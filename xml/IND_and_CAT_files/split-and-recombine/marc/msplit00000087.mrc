Most of the known small-molecule inhibitors that have shown potent antitumor activity target the Hsp90 N-terminal domain and directly inhibit its ATP-ase activity. Many of these molecules display important secondary effects. A different approach to Hsp90 inhibition consists of targeting the protein C-terminal domain (CTD) and modulating its chaperone activity through allosteric effects. Using an original computational approach, allosteric hot-spots in the CTD have been recently identified that control interdomain communication. A combination of virtual and experimental screening enabled identification of a rhamnosylated benzofuran (Eupomatenoid-2) as a lead for further development. In this paper we describe glycodiversification of Eupomatenoid-2 using chemical glycosylation of the 2-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)benzofuran aglycon (a.k.a. Eupomatenoid-6). Glycosylation of the phenol by glycosyl bromides under basic conditions afforded the desired products in the gluco-, galacto-, and fuco-series. This approach failed in the manno- and rhamno-series. However, mannosylation and rhamnosylation of Eupomatenoid-6 could be obtained under carefully controlled acidic conditions, using O-benzoxazolyl imidate (OBox) donors. The glycosides obtained are currently under investigation as modulators of Hsp90 chaperone activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aantineoplastic activity 3abromides 3aenzyme inhibition 3aglycosides 3aheat-shock protein 90 3amannosylation 3aneoplasms 3aorganobromine compounds 3aphenol 3ascreening 3atherapeutics 0aEupomatenoid 0aPhenol glycosylation 0aHsp90 0aO-Benzoxazolyl imidate (OBox) 0aGlycodiversification 0aPhase Transfer Catalysis1 aBernardi, Anna1 aSattin, Sara0 tCarbohydrate research.g2014 May 22, v. 390 p.33-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2014.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014200155300002000297520153800317592002801855650001201883650001201895650001101907650002001918650002801938650002401966650001401990650001802004650001602022650001102038650003302049650001302082650001602095650003702111650000902148700001602157700001802173700001802191700001502209773012502224856007402349852000902423655001202432IND60641301720221121221936.0190505e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064130172DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21990j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yanyan10aNon-stoichiometric Co(ii), Ni(ii), Zn(ii)-ferrite nanospheres: size controllable synthesis, excellent gas-sensing and magnetic properties  ap. 98994-99002.  aThree kinds of non-stoichiometric ferrite nanospheres (including Co(ii), Ni(ii), Zn(ii)-ferrite) with uniform and tunable size have been successfully synthesized by a simple one-step solvothermal reaction using a mixture of ethylene glycol (EG) and H₂O as the solvent without the addition of any surfactants or templates. Based on SEM and TEM characterization, all three kinds of products were determined to be single crystalline nanospheres built from numerous primary nanoparticles. The size of the different ferrite nanospheres prepared with same conditions differs slightly. For the same ferrite, the size of the nanospheres can be adjusted in a certain range by changing volume ratio of ethylene glycol and H₂O in the solvent. Three nanosphere samples were selected to investigate the gas sensing performance and magnetic properties. As gas sensing materials, all the three types of ferrites exhibited n-type gas-sensing behavior on the exposure to reducing gas atmospheres and the Co(ii)-ferrite nanospheres exhibited high gas sensitivity and stability toward n-butanol. Magnetic measurements revealed that the Co(ii)-ferrite and Ni(ii)-ferrite nanospheres exhibited ferromagnetic property while the Zn(ii)-ferrite nanospheres showed superparamagnetic behavior. The values of saturation magnetization (Mₛ) of the three samples follow the sequence of Zn(ii)-ferrite (S3) > Co(ii)-ferrite (S1) > Ni(ii)-ferrite (S2) due to the difference of the magnetic moment of M(ii) cations and their distribution in the spinel lattice.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutanol 3acations 3acobalt 3aethylene glycol 3aferrimagnetic materials 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3anickel 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc1 aSun, Dandan1 aHao, Hongying1 aGao, Dongzhao1 aSun, Yaqiu0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 18, v. 6, no. 101 p.98994-99002dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21990j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245005400159300001800213520098200231592002801213650001501241650001201256650002001268650001301288650001601301650001301317700002501330700002001355700001901375773013101394856007501525852000901600655001201609IND60541305820221117073352.0160821e20150128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054130582DNAL7 a10.1021/ja510973h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSattler, Wesley10aBespoke Photoreductants: Tungsten Arylisocyanides  ap. 1198-1205.  aModular syntheses of oligoarylisocyanide ligands that are derivatives of 2,6-diisopropylphenyl isocyanide (CNdipp) have been developed; tungsten complexes incorporating these oligoarylisocyanide ligands exhibit intense metal-to-ligand charge-transfer visible absorptions that are red-shifted and more intense than those of the parent W(CNdipp)₆ complex. Additionally, these W(CNAr)₆ complexes have enhanced excited-state properties, including longer lifetimes and very high quantum yields. The decay kinetics of electronically excited W(CNAr)₆ complexes (*W(CNAr)₆) show solvent dependences; faster decay is observed in higher dielectric solvents. *W(CNAr)₆ lifetimes are temperature dependent, suggestive of a strong coupling nonradiative decay mechanism that promotes repopulation of the ground state. Notably, *W(CNAr)₆ complexes are exceptionally strong reductants: [W(CNAr)₆]⁺/*W(CNAr)₆ potentials are more negative than −2.7 V vs [Cp₂Fe]⁺/Cp₂Fe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aligands 3areducing agents 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atungsten1 aHenling, Lawrence

PM applications are limited because of typical high concentrations of aflatoxin. For the first time, pilot-scale extraction of protein and sequestration of aflatoxin from PM were evaluated. Aqueous PM dispersions were mixed with two commercial bentonite clays and Alcalase in a jacketed mixer, hydrolysed for 1 h, heated to inactivate protease, and solids and liquids were separated using a decanter. Liquid hydrolysates derived from this process had >90% reduction in aflatoxin when clay was present. ACE-inhibitory activities of these hydrolysates suggest a potential benefit for blood pressure regulation. The insoluble fractions from the dispersions were dried and used in a separate turkey poult feeding study. These results indicate that scale-up of this novel process is feasible and offers a means for adding value to this underutilized protein source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxins 3abentonite 3abioactive properties 3ablood pressure 3aclay 3adispersions 3ahydrolysates 3apeanut meal 3apeanut oil 3apeptides 3apoults 3asubtilisin 3aturkeys 0aACE 0aAflatoxin 0aBioactive peptides 0aPeanut meal 0aValue-added1 aOakes, Aaron J.1 aShi, Xiaolei1 aPrice, Kristin M.1 aLamb, Marshall C.1 aSobolev, Victor S.1 aSanders, Timothy H.1 aDavis, Jack P.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 May, v. 51, no. 2 p.492-499dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245010000130300001200230520128400242592002801526650003601554650002101590650001501611650001001626650001601636650002401652650001201676700001701688773016001705852000901865655001201874IND60721259920221121233019.0201224e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072125992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Punam10aStudies on the prevalence and pathology of reproductive disorders in sow in and around Guwahati  ap. 215.  aA study on the prevalence and pathology of reproductive disorders in sow in and around Guwahati was conducted from August, 2011 to February, 2013 on three organised and three unorganised farms in and around Guwahati. In this investigation, the prevalence of reproductive disorders data for three years i.e., from January 2010 to December 2012 were taken. The prevalence of reproductive disorders of sows in respect of organized and unorganized farms was recorded in terms of stillborn piglets, mummified foetuses, repeat breeding and abortion. This investigation showed the prevalence of repeat breeding (30.51%), stillborn piglets (27.26%), abortion (0.64%) and mummified foetuses (0.59%) in organized farms. However, in unorganized farms the prevalence of repeat breeding was (30.98%), stillborn piglets (24.08%), abortion (5.6%) and mummified foetuses (2.3%) were recorded. The seroepidemiological study of certain microbial organisms which were associated with the reproductive disorders in three organised and three unorganised farms were conducted. The prevalence of Porcine Circo virus (55.26%) and Brucella suis (28.94%) were recorded as highest in three unorganised farms. Whereas Classical Swine Fever antibody was found highest (91.56%) in vaccinated group of animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Suis 3aanimal pathology 3aantibodies 3afetus 3ahog cholera 3aserological surveys 3aviruses1 aTamuli, S.M.0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2014 Sept. 1, v. 38, no. 3 p.215-215dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011000167500002200277520135600299592002801655650002201683650003201705650002101737650002901758650001601787650002301803650001401826650002001840650001601860650001001876650002401886650001301910650001101923650001201934650001901946650001401965650002101979650002102000650001802021650001802039650002902057650001102086653000902097653000802106653001002114653001102124653000802135653001002143653000802153653001002161653000902171653000802180653000702188653002402195653001002219653003002229653002402259653000902283700002502292700002302317700002402340700001902364700002302383700002302406773007302429856008102502852000902583655001202592IND60558370020221121205106.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055837002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Alfonso, Anna10aMolecular Mechanism of DNA Topoisomerase I-Dependent rDNA Silencing: Sir2p Recruitment at Ribosomal Genes  aPre-press version  aSaccharomyces cerevisiae sir2Δ or top1Δ mutants exhibit similar phenotypes involving ribosomal DNA, including (i) loss of transcriptional silencing, resulting in non-coding RNA hyperproduction from cryptic RNA polymerase II promoters; (ii) alterations in recombination; and (iii) a general increase in histone acetylation. Given the distinct enzymatic activities of Sir2 and Top1 proteins, a histone deacetylase and a DNA topoisomerase, respectively, we investigated whether genetic and/or physical interactions between the two proteins could explain the shared ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) phenotypes. We employed an approach of complementing top1Δ cells with yeast, human, truncated, and chimeric yeast/human TOP1 constructs and of assessing the extent of non-coding RNA silencing and histone H4K16 deacetylation. Our findings demonstrate that residues 115–125 within the yeast Top1p N-terminal domain are required for the complementation of the top1∆ rDNA phenotypes. In chromatin immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we further demonstrate the physical interaction between Top1p and Sir2p. Our genetic and biochemical studies support a model whereby Top1p recruits Sir2p to the rDNA and clarifies a structural role of DNA topoisomerase I in the epigenetic regulation of rDNA, independent of its known catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA topoisomerase 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA interference 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetylation 3acatalytic activity 3achromatin 3aenzyme activity 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahistones 3amodels 3amutants 3anon-coding RNA 3aphenotype 3aprecipitin tests 3apromoter regions 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts 0arDNA 0aIGS 0ancRNA 0aPol II 0aRFB 0aH4K16 0aSIR 0aTop1p 0aChIP 0aCPT 0aIP 0aDNA topoisomerase I 0aSir2p 0atranscriptional silencing 0ahistone acetylation 0arDNA1 aDi Felice, Francesca1 aCarlini, Valentina1 aWright, Christine M1 aHertz, Marla I1 aBjornsti, Mary-Ann1 aCamilloni, Giorgio0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245018200160300001400342520075100356592002801107650001601135650002601151650001401177650003001191650002301221650003101244650001601275650002101291650002001312650001801332650001701350650001001367700001601377700001501393773012601408856007401534852000901608655001201617IND60765101720221119162915.0220422e20111111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510172DNAL7 a10.17221/3824-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽďárková, E.10aCompatibility of Cheyletus eruditus (Schrank) (Acari: Cheyletidae) and Ce&shy;phalonomia tarsalis (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) in biological control of stored grain pests  ap. 29-34.  aA laboratory experiment was carried out on stored wheat infested by the stored product mite Acarus siro and beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis.

Synchronous application of both natural enemies resulted in better control of O. surinamensis through an enhanced effect of both antagonists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcarus siro 3aCephalonomia tarsalis 3aCheyletus 3aOryzaephilus surinamensis 3abiological control 3alaboratory experimentation 3aparasitoids 3aplant protection 3apredatory mites 3astorage mites 3astored grain 3awheat1 aLukáš, J.1 aHorák, P.0 tPlant Protection Science.g, v. 39, no. 1 p.29-34dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21418x1212-25807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3824-pps3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245007400164300002000238520090200258592002801160650001101188650002901199650001101228650001501239650001301254650001701267653003901284653002101323653002301344653002001367653002301387700001701410700005901427700005801486773014201544856007801686852000901764655001201773IND60614667820221120182214.0181002e20180831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061466782DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b095462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min-sŏng,10aCovalent Organic Nanosheets as Effective Sodium-Ion Storage Materials  ap. 32102-32111.  aHerein, we study the structure-dependent energy storage performance of network polymers (covalent organic nanosheets, CONs) prepared by Stille cross-coupling under conventional reflux and solvothermal conditions, showing that the specific surface area and self-assembled morphology of CONs could be effectively controlled by a careful choice of the synthetic route and monomer combination.

The N-CDs exhibit an excitation-independent blue emission and an optimal quantum yield of 24.2%. Under strongly alkaline conditions adjusted by various alkaline solutions, the N-CDs exhibit robust fluorescence performance, even at an extreme pH value of 13. Although the fluorescence is quenched in strongly acidic solutions (pH = 1), the N-CDs exhibit reversible and repeatable ‘off–on’ fluorescence on modulating the pH value between 1 and 13, resulting from the protonation and deprotonation of the fluorescence-related surface states. Moreover, the N-CDs maintain a bright and stable emission in simulated body fluid (SBF). Thus, the N-CDs have promising applications for dynamic detection of pH switching caused by strongly acidic and strongly alkaline conditions and fluorescence bio-imaging of living organisms even under extreme pH conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium hydroxide 3abody fluids 3acarbon quantum dots 3acitric acid 3adeprotonation 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3apH 3aprotonation1 aZhou, Liang1 aLi, Yanan1 aDeng, Ruiping1 aZhang, Hongjie0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 14, v. 6, no. 110 p.108203-108208dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21994b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007200166300001800238520136400256592002801620650001301648650001601661650001101677650001301688650001601701650001101717650001701728650002101745700001501766700001801781700001701799773010401816856008101920852000902001655001202010IND60119641420221122111354.0141219e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011964142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-014-0812-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoozbahani, R.12aA Multi-objective Approach for Transboundary River Water Allocation  ap. 5447-5463.  aThe allocation of water to the stakeholders of a large basin involves conflicting objectives, since increasing the allocated water to one stakeholder leads to a reduction in water allocated to other stakeholders. The consideration of conflicting objectives is inevitable when the basin is a transboundary basin, where a river crosses at least one political border, either a border within a nation or an international boundary. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model for sharing water among stakeholders of a transboundary river, assuming that the stakeholders cooperate. Here, the cooperation implies a balanced water allocation to stakeholders since shortage in each stakeholder have negative impacts on others. Each objective function of the multi-objective model represents the water profit of a stakeholder; which has to be maximized. To reach a cooperative solution, a new method for transforming the multi-objective formulation to a three-step single objective formulation is proposed. The solution guarantees each stakeholder's profit which is larger than a percentage of its highest possible profit obtained in the case when the percentage of profit is equal for all stakeholders. The proposed model formulation was applied to the Sefidrud River where eight provinces are the stakeholders competing for water resources of this basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrossing 3amethodology 3amodels 3apolitics 3ariver water 3arivers 3astakeholders 3awater allocation1 aAbbasi, B.1 aSchreider, S.1 aArdakani, A.0 tWater resources management.g2014 Dec., v. 28, no. 15 p.5447-5463dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-014-0812-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100002800191245009200219506007600311506003100387520099800418592002801416596004501444506003701489650000901526650002201535650002001557650001401577650002101591650001201612650001601624650001701640650003201657651001101689653001301700653002901713653002201742653001701764653002301781700002801804773010101832856008501933852000902018655001202027IND60723907620221207073015.0210619e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072390762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.1009052chorus7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.1009052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoser, Gabrielle Elaine10aFinding exceedance locations in a large spatial database using nonparametric regression  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIn the era of big data analysis, it is of interest to develop diagnostic tools for preliminary scanning of large spatial databases. One problem is identification of locations where certain characteristics exceed a given norm, e.g. timber volume or mean tree diameter exceeding a user-defined threshold. Some of the challenges are, large size of the database, randomness, complex shape of the spatial mean surface, heterogeneity and others. In a step-by-step procedure, we propose a method for achieving this for large spatial data sets. For illustration, we work through a simulated spatial data set as well as a forest inventory data set from Alaska (source: USDA Forest Services). Working within the framework of nonparametric regression modeling, the proposed method can attain a high degree of flexibility regarding the shape of the spatial mean surface. Taking advantage of the large sample size, we also provide asymptotic formulas that are easy to implement in any statistical software.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUSDA 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3asample size 3aspatial data 3atree and stand measurements 3aAlaska 0aBig data 0aEnvironmental monitoring 0aKernel regression 0aSpatial data 0aSurface estimation1 aGhosh, S.q(Sucharita),0 tEcological complexity.g2021 Jan., v. 45 p.100905-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2020.1009053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009600171300001400267520086800281592002801149650001301177650004301190650001901233650001201252650001301264650001701277650001601294650001801310653001701328653001001345653000901355773010601364856008401470852000901554655001201563IND60598945420221120092556.0180702e20140604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059894542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2014.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPazourek, Jiří10aFast separation and determination of free myo-inositol by hydrophilic liquid chromatography  ap. 55-60.  aA fast liquid chromatography method for separation and determination of myo-inositol is reported. Determination of the biologically important isomer of inositols, myo-inositol, was optimized to avoid overlapping to possible interferents according to European Pharmacopoeia (glycerol, d-mannitol) and saccharose. The method in HILIC mode is extremely selective to other carbohydrates which allows to separate myo-inositol from allo- and d-chiro-inositol with resolution 12.3 and 5.2, resp. and this way it enables to separate myo-inostiol from contingent carbohydrates present in a sample matrix. Retention time of myo-inositol was 12min at 10°C, though higher temperatures (25°C or 40°C) or higher water content in the mobile phase could speed up the separation and determination to four minutes.

It is affected by many natural and human factors through heterogeneous relationships. Accurate prediction at unobserved locations using a limited number of observations hence remains a challenge. This study proposes a two-point machine learning method to fully utilize the information in spatial neighbors and high-dimensional covariates to improve prediction accuracy. It models the difference between pairs of points, predicts concentration differences between observation points and unobserved points, and uses those for neighbor selection. This supervised learning method integrates both spatial autocorrelation and property similarity. Method performance, illustrated in a case study of soil Pb, confirms that our method can greatly improve prediction accuracy for different sample sizes. The improvements vary with the sample size and have a decreasing trend as the sample size increases. Compared with ordinary kriging, kriging with external drift, random forest, and random forest-based regression kriging, the average improvements on RMSE are 1.49, 0.95, 0.93 and 0.62 respectively, and on MAE are 1.29, 1.17, 0.87 and 0.65 respectively. In the future, the method may be applied to the spatial prediction of other variables of the earth system, while the supervised learning method can be adjusted to new applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEarth system science 3aautocorrelation 3acase studies 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3akriging 3aprediction 3asample size 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3aspatial data 0aTwo point machine learning 0aSpatial prediction 0aSpatial heterogeneity 0aSoil heavy metal1 aStein, Alfred1 aWang, Jinfeng0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Apr., v. 108 p.102742-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009300171300001800264520107200282592002801354650001701382650002201399650002201421650002501443650001301468650001201481650001601493650001701509650001201526650001601538650002001554650001901574650001701593700002201610700002301632700002201655773012701677856008401804852000901888655001201897IND60099639620221119142544.0141105e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009963962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2012.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenkin, Kayte A.10aEndocannabinoids and the renal proximal tubule: An emerging role in diabetic nephropathy  ap. 2028-2031.  aDiabetic nephropathy is a leading cause for the development of end-stage renal disease. In diabetes mellitus, a number of structural changes occur within the kidney which leads to a decline in renal function. Damage to the renal proximal tubule cells (PTCs) in diabetic nephropathy includes thickening of the basement membrane, tubular fibrosis, tubular lesions and hypertrophy. A clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of diabetic kidney disease is essential for the understanding of the role cellular pathways play in its pathophysiology. The endocannabinoid system is an endogenous lipid signalling system which is involved in lipogenesis, adipogenesis, inflammation and glucose metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that in diabetic nephropathy, there is altered expression of the endocannabinoid system. Future investigations should clarify the role of the endocannabinoid system in the development of diabetic nephropathy and within this system, identify potential therapeutics to reduce the burden of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3abasement membrane 3aburden of disease 3adiabetic nephropathy 3afibrosis 3aglucose 3ahypertrophy 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3alipogenesis 3apathophysiology 3arenal function 3atherapeutics1 aVerty, Aaron N.A.1 aMcAinch, Andrew J.1 aHryciw, Deanne H.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2012 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.2028-2031dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014300173300001800316520159800334592002801932650001501960650001401975650001601989650001102005650001102016650002502027650001502052651000902067651000902076700001902085773010402104856008102208852000902289655001202298IND60119641620221122111345.0141219e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011964162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-014-0816-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Faraj, Furat A.

Daily unregulated flow records during the hydrologic years between 1955 and 1982 were considered at the upstream flow gauging station and daily unimpaired flow time series during the water years between 1931 and 1961 were examined at the most downstream hydrometric station. Two digital filtering algorithms and the flow duration curve method were applied to extract the base flow time series and compute its signature to total river flow. A generic methodology, which incorporates the flow duration curve method within digital filtering algorithms, has been introduced to obtain the filter parameter α in the filtering algorithms, and obtain the base flow contribution with a high level of confidence. Findings revealed that the base flow proportion is 38 % for the upper sub-basin and 31 % for the upper and middle combined sub-basins. The computed base flow signatures using the incorporated approach have very strong correlation coefficients of around 0.985. The driest year had the highest annual base flow index. The base flow index values started to increase in April and climbed to a peak by the end of May. A gradual decline between August and September was observed. The proposed methodology should be applied to unregulated watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abase flow 3acorrelation 3arivers 3arunoff 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aIran 3aIraq1 aScholz, Miklas0 tWater resources management.g2014 Dec., v. 28, no. 15 p.5477-5489dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-014-0816-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245014300173520195600316592002802272650002902300650000802329650001902337650001602356650001002372650001702382650001102399650000902410650001402419650001502433653002102448653001502469653001602484653001402500653002502514700001802539700001902557700001902576773011902595856008802714852000902802655001202811IND60733322620221121074632.0220110e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073332262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1468482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGyawali, Pradip10aApplication of crAssphage, F-RNA phage and pepper mild mottle virus as indicators of human faecal and norovirus contamination in shellfish  aShellfish growing waters contaminated with inadequately treated human wastewater is a major source of norovirus in shellfish and poses a significant human health risk to consumers. Microbial source tracking (MST) markers have been widely used to identify the source (s) of faecal contamination in water but data are limited on their use for shellfish safety. This study evaluated the source specificity, sensitivity, occurrence and concentration of three viral MST markers i.e. cross-assembly phage (crAssphage), F-specific RNA bacteriophage genogroup II (F-RNA phage GII) and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) using animal faeces (n = 119; 16 animal groups), influent wastewater (n = 12), effluent wastewater (n = 16) and shellfish (n = 33). CrAssphage, F-RNA phage GII and PMMoV had source specific values of 0.97, 0.99 and 0.91, respectively. The sensitivity of MST markers was confirmed by their 100% detection frequency in influent wastewaters. The frequency of detection in effluent wastewater ranged from 81.3% (F-RNA phage GII) to 100% (PMMoV). Concentration of F-RNA phage GII was one log₁₀ (influent wastewater) and 2–3 log₁₀ (effluent wastewater) lower than crAssphage and PMMoV, respectively. Despite lower prevalence of F-RNA phage GII in oysters and mussels compared to crAssphage and PMMoV, concentrations of the three MST markers were similar in mussels. As an indicator of norovirus contamination in shellfish, crAssphage and PMMoV had greater predictive sensitivity (100%; [95% CI; 81.5%–100%)]) and F-RNA phage GII had greater predictive specificity (93.3%; [95% CI; 68.1%–99.8%]). In contrast, crAssphage and F-RNA phage GII have similar accuracy for predicting norovirus in shellfish, however, PMMoV significantly overestimated its presence. Therefore, a combination of crAssphage and F-RNA phage GII analysis of shellfish could provide a robust estimation of the presence of human faecal and norovirus contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPepper mild mottle virus 3aRNA 3abacteriophages 3aenvironment 3afeces 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3arisk 3ashellfish 3awastewater 0aShellfish safety 0aCrAssphage 0aMST markers 0aNorovirus 0aFaecal contamination1 aDevane, Megan1 aScholes, Paula1 aHewitt, Joanne0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 783 p.146848-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1468483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012500155300001800280500001700298520067800315592002800993650001401021650001201035650001101047650002801058650001001086650002701096650001401123650002601137650002401163700002301187700006001210700005701270773014201327856007501469852000901544655001201553IND60760463420221121130029.0211222e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076046342DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.162622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYau, Katie10aRetrospective study on the use of lidocaine constant rate infusions for the treatment of ileus in ruminants and camelids  ap. 2933-2936.  aCase Reports  aLimited knowledge exists regarding the use of lidocaine as a prokinetic in ruminants and camelids to treat gastrointestinal ileus.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of PO and SC routes of ¹²³I administration on paired % thyroidal RAIU in euthyroid cats. Specifically, a 1.5‐fold difference (50% relative change) was hypothesized, which in absolute terms can be expressed as a 3.25% increase in the mean %RAIU of 7.04% after PO ¹²³I administration to 10.56% after SC dosing. ANIMALS: Seven healthy euthyroid teaching‐research colony cats. METHODS: A randomized, radiologist‐blinded crossover study comparing %RAIU after PO and SC ¹²³I administration. RESULTS: Percentage thyroidal RAIU values (mean ± SD; 95% confidence interval) after PO (4.81% ± 1.63%; 3.30%‐6.23%) and SC (5.26% ± 2.43%; 3.01%‐7.51%) ¹²³I administration were associated with a median within‐pair absolute difference of 0.2% (range: min, 0.1%‐max, 4.9%). Statistical significance was not achieved (P = .45). Six of 7 cats had a within‐pair absolute difference of 0.1% to 0.9% (relative change of 4%‐20%), but a single outlier cat had a within‐pair absolute difference of 4.9% (relative change of 108%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study did not detect an effect of ¹²³I administration route on paired % thyroidal RAIU in euthyroid cats. However, a type 2 statistical error due to small sample size is possible.  aPublisher supplied data  a419603cUniversity of Saskatchewan WCVM FR & R Fund 3aconfidence interval 3across-over studies 3ahyperthyroidism 3aiodine 3asample size 3aveterinary medicine1 aSnead, Elisabeth1 aHutcheson, Matt1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1531-33281 aSukut, Sally0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2021 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.2646-2651dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.162613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007900156300001800235520085600253592002801109650002301137650002001160650001901180650001601199700001601215700001701231700001801248773012601266856007401392852000901466655001201475IND60672338720221122213552.0191016e20191014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067233872DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc02415h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Zhimin10aUpgrading of levulinic acid into diverse N-containing functional chemicals  ap. 5449-5468.  aLevulinic acid (LA), one of the top 10 most promising biomass-derived platform molecules, is a versatile compound, and can be transformed into diverse value-added chemicals.

The accumulation of microplastics in freshwater and marine environments has strong ecological implications due to their long persistence, potential toxicity, and ability to adsorb other pollutants, acting as vectors of pathogens. Nevertheless, while the number of studies on the presence of microplastics in the wild fish increased, less attention has been paid to the farmed fish species. Here, we investigated the occurrence of microparticles in the digestive tracts of Sparus aurata and Cyprinus carpio at different life stages and reared by an intensive and semi-intensive production system, respectively. Our results showed the presence of natural microfibers and microplastics, with microfibers (~ 90%) being the dominant type. In both fish species, the presence of microparticles was not revealed at larval stage. Fry and adult S. aurata specimens showed microfiber abundances of 0.21 and 1.3 items/individual, respectively. A lower load of microparticles (p < 0.05) occurred in fry (0.06 items/individual) and adult C. carpio specimens (0.25 items/individual). As to the chemical composition of the micro-items, natural (20%), semi-synthetic (28%), and single or blended synthetic fibers (52%) were identified in S. aurata. Linen, rayon, lyocell, cotton: polyester and polyester (12.5% concentration for each polymer) fibers were identified in C. carpio, while PTFE (37.5%) was present as fragments. Rayon was the most frequent chemical type (21.2%). The polymer composition of the extracted microparticles showed significant differences between the fish species analysed (p < 0.05). Notably, a considerably lower contamination level of synthetic polymers (average 0.11 items/individual) was detected in the farmed fishes compared with the data obtained in other studies on feral ones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the plastic and the non-plastic microfiber contamination in the farmed S. aurata and C. carpio at different life stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aSparus aurata 3aadults 3achemical composition 3acotton 3afarmed fish 3afreshwater 3aingestion 3alarvae 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3apolyesters 3arayon 3atoxicity 3awild fish 0aMicroplastics 0aMicrofibers 0aSparus aurata 0aCyprinus carpio 0aAquaculture1 aMatanović, K.1 aD'Angelo, G.1 aVetri, V.1 aAnselmo, S.1 aBottari, T.1 aMancuso, M.1 aKužir, S.1 aSpanò, N.1 aCapillo, G.1 aDi Paola, D.1 aValić, D.1 aGjurčević, E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 782 p.146851-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1468513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156300002000271520097600291592002801267650001301295650002401308650002301332650002101355650001201376650002201388650001301410650001301423650001101436700001401447773012501461856007401586852000901660655001201669IND60641302520221122035458.0190505e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064130252DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra22008h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Kaifeng10aFacile fabrication of sulfur entrapped carbonized material as a cathode for high-performance lithium batteries  ap. 87690-87695.  aHere, we reported the synthesis of a sulfur-carbonized PAN composite material (SPC) for Li–S batteries by the direct reaction of PAN with sulfur in DMSO solvent and followed by calcination at 500 °C under an N₂ environment. The study demonstrated that the SPC was possessed of both chemical stability and excellent electrochemical performance. These properties can be attributed to the homogeneous liquid phase reaction system since it facilitated the uniform distribution of sulfur in the final carbonized PAN. As a result, the resulting SPC electrode exhibited a high reversible discharge capacity of about 807 mA h gcₒₘₚₒₛᵢₜₑ⁻¹ or 1647 mA h gₛᵤₗfᵤᵣ⁻¹ at 0.5C after 5 cycles, which corresponded to 98.3% sulfur utilization.

The formation of these symbiosomes requires a complex and coordinated interaction between the two partners during all stages of nodule development as any failure in the differentiation of either symbiotic partner, the bacterium or the plant cell prevents the subsequent transcriptional and developmental steps resulting in early senescence of the nodules. Certain legume hosts impose irreversible terminal differentiation onto bacteria. In the inverted repeat–lacking clade (IRLC) of legumes, host dominance is achieved by nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides that resemble defensin-like antimicrobial peptides, the known effector molecules of animal and plant innate immunity. This article provides an overview on the bacteroid and symbiosome development including the terminal differentiation of bacteria in IRLC legumes as well as the bacterial and plant genes and proteins participating in these processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3ainnate immunity 3aevolution 3ahosts 3atranscription (genetics) 3aantimicrobial peptides 3agenes 3acytoplasm 3alegumes 3abacteria 2aBacteriaxgrowth & development 2aBiological Evolution 2aFabaceaexgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aSymbiosis 0asenescence1 aMergaert, Peter1 aKondorosi, Eva0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Nov., v. 24, no. 11 p.1300-1309dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-06-11-01523Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02207naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011500159300001600274520122300290592002801513650001701541650001401558650001201572650001101584650002101595650001301616650001201629651001201641700001701653773012801670856007401798852000901872655001201881IND60765102520221119163401.0220419e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510252DNAL7 a10.17221/3832-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOparaocha, E.T.10aThrips (Thysanoptera) of vegetable crops (okro, spinach, garden egg and pumpkin) grown in Southeastern Nigeria  ap. 132-138.  aEight vegetable crops were sampled at five localities in Southeastern Nigeria and were found to harbour one or more species of thrips. The crops were&nbsp;Amaranthus hybridus,&nbsp;A. spinosus,&nbsp;Basella rubra,&nbsp;Solanum incanum,&nbsp;S. melongena,&nbsp;Hibiscus esculentus,&nbsp;Telfairia occidentalis&nbsp;and a species of&nbsp;Solanum. The sampled localities, with the frequency of occurrence of thrips, were Umuahia (29.6%), Owerri (28.5%), Port Harcourt (25.7%), Calabar (18.7%) and Enugu (6.0%). The studies revealed that crops with very heavy infloresences, e.g.&nbsp;Amaranthus hybridus, had a higher number of thrips (40%) per flower/leaf, while simple flowered crops like&nbsp;Telfairia occidentalis&nbsp;could only harbour a far lower number of thrips per flower/leaf. This showed a preference of these thrips for plants with heavy inflorescences which provided them with more protection, especially their larvae. Taxonomic/microscopic studies identified three species of thrips:&nbsp;Haplothrips gowdeyi&nbsp;that attacked 63% of all the sampled crops,&nbsp;Frankliniella schultzei&nbsp;was hosted by 50% of the crops, and&nbsp;Megalurothrips ventralis also preyed on 50% of the plant samples. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aThysanoptera 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aleaves 3aplant protection 3apumpkins 3aspinach 3aNigeria1 aOkigbo, R.N.0 tPlant Protection Science.g, v. 39, no. 4 p.132-138dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21418x1212-25807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3832-pps3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245015100202300002000353500001900373520130500392592002801697650002201725650002301747650004901770650002601819650002201845650000701867650001301874650001501887700005901902700005101961700001302012700005302025700001802078700005402096700005702150773014202207856007902349852000902428655001202437IND60715776920221117231407.0201103e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071577692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c044102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Hui-Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1883-378610aFirst Direct and Unequivocal Electron Spin Resonance Spin-Trapping Evidence for pH-Dependent Production of Hydroxyl Radicals from Sulfate Radicals  ap. 14046-14056.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecently, the sulfate radical (SO₄•–) has been found to exhibit broad application prospects in various research fields such as chemical, biomedical, and environmental sciences. It has been suggested that SO₄•– could be transformed into a more reactive hydroxyl radical (•OH); however, no direct and unequivocal experimental evidence has been reported yet. In this study, using an electron spin resonance (ESR) secondary radical spin-trapping method coupled with the classic spin-trapping agent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) and the typical •OH-scavenging agent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), we found that •OH can be produced from three SO₄•–-generating systems from weakly acidic (pH = 5.5) to alkaline conditions (optimal at pH = 13.0), while SO₄•– is the predominant radical species at pH < 5.5. A comparative study with three typical •OH-generating systems strongly supports the above conclusion. This is the first direct and unequivocal ESR spin-trapping evidence for •OH formation from SO₄•– over a wide pH range, which is of great significance to understand and study the mechanism of many SO₄•–-related reactions and processes. This study also provides an effective and direct method for unequivocally distinguishing •OH from SO₄•–.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenvironmental science 3ahydroxyl radicals 3apH 3asulfates 3atechnology1 aHuang, Chun-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7158-21491 aMao, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1597-53161 aShao, Bo1 aShao, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9212-96851 aYan, Zhu-Ying1 aTang, Miao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8460-66721 aZhu, Ben-Zhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5484-42900 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 54, no. 21 p.14046-14056dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c044103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012100163300001800284520091500302592002801217650000801245650001901253650001701272650002301289650001401312700002201326700002101348700002301369700001901392700002901411773013501440856007401575852000901649655001201658IND60639722420221122010445.0190502e20171211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063972242DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cs00680b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoynton, Fergus E.14aThe development of ruthenium(ii) polypyridyl complexes and conjugates for in vitro cellular and in vivo applications  ap. 7706-7756.  aRuthenium(ii) [Ru(ii)] polypyridyl complexes have been the focus of intense investigations since work began exploring their supramolecular interactions with DNA.

In only 10 years the field has expanded with diverse applications for these complexes as imaging agents and promising candidates for therapeutics. In light of these efforts this review exclusively focuses on the developments of these complexes in biological systems, both in cells and in vivo, and hopes to communicate to readers the diversity of applications within which these complexes have found use, as well as new insights gained along the way and challenges that researchers in this field still face.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aimage analysis 3aluminescence 3aprecision medicine 3aruthenium1 aBright, Sandra A.1 aBlasco, Salvador1 aWilliams, D.

In this paper, a new NASICON-type material Li₃Cr(MoO₄) ₃ has been studied for the first time as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries with high specific capacity. Comprehensive studies by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis-IR diffuse reflection, bond valence sum maps calculation, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the Four-Probe method show that Li₃Cr(MoO₄)₃ possesses a narrow band gap, high electronic conductivity and fast lithium ion transport channels, and delivers a high specific capacity (200 mA h g⁻¹) and rate performance.

Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs) with different superficial moieties (passivate-CQDs with carboxylic groups, thiol-CQDs and amine-CQDs) were used to prepare hybrid gels using a low molecular weight hydrogelator (LMWG). The use of the gels results in considerable fluorescence enhancement and also markedly influences selectivity. The most selective CQDG system for Ag⁺ ion detection proved to be those containing carboxylic groups onto their surface. The selectivity towards Ag⁺ ions is possibly due to its flexible coordination sphere compared with other metal ions. This fluorescent sensing platform is based on the strong Ag–O interaction which can quench the photoluminescence of passivate-CQDs (p-CQDs) through charge transfer. The limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the proposed method were 0.55 and 1.83µgmL⁻¹, respectively, being applied in river water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon quantum dots 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahydrogels 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3aphotoluminescence 3ariver water 3asilver 0aCQDs 0aCNDs 0aSQDs 0aCQDGs 0ap-CQDs 0at-CQDs 0aa-CQDs 0aLMWG 0aIL 0aBMIM-BF4 0aDIC 0aNHS 0aRSD 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aSEM 0aCarbon Quantum Dots 0aSilver 0aSensor 0aSupramolecular gel 0aUrea 0aFluorescence1 aSoriano, M.L.1 aKennedy, S.R.1 aSteed, J.W.1 aValcárcel, M.0 tTalanta.g2016 May 01, v. 151 p.100-105dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016000156300002000316520142000336592002801756650001101784650001401795650001101809650002101820650001401841650000901855650001201864650002201876650001801898650001101916700001801927700001701945700001401962700001601976700001801992773014102010856007402151852000902225655001202234IND60617248520221118052746.0181024e20181009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061724852DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta07790h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Yuelei10aHighly reversible Na ion storage in N-doped polyhedral carbon-coated transition-metal chalcogenides by optimizing the nanostructure and surface engineering  ap. 18967-18978.  aTransition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have been attracting widespread attention due to their high lithium/sodium storage capacity, wide availability, and enhanced safety. However, their practical applications are still suffering from high volume changes, poor electronic conductivity and low utilization of active materials, resulting in unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. In this study, a facile one-pot solvothermal method was developed to self-assemble and produce N-CoS₂@C composites. It was found from the experiments that the developed 3D polyhedral carbon-coated structure of N-CoS₂@C can effectively reduce the diffusion lengths of sodium ions and electrons. Carbon layer was also found firmly encapsulated the CoS₂, where it can greatly release mechanical stresses under high volume change and also improve the electronic conductivity of active materials. The developed 3D polyhedral carbon-coated structure results in outstanding rate performance (738 mA h g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹ reaching up to 86.2% theoretical capacity and 450 mA h g⁻¹ even at 10 A g⁻¹) and extraordinary cycle stability (559 mA h g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹ after 1000 cycles) when used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The research outcomes provide a novel design strategy for high-performance TMC electrodes and also a facile approach to fabricate promising anode materials for high-performance SIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3aions 3alithium 3amechanical stress 3ananomaterials 3asodium1 aCheng, Xudong1 aGong, Lunlun1 aShi, Long1 aDeng, Yurui1 aZhang, Heping0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Oct. 9, v. 6, no. 39 p.18967-18978dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta07790h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006800168300001600236520094600252592002801198650002201226650002401248650001501272650002401287650001201311650001101323650001901334650001101353650002001364653000801384653000801392653000901400653000701409653000801416653003001424653002601454653001201480653001301492653002501505700002301530700002001553773012201573856008201695852000901777655001201786IND60527907320221122131427.0190416e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052790732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRich, Joseph O.10aLaccase-mediator catalyzed conversion of model lignin compounds  ap. 111-115.  aLaccases play an important role in the biological break down of lignin and have great potential in the deconstruction of lignocellulosic feedstocks. We examined a variety of laccases, both commercially prepared and crude extracts, for their ability to oxidize three model lignol compounds (p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol). We identified both mediated and non-mediated laccase-catalyzed reactions that converted p-coumaryl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol to p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, respectively. Interestingly, the products produced by the concerted action of the laccase mediator system on lignol substrates are the same as those produced by chemical catalytic approaches. The enzymatic approach affords the opportunity for a biological approach to the conversion of lignin to valuable specialty chemicals that have use in a variety of industrial, consumer and pharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconiferyl alcohol 3aenzymatic treatment 3afeedstocks 3ahydroxybenzaldehyde 3alaccase 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3asinapyl alcohol 0aLMS 0apCA 0a4HBA 0aSA 0aDMQ 0a2,6-Dimethoxybenzoquinone 0ap-Hydroxybenzaldehyde 0aLaccase 0aMediator 0aLignin bioconversion1 aAnderson, Amber M.1 aBerhow, Mark A.0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2016 Jan., v. 5 p.111-115dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2016.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012400170300002000294520167500314592002801989650001502017650002302032650001802055650002102073650001602094650003302110650001902143650002702162650002402189650002202213650001802235650001602253700002002269700001902289700001702308700005802325773011602383856008402499852000902583655001202592IND60677896420221122050406.0191213e20190816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPak, Chin-t'ae,10aDevelopment of Poly(methyl methacrylate)-Based Copolymers with Improved Heat Resistance and Reduced Moisture Absorption  ap. 15880-15886.  aPoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is widely used as a transparent material for optical applications, owing to its high light transmittance. However, it exhibits poor heat resistance and high moisture absorption, leading to distortion and deformation upon exposure to elevated temperatures and/or moisture. These structural changes decrease the transparency of PMMA, critically limiting its applicability. In this study, we synthesized poly(methyl methacrylate-co-styrene-co-acrylamide) (PMSAm) as a reference polymer and introduced one of four different comonomers [N-phenylmaleimide (PMI), N-cyclohexylmaleimide (CHMI), allyltrimethylsilane (ATMS), or 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TF)] as a means to improve heat resistance and reduce moisture absorption. Four series of PMMA-based random copolymers (PMSAm–PMI, PMSAm–CHMI, PMSAm–ATMS, and PMSAm–TF) were synthesized by conventional thermal radical polymerization. All of the polymers synthesized exhibited improved heat resistance, with PMSAm–CHMI exhibiting the highest glass transition temperature (Tg = 122.54 °C) and 5% weight loss thermal decomposition temperature (T₅d = 343.40 °C) as well as the lowest thermal expansion coefficient (90.3 μm m–¹ °C–¹). The highest hydrophobicity was exhibited by PMSAm–TF, with a water contact angle of 78.9°, indicating higher hydrophobicity compared to that of pure PMMA (69.4°). More importantly, high transparency (∼90%) was exhibited by all of the synthesized polymers. Thus, our copolymerization strategy successfully addresses the limitations, i.e., low heat resistance and high moisture absorption, of conventional PMMA-based materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acomposite polymers 3acontact angle 3acopolymerization 3adeformation 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrophobicity 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3athermal degradation 3athermal expansion 3atransmittance 3aweight loss1 aBaek, Myung-Jin1 aChoi, Hyun Woo1 aKim, Hak-Sun1 aLee, Dong Woog1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1572-92700 tLangmuir.g2019 Aug. 16, v. 35, no. 48 p.15880-15886dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245005500170300002000225520121200245592002801457650001301485650002001498650001601518650001901534700001301553700002201566700001901588700001601607700002001623700002601643700006801669773011601737856008401853852000901937655001201946IND60677896520221122050243.0191213e20191013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Sierra G.10aDynamics of Synovial Fluid Aggregation under Shear  ap. 15887-15896.  aThe synovial fluid (SF) that lubricates articular joints exhibits complex rheological and tribological properties due to the interactions and behaviors of its various molecular components. Under shear, SF films abruptly thicken by more than 300% and large, dense aggregates form within the fluid. In this study, we used the Surface Force Apparatus to elucidate which SF components are involved in this shear-induced transformation by (i) determining which (if any) of all major SF components replicate the behavior of SF under shear and (ii) observing the effect of removing implicated components from SF by enzymatic digestion. While most previous studies of SF have focused on the tribological roles of lubricin or hyaluronic acid, our results indicate that albumin is a key contributor to the formation of aggregates in SF under shear. Our results also suggest that SF aggregation is associated with efficient surface protection against wear. As our findings are based on experiments involving rigid, nonporous surfaces, they may be used to investigate shear-mediated aggregation mechanisms occurring during the lubrication of artificial joints, ultimately advancing our current vision of implant design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3ahyaluronic acid 3alubrication 3asynovial fluid1 aGuan, Ya1 aPacifici, Noah J.1 aBrown, Cory N.1 aCzako, Evan1 aSamak, Mihir S.1 aBonassar, Lawrence J.1 aGourdon, D.q(Delphine),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8584-07860 tLangmuir.g2019 Oct. 13, v. 35, no. 48 p.15887-15896dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016800166300001600334500001900350520127400369592002801643650001601671650001601687650001401703650001001717650001601727650001201743650001401755650002001769650002701789650001301816650001001829650001301839653002001852653002001872653001301892653001401905700002001919700001901939700002401958700006201982700006102044773013902105856008302244852000902327655001202336IND60730627620221121064155.0210408e20210416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073062762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjan, Rajiv10aProphylactic administration of podophyllotoxin and rutin combination assists the revival of radiation-induced hematopoietic suppression in lethally irradiated mice  ap. 214-220.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHematopoietic syndrome contributes to mortality after exposure to high doses of low LET radiation. In this context, we have earlier demonstrated the potential of G-003 M (a combination of podophyllotoxin and rutin) in alleviating radiation-induced bone marrow suppression. Similarly, we here demonstrate that G-003 M protected mice from death (>83% protection) and increased the populations of CD 34 (Cluster of differentiation 34) as well as CD 117 (Cluster of differentiation 117) positive cell population and their colony forming capacity. This was accompanied with increase in the serum titre of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Interestingly, G-003 M lowered down the titre of fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt-3) ligands. Our results furthermore demonstrates that G-003 M facilitated the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and upregulated the expression of Wnt 10b. Conditioning of animal with G-003 M activated the expression of survivin, inhibited the activation of Caspase-3 in CD 34/117⁺ progenitor stem cells and protected the bone marrow vascularity and splenic colonies in lethally irradiated animals, which collectively promoted hemopoietic recovery in lethally irradiated mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abone marrow 3acaspase-3 3adeath 3airradiation 3aligands 3amortality 3apodophyllotoxin 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aresearch 3arutin 3atyrosine 0aGamma radiation 0aRadio protector 0aCytokine 0aApoptosis1 aKalita, Bhargab1 aSingh, Abhinav1 aYashavarddhan, M.H.1 aPrakash, Hridayesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5269-24811 aGupta, Manju Lata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3096-50440 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Apr. 16, v. 549 p.214-220dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03843naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245014100191300001600332520180400348592002802152650002602180650002702206650001302233650001602246650001102262650002002273650001702293650001802310650003702328650002002365650002002385650002702405650002102432650001402453650005202467650001202519650001802531650003902549650001202588650001102600650001002611650004402621650004302665650003102708650003302739650003102772650004302803650003002846650005402876700002102930700002002951700001902971773011102990856008403101990002303185852000903208655001203217IND60097905320221119153838.0141104e20130228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009790532DNAL7 a233761592pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwanaga, Kōichi,10aPurinergic P2Y1 receptor signaling mediates wound stimuli-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts  ap. 158-164.  aIntestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISMFs) are crucial for barrier formation against inflammatory stimuli. Physical injury induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, which accelerates wound healing by ISMFs. However, the mechanism of COX-2 induction remains unclear. Physically damaged cells release ATP. Here, we investigate the role of ATP-purinergic signaling in wound-induced COX-2 induction in ISMFs. By 24h post-injury, bovine ISMFs had migrated to and closed the wounded area. A COX inhibitor, indomethacin or a purinergic P2 receptor antagonist, suramin, inhibited wound healing. However, additional treatment with indomethacin did not influence wound healing in suramin-treated ISMFs. RT-PCR showed an increase in COX-2 mRNA expression 2h post-injury, which was inhibited by suramin. These results suggest that ATP mediates wound-induced COX-2 elevation. We next assessed the contribution of various purinergic receptors in COX-2 induction. An ATP analog, ATPγS and a purinergic P2Y1, 11–13 receptors agonist, ADP, were among the agents tested which increased COX-2 expression. ATPγS-induced COX-2 mRNA expression was suppressed by suramin or a purinergic P2Xs, P2Y1, 4, 6, and 13 receptors antagonist, PPADS. These data suggest the involvement of Gq-coupled purinergic P2Y1 receptor or Gᵢ-coupled purinergic P2Y13 receptor in COX-2 induction. U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, which is a downstream signal of Gq protein, showed suppression of COX-2 mRNA expression. However, pertussis toxin, a Gᵢ inhibitor, did not show suppression. We also revealed that inhibitors of p38 MAPK and PKC inhibited ATPγS-induced COX-2 mRNA expression. Collectively, purinergic P2Y1 receptor signaling mediates wound-induced COX-2 expression through p38 MAPK and PKC pathways in ISMFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3acattle 3agene expression 3aindomethacin 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apertussis toxin 3aphospholipase C 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotein kinase C 3areceptors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asuramin 3atissue repair 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aColon 2aCyclooxygenase 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIntestinal Mucosaxcytologyxinjuries. 2aMyofibroblastsxmetabolism 2aProtein Kinase Cxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Purinergic P2Y1xmetabolism 2aWound Healingxphysiology 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism1 aMurata, Takahisa1 aHori, Masatoshi1 aOzaki, Hiroshi0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 28, v. 702, no. 1-3 p.158-164dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012200172300002000294520155700314592002801871650001301899650002101912650000901933650001301942650001301955650001801968650001201986650003801998650003702036650002502073650001202098700002302110700006202133773011602195856008402311852000902395655001202404IND60677896620221122050253.0191213e20190809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilne, Zachary B.10aSliding History-Dependent Adhesion of Nanoscale Silicon Contacts Revealed by in Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy  ap. 15628-15638.  aNanoscale asperity-on-asperity sliding experiments were conducted using a nanoindentation apparatus inside a transmission electron microscope, allowing for atomic-scale resolution of contact formation, sliding, and adhesive separation of two silicon nanoasperities in real time. The formation and separation of the contacts without sliding revealed adhesion forces often below detectable limits (ca. 5 nN) or at most equal to values expected from van der Waals forces. Lateral sliding during contact by distances ranging from 3.7 μm down to as little as 20 nm resulted in an average 19× increase in the adhesive pull-off force, with increases as large as 32× seen. Adhesion after sliding increased with both the sliding speed and the applied normal contact stress. Unlike cold welding, where irreversible material changes like flow occur, these effects were repeatable and reversible multiple times, for multiple pairs of asperities. We hypothesize that sliding removes passivating surface terminal species, most likely hydrogen or hydroxyl groups, making sites available to form strong covalent bonds across the interface that increase adhesion. Upon separation, repassivation occurs within the experimentally limited lower bound time frame of 5 s, with full recovery of low adhesion. The results demonstrate the strong sliding history-dependence of adhesion, which hinges on the interplay between tribologically induced removal of adsorbed species and repassivation of unsaturated bonds on freshly separated surfaces by dissociative chemisorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3achemical bonding 3acold 3ahydrogen 3amoieties 3ananomaterials 3asilicon 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avan der Waals forces 3awelding1 aBernal, Rodrigo A.1 aCarpick, Robert W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3235-31560 tLangmuir.g2019 Aug. 09, v. 35, no. 48 p.15628-15638dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016100168300001400329520123900343592002801582650001201610650001601622650002101638650001101659650001201670650001301682650001101695650001001706651001101716653002201727653002401749653001101773653002401784653000901808700002401817700002401841773011501865856008201980852000902062655001202071IND60628708520221118100954.0190523e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062870852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2019.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsiftsis, Spyros10aNeottia cordata (Orchidaceae) at its southernmost distribution border in Europe: Threat status and effectiveness of Natura 2000 Network for its conservation  ap. 27-35.  aNeottia cordata is an orchid species that exclusively occurs in Picea abies subsp. abies and Pinus sylvestris stands and forms its southernmost distribution limits in Greece. Over the last decade, it has been recorded in numerous sites, in which it forms small colonies, both in terms of population and area. This research re-evaluates the threat status of Neottia cordata based on updated chorological and population data; it also checks the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 Network as far as its conservation is concerned by applying the MaxEnt model. The recently collected data justify the classification of N. cordata as "Vulnerable". The most significant variables that affect its distribution were found to be the vegetation type and the precipitation of the warmest quarter. The results of the MaxEnt model suggest that: (i) the Natura 2000 Network is characterised by areas of higher habitat suitability values when compared to the areas that fall outside this network; and, (ii) Picea abies subsp. abies forests are more suitable for its conservation than those of Pinus sylvestris. It is concluded that the most appropriate management measure for the species conservation is the maintenance of the tree layer canopy closed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeottia 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3acanopy 3aforests 3ahabitats 3amodels 3atrees 3aGreece 0aEastern Macedonia 0aTerrestrial orchids 0aMaxEnt 0aHabitat suitability 0aIUCN1 aDjordjević, Vladan1 aTsiripidis, Ioannis0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2019 Apr., v. 48 p.27-35dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2019.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01042naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006700155300001800222520013500240592002800375650002600403650002400429650002200453700001800475700002000493700002200513773013400535856007400669852000900743655001200752IND60639722920221122032641.0190502e20170418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063972292DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cs90028g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrieto, P.10aCorrection: Understanding MAOS through computational chemistry  ap. 2363-2364.  aCorrection for ‘Understanding MAOS through computational chemistry’ by P.

In the study, the effect has been studied at two observation sites with varying groundwater level. Regular measurements of soil moisture and soil temperature were taken in field at 1.5, 2.2 and 3 m depth to observe the groundwater level effect on these parameters. Preliminary analysis during November 2016–April 2017 was carried to find the relationship among soil moisture, soil temperature and surface temperature with groundwater level at each observation depth. Soil moisture and groundwater level has shown strong negative correlation (R² = 0.734, depth 1.5 m; R² = 0.799, depth 2.2 m and R² = 0.852, depth 3.0 m) at shallow groundwater level site and weak correlation (R² = 0.578, depth 1.5 m; R² = 0.501 and R² = 0.339, depth 3.0 m) at deep groundwater level site. Soil temperature and groundwater level has also shown strong positive correlation (R² = 0.840, depth 1.5 m, R² = 0.862, depth 2.2 m and R² = 0.917, depth 3.0 m) at shallow groundwater site and poor correlation (R² = 0.573, depth 1.5 m; R² = 0.468, depth 2.2 m and R² = 0.428, depth 3.0 m) at deep groundwater site. Soil moisture and soil temperature were also found strongly correlated (R² = 0.701, depth 1.5 m; R² = 0.602, depth 2.2 m and R² = 0.731, depth 3.0 m). Further, LANDSAT-8 data during observation period was processed to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) which in addition was correlated with soil moisture, soil temperature and groundwater level. LST was found significantly correlated with soil moisture and soil temperature at shallow groundwater site. However, a strong positive correlation, i.e., R² = 0.874 was deducted between LST and groundwater level at shallow groundwater site and poor correlation, i.e., R² = 0.434 at deep groundwater site. Thus, we have seen that shallow groundwater level has significant effect on these observed variables. The empirical results support our basic hypothesis and suggest further work for the better understanding and coupling of relationship among these parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3agroundwater 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asurface temperature 3awater table1 aShukla, J.

The microbial source (Aspergillus terreus) and plant source (Allium cepa seeds extract) reveal the presence of economic critical industrial enzymes, mainly cellulase. Cellulase from fungal culture filtrate (FCF) and onion seeds extract (OSE) shows the optimum activities at temperature (60°C and 55°C), pH (5.5 and 6.0) and substrate concentration (15 and 12.5mg/ml), respectively. The Km and Vmax for cellulase from FCF and OSE were 20 and 8mg/ml and 10 and 2.78U/ml, respectively. The calculated values of the half-life for cellulase from FCF and OSE at 55 and 70°C were 577.5 and 414.97, 150.33 and 135.35min, respectively. The fungal cellulase activity increased to four, three and two-fold in the presence of Ca2+, Ba+, Mg+ and Mn2+, respectively. However, plant cellulase did not enhanced by all tested metal ions. The plant cellulase efficient in saccharification of potato shells and corn cobs after 48h with 81.29% and 52.35% saccharification yield, respectively. While the fungal cellulase was more efficient in hydrolyzing of molokhia stems with saccharification yield 86.87%. The microbial and plant-derived cellulase showed good effect in bio-polishing of cotton fabric. The FCF exhibited a wide range of antimicrobial activity against gram positive, gram negative bacteria and fungi, where OSE displayed good antifungal activity against Alternaria solani and Alternaria alternata. Pretreatment of tomato fruits with OSE caused reduction in disease incidence DI of A. alternata and A. solani and delay in ripening of fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aAlternaria alternata 3aAlternaria solani 3aAspergillus terreus 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aantifungal properties 3acalcium 3acorn cobs 3acotton fabric 3aculture filtrates 3adisease incidence 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afruits 3afungi 3ahalf life 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3amicrobial culture 3aonions 3apH 3apotatoes 3aripening 3asaccharification 3astems 3atemperature 3atomatoes 0aCellulase enzyme 0aAspergillus terreus 0aOnion seeds 0aSaccharification 0aTextile industry 0aPlant disease1 aAbd El Aty, Abeer A.1 aHamed, Eman R.1 aEid, Basma M.1 aIbrahim, Nabil A.0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2016 Jan., v. 5 p.116-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2016.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014700170300001400317520087600331592002801207650004401235650002601279650003001305650002701335650000901362650004301371650002201414650001601436650001801452650001301470650002701483650002701510650001401537700002701551700002001578700002601598700002501624773009401649856008101743852000901824655001201833IND50071670320221120122808.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007167032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-013-1324-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhandare, Rahul V.10aDevelopment of a low-cost, phyto-tunnel system using Portulaca grandiflora and its application for the treatment of dye-containing wastewaters  ap. 47-55.  aA phyto-tunnel was developed using a drilled PVC pipe.

The ciliary muscle strips isolated by bovine eyes were exposed cumulatively to anandamide in the presence and in the absence of carbachol (5nM), in a miograph system for isometric recording. The experiments were also conducted in the presence of AM251 (100nM), 4-DAMP (100nM), Pertussis toxin (500ng/ml), U73122 (0.1 and 1μM), chelerythrine (1 and 10μM) and Y27632 (1 and 10μM). Contractile responses were expressed as the percentage of 10μM carbachol-induced contraction. The anandamide-induced contraction on bovine ciliary muscle strips was enhanced by the previous stimulation of Gq-protein-coupled muscarinic M₃ receptors with carbachol. The contractile response to anandamide plus carbachol was affected by different inhibitors such as Pertussis toxin, phospholipase C, protein kinase C and Rho-kinase. The key results of the present study show that sequential activation of muscarinic M₃ receptors and cannabinoid CB₁ receptors produce synergistic contractile effects of the bovine ciliary muscle by involving the activation of Rho-kinase and protein kinase C.  aPublisher supplied data 3acannabinoids 3acarbachol 3acattle 3aeyes 3amuscle strength 3amuscles 3apertussis toxin 3aphospholipase C 3aprotein kinase C 3areceptors 2aAnimals 2aArachidonic Acidsxpharmacology 2aCannabinoid Receptor Agonistsxpharmacology 2aCannabinoid Receptor Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aCarbacholxpharmacology 2aCattle 2aCholinergic Agonistsxpharmacology 2aCiliary Bodyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aEndocannabinoidsxpharmacology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMuscarinic Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aMuscle Contractionxdrug effects 2aMuscle, Smoothxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPiperidinesxpharmacology 2aPolyunsaturated Alkamidesxpharmacology 2aProtein Kinase Cxphysiology 2aPyrazolesxpharmacology 2aReceptor, Cannabinoid, CB1xagonistsxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2aReceptor, Muscarinic M3xagonistsxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2arho-Associated Kinasesxphysiology1 aLograno, Marcello Diego0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 28, v. 702, no. 1-3 p.174-179dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0533Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011800157300002000275520094900295592002801244650000901272650001301281650001501294650001101309650002501320653002101345653004501366653001801411653002401429653002601453700001601479700002101495700001301516700001801529700001801547700002001565773012601585856007501711852000901786655001201795IND60527694420221119122544.0160715e20140813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052769442DNAL7 a10.1021/am503675x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Hyejin10aAg Shell–Au Satellite Hetero-Nanostructure for Ultra-Sensitive, Reproducible, and Homogeneous NIR SERS Activity  ap. 11859-11863.  aIt is critical to create isotropic hot spots in developing a reproducible, homogeneous, and ultrasensitive SERS probe. Here, an Ag shell–Au satellite (Ag–Au SS) nanostructure composed of an Ag shell and surrounding Au nanoparticles was developed as a near-IR active SERS probe. The heterometallic shell-satellite structure based SERS probe produced intense and uniform SERS signals (SERS enhancement factor ∼1.4 × 10⁶ with 11% relative standard deviation) with high detectability (100% under current measurement condition) by 785 nm photoexcitation. This signal enhancement was independent of the laser polarizations, which reflects the isotropic feature of the SERS activity of Ag–Au SS from the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of SERS hot spots between the shell and the surrounding satellite particles. The Ag–Au SS nanostructure shows a great potential as a reproducible and quantifiable NIR SERS probe for in vivo targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3ananogold 3asatellites 3asilver 3astatistical analysis 0acore−satellite 0asurface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 0aSERS hot spot 0anear-infrared probe 0auniform SERS activity1 aKang, Homan1 aYang, Jin-Kyoung1 aJo, Ahla1 aLee, Ho-Young1 aLee, Yoon-Sik1 aJeong, Dae Hong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Aug. 13, v. 6, no. 15 p.11859-11863dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam503675x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245007000202300002000272520204400292592002802336650002502364650002502389650002602414650002202440650001602462650001302478650001402491650001102505650001402516650001502530650000902545650001402554650001302568650002002581650001602601650001902617700003002636700002002666700006202686773011602748856008402864852000902948655001202957IND60677896920221122050419.0191213e20191014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2646-591710aInterfacial Phenomena of Natural Dispersants for Crude Oil Spills  ap. 15904-15913.  aA natural surfactant was studied to simulate the dispersion process of crude oil in water. The interfacial phenomena of this natural dispersant was compared with a commercially available chemical dispersant, COREXIT EC9500A. This functional surfactant was extracted from the mucilage of the Opuntia ficus-indica cactus species. The evaluation to determine the efficacy to disperse crude oil of the cactus-based mucilage extract (nongelling extract, NE) was based on characterizing surface and interfacial tension, dispersion efficiency, mixing effects, salinity effects, stability, and droplets size distributions. We found that surface tension values follow a linear relationship with respect to the natural logarithm of the concentrations of NE. The application of NE in the water phase led to decreasing oil/water interfacial tensions. Surface tension tests were also used to quantify the effect of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion ratios once either natural or commercialized dispersants were added. A key finding of our work is that the surface tension between typical 6% and 3% v/v O/W emulsions was significantly reduced with the addition of discrete amounts of NE. This result indicated that the dynamic balance between O/W and water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions was thermodynamically more stable toward O/W emulsion states with NE. We also found that O/W emulsions with higher dispersion effectiveness were formed for both 10 and 35 practical salinity units, as the dispersant to oil ratios increased, with a significant correlation to the mixing energy. We observed that the O/W emulsions with natural dispersants had a significantly smaller weighted average diameter compared to those with COREXIT EC9500A. Such a phenomenon can be explained by understanding intermolecular interactions due to the structure and type of dispersant. In conclusion, cactus-based mucilage extracts could be used as environmentally benign dispersants and, therefore, reduce negative social perceptions of the application of dispersants to clean up spilled oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3acacti and succulents 3achemical interactions 3acommercialization 3adispersants 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3amucilages 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apetroleum 3asalinity 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3athermodynamics1 ade Lima Stebbins, Daniela1 aToomey, Ryan G.1 aAlcantar, Norma A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0371-17910 tLangmuir.g2019 Oct. 14, v. 35, no. 48 p.15904-15913dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b020363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001900176245008100195300001500276520156200291592002801853650001401881650001501895650001501910650002301925650000901948650002501957650001501982650003101997650001202028650002002040650003502060650001202095650001202107700001802119700002702137700002202164700001702186773015202203856006902355856010402424990002302528852000902551655001202560IND60643871220221121043353.0190514e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064387122DNAL7 a10.3791/536922doi7 aPMC47811002pmcid7 a267806052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzadeh, Jadali10aInitiating differentiation in immortalized multipotent otic progenitor cells  ap. e53692.  aUse of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or embryonic stem cells (ESC) for cell replacement therapies holds great promise. Several limitations including low yields and heterogeneous populations of differentiated cells hinder the progress of stem cell therapies. A fate restricted immortalized multipotent otic progenitor (iMOP) cell line was generated to facilitate efficient differentiation of large numbers of functional hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) for inner ear cell replacement therapies. Starting from dissociated cultures of single iMOP cells, protocols that promote cell cycle exit and differentiation by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) withdrawal were described. A significant decrease in proliferating cells after bFGF withdrawal was confirmed using an EdU cell proliferation assay. Concomitant with a decrease in proliferation, successful differentiation resulted in expression of molecular markers and morphological changes. Immunostaining of Cdkn1b (p27KIP) and Cdh1 (E-cadherin) in iMOP-derived otospheres was used as an indicator for differentiation into inner ear sensory epithelia while immunostaining of Cdkn1b and Tubb3 (neuronal β-tubulin) was used to identify iMOP-derived neurons. Use of iMOP cells provides an important tool for understanding cell fate decisions made by inner ear neurosensory progenitors and will help develop protocols for generating large numbers of iPSC or ESC-derived hair cells and SGNs. These methods will accelerate efforts for generating otic cells for replacement therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadherins 3acell cycle 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3aears 3aembryonic stem cells 3aepithelium 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3aganglia 3agenetic markers 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3aneurons 3atubulin1 aSong, Zhichao1 aLaureano, Alejandra S.1 aToro-Ramos, Alana1 aKwan, Kelvin0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Jan. 02, , no. 107 p.e53692-e53692dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/536923Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53692/initiating-differentiation-immortalized-multipotent-otic-progenitor  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245008600206300001800292506007600310520177200386592002802158506003702186650001502223650002402238650001502262650003002277650001102307650001502318650001802333650002402351650001602375650001202391650001402403651001402417700002102431700001902452700001602471700001802487773012102505856007902626852000902705655001202714IND60119145220221207134408.0141203e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011914522DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.123362doi7 aPMC42862042pmcid7 a255985502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRead, Cassia F.10aBiocrust morphogroups provide an effective and rapid assessment tool for drylands  ap. 1740-1749.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiological soil crusts (biocrusts) occur across most of the world's drylands and are sensitive indicators of dryland degradation. Accounting for shifts in biocrust composition is important for quantifying integrity of arid and semi‐arid ecosystems, but the best methods for assessing biocrusts are uncertain. We investigate the utility of surveying biocrust morphogroups, a reduced set of biotic classes, compared to species data, for detecting shifts in biocrust composition and making inference about dryland degradation. We used multivariate regression tree (MRT) analyses to model morphogroup abundance, species abundance and species occurrence data from two independent studies in semi‐arid open woodlands of south‐eastern Australia. We advanced the MRT method with a ‘best subsets’ model selection procedure, which improved model stability and prediction. Biocrust morphogroup composition responded strongly to surrogate variables of ecological degradation. Further, MRT models of morphogroup data had stronger explanatory power and predictive power than MRT models of species abundance or occurrence data. We also identified morphogroup indicators of degraded and less degraded sites in our study region. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable management of drylands requires methods to assess shifts in ecological integrity. We suggest that biocrust morphogroups are highly suitable for assessment of dryland integrity because they allow for non‐expert, rapid survey and are informative about ecological function. Furthermore, morphogroups were more robust than biocrust species data, showed a strong response to ecological degradation and were less influenced by environmental variation, and models of morphogroup abundance were more predictive.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarid lands 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental degradation 3amodels 3aprediction 3arapid methods 3aregression analysis 3asoil crusts 3asurveys 3awoodlands 3aAustralia1 aDuncan, David H.1 aVesk, Peter A.1 aElith, Jane1 aWan, Shiqiang0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2014 Dec., v. 51, no. 6 p.1740-1749dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.123363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03951naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245008400193300001600277500001500293520170200308592002802010650001602038650000902054650002202063650001602085650001902101650001702120650001802137650001702155650001402172650000902186650001702195650001802212650001202230650001202242650002402254650001602278650002102294650001702315650001202332650005302344650006602397650002602463650003102489650002002520650000902540650000902549650002302558650001902581650003002600650003602630650004102666650000902707650003502716650003002751650003902781653002202820700001902842700002202861700001902883700002102902700001902923700002402942773011102966856008403077990002303161852000903184655001203193IND60097905720221119153520.0141104e20130228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009790572DNAL7 a233962322pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuchimochi, Wakaba10aGhrelin prevents the development of experimental diabetic neuropathy in rodents  ap. 187-193.  a2019-12-06  aGhrelin is an acylated peptide discovered in gastric extracts as an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) receptor. This peptide increases food intake and growth hormone secretion, suppresses inflammation and oxidative stress, and promotes cell survival and proliferation. Our study investigated the pharmacological effect of ghrelin in the prevention of polyneuropathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in C57BL/6N mice, GHS receptor-deficient mice, and growth hormone-deficient rats. Ghrelin or desacyl-ghrelin was administered daily for four weeks immediately after disease onset. The effects of ghrelin on food intake, body weight, blood glucose and plasma insulin levels, nerve conduction velocities, temperature sensation, and 8-isoprostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) levels were examined. We found that ghrelin administration did not change food intake, body weight gain, blood glucose levels, or plasma insulin levels in C57BL/6N mice in comparison with mice treated with saline or desacyl-ghrelin administration. Ghrelin administration, but not desacyl-ghrelin, prevented motor and sensory polyneuropathy and reduced the plasma concentrations of 8-iso-PGF2α in C57BL/6N mice. Ghrelin also prevented the reduction in nerve conduction velocities in growth hormone-deficient rats, but not in GHS receptor-knockout mice. In conclusion, ghrelin administration in a rodent model of diabetes prevented polyneuropathy, and this effect was mediated through the GHS receptor and was independent of growth hormone. The protection against the development of experimental diabetic polyneuropathy by ghrelin could be key in preventing this otherwise intractable disorder.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood intake 3arats 3ahormone secretion 3aweight gain 3acell viability 3asomatotropin 3ablood glucose 3ainflammation 3asensation 3amice 3apharmacology 3aanimal models 3ainsulin 3aghrelin 3adiabetic neuropathy 3atemperature 3aoxidative stress 3anerve tissue 2aAnimals 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxphysiopathology 2aDiabetic Neuropathiesxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aGhrelinxpharmacology 2aGrowth Hormonexphysiology 2aHot Temperature 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMotor Neuronsxphysiology 2aNeural Conductionxdrug effects 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aReceptors, Ghrelinxphysiology 2aSciatic Nervexphysiology 2aSensory Receptor Cellsxphysiology 0adiabetes mellitus1 aKyoraku, Itaru1 aYamaguchi, Hideki1 aToshinai, Koji1 aShiomi, Kazutaka1 aKangawa, Kenji1 aNakazato, Masamitsu0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 28, v. 702, no. 1-3 p.187-193dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01610naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245007500167300001500242500001900257520054900276592002800825650001200853650001300865650001400878650001200892650001100904650001600915651001000931653002200941653002900963653001400992700001801006700001301024773011001037856008001147852000901227655001201236IND60695831120221120101310.0200519e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069583112DNAL7 a10.1179/174328206X1053622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalabrese, G.

Traditional metal oxide catalysts are prone to be sulfated and the as-formed sulfates are difficult to decompose. In this study, we discovered that SO₂ adsorption could be largely restrained over FeδCe₁₋δVO₄ catalysts, which effectively restrained the deposition of sulfate species and endowed catalysts with strong SO₂ tolerance at an extremely low temperature of 240 °C. The increasing oxygen vacancies, enhanced redox properties, and improved acidity contributed to the SCR activity of the FeδCe₁₋δVO₄ catalyst. The reaction pathway changed from the reaction between bidentate nitrate and the NH₃ species over CeVO₄ catalysts via the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism to that between gaseous NOₓ and the NH₄⁺/NH₃ species over FeδCe₁₋δVO₄ catalysts via the Eley–Rideal mechanism. The effective suppression of SO₂ adsorption allowed FeδCe₁₋δVO₄ catalysts to maintain the Eley–Rideal pathways on account of the reduced formation of sulfate species. This work demonstrated an effective route to improve SO₂ tolerance via modulating SO₂ adsorption on Ce-based vanadate catalysts, which presented a new point for the development of high-performance SO₂-tolerant SCR catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3aenvironmental science 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3asulfates 3atechnology 3atemperature1 aHan, Lupeng1 aWang, Penglu1 aFeng, Chong1 aZhang, Jianping1 aYan, Tingting1 aDeng, Jiang1 aShi, Liyi1 aZhang, Dengsong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4280-00680 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 54, no. 21 p.14066-14075dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c050383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008500172300001600257520106800273592002801341650002901369650001301398650002101411650001601432650000901448650002201457650001601479650001301495653002401508653001301532653001901545653001101564653003201575653001301607700001801620700001701638700001801655700005901673773011301732856008301845852000901928655001201937IND60547065320221120234921.0170607e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054706532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Pao-Wen Grace14aThe optimal combination of entrapped bacteria for diesel remediation in seawater  ap. 383-391.  aThe objective is to determine an optimized combination of immobilized cell when remediating diesel-oil contaminated seawater. Experiments were conducted using the diesel-degrading bacteria: Rhodococcus pyridinivorans CC-HCCH11, Gordonia alkanivorans CC-JG39, and Alcaligenes piechaudii CC-ESB2. They were entrapped in calcium alginate gel beads. All of the combinations were evaluated with the total petroleum hydrocarbon-diesel (TPHd) degradability in modified Bushnell Haas medium by baffled flask tests. Design I (dominant CC-HCCH11) achieved the highest TPHd degradation percentage (78%), followed by Design II (75%), Design III (70%), and Design IV (61%). Design I reduced TPHd from initial 2342 mg/L to 504 mg/L, and also achieved the highest 1st order kinetic rate (0.0049/hr) followed by Design III (0.0046/hr), Design IV (0.0042/hr), and Design II (0.0022/hr). A parallel batch result showed that the free-cell Design I revealed only about half of the TPHd degradability. Nutrient test showed that Bushnell Haas medium was adequate for the remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter piechaudii 3abacteria 3acalcium alginate 3adiesel fuel 3agels 3aimmobilized cells 3aremediation 3aseawater 0aCell immobilization 0aSeawater 0aBioremediation 0aDiesel 0aTotal petroleum hydrocarbon 0aNutrient1 aLiou, Jia Wen1 aLi, Yi Tsung1 aSu, Wen Liang1 aChen, Chih-Hung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2173-91810 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2015 Aug., v. 102 p.383-391dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245014000164300001400304500001100318520115700329592002801486650002101514650002701535650001401562650001301576650001701589650002601606650001001632650002201642650001301664650002301677650001701700650002701717650001101744700001801755773018601773856007901959852000902038655001202047IND50090240520221118192948.0150218e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009024052DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6968.124502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Juneyoung10aMelittin triggers apoptosis in Candida albicans through the reactive oxygen species‐mediated mitochondria/caspase‐dependent pathway  ap. 36-42.  aLETTER  aMelittin is one of the best‐studied antimicrobial peptides, and many studies have focused on the membrane underlying its membrane‐disruptive activity. We previously showed that melittin could cause some hallmarks of apoptosis in Candida albicans. Here, we first report the exact mechanism of melittin‐induced fungal apoptosis. We first characterized the reactive oxygen species generated by melittin. The results showed that melittin strongly produced highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), which contribute to cell death. Next, we showed that melittin also disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and induced the Ca²⁺release from the endoplasmic reticulum and its remarkable accumulation in mitochondria. Finally, we investigated the role of caspase in the apoptotic pathway. The results showed that melittin activated metacaspase, which was mediated by cytochrome c release. To summarize, melittin is involved in the mitochondria‐ and caspase‐dependent apoptotic pathway in C. albicans. Our findings suggest that melittin possesses a dual antimicrobial mechanism, including membrane‐disruptive and apoptotic actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acytochrome c 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afungi 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amelittin 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxygen1 aLee, Dong Gun0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2014 June, v. 355, no. 1 p.36-42dPublished by Elsevier/North Holland on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6968.124503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013200160300001800292520106000310592002801370650001101398650002201409650002501431650001701456650002101473650001201494650002201506650001301528650003301541650000801574650003701582700001301619700001501632700001701647700001701664700001401681773010201695856008101797852000901878655001201887IND60575486520221118032334.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057548652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-017-0929-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Li10aSynthesis and lithium storage properties of interconnected fullerene-like carbon nanofibers encapsulated with tin nanoparticles  ap. 6969-6975.  aInterconnected fullerene-like carbon nanofibers encapsulated with tin nanoparticles (Sn@FLCNFs) were synthesized by a facile and scalable electrospinning method using fullerene-like carbon nanoparticles and PVP as carbon sources. SEM and TEM revealed that Sn nanoparticles have been uniformly embedded into the nanofibers. The self-supported Sn@FLCNFs could be directly used as an anode of lithium-ion battery without adding any polymer and binder; it showed a high initial coulombic efficiency. A reversible capacity as high as 846 mA h g⁻¹ remained after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g⁻¹. When the current density was raised to 1 A g⁻¹, the reversible capacity maintained 656 mA h g⁻¹ after 300 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the formation of the efficient Li-ions diffusion paths and highly conductive cross-linked network in the Sn@FLCNFs electrode, and the interconnected carbon framework can prevent the Sn nanoparticles from pulverization and re-aggregation during cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon nanofibers 3acarbon nanoparticles 3acrosslinking 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atin 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aQiao, Li1 aLi, Xiuwan1 aSun, Xiaolei1 aYue, Hongwei1 aHe, Deyan0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 June, v. 52, no. 12 p.6969-6975dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-017-0929-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245011600188300001400304520105900318592002801377650002101405650001501426650001801441650002201459650001701481650000901498650000901507650000901516650003501525650003201560650001201592650002701604650003101631650001301662650000901675650002801684650000901712650002501721650002701746700001901773700001901792700002001811700002001831700001801851700001801869773010901887856008401996990002302080852000902103655001202112IND60097905920221119153535.0141104e20130228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009790592DNAL7 a233535942pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Kuo-Lun10aProlonged analgesic effect of amitriptyline base on thermal hyperalgesia in an animal model of neuropathic pain  ap. 20-24.  aThe best analgesic drugs for neuropathic pain have a long duration of action, can be given via multiple routes, and can be used preemptively. We evaluated the antinociceptive effects and duration of action of subcutaneously injected amitriptyline base (AMT-Base) (in oil). A plantar test in a spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain in rats showed that typical amitriptyline HCl (AMT-HCl) (in saline) and AMT-Base had a significant dose-dependent antinociceptive effect: the antinociceptive duration of a single 100μmol/kg injection of AMT-HCl was 5h and of AMT-Base was 24h when given 7 days after a SNL, and of a single 200μmol/kg injection of AMT-Base was 39 days when given 1h before and 4 days when given 7 days after a SNL. The post-ligation antinociceptive duration of AMT-Base was 4.8 times that of AMT-HCl, but the duration of preemptive (pre-ligation) AMT-Base treatment was 9.7 times that of AMT-Base. We can conclude that preemptive amitriptyline base provides long-lasting antinociception for neuropathic pain experimentally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesic effect 3aanalgesics 3aanimal models 3ahydrochloric acid 3anerve tissue 3aoils 3apain 3arats 2aAmitriptylinextherapeutic use 2aAnalgesicsxtherapeutic use 2aAnimals 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aHyperalgesiaxdrug therapy 2aLigation 2aMale 2aNeuralgiaxdrug therapy 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSpinal Nervesxsurgery1 aShieh, Ja-Ping1 aChu, Chin-Chen1 aZheng, Guangyi,1 aWang, Jhi-Joung1 aLin, Mao-Tsun1 aYeh, Mou-Yung0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 28, v. 702, no. 1-3 p.20-24dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.12.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005500145245014700200300002000347500001900367520136600386592002801752650001601780650000801796650001601804650001201820650004601832650001101878650002201889650002301911650001401934650001001948650001801958650001801976650001301994650001502007700005602022700001202078700002002090700001502110700006202125700005102187773014202238856007902380852000902459655001202468IND60715777820221117231239.0201103e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071577782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c051002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Jiafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9425-037112aA Novel Insight into the Ozone–Skin Lipid Oxidation Products Observed by Secondary Electrospray Ionization High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry  ap. 13478-13487.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEmissions of secondary products through reactions of oxidants, ozone (O₃), and hydroxyl radical (·OH) with human skin lipids have become increasingly important in indoor environments. Here, we evaluate the secondary organic compounds formed through heterogeneous reactions of gaseous O₃ with hand skin lipids by using a high-resolution quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a commercial secondary electrospray ionization (SESI) source. More than 600 ions were detected over a period of less than 40 min real-time measurements, among which 53 ions were characterized with a significant increasing trend in signal intensity at the presence of O₃. Based on the detected ions, we suggest detailed reaction pathways initiated by ozone oxidation of squalene that results in primary and secondary ozonides; we noticed for the first time that these products may be further cleaved by direct reaction of nucleophilic ammonia (NH₃), emitted from human skin. Finally, we estimate the fate of secondarily formed carbonyl compounds with respect to their gas-phase reactions with ·OH, O₃, and NO₃ and compared with their removal by air exchange rate (AER) with outdoors.

However, traditional sulfuration reagents (Na₂S, FeS, CaS, etc.) rapidly release H₂S under acidic conditions via spontaneous hydrolysis, leading to serious H₂S pollution. Herein, a H₂S release process employing thiosulfate as a sulfuration reagent was proposed to eliminate H₂S pollution. We found that thiosulfate can release H₂S with specificity both in the dark and under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation under acidic conditions. In the absence of arsenic/HMs, H₂S is not released because the formed H₂S is consumed by a thiosulfate decomposition product, sulfite, or by its photolysis. In the presence of arsenic/HMs, H₂S is released because the formed H₂S immediately reacts with arsenic/HMs to generate sulfide precipitates rather than being consumed. The efficiency of transforming thiosulfate to H₂S under UV irradiation is 2.5-fold the efficiency in the dark, because UV irradiation promotes the transformation of “effective sulfur” in thiosulfate molecules to form H₂S through the transformation of HS· and S₂O₃• – radicals. Moreover, more than 99.9% of arsenic/HMs were removed from strongly acidic wastewater without producing H₂S pollution under UV irradiation. This thiosulfate-based H₂S-specific release process solves the problem of H₂S pollution under acidic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ahydrolysis 3airradiation 3aphotolysis 3apollution 3asulfites 3athiosulfates 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater1 aHu, Xingyun1 aPeng, Xianjia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7150-06061 aWang, Xianliang0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 54, no. 21 p.14076-14084dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c051663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001700168245017300185300001400358500001500372520101600387592002801403650000901431650001501440650001601455650002001471650002001491650002701511650002401538650001701562650002201579650001601601650001501617650002401632650001601656650002501672650001101697650002701708650005001735650003201785650003601817650004401853650002401897653000901921700002101930700001801951700001801969700002101987773007902008856008302087852000902170655001202179IND60080894720221120050609.0140812e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008089472DNAL7 a211118052pmid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2010.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsieh, Ai-Ru10aOn the use of multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and classification and regression tree (CART) to identify haplotype–haplotype interactions in genetic studies  ap. 77-85.  a2019-12-06  aHaplotype-based approaches may have greater power than single-locus analyses when the SNPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium with the risk locus. To overcome potential complexities owing to large numbers of haplotypes in genetic studies, we evaluated two data mining approaches, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and classification and regression tree (CART), with the concept of haplotypes considering their haplotype uncertainty to detect haplotype–haplotype (HH) interactions. In evaluation of performance for detecting HH interactions, MDR had higher power than CART, but MDR gave a slightly higher type I error. Additionally, we performed an HH interaction analysis with a publicly available dataset of Parkinson's disease and confirmed previous findings that the RET proto-oncogene is associated with the disease. In this study, we showed that using HH interaction analysis is possible to assist researchers in gaining more insight into identifying genetic risk factors for complex diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aloci 3ahaplotypes 3auncertainty 3adata collection 3aproto-oncogenes 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aParkinson disease 3aresearchers 2aAlgorithms 2aComputer Simulation 2aData Mining 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aHumans 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aMultifactor Dimensionality Reductionxmethods 2aParkinson Diseasexgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-retxgenetics 2aRegression Analysis 0arisk1 aHsiao, Ching-Lin1 aChang, Su-Wei1 aWang, Hui-Min1 aFann, Cathy S.J.0 tGenomics.g2011 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.77-85dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2010.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006200170300001600232520093400248592002801182650001001210650001501220650002001235650001001255650002101265650003201286650001201318650001901330650000701349650001001356653001901366653001501385653002101400700002801421700002401449700001801473700001901491773012201510856008201632852000901714655001201723IND60527908220221121191705.0190416e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052790822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMegías, Cristina10aPurification of canavanine from the legume Vicia disperma  ap. 150-154.  aVicia disperma is an annual legume that accumulates high amounts of the non-protein amino acid canavanine in the seeds. The purification of this amino acid from the seeds of V. disperma has been investigated in order to assess the possibility of using this plant as a source of canavanine. Seeds had 3% (w/w) canavanine content, representing 84.3% (w/w) total free amino acids. Canavanine was extracted from seed flour extracts at pH 4 and purified by nanofiltration and ion-exchange chromatography, followed by either precipitation or crystallization, yielding canavanine 90% and 97% pure, respectively. This represents a simple and inexpensive procedure for production of canavanine, taking advantage of the high content of canavanine in V. disperma. This could have a very beneficial impact on the use of V. disperma and other Vicia rich in canavanine, some of which have good agronomic properties and were farmed in the past.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia 3acanavanine 3acrystallization 3aflour 3afree amino acids 3aion exchange chromatography 3alegumes 3ananofiltration 3apH 3aseeds 0aVicia disperma 0aCanavanine 0aFree amino acids1 aCortés-Giraldo, Isabel1 aGirón-Calle, Julio1 aAlaiz, Manuel1 aVioque, Javier0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2016 Jan., v. 5 p.150-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2016.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008600166300001600252500001900268520124600287592002801533650001401561650001101575650001301586650001501599650003001614650002301644650002001667650001101687650001101698650001101709651001901720653001501739653002201754653002201776653003201798653001601830773011101846856008001957852000902037655001202046IND60695831520221120101139.0200519e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069583152DNAL7 a10.1179/174328206X1054162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansová, Irena10aSeasonal growth and dynamics of epixylic bryophytes in Bohemian old-growth forest  ap. 123-132.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeasonal patterns in growth and dynamics of 13 epixylic bryophyte species (six liverworts and seven mosses) were studied within permanent plots in the Žofínský prales old-growth forest in south-eastern Bohemia, Czech Republic. Transparencies were used to record positions and cover of bryophyte colonies within each plot twice a year (in spring and autumn) for periods of 1–4 years. Percentage growth of species populations and growth dynamics of their colonies were analysed in order to identify seasonality in their growth. Establishment of bryophyte colonies and their expansion, as well as pair-wise overgrowth of adjacent colonies of different species were compared in order to identify competitive interactions between bryophyte species. Bryophytes grew faster during the winter season (October–April) than during summer, and the various species did not differ in their percentage growth. The growth dynamics of bryophyte colonies was highly seasonal and the species differed in their dynamics pattern. The expansion and retreat (local extinction) of bryophyte species were greatest in winter, and the stability of colonies was, therefore, higher in summer. Interspecific competition among the species studied appears to be low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3aautumn 3abryology 3aextinction 3ainterspecific competition 3aold-growth forests 3aseasonal growth 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aCzech Republic 0aBRYOPHYTES 0aPERCENTAGE GROWTH 0aSEASONAL PATTERNS 0aTEMPERATE OLD-GROWTH FOREST 0aFALLEN LOGS0 tJournal of bryology.g2006 June 1, v. 28, no. 2 p.123-132dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2030x1743-28207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1179/174328206X1054163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011200171300001600283520106900299592002801368650003401396650001601430650002501446650001701471650002501488650001201513650001601525650001301541650001601554650001201570650001201582650000901594650001401603650002601617653002501643653003601668653001201704653003701716653003201753653002401785700002101809700002401830773012201854856008201976852000902058655001202067IND60527908320221121191645.0190416e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052790832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangwong, Giraporn10aAntioxidant activity of chemically and enzymatically modified sericin extracted from cocoons of Bombyx mori  ap. 155-161.  aThai silk cocoons from polyvoltine silkworm strain, Nangnoi, contain several antioxidant factors, pigments and protein.

The antioxidant activity of crude sericin extract (CSE) treated with protease enzyme measured by ABTS and DPPH assays showed 5.0-fold and 3.0-fold higher activity than that of untreated CSE, while DTT, β-mercaptoethanol and UV light treatments were found to significantly decrease antioxidant activity of CSE.

Several studies on these health benefits have assessed individual and population exposure to urban greenness using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from different satellite platforms. Recent comparisons between birds-eye NDVI and street-level measurements suggest that NDVI can severely misclassify individual exposure which, in turn, can bias epidemiologic effect estimates. Pedestrian video data may provide a novel source of individual, eye-level information on both indoor and outdoor exposure to vegetation. The objective of this pilot study was to examine the potential of pedestrian video data for assessing exposure to urban greenness using secondary data collected for a different study on microscale urban air temperatures. Image processing was used to extract green, yellow, and shaded pixels from ˜10 million frames of video footage collected during 40 sampling runs of 20 urban routes measuring 8–10 km each. Resulting greenness values (combined total of green, yellow, and shaded pixels) were compared with concurrent air temperatures using correlations, time series plots, and maps. Correlations ranged from -0.61 to 0.34 and were in the expected direction for 31 of 40 runs. Time series plots and overlay maps showed clear inverse relationships in many cases. Most routes originally chosen to characterize higher temperature areas had negative correlations. Flat and weakly positive relationships tended to occur when conditions were overcast or routes were closer to large waterways. Secondary data are limited for such assessments, but the methods described here are promising for future exposure assessment at the individual level and evaluation of methods applied at the population level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acooling 3adata collection 3aexposure assessment 3aimage analysis 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3awaterways 0aAir temperature 0aExposure assessment 0aGreenness 0aUrban heat island 0aVegetation1 aTsin, Pak Keung1 aBosch, Matilda van den,1 aBräuer, Michael,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9103-93431 aHenderson, Sarah B.0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 Feb., v. 38 p.280-285dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2019.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002200168245015300190300001400343520094400357592002801301650000801329650001501337650002001352650002001372650001001392650000901402650002601411650002901437650002001466650002701486650004101513650003901554650001101593650001101604650002401615650005301639700002101692700001901713700001401732773007901746856008301825852000901908655001201917IND60080894820221120050629.0140812e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008089482DNAL7 a210448812pmid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2010.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtiz-Estevez, M.10aSegmentation of genomic and transcriptomic microarrays data reveals major correlation between DNA copy number aberrations and gene–loci expression  ap. 86-93.  aDNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) are genetic alterations common in cancer cells. Their transcriptional consequences are still poorly understood. Based on the fact that DNA copy number (CN) is highly correlated with the genomic position, we have applied a segmentation algorithm to gene expression (GE) to explore its relation with CN. We have found a strong correlation between segmented CN (sCN) and segmented GE (sGE), corroborating that CNAs have clear effects on genome-wide expression. We have found out that most of the recurrent regions of sGE are common to those obtained from sCN analysis. Results for two cancer datasets confirm the known targets of aberrations and provide new candidates to study. The suggested methodology allows to find recurrent aberrations specific to sGE, revealing loci where the expression of the genes is independent from their CNs.

The maximum xylanase production, 4061.32U/g, was achieved in different sized flasks. The study further aimed at higher yield recovery in a single step from fermented sorghum straw through statistical methodology. For optimizing recovery conditions with respect to extractant volume (8–16mL/g), extraction time (30–150min), extraction speed (50–250rpm) and extraction temperature (30–50°C), central composite design (CCD) in 27 runs was employed. Maximum xylanase yield under validated recovery conditions was 5177.23U/g with 90% recovery efficiency. Next, the crude xylanase, commercial cellulase and combination of both were subjected for saccharification of various untreated and pretreated agro-residues. The studied enzymes yielded much higher sugar content in combination, rather than their utilization as alone. Overall, xylanase from Aspergillus tubingensis FDHN1 can be produced and recovered at high level under solid state fermentation, exhibiting potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus tubingensis 3aculture flasks 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3asaccharification 3asolid state fermentation 3astatistical analysis 3astraw 3asugar content 3atemperature 3axylanases 0aAspergillus tubingensis FDHN1 0aXylanase production 0aSolid state fermentation 0aStatistical methodology 0aEnzyme recovery 0aOptimization 0aSaccharification1 aBhatt, Nikhil S.1 aModi, H.A.1 aDivecha, Jyoti0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2016 Apr., v. 6 p.51-57dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2016.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011000162300001800272520130500290592002801595596021801623650001601841650001601857650001501873650001901888650001501907650001501922650001401937700001401951700001701965773014401982856008202126852000902208655001202217IND60746965120221122215524.0210809e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074696512DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-021-01377-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jin14aThe Extraction and Analysis of Deformation Features of Hualien Earthquake Based on Sentinel-1A/B SAR Data  ap. 2069-2077.  aFocusing on Hualien earthquake which happened on April 18th in 2019, this research took Sentinel-1A/B SAR images as data source, extracted deformation field through DInSAR and MAI technology, analyzed deformation features based on interferogram, geological structure, distribution of aftershocks and the vertical PGA monitoring results. Our results showed that the maximum displacement of land surface subsidence near the seismic focus areas in LOS direction reached up to 3.6 cm, and the maximum displacement near the seismic focus areas in azimuth direction reached up to − 3.5 cm, both less than 4.0 cm. That was to say, the displacement in both direction caused by this earthquake was not significant in study area. And the previous research results indirectly implied that the extraction results of deformation field were reasonable near the seismic focus area. Then, based on the previous research results on geological structure, regional tectonics, reverse-type earthquake rupture and PGA, through the analysis on surface deformation field, vertical PGA results and surface cover types in the study area, we could indicate that, due to the effect of terrain on refraction and reflection of seismic wave, the impact of terrain on vertical PGA exceeded that of the epicentral distance.  aPublisher supplied data  aSQ2017YFGH001475cScience and Technology Cooperation Project’ between China and Greece “Research on Coastal Infrastructure Monitoring and Evaluation System Based on Multi-source Earth Observation Technology” 3adeformation 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3ainterferometry 3alandscapes 3asubsidence 3atectonics1 aHan, Ping1 aLi, Guangxue0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2021 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.2069-2077dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-021-01377-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245018300167300001400350520047900364592002800843650002700871650001900898650002100917650002700938650001500965650001800980653002000998653002001018653001801038653003301056653002101089653001701110700002101127700002101148700002001169773010601189856008401295852000901379655001201388IND60598943120221123043258.0180702e20140331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059894312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2014.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMező, Erika10aLarge-scale synthesis of 6-deoxy-6-sulfonatomethyl glycosides and their application for novel synthesis of a heparinoid pentasaccharide trisulfonic acid of anticoagulant activity  ap. 19-29.  aMultigram-scale syntheses of three 6-deoxy-6-sulfonatomethyl α-glucosides were accomplished via reactions of the corresponding primary triflate derivatives with the lithiated ethyl methanesulfonate.

In this paper, we present a flash flood regionalization approach using machine learning algorithms to generate the flash flood regionalization map. First, the random forest algorithm is used to identify thirteen key factors of flash floods from a series of rainfall and topographic factors that have great potential to drive the occurrence of flash floods. Second, the two-stage hybrid self-organizing-map-based clustering algorithm is built to delineate the homogeneous regions of flash floods according to the identified thirteen key factors. Third, the best clustering result is selected by the clustering validity indices and it is regarded as the initial regionalization map. Last, the post-processing is implemented to obtain the final regionalization map of flash floods. A case study in the Jiangxi province of China was conducted to generate the flash flood regionalization map with eighteen homogeneous regions. The regionalization map clearly divides the historical flash flood events with different densities into different regions and it is visually satisfied. The quantitative evaluation method further confirmed that the flash flood regionalization map can provide the determinant power of 77.31% for the spatial distribution of historical flash flood events. Hence, it is a valuable option to perform the flash flood regionalization of watersheds and it is beneficial for local government in the Jiangxi province of China in future flash flood mitigation and prevention.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aflood control 3afloods 3ahybrids 3alocal government 3aquantitative analysis 3arain 3aspatial data 3atopography 3aChina 0aRegionalization 0aFlash floods 0aClustering algorithm 0aClustering validity indices 0aJiangxi province 0aChina1 aChen, Yuehong1 aZhang, Xiaoxiang1 aMa, Qiang1 aRen, Liliang0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Apr., v. 108 p.102717-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245013000175520126500305592002801570650001401598650001501612650001501627650001501642650001901657650001201676650002201688650001701710650001301727650002101740653001801761653002201779653001701801653001501818653001501833700001701848700001201865700001701877700001501894700001701909773009201926856009002018852000902108655001202117IND60733320120221122123838.0211227e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073332012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1304872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Mengmeng10aSynthesis of membrane-type graphene oxide immobilized manganese dioxide adsorbent and its adsorption behavior for lithium ion  aRecently, there has been an urgent need to develop new materials and technologies for extracting lithium ions. Herein, the membrane-type adsorbent of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) is prepared by a vacuum filtration method using graphene oxide (GO) as a binder and amino-β-cyclodextrin (amino-β-CD) as an adjuvant. The results of thermogravimetric analysis show that MnO₂ is successfully immobilized on GO layers with a content of about 24 wt%, which enabled rapid adsorb lithium ions from the ionic solution. In addition, the permeation experiment shows the membrane has specific selectivity for lithium ion transport and adsorption, which is manifested in the selectivity ratios of K⁺/Li⁺, Na⁺/Li⁺ and K⁺/Na⁺ to 2.5, 3.2 and 0.8, respectively. Adsorption experiments show that GO-β-CD/MnO₂ membrane has a high adsorption capacity for lithium ions (37.5 mg g⁻¹). The adsorption kinetic curve indicates that the lithium adsorption process is controlled by the chemical adsorption mechanism. In the enrichment experiment, the concentration of lithium ions from seawater can be enriched to 1.2 mg L⁻¹ after 100 cycles. The results suggest that the developed GO-β-CD/MnO₂ membrane could effectively extract lithium ions from seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3afiltration 3agraphene oxide 3alithium 3amanganese dioxide 3apermeability 3aseawater 3athermogravimetry 0aMembrane-type 0aManganese dioxide 0aLithium ions 0aAdsorption 0aDesorption1 aYao, Chenxue1 aSu, Yan1 aLiu, Jinglei1 aXu, Lijian1 aHou, Shifeng0 tChemosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 279 p.130487-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1304873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002700150245011500177300001600292520095400308592002801262650002001290650002501310650002201335650002101357650001301378650001301391650001101404650001601415650001201431700003001443700002401473700002601497700002901523700002801552700001701580700002701597700003601624700002901660700003401689773008901723856008601812852000901898655001201907IND4465456720221116212850.0141111e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446545672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.01.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArvizu-Flores, Aldo A.10aThermodynamic activation and structural analysis of trypsin I from Monterey sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea)  ap. 898-904.  aIn this work, we report the molecular characterisation of trypsin I (Try I) from Monterey sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea). Aspects such as thermodynamic activation parameters, molecular model and cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence allow a more in depth understanding of its activity at low temperatures. The analysis of the thermodynamic activation parameters suggests that this molecule is a cold-adapted protease. From the molecular cloning, we deduced the amino acid sequence and predicted a theoretical structural model of sardine Try I with a classical trypsin fold. Cold-adaptation of this enzyme probably comes from amino acid replacement of key residues to improve flexibility at low temperature, thus increasing kcₐₜ. The cold-adaptation of sardine Try I opens a wide range of biotechnological applications for this protease and also it is interesting from the structure function relationship point of view of serine protease proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSardinops sagax 3aamino acid sequences 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular models 3aproteins 3asardines 3aserine 3atemperature 3atrypsin1 aQuintero-Reyes, Idania E.1 aFelix-Lopez, Martha1 aIslas-Osuna, Maria A.1 aYepiz-Plascencia, Gloria1 aPacheco Aguilar, Ramon,1 aNavare, Arti1 aFernández, Facundo M.1 aVelazquez-Contreras, Enrique F.1 aSotelo-Mundo, Rogerio R.1 aCastillo-Yañez, Francisco J.0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 133, no. 3 p.898-904dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.01.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003100155245015800186520191500344592002802259650001002287650002702297650001802324650002102342650001102363650001502374650004302389650001902432650001902451650001402470650001902484650001302503650002102516650002502537650002602562650001602588653002602604653001502630653002402645653002102669653002702690653002002717700002202737700001802759700002702777700006102804700001902865700003402884773009202918856009003010852000903100655001203109IND60733320220221122123845.0211227e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073332022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1304882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlulema-Pullupaxi, Paulina10aPhotoelectrocatalytic degradation of glyphosate on titanium dioxide synthesized by sol-gel/spin-coating on boron doped diamond (TiO2/BDD) as a photoanode  aThe construction of a photoanode with several layers of titanium oxysulfate as a precursor to form titanium dioxide-TiO₂ on boron doped diamond-BDD (TiO₂/BDD), and its application for the photoelectro-degradation of glyphosate in aqueous medium are presented. The study was divided into three stages: i) optimization of the number of layers of the TiO₂ precursor to modify BDD using a novel method combining Sol-gel/Spin-Coating; ii) characterization of the TiO₂/BDD electrodes, by scanning electron microscopy-SEM, dispersive energy spectroscopy-EDX, Ray diffraction-XRD, contact angle, and electrochemical response by cyclic voltammetry using [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/⁴⁻ system; iii) degradation of glyphosate (50 mg L⁻¹) by electrochemical oxidation on BDD and photoelectrocatalysis on TiO₂/BDD in dark and UV-light conditions, at different current densities, for 5 h. The glyphosate degradation and mineralization were evaluated by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, Total Organic Carbon, Chemical Oxygen Demand and inorganic-ions concentration (NO₃⁻, PO₄³⁻, and NH₄⁺). Also, the aminomethylphosphonic acid-AMPA was quantified by HPLC, as a degradation intermediate. Using five layers of the TiO₂ precursor, in the construction of TiO₂/BDD photoanode, and a lower contact angle, greater photoelectrocatalysis against the [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/⁴⁻ redox system and better degradation of glyphosate compared to BDD without modification were achieved. The formation of TiO₂ nanoparticles (14.79 ± 3.43 nm) in anatase phase on BDD was verified by SEM and XRD. Additionally, glyphosate degradation and mineralization were 2.3 times faster by photoelectrocatalysis on TiO₂/BDD, relative to BDD, at 3 mA cm⁻² and UV-light. Thus, the presence of TiO₂ on BDD increases the rate and efficiency of glyphosate degradation with respect to electrochemical oxidation on BDD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3achemical oxygen demand 3acontact angle 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aglyphosate 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainorganic ions 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3atotal organic carbon 3aultraviolet radiation 3avoltammetry 0aPhotoelectrocatalysis 0aPhotoanode 0aBoron doped diamond 0aTitanium dioxide 0aGlyphosate degradation 0aWater treatment1 aFernández, Lenys1 aDebut, Alexis1 aSantacruz, Cristian P.1 aVillacis, William1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8653-75861 aFierro, Carola1 aEspinoza-Montero, Patricio J.0 tChemosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 278 p.130488-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1304883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245008200179300001600261520128800277592002801565650004401593650002501637650002201662650003801684650002801722650001901750650002301769650002201792650002801814650001301842653001501855653002001870653002501890653002001915653002301935700002601958700003301984700003402017700002302051700002502074700002902099700003902128773012802167856008102295852000902376655001202385IND60113643020221118001956.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011364302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.09.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Fabricia da Rocha10aAntioxidant activity of the mangiferin inclusion complex with β-cyclodextrin  ap. 129-134.  aThe aim of this study was to characterize the complex between mangiferin (MGN) with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) obtained through the co-evaporation method using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), as well as to verify the antioxidant activity of this complex by means of radical scavenging activity toward 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (RSA-DPPH), with additional analysis of solvent effects, and Oxygen Radical Antioxidant Capacity-Fluorescein (ORAC-FL) assays. The protective effects of MGN and the MGN:β-CD complex against peroxyl radical-initiated membrane lipid peroxidation were also evaluated. The analysis of the solvent effects in the DPPH method demonstrated that at amounts of organic solvents lower than the ratio 50:50 (methanol–water or ethanol–water) there is a drawback, due to the hydrophobic nature of DPPH and should not be used. The antioxidant activity of the MGN:β-CD complex was higher than in its free form, as seen by both methods. The RSA-DPPH value was twofold larger for the complex while the ORAC-FL value was fifteenfold larger. Lipid peroxidation assays showed that the MGN:β-CD complex has a protective effect on the membrane that is as effective as the positive control (Trolox).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afree radical scavengers 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid peroxidation 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3asolvents 0aMangiferin 0aβ-Cyclodextrin 0aAntioxidant activity 0aSolvent effects 0aLipid peroxidation1 aValentim, Iara Barros1 aRamones, Edgar Luís Catarí1 aTrevisan, Maria Teresa Salles1 aOlea-Azar, Claudio1 aPerez-Cruz, Fernanda1 ade Abreu, Fabiane Caxico1 aGoulart, Marília Oliveira Fonseca0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 Apr., v. 51, no. 1 p.129-134dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01344naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015100156300002000307520031000327592002800637650002300665650001700688650003000705700001200735700001700747700002000764700001500784700001300799773013500812856007400947852000901021655001201030IND60672336120221122225118.0191016e20191008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067233612DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc06678k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Shikuan12aA formal (5+1) annulation reaction from heterodimerization of two different isocyanides: stereoselective synthesis of 2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazin-2-one  ap. 12243-12246.  aA novel (5+1) annulation reaction of functionalized 2-isocyanophenyloxyacrylate and aromatic, aliphatic isocyanides has been disclosed.

A&nbsp;simple, rapid and reproducible procedure for identification of extracellular lactase is described using callus cultures of seedlings from the tested plant, hairy roots of 2.5 days old seedlings of watermelon germinating on agar plates as well as cell suspension cultures derived from callus cultures. For the determination of intracellular activities of lactase, 6-bromo-2-naphthyl-&beta;-D-galactopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-&beta;-D-galactopyranoside were used as synthetic substrates. The extracellular lactase activity was determined by evaluating the day-zone in agar medium. The enzyme from watermelon callus cultures and seedling roots, cultivated on agar plates supplemented with 6-bromo-2-naphthyl-2-bromo-&beta;-D-galactopyranoside, hydrolyzed this substrate releasing 6-bromo-naphthyl. By simultaneous coupling with hexazonium p-rosaniline or Fast Blue BB the corresponding azo dye was formed. The parallel extracellular and intracellular activities were determined in cell suspension cultures derived from callus cultures. The results show a&nbsp;43.8% intracellular and 54.2% extracellular distribution of lactase activity. The described agar plate method enables a&nbsp;rapid, simple and specific detection of plant processes of extracellular lactase. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrullus lanatus var. lanatus 3aagar 3aazo dyes 3abeta-galactosidase 3acallus 3acell suspension culture 3aculture media 3aseedlings 3awatermelons1 aMičieta, K.1 aTokhtaeva, E.1 aValšíková, M.1 aKoreňová, M.1 aBlanáriková, V.0 tZahradnictví.g, v. 31, no. 4 p.132-135dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21417x0862-867X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3806-hortsci3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245017000212300001800382506007600400520152200476592002801998506003702026650001802063650002102081650001102102650001002113650001402123650001602137650002102153650001002174650001402184650001002198650001702208650002102225650002202246650001602268650002202284650001302306650001702319650002502336650002602361650002402387650002802411650001402439650002002453700002102473700001702494700002002511700002102531700001902552700002102571700002202592700001602614700002102630700001902651700002302670700002202693773012702715856008402842852000902926655001202935IND60099637220221207111904.0141105e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009963722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2012.06.0162doi7 aPMC37788992pmcid7 a227283122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSewell, Gavin W.10aLipidomic profiling in Crohn's disease: Abnormalities in phosphatidylinositols, with preservation of ceramide, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine composition  ap. 1839-1846.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCrohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition largely affecting the terminal ileum and large bowel. A contributing cause is the failure of an adequate acute inflammatory response as a result of impaired secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages. This defective secretion arises from aberrant vesicle trafficking, misdirecting the cytokines to lysosomal degradation. Aberrant intestinal permeability is also well-established in Crohn's disease. Both the disordered vesicle trafficking and increased bowel permeability could result from abnormal lipid composition. We thus measured the sphingo- and phospholipid composition of macrophages, using mass spectrometry and stable isotope labelling approaches. Stimulation of macrophages with heat-killed Escherichia coli resulted in three main changes; a significant reduction in the amount of individual ceramide species, an altered composition of phosphatidylcholine, and an increased rate of phosphatidylcholine synthesis in macrophages. These changes were observed in macrophages from both healthy control individuals and patients with Crohn's disease. The only difference detected between control and Crohn's disease macrophages was a reduced proportion of newly-synthesised phosphatidylinositol 16:0/18:1 over a defined time period. Shotgun lipidomics analysis of macroscopically non-inflamed ileal biopsies showed a significant decrease in this same lipid species with overall preservation of sphingolipid, phospholipid and cholesterol composition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrohn disease 3aEscherichia coli 3abiopsy 3acecum 3aceramides 3acholesterol 3achronic diseases 3acolon 3acytokines 3aileum 3ainflammation 3aisotope labeling 3alipid composition 3amacrophages 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3apermeability 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylinositols 3aphosphatidylserines 3aphysiological transport 3asecretion 3astable isotopes1 aHannun, Yusuf A.1 aHan, Xianlin1 aKoster, Grielof1 aBielawski, Jacek1 aGoss, Victoria1 aSmith, Philip J.1 aRahman, Farooq Z.1 aVega, Roser1 aBloom, Stuart L.1 aWalker, Ann P.1 aPostle, Anthony D.1 aSegal, Anthony W.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2012 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.1839-1846dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009200165300001600257520115200273592002801425650001001453650001101463650001401474650001301488650001101501700001901512700001401531773011701545856007801662852000901740655001201749IND60765099720221120172746.0220419e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076509972DNAL7 a10.17221/3807-hortsci2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVlastníková, H.14aThe RAPD analysis of several cultivars of grapevine (Vitis viniferaL.) and their clones  ap. 136-139.  aNine identification RAPD markers (Moravcov&aacute; et al. 2003) were used to distinguish 24 clones and grapevine cultivars. No polymorphism was detected among all the tested clones of Chardonnay, Pinot gris and Zweigeltrebe from Pole&scaron;ovice. Pinot noir, Pinot gris, Pinot blanc and Pinot Meunier were indistinguishable within clones, they also showed the identical RAPD profile within cultivars (except discussed sample No. 26). On the other hand, Auxerrois as a relative to cultivars of Pinot group showed unique patterns and may be classified as a different cultivar. Some irregularities within the cultivars of Pinot family from Oblekovice were also found, several of them gave different results from those expected: Pinot blanc sample 26 has the RAPD profile typical of Chardonnay. A new abnormal RAPD pattern as a marker of typical Chardonnay and Pinot profiles was observed in two cases. While RAPD banding patterns could not distinguish between the known clones, they were useful for distinguishing between phenotypically similar cultivars and for assessing the origins of cultivars thought to have originated as sports. &nbsp; &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3aclones 3acultivars 3asampling 3asports1 aMoravcová, K.1 aPidra, M.0 tZahradnictví.g, v. 31, no. 4 p.136-139dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21417x0862-867X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3807-hortsci3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245013000204300001800334506007600352520065300428592002801081506003701109650001101146650000901157650001201166650002201178650001701200650002101217700002101238700002401259700002201283700002201305700002301327700002301350773013101373856007501504852000901579655001201588IND60541304120221207075559.0160821e20150128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054130412DNAL7 a10.1021/ja51151982doi7 aPMC43119742pmcid7 a255945332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Bosch, Isaac12aA “Naked” FeIII-(O22–)-CuII Species Allows for Structural and Spectroscopic Tuning of Low-Spin Heme-Peroxo-Cu Complexes  ap. 1032-1035.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHere we describe a new approach for the generation of heme-peroxo-Cu compounds, using a “naked” complex synthon, [(F₈)Feᴵᴵᴵ-(O₂²–)-Cuᴵᴵ(MeTHF)₃]⁺ (MeTHF = 2-methyltetrahydrofuran; F₈ = tetrakis(2,6-difluorophenyl)porphyrinate).

Recently, we demonstrated the presence of sialylated N-glycans using mass spectrometry in tick salivary glands and the gut. However, we proposed a host (blood) origin for these glycans and mapped the transport of sialylated molecules from the gut to the salivary glands. In this report, we performed quantitation of whole sialic acid and of metabolically incorporated sialic acid (N-azido neuraminic acid) in Ixodes ricinus tick samples. We show that the majority of sialylated molecules in the adult tick originate in the host (blood) and are not synthesized by the tick. Similar results were observed for tick cell cultures. The almost complete absence of tick sialylated molecules and the specific transport and localization of host structures into the tick salivary glands and the saliva raises many questions on the role of these molecules in the physiology and, specifically, the blood-feeding of ticks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIxodes ricinus 3aadults 3ablood 3acell culture 3aglycoproteins 3ahematophagy 3alectins 3amass spectrometry 3aneuraminic acid 3apolysaccharides 3asaliva 3asalivary glands 3asialic acid 3astaining 3aticks 0aTick 0aIxodes ricinus 0aSialic acid 0aClick chemistry 0aThiobarbituric acid assay 0aTick cell line1 aVancova, Marie1 aSterbova, Jarmila1 aBell-Sakyi, Lesley1 aGrubhoffer, Libor0 tCarbohydrate research.g2014 May 07, v. 389 p.93-99dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2014.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01776naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245005900168300001600227520060100243592002800844650001100872650002100883650001100904650001700915650002100932650002100953650001900974650002100993653001701014653002101031653000801052700001401060700002101074700001501095700001401110773015901124856008601283852000901369655001201378IND60721257220221121211646.0201224e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072125722DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2014.01157.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaiswal, C.10aImmunomodulatory effect of a-tocopherol in albino rats  ap. 133-134.  aThe present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of α- tocopherol on chlorpyrifos induced immunotoxicity and oxidative stress in experimental rats.

Therefore, such sessions are thought to provide information that can be useful for welfare assessment. Recent studies on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) validated caretakers’ ratings of dolphins’ participation during training sessions as a welfare indicator. Even though their behavior, adaptation to captive settings or relationship with humans may differ from bottlenose dolphins, many other odontocete species remain much less studied. In the present study, animals from three groups including Yangtze finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), East-Asian finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis sunameri), and bottlenose dolphins were monitored during training sessions. Four variables were recorded: a participation score rated by caretakers, the leaving rate, the amount of food eaten, and the propensity to finish the attributed food. Bottlenose dolphins participated better in sessions: they were attributed higher participation scores, departed less and finished their food more often than finless porpoises. The context of the sessions, including time of the day, season, type of session, social grouping, occurrence of unusual events or presence of visitors affected the parameters recorded during sessions in the three groups. The inter-species differences and the context-related variations of the four measured parameters should be used to adapt the schedules and techniques of training sessions for each group. Such adaptation could improve training effectiveness and the human-animal relationship. In addition, the associations among the four measured parameters and between these parameters and the animals’ displayed activity revealed the most informative parameter for each group: participation score for Yangtze finless porpoises, food intake for East-Asian finless porpoises and leaving rate for bottlenose dolphins. These parameters best reflect the motivation of the animals during sessions, and may therefore be beneficial to integrate into welfare monitoring tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeophocaena 3aTursiops truncatus 3afood intake 3ahuman-animal relations 3amotivation 3awelfare assessment 0abottlenose dolphin 0afinless porpoise 0aqualitative assessment 0atraining session 0awelfare1 aHao, Yujiang1 aWang, Ding0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2022 Jan., v. 47 p.45-58dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2021.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245014900165520173300314592002802047650002202075650001902097650001702116650001202133650001502145650001702160650001502177650002002192650002602212650002202238650001302260650001502273650001302288650002002301650002202321650001302343650001602356650002302372650001702395650002102412650002602433650001802459650001802477650001502495650001502510653002302525653002002548653000802568653001802576700001602594773011602610856008402726852000902810655001202819IND60679689220221118161506.0200210e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067968922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2019.1059952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaobin10aAgricultural utilization and vegetation establishment on saline-sodic soils using a water–salt regulation method for scheduled drip irrigation  aReclamation of saline-sodic soils for agricultural and vegetation ecological establishment is an important way to solve food and environmental problems, especially in developing countries. A water–salt regulation method using scheduled drip irrigation to control the soil matric potential (SMP) at a depth of 0.2 m immediately under drip emitters was proposed and the application effect of the method applied in field experiments was evaluated for reclamation of saline-sodic wasteland at five sites with different climates, land-use objectives, and planting patterns. A low-salinity environment was created in the whole soil profile, especially in the root zone, and the salt leaching process was divided into three stages: rapid desalination, slow desalination, and salt stabilization. The soil environment was improved with reclamation time, resulting in improved land productivity, crop yields at levels close to those in local farmland after 2–3 years, and good landscape vegetation ecosystems were created by establishment of artificial vegetation and natural germination of seeds in the soil seed bank. Soil alkalization should receive some attention during the salt leaching process because it may affect the growth of acid-loving plants. In addition, the low survival rates for salt-sensitive/non-salt tolerant landscape plants in the early reclamation period led to the creating a non-saline soil environment by adding non-saline soils into planting holes. Overall, the water–salt regulation method to control SMP immediately under scheduled drip irrigation emitters is suited for saline-sodic soils restoration, and some suggestions were proposed for its better application according to the field experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aalkalinization 3aburied seeds 3aclimate 3acrop yield 3adesalination 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3afield experimentation 3aland productivity 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aleaching 3amicroirrigation 3aornamental plants 3aplanting 3arhizosphere 3asaline sodic soils 3asaline soils 3aseed germination 3asoil matric potential 3asoil profiles 3asurvival rate 3avegetation 3awastelands 0aSaline-sodic soils 0aDrip irrigation 0aSMP 0aSalt leaching1 aKang, Yaohu0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 231 p.105995-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.1059953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012800162506011700290506007600407520138400483592002801867506003701895650001201932650002001944650001501964650001501979650001001994650001702004653003002021653004602051653002402097653002002121653004002141700001402181700001702195700001602212700001702228700001502245700001702260700001402277773015102291856008202442852000902524655001202533IND60776643520221207114701.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077664352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dilong10aAGFP-Net: Attentive geometric feature pyramid network for land cover classification using airborne multispectral LiDAR data  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAccurate land cover (LC) classification plays an important role in ecosystem protection, climate changes, and urban planning. The airborne multispectral LiDAR data are increasingly used for high-resolution and accurate LC classification tasks. However, most of the existing methods lack of the comprehensive extraction of the spatial geometric structure features, and ignore the fusion of multi-scale extracted features. In this paper, a point-wise deep learning-based method is proposed for LC classification based on airborne multispectral LiDAR data. We present a novel convolution operator to efficiently extract the spatial geometric structure features, called attentive graph geometric moments convolution (AGGM Convolution). Besides, to fuse the extracted multi-scale features, we propose a feature up-sampling module and construct a feature pyramid to integrate the features with different scales. The proposed method was evaluated using multispectral LiDAR data acquired with an airborne Teledyne Optech Titan system. In comparison with the previously developed state-of-the-art point cloud segmentation models, the proposed method behaves superiorly with an overall accuracy of 96.9% and a Kappa index of 0.950 on the test scenes. The quantitative assessments demonstrate that the proposed method performs effectively and efficiently in land cover classification tasks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aland cover 3alidar 3aspatial data 0aLand cover classification 0aAirborne multispectral LiDAR point clouds 0aAttention mechanism 0aFeature pyramid 0aGraph geometric moments convolution1 aShen, Xin1 aGuan, Haiyan1 aYu, Yongtao1 aWang, Hanyun1 aZhang, Guo1 aLi, Jonathan1 aLi, Deren0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Apr., v. 108 p.102723-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245007900171520187700250592002802127650001302155650001202168650001602180650002202196650001802218650001702236650003102253650002802284650000702312650001902319650001402338650002002352650001902372653000902391653001602400653001302416653001402429653001602443700001202459700002002471700001202491700001702503700001602520700002002536773009202556856009002648852000902738655001202747IND60733320620221122064602.0211227e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073332062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1304932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Libing10aFormation of Al30 aggregates and its correlation to the coagulation effect  aAl₃₀ is the polycation with the highest degree of polymerization and surface charge in the currently known structural aluminum species. It shows excellent coagulation performance in water treatment process, and has the characteristics of wide application range of pH and dosage. pH value is one of the most important factors affecting the aggregation and coagulation process of Al₃₀, but the influence of Al₃₀ aggregation reaction on its coagulation effect is still unclear. Therefore, this article reports the deprotonation and aggregation reaction of Al₃₀ by adjusting the basicity (B) of the solution, particularly to further understand the coagulation mechanism of Al₃₀ under different conditions. The results showed that in the base titration process, when B < 2.86 in 0.01 M Al₃₀ solution as AlT (the concentration of total Al), deprotonation and preliminary aggregation mainly occurred; when B > 2.86, the size of Al₃₀ aggregates (Al₃₀agg) increased rapidly, forming gels and gradually transforming into Al(OH)₃. In this process, in addition to the reduction of electrostatic repulsion induced by Al₃₀ deprotonation, the oligomers generated by the partial dissociation of Al₃₀ also play the role of bridging-connection. Under the experimental titration conditions, the Al₃₀agg always maintained a positive zeta potential. In addition, Al₃₀ can deprotonate and aggregate at lower pH, which is an important reason for its unique coagulation characteristics. The larger structure size of Al₃₀ also made it easy to form branched aggregates, so that it can play an effective role in a wider dosage range without destabilization of colloids. This study gives an insight in the advancement of coagulants and promotes the industrial application and commercialization of functional coagulants based on polyaluminum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acations 3acoagulation 3acommercialization 3adeprotonation 3adissociation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aindustrial applications 3apH 3apolymerization 3atitration 3awater treatment 3azeta potential 0aAl30 0aAggregation 0aBasicity 0aMechanism 0aCoagulation1 aLu, Sen1 aDemissie, Hailu1 aYue, Ye1 aJiao, Ruyuan1 aAn, Guangyu1 aWang, Dongsheng0 tChemosphere.g2021 Sept., v. 278 p.130493-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1304933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012000163300001600283520097400299592002801273650002301301650002101324650002801345650001201373650001601385650001701401650002001418650002001438650001501458650001401473650002201487650001101509650000701520650003001527650002201557650001901579650003001598653001501628653002101643653000901664653002301673700001901696700001601715700001601731700001701747773010801764856008401872852000901956655001201965IND60598943820221123021516.0180702e20140331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059894382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2014.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Nan10aCloning and characterisation of a novel neoagarotetraose-forming-β-agarase, AgWH50A from Agarivorans gilvus WH0801  ap. 147-151.  aAgWH50A, a novel β-agarase, was cloned from Agarivorans gilvus WH0801 by degenerate and nested PCR. It consists of 942 amino acids (105kDa), including a 21-amino acid signal peptide. AgWH50A shares the highest amino acid sequence homology with AgaD02 from Agarivorans sp. QM38 (53%). The recombinant agarase gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Maximum enzymatic activity (Km 5.97mg/mL and Vmax 0.781U/mg) was observed at pH 6.0 and 30°C. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Fourier transform-nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and thin-layer chromatography, we analysed the hydrolysis products and concluded that AgWH50A is a neoagarotetraose-forming β-agarase, which can cleave agarose into neoagarotetraose. This novel agarase has potential applications in the industrial production of neoagarotetraose and provides a new agarose hydrolysis model for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgarivorans gilvus 3aEscherichia coli 3aaffinity chromatography 3aagarose 3aamino acids 3abeta-agarase 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3ahydrolysis 3amagnetism 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology 3asignal peptide 3athin layer chromatography 0aβ-Agarase 0aNeoagarotetraose 0aGH50 0aAgarivorans gilvus1 aMao, Xiangzhao1 aDu, Zongjun1 aMu, Bozhong1 aWei, Dongzhi0 tCarbohydrate research.g2014 Mar. 31, v. 388 p.147-151dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2014.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245013900163300001600302500002400318500002400342520057000366650002200936650001800958650001300976650000900989650001000998650001901008650002601027650001001053650001801063650004301081650005201124650001201176700001801188700002101206700002201227700002001249700001701269700001701286700002201303700001901325773010001344852000901444856008601453655001201539IND4462258620221120035137.0111110s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446225862DNAL7 a10.1637/9607-120510-Case.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmnon, Inbar10aIsolation and Identification of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Subtype H5N1 from Emus from the Ein Gedi Oasis by the Dead Sea  ap. 499-502.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aAn avian influenza virus (AIV), A/Emu/Israel/552/2010/ (H5N1), was isolated from a dead emu that was found in the Ein Gedi oasis near the Dead Sea.

These nocturnal bugs spend most of the daylight hours aggregated with conspecifics inside crevices in roofs and walls. Around the entrances of the shelters T. infestans deposits faeces that contain chemical cues that attract conspecifics. In this work we investigated whether attraction to faeces can be modulated by experience in this insect species. First, we analyzed if the attraction of nymphs to faeces is innate or acquired through previous sensory experiences. Results show that after hatching, 1st instar nymphs are attracted to faeces even if they had never been in contact with them before, thus indicating that this attraction is innate. Second, we studied if attraction to faeces can be influenced by the presence of con-specifics. No differences were found in the attraction to faeces of nymphs released alone or in groups, suggesting that attraction to faeces is independent of the presence of other individuals. Third, we examined if the innate response to faeces of nymphs can be modulated by experience. After pre-exposing nymphs to faeces during 24h, insects were no longer attracted to faeces. Finally, by pairing the presence of faeces with an aversive mechanical disturbance, nymphs switched from attraction to avoidance of faeces. These results show that although faeces attraction has a strong innate component, it can be modulated by experience. The learning and memory capacities of triatomines have been studied only recently, and our work is the first report on the effects of experience in the aggregation context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aRhodnius prolixus 3aTriatoma infestans 3afeces 3ahatching 3ainsect physiology 3ainsects 3ainstars 3amemory 3anymphs 3aLatin America 0aAggregation 0aFaeces 0aLearning 0aPlasticity 0aTriatoma infestans1 aLorenzo-Figueiras, Alicia N.1 aMinoli, Sebastián A.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2017 Apr., v. 98 p.23-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245013500211300001600346520103300362592002801395596005501423596005501478596005501533596005501588596005501643650002501698650002401723650001401747650001301761650001801774650001101792650001301803650001601816651001801832700002301850700001901873700001801892700002301910700002401933700002101957700002201978700001702000700002302017700001702040700002602057700002102083700002102104700002002125700002302145700002402168700002202192773010302214856008302317852000902400655001202409IND60760461520221121125942.0211222e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076046152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-021-01667-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarling, Geraint A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3753-589910aCan a key boreal Calanus copepod species now complete its life-cycle in the Arctic? Evidence and implications for Arctic food-webs  ap. 333-344.  aThe changing Arctic environment is affecting zooplankton that support its abundant wildlife. We examined how these changes are influencing a key zooplankton species, Calanus finmarchicus, principally found in the North Atlantic but expatriated to the Arctic. Close to the ice-edge in the Fram Strait, we identified areas that, since the 1980s, are increasingly favourable to C. finmarchicus. Field-sampling revealed part of the population there to be capable of amassing enough reserves to overwinter. Early developmental stages were also present in early summer, suggesting successful local recruitment. This extension to suitable C. finmarchicus habitat is most likely facilitated by the long-term retreat of the ice-edge, allowing phytoplankton to bloom earlier and for longer and through higher temperatures increasing copepod developmental rates. The increased capacity for this species to complete its life-cycle and prosper in the Fram Strait can change community structure, with large consequences to regional food-webs.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/P006213/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/P006353/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/R012733/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/P006302/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/P005985/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3aCalanus finmarchicus 3acommunity structure 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3aphytoplankton 3asummer 3awildlife 3azooplankton 3aArctic region1 aFreer, Jennifer J.1 aBanas, Neil S.1 aBelcher, Anna1 aBlackwell, Mayleen1 aCastellani, Claudia1 aCook, Kathryn B.1 aCottier, Finlo R.1 aDaase, Malin1 aJohnson, Magnus L.1 aLast, Kim S.1 aLindeque, Penelope K.1 aMayor, Daniel J.1 aMitchell, Elaine1 aParry, Helen E.1 aSpeirs, Douglas C.1 aStowasser, Gabriele1 aWootton, Marianne0 tAmbio.g2022 Feb., v. 51, no. 2 p.333-344dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01667-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245020300172300001800375500001500393520131900408592002801727650001501755650001301770650001801783650002701801650001601828650001901844650001201863650001401875650001101889650002101900653001001921700001801931700001901949700002101968700002101989700002302010700002402033700002002057700002402077700002102101700002102122773012702143856008402270852000902354655001202363IND60099637720221119142425.0141105e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009963772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2012.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakamoto, Akihiko10aEnhanced biofilm formation and/or cell viability by polyamines through stimulation of response regulators UvrY and CpxR in the two-component signal transducing systems, and ribosome recycling factor  ap. 1877-1886.  a2019-12-06  aWe have reported that polyamines increase cell viability at the stationary phase of cell growth through translational stimulation of ribosome modulation factor, and SpoT and RpoZ proteins involved in the synthesis and function of ppGpp in Escherichia coli. Since biofilm formation is also involved in cell viability, we looked for proteins involved in biofilm formation and cell viability whose synthesis is stimulated by polyamines at the level of translation. It was found that the synthesis of response regulators UvrY and CpxR in the two-component signal transducing systems and ribosome recycling factor (RRF) was increased by polyamines at the level of translation. Polyamine stimulation of the synthesis of UvrY and RRF was dependent on the existence of the inefficient initiation codons UUG and GUG in uvrY and frr mRNA, respectively; and polyamine stimulation of CpxR synthesis was dependent on the existence of an unusual location of a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence in cpxR mRNA. Biofilm formation and cell viability in the absence of polyamines was increased by transformation of modified uvrY and cpxR genes, and cell viability by modified frr gene whose translation occurs effectively without polyamines. The results indicate that polyamines are necessary for both biofilm formation and cell viability.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolyamines 3aproteins 3amessenger RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 3acell growth 3acell viability 3abiofilm 3aribosomes 3acodons 3aEscherichia coli 0agenes1 aTerui, Yusuke1 aYamamoto, Taku1 aKasahara, Takuma1 aNakamura, Mizuho1 aTomitori, Hideyuki1 aYamamoto, Kaneyoshi1 aIshihama, Akira1 aMichael, Anthony J.1 aIgarashi, Kazuei1 aKashiwagi, Keiko0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2012 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.1877-1886dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01770naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245007100160300001200231520080800243592002801051650002501079650002301104650002401127650001301151650001801164650001201182700001601194700001501210700001901225773011301244856007801357852000901435655001201444IND60765100120221118233841.0220422e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510012DNAL7 a10.17221/3810-hortsci2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoliáš, J.10aMechanical resonance method for evaluation of peach fruit firmness  ap. 1-6.  aAn investigation was carried out to establish the basic relationship between mechanical resonance, firmness, chemical composition and ethylene production during the maturity time and the ripening time of peach fruit.

This great variety of forms of gender-based dimorphism suggests that sexual selection may play an important role in the diversification of some lineages. It also impacts species identification, assignment of females to described species and biodiversity assessments. Here we use DNA-sequence-based species discovery methods (the Poisson Tree Processes model with Bayesian support values, bPTP, and the Generalized Mixed Yule–Coalescent approach, GMYC, accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty) to shed light on the morphological disparity displayed in several species of neopilionid harvestmen from New Zealand. Both species delimitation analyses recovered many clades that coincide with our prior assignment of morphospecies, based solely on males, and allowed us to assign females and juveniles to these species as well as to identify putative new species and to assign some unidentified species to genera. Several genetic species, particularly Forsteropsalis inconstans and Pantopsalis cheliceroides-listeri, showed complex morphological disparity in the size and shape of the male chelicerae, but also in the general size and coloration patterns of the males. The systematic implications of our results and a possible ecological explanation for the exaggerated traits are discussed. Following our findings, the following taxonomic action is taken: Forsteropsalis nigra is considered a junior synonym of F. inconstans (new synonymy).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpiliones 3abiodiversity 3acolor 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amodels 3amorphospecies 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 3aspecies identification 3auncertainty 3aNew Zealand 0aEnantiobuninae 0aspecies delimitation 0aPantopsalis 0aForsteropsalis 0aMegalopsalis 0aMangatangi1 aVélez, Sebastián1 aGiribet, Gonzalo0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2014, v. 28, no. 6 p.590-604dCSIRO Publishingx1445-52267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS140293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007100169520147600240592002801716650003401744650001401778650002101792650001801813650001901831650001101850653001501861653001301876653001501889653000901904653003101913653000801944700002001952773011101972856008602083852000902169655001202178IND60753091720221120070053.0211106e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075309172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1229672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, Sachin13aAn improved method for galactosyl oligosaccharide characterization  aDue to beneficial effects of galactosyl oligosaccharides (GOS) on digestive and immune health, their characterization has become increasingly important. This is especially so as GOS are synthesized enzymatically and contain oligosaccharides of different sizes and linkages. High performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD) is widely used for GOS characterization. With its high resolving power, it can separate structural isomers. Here we present a significant improvement to currently used methods. Our approach combines high resolution HPAE separation on a CarboPac PA300 column with 4 µm particle size with PAD and Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) detections to provide in-depth information on GOS composition. Oligosaccharide resolution, especially in the disaccharide region, is significantly improved and can be routinely achieved. Improvement in technology to remove sodium before MS results in minimal peak dispersion, allowing GOS degrees of polymerization 2 to 6 to be identified based on mass spectra obtained from intact oligosaccharides and confirmed using fragmentation patterns observed in MS/MS data. Combining HPAE with MS led to identification of 28 oligosaccharides in a commercial GOS sample. We attempted to correlate oligosaccharide structure with observed elution behavior. To our knowledge this is first such attempt and can form a basis for a comprehensive structure vs HPAE elution behavior database.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange chromatography 3adatabases 3aoligosaccharides 3aparticle size 3apolymerization 3asodium 0aPrebiotics 0aHPAE-PAD 0aQ Exactive 0aHRAM 0aOrbitrap Mass Spectrometry 0aGOS1 aRohrer, Jeffrey0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 1184 p.122967-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1229673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010000171300001800271520106900289592002801358650001301386650001701399650001001416650002701426650002301453650001701476650002701493650001901520650002701539650002101566650003301587650002901620650002601649700002501675773012701700856008401827852000901911655001201920IND60099637820221119142621.0141105e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009963782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2012.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeshkini, Azadeh10aFoxo3a targets mitochondria during guanosine 5′-triphosphate guided erythroid differentiation  ap. 1718-1728.  aEvidence is emerging that Foxo family proteins serve as biochemical signal integrators in complex signaling networks mediating and modulating diverse cellular functions. Herein, we report that besides the well-established function of Foxo3a as a transcriptional regulator of multiple target genes in nucleus, a substantial fraction of Foxo3a translocates to mitochondria leading to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and caspase activation during erythroid differentiation mediated by guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP). In fact, non transcriptional role of Foxo3a in mitochondria was achieved through the protein–protein interaction with pro-apoptotic protein Bax and its translocation to mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, our results revealed that mitochondrial localization of Foxo3a was modulated by intracellular GTP content which is sensed by PKC signaling element. Collectively, our findings provided insight into a novel Foxo3a mechanism in leukemia cells which led to engagement of cells in the maturation pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaspases 3acytochrome c 3agenes 3aguanosine triphosphate 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasm cells 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aprotein kinase C 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aYazdanparast, Razieh0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2012 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.1718-1728dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007500164300001500239520129700254592002801551650001501579650001001594650001601604650001301620650000901633650002101642650000901663650001401672650001101686650001201697651001001709653001001719653001701729653001801746653002201764653001601786700001901802700002001821773012701841856008101968852000902049655001202058IND60113643620221118001952.0190318e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011364362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadam, Swati10aOptimization of process parameters for continuous kheer-making machine  ap. 94-103.  aIf rice is cooked in milk, starch–milk reaction results into a thick product, which is very popular in India known as kheer. Conventionally, kheer is prepared by cooking rice in milk in an open pan over low fire followed by addition of sugar toward the end. The present investigation aims to optimize the process parameters (operating pressure and cooking time) for designing the pressurized cooking section of a continuous kheer-making machine. Sensory trials of kheer prepared conventionally and using pressurized methods were carried out and the data was analyzed using Fuzzy Logic. Sensory results of open-pan samples indicated that there is a small range of Whiteness Index (WI) and Hardness (H) values that is desirable in kheer. An Artificial Neural Network-Genetic Algorithm (ANN-GA) model was developed to further optimize the operating parameters to result in a product that would have the desired color and texture observed in kheer prepared conventionally. The developed ANN-GA model was successful in providing with input conditions leading to desired WI and H values. Finally, from the set of optimal input conditions, operating pressure of 0.27 MPa and cooking time of 7.5 min was chosen for designing the pressurized cooking section of the continuous kheer-making machine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acolor 3afuzzy logic 3ahardness 3amilk 3apressure cooking 3arice 3arice milk 3asugars 3atexture 3aIndia 0aKheer 0aOptimization 0aHybrid ANN-GA 0aPenalty functions 0aFuzzy Logic1 aGulati, Tushar1 aDatta, Ashis K.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 Apr., v. 51, no. 1 p.94-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009200170300001800262520115800280592002801438650001601466650001801482650001401500650001401514650002101528650001901549650002301568650001401591650001001605650001901615650001701634650001101651650002101662650000901683650002101692650001301713650002401726650001901750650003101769650002901800700002101829700002001850700001701870700001701887700001601904700002101920700001801941700001901959773012701978856008402105852000902189655001202198IND60099637920221119142355.0141105e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009963792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2012.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevkota, Sushil10aEi24-deficiency attenuates protein kinase Cα signaling and skin carcinogenesis in mice  ap. 1887-1896.  aEtoposide-induced gene 24 (Ei24) is a p53 target gene that inhibits growth, induces apoptosis and autophagy, as well as suppresses breast cancer. To evaluate the role of Ei24 in in vivo tumorigenesis, we generated an Ei24-deficient mouse model. Here, we report that, although Ei24 homozygous knockout mice are embryonic lethal, Ei24 heterozygous null mice are attenuated to DMBA/TPA-induced carcinogenesis with regard to the number and size of tumors but not the incidence. Ei24 contains a functional consensus motif, named as an R motif that is highly analogous to amino acids 105–110 of RINCK1, an E3 ligase for protein kinase C (PKC) proteins. We found that Ei24 stabilizes PKCαvia RINCK degradation and competition with RINCK for binding with the C1a domain of PKCα. We also found that Ei24 contributes to PKCα-mediated transactivation of EGFR by promoting PKCα membrane localization and interaction with EGFR. Finally, using Oncomine database we show that Ei24 and EGFR are upregulated in some subsets of human HNSCC. These results suggest that Ei24 is a regulator of the RINCK1-PKCα-EGFR signaling pathway in the development of skin-cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3aconsensus sequence 3adatabases 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3aknockout mutants 3amice 3aprotein kinase C 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3askin neoplasms 3atranscriptional activation 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aSung, Young Hoon1 aChoi, Jung Min,1 aLee, Jaehoon1 aHa, Na Young1 aKim, Hyunki1 aCho, Byoung Chul1 aSong, Jaewhan1 aLee, Han-Woong0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2012 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.1887-1896dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.06.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014600169506011700315506007600432520131100508592002801819506003701847650001901884650002901903650001701932650002001949650001001969650002001979650001101999650001002010650001702020650002902037650001002066653002102076653001502097653001502112653001802127653002702145653001902172653001002191700003302201700002202234700002102256700002102277700002102298773015102319856008202470961001202552852000902564655001202573IND60776643920221207102538.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077664392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattarai, Rajeev10aEstimating species-specific leaf area index and basal area using optical and SAR remote sensing data in Acadian mixed spruce-fir forests, USA  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study combined Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 multispectral, and site variable datasets to model leaf area index (LAI) and basal area per ha (BAPH) of two economically important tree species in Northeast, USA; red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.; RS), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.)

The results showed that RF outperformed MLP by reducing the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) by 0.01 and 0.06 for LAI and BAPH, respectively. The final variables selected for modeling of both LAI and BAPH indicated the superiority of Sentinel-2 variables over the Sentinel-1 SAR with minor contributions of site variables (mainly elevation). The red-edge spectral vegetation indices played a significant role in both LAI and BAPH estimation. We attained the lowest nRMSEs of 0.12, and 0.16 for the final LAI model of RS, and BF, respectively using Sentinel-2 and site variables. The lowest nRMSE for both RS and BF BAPH models was 0.12. As RS and BF are the primary host species for a cyclically occurring and most destructive pest of the region, eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana; SBW), these estimations will be useful to evaluate SBW dynamics in the region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAbies balsamea 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aPicea rubens 3adata collection 3ahosts 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3apests 3aspatial data 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atrees 0aForest inventory 0aRed spruce 0aBalsam fir 0aRandom Forest 0aMulti-Layer Perceptron 0aRemote sensing 0aMaine1 aRahimzadeh-Bajgiran, Parinaz1 aWeiskittel, Aaron1 aHomayouni, Saeid1 aGara, Tawanda W.1 aHanavan, Ryan P.0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Apr., v. 108 p.102727-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027273Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010400158300002200262520094600284592002801230650002201258650003701280650002801317650001001345650001501355650001201370650001801382700001701400700001601417700001501433700001301448700001701461700001801478773012701496856007401623852000901697655001201706IND60641300220221122004500.0190505e20161122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064130022DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21961f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Dongmei10aImproved performance of co-sputtered Ni–Ti oxide films for all-solid-state electrochromic devices  ap. 111148-111160.  aThin films of Ni–Ti oxide were co-sputtered by reactive direct current magnetron sputtering and their structures, morphologies, and compositions were investigated by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy. Their electrochromic (EC) performances were studied using cyclic voltammetry, alternating current impedance and optical transmittance measurements. The proper addition of Ti helps the films achieve excellent EC behavior, including the stable coloration–bleaching cycles, high optical transmittance modulation (∼78%), great coloration efficiency (96 cm² C⁻¹) and low alternating current impedance. Finally, the multiple-layer stacks ITO/NiOₓ:Ti/PVB(Li⁺)/WO₃/ITO were laminated based on the optimization of NiOₓ:Ti single layers. A large optical contrast (∼60%), a fast response time (3.2 and 4.4 s) and a good durability were obtained for the all-solid-state full EC device.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3acolor 3adurability 3alithium 3atransmittance1 aWang, Wenwen1 aDong, Guobo1 aZhang, Fan1 aYu, Hang1 aHe, Yingchun1 aDiao, Xungang0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 22, v. 6, no. 112 p.111148-111160dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra21961f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009700170520193200267592002802199650002002227650001802247650001302265650001402278650002302292650001802315650001702333650001602350650002102366650001302387650001502400650001102415650001202426650001202438650002502450650002102475651003702496653002102533653001802554653002402572653000802596700002102604700002502625700002602650700002702676700002402703700001702727700002402744700003102768773011602799856008202915852000902997655001203006IND60679689820221118161714.0200210e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067968982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1124222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManya, Mboni Henry10aAntimalarial herbal remedies of Bukavu and Uvira areas in DR Congo: An ethnobotanical survey  aThe main objective of the present study was to collect and gather information on herbal remedies traditionally used for the treatment of malaria in Bukavu and Uvira, two towns of the South Kivu province in DRC.Direct interview with field enquiries allowed collecting ethnobotanical data; for each plant, a specimen was harvested in the presence of the interviewed traditional healers (THs). The recorded information included vernacular names, morphological parts of plants, methods of preparation and administration of remedies, dosage and treatment duration. Plants were identified with the help of botanists in the herbaria of INERA/KIPOPO (DRC) and the Botanic Garden of Meise (Belgium), where voucher specimens have been deposited. The results were analysed and discussed in the context of previous published data.Interviewees cited 45 plant species belonging to 41 genera and 21 families used for the treatment of malaria. These plants are used in the preparation of 52 recipes, including 25 multi-herbal recipes and 27 mono-herbal recipes. Apart of Artemisia annua L. (Asteraceae; % Citation frequency = 34%) and Carica papaya L. (Caricaceae; % Citation frequency = 34%), the study has highlighted that the most represented families are Asteraceae with 12 species (26%), followed by Fabaceae with 7 species (16%) and Rubiaceae with 4 species (9%). For a majority of plants, herbal medicines are prepared from the leaves in the form of decoction and administered by oral route.Literature data indicate that part of cited species are already known (38%) and/or studied (30%) for antimalarial properties, which gives credit to the experience of Bukavu and Uvira interviewees and some level of confidence on collected information. The highly cited plants should be investigated in details for the isolation and identification of active ingredients, a contribution to the discovery of new possibly effective antimalarials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia annua 3aCarica papaya 3aFabaceae 3aRubiaceae 3aactive ingredients 3aantimalarials 3acommon names 3aethnobotany 3aherbal medicines 3aherbaria 3ainterviews 3aleaves 3amalaria 3asurveys 3atraditional medicine 3atype collections 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 0aMedicinal plants 0aEthnomedicine 0aSouth Kivu province 0aDRC1 aKeymeulen, Flore1 aNgezahayo, Jérémie1 aBakari, Amuri Salvius1 aKalonda, Mutombo Emery1 aKahumba, Byanga Joh1 aDuez, Pierre1 aStévigny, Caroline1 aLumbu, Simbi Jean-Baptiste0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 249 p.112422-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1124223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005900144245013800203300002000341520114400361592002801505650001401533650001501547650001901562650002201581650001201603650002201615650002201637650001101659650001401670653002401684653002101708653003101729653003201760653003401792700001501826700001801841700001701859700002001876700001901896773014201915856007902057852000902136655001202145IND60614666520221122005650.0181020e20180827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061466652DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b092562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jun-chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7530-859010aMultiple Linkage Modification of Lithium-Rich Layered Oxide Li₁.₂Mn₀.₅₄Ni₀.₁₃Co₀.₁₃O₂ for Lithium Ion Battery  ap. 31324-31329.  aA multiple linkage modification (MLM) method was investigated to comprehensively improve the properties of lithium-rich layered oxides. MLM Li₁.₂Mn₀.₅₄Ni₀.₁₃Co₀.₁₃O₂ was successfully synthesized via continuous and appropriate heat treatment. The synthesized Li₁.₂Mn₀.₅₄Ni₀.₁₃Co₀.₁₃O₂ particles were coated with a Li₂ZrO₃ layer and doped with Zr⁴⁺ by using a Zr compound as the MLM reagent. The Li₂ZrO₃ coating layer could protect materials from the corrosion of hydrogen fluoride, and the structure of the base materials was stabilized due to Zr⁴⁺ doping. In addition, the formation of Li₂ZrO₃ captured inactive residual lithium on the surface and absorbed lithium of host materials, thereby leading to the reduction in the Li/M ratio of materials and promoting the first-cycle Coulombic efficiency. The MLM material delivered the highest initial cycle Coulombic efficiency (∼85%), the best cycle and rate performance among bare and ZrO₂-coated particles. These results indicate that MLM is an important technique for improving the performance of electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrosion 3aelectrodes 3aheat treatment 3ahydrofluoric acid 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amaterials science 3aoxides 3azirconium 0alithium ion battery 0acathode material 0alithium-rich layered oxide 0aelectrochemical performance 0amultiple linkage modification1 aYang, Zhuo1 aWang, Peng-bo1 aTang, Lin-bo1 aAn, Chang-sheng1 aHe, Zhen-jiang0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Aug. 27, v. 10, no. 37 p.31324-31329dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b092563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01539naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017100158300002000329520045300349592002800802650001300830650001200843650002000855650001300875700001700888700001800905700001300923700001700936700001200953700001800965773013500983856007401118852000901192655001201201IND60672336920221122225132.0191016e20191008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067233692DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc07133d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xi-Meng10aUnravelling a general mechanism of converting ionic B/N complexes into neutral B/N analogues of alkanes: Hᵟ⁺⋯Hᵟ– dihydrogen bonding assisted dehydrogenation  ap. 12239-12242.  aLong-sought mechanisms for the conversion of diammoniate of diborane ([NH₃BH₂NH₃]⁺[BH₄]⁻) into NH₃BH₃ and [NH₂BH₂]ₙ as well as ammonium aminodiborane ([NH₄]⁺[BH₃NH₂BH₃]⁻) into a butane analogue, NH₃BH₂NH₂BH₃, have been elucidated on the basis of extensive experimental and theoretical studies.

However, the interactions controlling the geometry at metal centers remain often elusive. In this study, the coordination properties toward copper ionsCuᴵᴵ or Cuᴵof a geometrically constrained glycoligand centered on a sugar scaffold were compared with those of an analogous ligand built on an unconstrained alkyl chain. The sugar-centered ligand was shown to be more preorganized for Cuᴵᴵ coordination than its open-chain analogue, with an unusual additional stabilization of the Cuᴵ redox state. This preference for Cuᴵ was suggested to arise from geometric constraints favoring an optimized folding of the glycoligand minimizing steric repulsions. In other words, the Cuᴵ d¹⁰ species is stabilized by valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR). This idea was rationalized by a theoretical noncovalent interactions (NCI) analysis. The cumulative effects of weak forces were shown to create an efficient buckle as in a hook-and-loop fastener, and fine structural features within the glycoligand reduce repulsive interactions for the Cuᴵ state. This study emphasizes that monosaccharide platforms are appropriate ligand backbones for a delicate geometric control at the metal center, with a network of weak interactions within the ligand. This structuration availing in glycoligands makes them attractive for metallic entasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3ageometry 3aligands 3asugars1 aCisnetti, Federico1 aGillet, Natacha1 aGuillot, Régis1 aAumont-Nicaise, Magali1 aPiquemal, Jean-Philip1 aDesmadril, Michel1 aLambert, F.q(François),1 aPolicar, Clotilde0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Jan. 28, v. 137, no. 3 p.1141-1146dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja510259p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013800172300001200310520216000322592002802482650002402510650002302534650001102557650000902568650003002577650001902607650002202626650001202648650001102660650001002671650001802681650001602699651001102715653003602726653001802762653001502780653001702795700002402812700001702836773010702853856008702960852000903047655001203056IND60558369020221120075754.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055836902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieterse, Welma10aDo thermal tolerances and rapid thermal responses contribute to the invasion potential of Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera: Tephritidae)?  ap. 1-6.  aBactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae) has shown remarkable range expansion over the past 10years and invaded several new continents including Africa. Here we report results of a detailed assessment of acute high and low temperature survival ability and the plasticity thereof, to test the hypothesis that traits of the thermal niche have contributed to the species’ invasion ability. We also assess life-stage-related variation of thermal tolerances to determine potential stage-related environmental sensitivity. The temperatures at which c. 20% of the population survived of B. dorsalis were determined to be −6.5°C and 42.7°C, respectively, when using 2h exposures. Further, four life stages of B. dorsalis (egg, 3rd instar larvae, pupae and adults) were exposed to high and low discriminating temperatures to compare their thermal survival rates. The egg stage was found to be the most resistant life stage to both high and low temperatures, since 44±2.3% survived the low and 60±4.2% survived the high discriminating temperature treatments respectively. Finally, the potential for adult hardening responses to mediate tolerance of extremes was also considered using a diverse range of acute conditions (using 2h exposures to 15°C, 10°C and 5°C and 30°C, 35°C, 37°C and 39°C as hardening temperatures, and some treatments with and without recovery periods between hardening and discriminating temperature treatment). These showed that although some significant hardening responses could be detected in certain treatments (e.g. after exposure to 37°C and 39°C), the magnitude of this plasticity was generally low compared to two other wide-spread and more geographically-range-restricted con-familial species, Ceratitis capitata and C. rosa. In other words, Bactrocera dorsalis adults were unable to rapidly heat- or cold-harden to the same extent as the other Ceratitis species examined to date. These results suggest a narrower thermal niche in B. dorsalis compared to these Ceratitis species – in both basal and plastic terms – and suggests that its geographic distribution might be more restricted in consequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aCeratitis capitata 3aadults 3aeggs 3ageographical distribution 3aheat tolerance 3ainsect physiology 3ainstars 3alarvae 3apupae 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3aAfrica 0aEnvironmental stress resistance 0aNiche breadth 0aAdaptation 0aRange limits1 aTerblanche, John S.1 aAddison, Pia0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2017 Apr., v. 98 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001900163245009700182300001800279500001500297520136600312592002801678650002801706650001601734650000901750650002901759650001401788650001701802650001001819650002301829650001101852650002101863650001701884650001101901650002701912650002301939650003301962650002701995650003002022650003102052650001502083650001402098650005602112650002902168650004202197650003802239650003902277650005802316653001502374653000802389653002602397653000902423653002602432700001602458700001502474700001702489700001502506700001202521773011602533852000902649856008202658655001202740IND4462271520221122032850.0160907e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446227152DNAL7 a217707772pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-02-11-00542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancki, M.

Resistance in wheat to Stagonospora nodorum is complex, whereby genes for seedling, flag leaf, and glume resistance are independent. The aims of this study were to identify alternative genes for flag leaf resistance, to compare and contrast with known quantitative trait loci (QTL) for SNB resistance, and to determine the potential role of host-specific toxins for SNB QTL. Novel QTL for flag leaf resistance were identified on chromosome 2AS inherited from winter wheat parent ‘P92201D5’ and chromosome 1BS from spring wheat parent ‘EGA Blanco’. The chromosomal map position of markers associated with QTL on 1BS and 2AS indicated that they were unlikely to be associated with known host–toxin insensitivity loci. A QTL on chromosome 5BL inherited from EGA Blanco had highly significant association with markers fcp001 and fcp620 based on disease evaluation in 2007 and, therefore, is likely to be associated with Tsn1-ToxA insensitivity for flag leaf resistance. However, fcp001 and fcp620 were not associated with a QTL detected based on disease evaluation in 2008, indicating two linked QTL for flag leaf resistance with multiple genes residing on 5BL. This study identified novel QTL and their effects in controlling flag leaf SNB resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative trait loci 3aleaf blotch 3aloci 3aParastagonospora nodorum 3aseedlings 3aspring wheat 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3atoxins 3ahost specificity 3awinter wheat 3aleaves 2aAscomycotaxphysiology 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aMycotoxins 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Immunityxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aSeedlingsxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aTriticumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 0apleiotropy 0aSSR 0aLeptosphaeria nodorum 0aDArT 0aPhaeosphaeria nodorum1 aShankar, M.1 aWalker, E.1 aLoughman, R.1 aGolzar, H.1 aOhm, H.0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Nov., v. 101, no. 11 p.1278-1284dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-02-11-00543Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02610naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245031200164300001600476520110700492592002801599650001801627650002201645650001301667650004401680650001401724650001501738650001301753650002201766650001101788650001401799653004101813653003101854653002101885653001601906653001701922700002501939773015001964856007702114852000902191655001202200IND60521928120221120054332.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052192812DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-02202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaukorat, Thomas10aN,N′,N′-Trimethylethylendiamin-substituierte Phosphor(III)-Verbindungen und deren Oxidation zu Derivaten mit tetra- und pentakoordiniertem Phosphor / N,N′,N′-Trim ethylethylenediamine-Substituted Phosphorus(III) Com pounds and their Oxidation to Derivatives with Four-and Five-Coordinated Phosphorus  ap. 275-283.  aA study was made of the intramolecular donor-acceptor interaction in N,N′,N′-trimethylethylenediamine- substituted phosphorus compounds, involving λ³-, λ⁴- and λ⁵-phosphorus atoms, as a function of the nature of the substituents at phosphorus. The reaction of N-trimethylsilyl-N,N′,N′-trimethylethylenediamine (1) with (PrⁱO)₂PCl furnished the acyclic, trimethylethylenediamine-substituted phosphorus(III) compound 4. There is no NMR spectroscopic evidence for an intramolecular donor-acceptor interaction between the phosphorus atom and the nitrogen atom of the dimethylamino group in 4. The oxidation of the trivalent phosphorus atom in 4 and in the related compound 5 by sulfur, selenium, tetrachloroo- benzoquinone, and hexafluoroacetone led to the corresponding λ⁴P compounds 6 - 9 and to the λ⁵P compounds 10 and 11. No intramolecular donor-acceptor interaction could be detected in any of these products. There was no reaction between 5 and elemental tellurium.

Therefore, the objectives of this experiment were to evaluate two levels of wheat straw (WS) in conventional and pelleted TMR on feed sorting behavior, rumen morphometry, the thickness of stratum corneum (SC), and color of reticulorumen mucosa. Thirty-two Beetle male goats (8 goats/treatment) were assigned to one of the four treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement: CTMR15 and CTMR 25 (conventional TMR containing 15 and 25 % WS, respectively), the PTMR15 and PTMR25 (pelleted TMR containing 15 and 25 % WS, respectively). In PTMR, the WS was ground to 8 mm and then pelleted. Feed sorting behavior of goats fed conventional TMR was evaluated twice weekly using Penn State Particle Separator (PSPS). At the end of the experiment, goats (n = 8/treatment) were slaughtered and rumen tissues preserved for further rumen morphometric examination. The CTMR25 fed goats consumed more medium (< 19,> 8 mm) and short (> 1.18) particles. There was a significant interaction (P < 0.05) between physical form (PF) of the diet and straw level (SL) for papillae length (PL), papillae density (PD), and surface area. The PL was greater (P < 0.05) in PTMR15 and PTMR25 compared with CTMR15 and CTMR25. Additionally, PD and surface area were higher (P < 0.05) in PTMR15 than the rest of the treatments. However, the papillae width (PW) was not affected (P> 0.05) by the PF or the SL in the diet. The thickness of stratum corneum (SC) (18.55 μm) was highest (P < 0.05) in the PTMR15 compared with the PTMR25, CTMR15, and CTMR25. Lightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*) values for reticulorumen mucosa color were greater (P < 0.05) in CTMR15 and CTMR25 than PTMR25 and PTMR15. In conclusion, fattening goats fed on conventional TMR selected for medium and short fiber particles. Feeding PTMR15 resulted in a greater PL, PD; however, a thickened SC and darker mucosa color of rumen and reticulum was also observed in goats fed on pelleted TMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3adiet 3agoats 3amales 3amorphometry 3amucosa 3aresearch 3areticulum 3arumen 3asurface area 3awheat straw 0aPapillae length 0aPapillae width 0aPelleted 0aRumen mucosa color 0aStratum corneum1 aRashid, Muhammad Afzal1 aYousaf, Muhammad Shahbaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1106-62891 aNaveed, Saima1 aJaved, Khalid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7610-99671 aNauman, Kashif1 aRehman, Habib Ur0 tSmall ruminant research.g2021 Mar., v. 196 p.106316-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2021.1063163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011700169300001400286520122600300592002801526650002201554650001501576650001501591650001301606650003501619650002001654650001001674650001301684650001101697650001101708650001701719650003301736650002301769650001101792650001401803650003701817650001601854653002001870653002601890653002101916653002001937653002301957653001301980700001601993700001502009700002002024700001802044773009802062856008502160852000902245655001202254IND60546494920221118145726.0160903e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054649492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubhan, Fazle14aThe enhanced adsorption of sulfur compounds onto mesoporous Ni-AlKIT-6 sorbent, equilibrium and kinetic analysis  ap. 82-91.  aHigh performance nickel supported on mesoporous AlKIT-6 (Si/Al=15, 25, 50, 100) sorbents were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) with ultrasonic aid for adsorptive desulfurization of commercial diesel and simulated fuels. The sorbents were characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption, XRD, NH3-TPD, Py-FT-IR, HRTEM, SEM and atomic absorption spectroscopy techniques. The analysis results confirmed that Aluminum atoms entered the framework and 20%Ni-AlKIT-6(15) can still retain three dimensional structure of AlKIT-6(15) and Ni is highly dispersed in the support. The kinetic pseudo second-order model and Langmuir isotherm are shown to exhibits the best fits of experimental data for the adsorption of thiophene (T), benzothiophene (BT) and dibenzothiophene (DBT) over AlKIT-6 and 5–30%Ni-AlKIT-6. Intraparticle diffusion and steric hindrance were the rate controlling step of the adsorption of T and DBT over AlKIT-6(15) and 20%Ni-AlKIT-6(15) as verified through the intraparticle diffusion model. The characterization of regenerated 20%Ni-AlKIT-6(15) revealed that three-dimensional cubic Ia3d symmetric structure was maintained in the sorbent after 6 successive desulfurization–regeneration cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3adesulfurization 3afuels 3akinetics 3amodels 3anickel 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asulfur 3athiophene 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrasonics 0aDesulfurization 0aMesoporous Ni-AlKIT-6 0aLewis acid sites 0aSimulated fuels 0aIsotherm equations 0aKinetics1 aYan, Zifeng1 aPeng, Peng1 aIkram, Muhammad1 aRehman, Sadia0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 270 p.82-91dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.01.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245005500169300001600224520165600240592002801896650001401924650002401938650001801962650001801980650002401998650001802022650001502040650002202055700002302077700001302100773011902113856008302232852000902315655001202324IND60723169120221119210407.0211030e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072316912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2020.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Andrew C.A.10aFood security and nutrition- a systematic approach  ap. 738-745.  aAs highlighted in the FAO definition, nutritional quality is an important aspect of food security which has not been thoroughly addressed to date. There is an urgent need to measure the ability of alternative proteins to replace or supplement traditional sources in terms of both quality and quantity. Protein quality scores such as PDCAAS or DIAAS are available as quantitative measures of protein quality, incorporating both the digestibility of the protein and its content of indispensable amino acids.This paper addresses the challenge of framing nutritional security in quantitative terms. The mass consumption of key protein-containing foods in Singapore was plotted against their respective PDCAAS scores, giving a snapshot of the protein quality profile for these major food types. For the purpose of analysis, protein quality was classified into four ranges in terms of PDCAAS values: >1, 0.8–1.0, 0.6 to 0.8 and < 0.6. A scaffold-based approach is proposed as a means to enhance consumer acceptance, and thus the demand and production of novel foods.The plot of mass of protein consumed vs protein quality provides an estimate of the nutritional shortfall for the different protein quality ranges, which can be supplemented by alternative proteins. The use of scaffolds in food product development offers benefits such as protein structuring, combining different food components and creating nutritional equivalents of traditional food products, all of which increase the level of consumer acceptance. Existing methods to make tissue engineering scaffolds can potentially be scaled up to fulfil the requirements for this new application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSingapore 3aconsumer acceptance 3adigestibility 3afood security 3aproduct development 3aprotein value 3atechnology 3atraditional foods1 aTai, Benjamin C.U.1 aDu, Chan0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 Mar., v. 109 p.738-745dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245008800178300001600266500002000282520173300302592002802035650005002063650000902113650001602122650001502138650001502153650001502168650002302183650001002206651001502216700002402231773013902255856009102394852000902485655001202494IND60587713220221120150025.0180117e199411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058771322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1994.tb00494.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Charles B.10aGround Water Monitoring Statistics Update: Part II: Nonparametric Prediction Limits  ap. 159-175.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNonparametric prediction limits can be useful statistical tools for ground water monitoring at facilities regulated under RCRA Subtitle C. Subtitle D. and similar regulations. New, exact tables arc presented for both “1 of m” plans (m chances to gel one observation inbounds at each of r monitoring wells to avoid a statistically significant increase) and “California” plans (first or all of the next m‐1 observations inbounds at each well). The tables provide per‐constituent significance levels (false positive rates) as a function of the background sample size n. m. r, the prediction limit (the largest or the next to largest, background observation), and the confirmatory resampling plan selected. When used in a monitoring program, future observations from several wells are compared with a prediction limit obtained from a common background sample. The table significance levels therefore depend critically on having IID (independent and identically distributed) observations. In particular, the false positive rate computations are not valid, and the procedures should not be used, with constituents whose measurements exhibit inherent spatial or systematic temporal variability. Recent U.S. EPA guidance explicitly encourages controlling facility‐wide false positive rates over both constituents and wells. Nonparametric prediction limits, particularly with California resampling plans, will have greater difficulty in meeting the new. lower per‐constituent false positive rate goals than previous ones, especially if many constituents are involved. Nonetheless, nonparametric prediction limits remain superior to other commonly used procedures for dealing with data with high proportions of nondctects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3agels 3agroundwater 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3astatistics 3atemporal variation 3awells 3aCalifornia1 aMcNichols, Roger J.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1994 Nov., v. 14, no. 4 p.159-175dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl49783x1069-36297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1994.tb00494.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245012200154500002000276520216700296592002802463596005902491596006102550596005902611650002402670650001102694650001502705650002302720650002502743650001302768650001202781650002002793650001902813650001702832650001902849650001502868651001002883700001602893700005202909700001302961700001902974773012302993856007203116852000903188655001203197IND60743181820221117084427.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074318182DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.23412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aGains or losses? A quantitative estimation of environmental and economic effects of an ecological compensation policy  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEcological compensation is an innovative and effective tool to explore the coordinated development of socioeconomic prosperity and ecological protection, especially for a watershed crossing different regions. It converts the externalities of ecosystem services into practical financial incentives for local stakeholders. This empirical study applies a quantitative policy evaluation approach to evaluate the environmental and economic effects of an ecological compensation policy, using the paddy land–to–dry land (PLDL) program implemented in China’s Miyun Reservoir watershed as an example. The study is based on responses to a 2017 questionnaire regarding agricultural production inputs and outputs administered to 269 households in Hebei Province, where the PLDL program has been operational for over 10 yr. The results show that the program has reduced nitrogen usage by 24% on average in 2017 and decreased the total nitrogen emission load by 16.98 tons for the entire case area, which accounts for approximately 18.6% of the total nitrogen load reduction of the Miyun Reservoir basin. However, the upstream households involved in this program have experienced agricultural income losses higher than that allowed for by the current compensation criterion. Therefore, this paper discusses the factors that should be considered in the process of determining ecological compensation criteria. In particular, the paper proposes a differential compensation scheme based on the environmental effect at the individual level to avoid a standard payment for all households irrespective of their different contributions. This differential compensation payment scheme facilitates the fair treatment of environmental contributors and maximizes environmental benefits through an equitable allocation of limited ecological compensation funds. This study serves as a theoretical and practical reference for further improvement of the current ecological compensation policy in China. The study also sheds light on practices for estimating ecological compensation criteria and formulating ecological compensation policies for other regions or countries in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a71774151cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a5171102058cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41671526cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aagricultural income 3abasins 3aecosystems 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental impact 3anitrogen 3apaddies 3apolicy analysis 3aquestionnaires 3astakeholders 3atotal nitrogen 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aHong, Jiayu1 aWu, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4688-01571 aYang, Yu1 aDong, Congcong0 tEcological applications.g2021 July, v. 31, no. 5 p.e02341-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.23413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011900169300001800288520179900306592002802105650002102133650002602154650001302180650001602193650001502209650002002224650001102244650002602255650001502281650001402296650002602310650001902336650001902355650001402374650001402388650001302402700002702415700002302442700002102465700002202486700001802508773011202526856008602638852000902724655001202733IND60579908620221119115023.0170905e20170905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057990862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b010252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharaha, Uraib10aUsing Infrared Spectroscopy and Multivariate Analysis to Detect Antibiotics’ Resistant Escherichia coli Bacteria  ap. 8782-8790.  aBacterial pathogens are one of the primary causes of human morbidity worldwide. Historically, antibiotics have been highly effective against most bacterial pathogens; however, the increasing resistance of bacteria to a broad spectrum of commonly used antibiotics has become a global health-care problem. Early and rapid determination of bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics has become essential in many clinical settings and, sometimes, can save lives. Currently classical procedures require at least 48 h for determining bacterial susceptibility, which can constitute a life-threatening delay for effective treatment. Infrared (IR) microscopy is a rapid and inexpensive technique, which has been used successfully for the detection and identification of various biological samples; nonetheless, its true potential in routine clinical diagnosis has not yet been established. In this study, we evaluated the potential of this technique for rapid identification of bacterial susceptibility to specific antibiotics based on the IR spectra of the bacteria. IR spectroscopy was conducted on bacterial colonies, obtained after 24 h culture from patients’ samples. An IR microscope was utilized, and a computational classification method was developed to analyze the IR spectra by novel pattern-recognition and statistical tools, to determine E. coli susceptibility within a few minutes to different antibiotics, gentamicin, ceftazidime, nitrofurantoin, nalidixic acid, ofloxacin. Our results show that it was possible to classify the tested bacteria into sensitive and resistant types, with success rates as high as 85% for a number of examined antibiotics. These promising results open the potential of this technique for faster determination of bacterial susceptibility to certain antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3aceftazidime 3agentamicin 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amicroscopy 3amorbidity 3amultivariate analysis 3analidixic acid 3anitrofurantoin 3aofloxacin 3apathogens 3apatients1 aRodriguez-Diaz, Eladio1 aRiesenberg, Klaris1 aBigio, Irving J.1 aHuleihel, Mahmoud1 aSalman, Ahmad0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Sept. 05, v. 89, no. 17 p.8782-8790dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.7b010253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245015900174300001800333520148200351592002801833650002301861650002201884650001701906650001801923650003601941650002501977650001402002650002202016650001902038650001002057650001802067650001902085650001802104650001802122650002002140650003202160650002102192700001902213700002502232700006402257773011802321856008302439852000902522655001202531IND60654186720221120104407.0190723e20190702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065418672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.9b004672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKostenko, Anastasiia10aKinetic Characterization of the C–H Activation Step for the Lipoxygenase from the Pathogenic Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae: Impact of N-Linked Glycosylation  ap. 3193-3203.  aLipoxygenases from pathogenic fungi belong to the lipoxygenase family of enzymes, which catalyze C–H activation of polyunsaturated fatty acids to form a diverse set of cell-signaling hydroperoxides. While the lipoxygenase catalytic domains are structurally and functionally similar, these fungal enzymes are decorated with N-linked glycans. The impact of N-linked glycans on the structure and function of these enzymes remains largely unknown. One exemplary system is MoLOX, a lipoxygenase from the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, that is emerging as an important target for the devastating rice blast disease. Herein, we demonstrate that hydrogen transfer, associated with C–H cleavage of the substrate linoleic acid by MoLOX, is rate-determining and occurs by a hydrogen tunneling mechanism. Using the differential enthalpic barrier for hydrogen and deuterium transfer, ΔEₐ, as a kinetic reporter of tunneling efficiency, a disproportionate increase in the activation energy for deuterium transfer is observed upon treatment of MoLOX with a peptide:N-glycosidase that cleaves N-linked carbohydrates from the protein. This increased ΔEₐ is consistent with an impairment of substrate positioning in the enzyme–substrate complex for both the tunneling ready state and the ground state. These results provide new insight into the functional consequences of N-linked glycosylation on lipoxygenase C–H activation and have important implications for MoLOX inhibitor design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aactivation energy 3aactive sites 3ablast disease 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adeuterium 3aenzyme substrates 3afungal enzymes 3afungi 3aglycosylation 3ahydroperoxides 3alinoleic acid 3alipoxygenases 3apolysaccharides 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3avirulent strains1 aRay, Katherine1 aIavarone, Anthony T.1 aOffenbacher, Adam R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6990-71780 tBiochemistry.g2019 July 02, v. 58, no. 29 p.3193-3203dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b004673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245010400169300001600273520131300289592002801602650001601630650001001646650001401656650001101670650001001681650002001691650001901711650001301730650002501743650002701768650001301795653001601808653001701824653000801841653000801849653002501857700002501882700001801907700002101925700002001946700001801966773010301984856008002087852000902167655001202176IND60481110420221119050604.0200717e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048111042DNAL7 a10.2478/fhort-2013-00172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGajc-Wolska, Janina10aEffect of supplementary lighting on selected physiological parameters and yielding of tomato plants  ap. 153-159.  aLight is one of the basic factors needed by plants for their development. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of supplementary lighting of tomato plants with HPS and LED lamps on the chosen physiological parameters and yielding of autumn-winter cultivation crops. Two tomato cultivars (‘Komeett’ F1 and ‘Starbuck’ F1 by De Ruiter Seeds) were used in this experiment. After the plants were planted, LED and HPS lamps of 100 μmol m-2 s-1 light intensity were installed. The results show that the introduction of a supplementary light source to tomato cultivation caused an increase in the intensity of photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance and chlorophyll by 57.7%, 17.1%, 39.3% and 24.4% on average, respectively. Higher values of those parameters were obtained with HPS lamps than with LED lamps. The amount of marketable crops, number of fruits and mean fruit weight were higher in both combinations in which supplementary lighting was applied, and the values of these traits were higher when the cultivation was supplementary lighted with HPS lamps than with LED lamps. Due to the overhead light configuration and continued low light output, there was no increase of efficiency when using LED lamps compared to HPS lamps despite better focusing and spectral distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3acultivars 3afruits 3alamps 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthesis 3aplanting 3astomatal conductance 3asupplementary lighting 3atomatoes 0achlorophyll 0agas exchange 0aHPS 0aLED 0aSolanum lycopersicon1 aKowalczyk, Katarzyna1 aMetera, Agata1 aMazur, Katarzyna1 aBujalski, Dawid1 aHemka, Lucyna0 tFolia horticulturae.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 25, no. 2 p.153-159dVersitawJournal:2057x2083-59657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/fhort-2013-00173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01642naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024001900131040001800150100002300168245014600191300001600337520046200353592002800815650001600843650001100859650001600870650002000886653001900906653001600925653002900941653003100970653001101001653001001012700002401022773014201046856008301188852000901271655001201280IND60594770620221117214512.0180522e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059477062DNAL7 a10.3159/TORREY-D-16-00013.12doi4 atbot-144-03-07  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenet-Pierce, Nuri10aTaxonomic recovery of the species in the Chenopodium neomexicanum (Chenopodiaceae) complex and description of Chenopodium sonorense sp. nov.1  ap. 339-356.  aWe utilize fruit and seed morphology to help clarify the taxonomy of the Chenopodium neomexicanum complex.

Geographic profiling boasts a wide range of applications, such as finding source populations of invasive species or breeding sites of vectors of infectious disease. The model provides a cost‐effective approach for prioritizing search strategies for source locations and does so via simple data in the form of the positions of each observation, such as individual sightings of invasive species or cases of a disease. In doing so, however, classic geographic profiling approaches fail to make the distinction between those areas containing observed absences and those areas where no data were recorded. Absence data are generated via spatial sampling protocols but are often discarded during the inference process. Here we construct a geographic profiling model that resolves these issues by making inferences via count data, analyzing a set of discrete sentinel locations at which the number of encounters has been recorded. Crucially, in our model this number can be zero. We verify the ability of this new model to estimate source locations and other parameters of practical interest via a Bayesian power analysis. We also measure model performance via real‐world data in which the model infers breeding locations of mosquitoes in bromeliads in Miami‐Dade County, Florida, USA. In both cases, our novel model produces more efficient search strategies by shifting focus from those areas containing observed absences to those with no data, an improvement over existing models that treat these areas equally. Our model makes important improvements upon classic geographic profiling methods, which will significantly enhance real‐world efforts to develop conservation management plans and targeted interventions.  aPublisher supplied data  a1U01CK000510‐03cCenter for Disease Control and Prevention  aNE/L002485/1cNatural Environmental Research Council 3aBayesian theory 3aBromeliaceae 3acost effectiveness 3acriminology 3adisease control 3aepidemiology 3ainfectious diseases 3ainvasive species 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3aFlorida1 aFaulkner, Sally C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0342-43891 aWilke, André B.

Herein, we report a new metal-free photoactive polymer containing thiadiazole and triazine units with a stable photo-electroactivity in strong acidic electrolytes. The reactivity of chloro groups in cyanuric chloride and the nucleophilic substitution with 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,5-thiadiazole favors the facile (electro)copolymerization at lower oxidative potentials. Spectral investigations reveal the systematic bathochromic shift toward the visible region with extensive polymerization. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, NMR, Raman, IR, and UV–vis spectral studies evidence the substitution of chloro units with dimercapto units. This N- and S-rich poly(2,5-dimercaptothiadiazole-triazine) exhibits p-type photoactivity with the optical band gaps in the range of 2.4–2.6 eV. On the contrary, poly-2,5-dimercaptothiadiazole displays poor n-type photoactivity. The photoelectrode shows stable, repeatable photovoltage (15–20 mV) and photocurrent (3–4 μA cm–²) responses in acidic electrolytes, and the incremental photocurrent responses at higher cathodic potentials for longer duration are attributed to the excellent protonation capability of polymeric units. Furthermore, they exhibit good oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3acyanuric chloride 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy conversion 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3aprotonation 3asolar energy 3aspectral analysis 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aKandaiah, Sakthivel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4390-77050 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 June 19, v. 123, no. 28 p.17075-17082dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b006863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005000171300001400221520046700235592002800702650002500730650001800755650002900773653000800802653000800810653000800818653001200826653000800838653003400846653002400880700002500904773009600929856008601025852000901111655001201120IND60626486320221119115837.0190206e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062648632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLink, Albert N.12aA public sector knowledge production function  ap. 64-66.  aThere are no studies of the R&D-to-patenting relationship at the federal agency level.

During the last decade, the concept of cellular automata (CA) has been widely adopted to develop various 2D shallow water flow models. Such CA models use simple transition rules that only consider the conservation of mass and neglect the conservation of momentum, as a result, the models behave like the non-inertia wave approximation which are not suitable for modeling strong discontinuous flows (i.e., transcritical flows and wet-dry interfaces). To overcome this limitation, the present study proposes a new CA framework (SWFCA) for 2D shallow water flow modeling, in which the Bernoulli hydraulic head is adopted to replace water level as the key factor to determine water movements. A novel methodology for linking water depths and velocities in the framework is developed. Model verification is carried out through four cases of regular flows and six benchmark cases with strong discontinuous flows. Model efficiency assessment is also conducted to analyze the numerical performance under various flow conditions. The outcomes indicate that the proposed SWFCA model and a non-inertia wave CA-based model (WCA2D) both provide satisfactory results on regular flows. In modeling strong discontinuous flows, the SWFCA model performs better than the WCA2D model and provides the same accuracy as the finite volume model with a HLLC scheme (FV-HLLC). In the aspect of moving wet-dry interfaces and flows under the partially wet condition, the SWFCA model can achieve higher accuracy than the FV-HLLC model. The numerical efficiency of the SWFCA model relates to the flow conditions involved. As the portion of strong discontinuous flows in the computational domain is increasing, the SWFCA model can be up to 305.5% and 121.0%-1282.2% faster than the WCA2D model and the FV-HLLC model, respectively. This novel CA-based framework has been proved its accuracy and efficiency for shallow water flow modeling. Therefore, it has considerable potentials as a useful tool for real-time flood inundation modeling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amodels 3amomentum 3awater flow 0aShallow water flow 0aCellular automata 0aDynamic wave 0aBernoulli hydraulic head1 aYu, Hsiang-Lin1 aWang, Chia-Ho1 aChen, Albert S.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Oct., v. 613 p.128449-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1284493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009900170300001600269520121000285592002801495650002601523650001001549650001501559650001401574650001501588650001501603650001901618650001801637650001401655650002201669650002401691650001701715650002501732650001401757650002201771700001501793773010001808852000901908856008801917655001202005IND4381630420221118040632.0160420e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438163042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01578.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanley, M.

Nevertheless, while many of the mechanisms governing seedling selection by herbivores are well established, the effects of tissue loss at the seedling stage on subsequent plant development are poorly understood. • Here we examined how the removal of 50 or ∼100% of cotyledon area from 7‐d‐old chalk grassland seedlings affected subsequent plant growth and flowering over a 100‐d period. • Cotyledon damage had a significant effect on growth during the establishment phase for six of the nine species. For two species, significant effects on plant growth were manifest in 100‐d‐old plants. Of the five species that flowered, three developed fewer inflorescences or flowered later as a consequence of cotyledon damage suffered as a seedling. • Our results show that, in addition to the direct effect of herbivory on seedling mortality, more subtle sublethal effects may also influence plant establishment. Reduced growth as a result of cotyledon damage may have implications for plant competition during the establishment phase, and on subsequent reproductive success at maturity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3achalk 3acotyledons 3aflowering 3agrasslands 3aherbivores 3ainflorescences 3amature plants 3amortality 3aplant competition 3aplant establishment 3aplant growth 3areproductive success 3aseedlings 3asublethal effects1 aMay, O.

A four‐factorial central composite design (CCD) based on response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to study the effect of various process parameters on removal efficiency and energy consumption as the responses. On optimization, maximum removal efficiency up to 95% was attained with energy consumption as 0.903 W‐hour per gram removal of Cu (II) at applied current 0.26 A, initial copper concentration of 27.8 ppm, application time of 5.4 min and pH 7. The interaction between the process variables was evaluated by using the obtained 3‐D plots. The models generated were validated by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Studies carried on Cu (II) removal rate showed adsorption suited pseudo‐Ist order kinetics best. Overall, the electrocoagulation process proved efficient, low cost and a promising alternative to conventional treatment procedures in removing Cu (II). PRACTITIONER POINTS: Adsorption over hydroxide/polyhydroxide complexes of Fe assisted in enhanced removal of Cu (II) by EC. Higher concentrations treated at lower current but longer duration reduces energy. pH was found to be the deterministic factor for coagulation. CCD‐based optimization reduced energy consumption substantially.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanalysis of variance 3aapplication timing 3aaqueous solutions 3aelectrocoagulation 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3apH 3aresearch 3aresponse surface methodology 3awater1 aKhan, Saif Ullah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8784-24591 aIslam, Dar Tafazul1 aKhan, Nadeem Ahmad1 aFarooqi, Izharul Haq0 tWater environment research.g2020 Sept., v. 92, no. 9 p.1350-1362dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:21189x1061-43037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.13323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245008800195500002000283520181000303592002802113596003002141596003302171596004702204650001102251650001902262650001902281650002702300650001502327650001302342650002302355650002102378650001902399650002602418650002102444650001902465650001502484650001502499651001202514700002302526700002302549700001802572700001802590700002002608700002002628773012202648856007402770852000902844655001202853IND60775639920221122124619.0220426e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077563992DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.135632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberle, Brad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4227-335210aRestoration objectives create surface carbon cycle trade‐offs in coastal habitats  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCoastal habitats are important and imperiled. To mitigate climate change impacts, carbon (C) sequestration has joined established restoration objectives, including habitat diversity, public access, and native vegetation. Changing topography, maintaining trails, and removing invasive plants may influence coastal C production and retention in different ways depending on how each activity influences the stabilization of organic matter in surface sediments. We quantified variation in litter and surface soil dynamics within and between coastal parks that varied in age from prerestoration to nearly 20 years old in Manatee County, Florida. Older parks had deeper soil organic horizons with higher levels of soil moisture and respiration, indicating that restoration sequesters soil C despite increases in microbial efficiency. However, variation within parks indicated that detrital C dynamics change depending on local management objectives. Relative to unmanaged locations, restored wetlands, including mangroves, salt marshes, and freshwater ponds, had soil organic horizons nearly 20 cm deeper, with high litter stabilization rates despite less litter mass and shorter projected soil sample C mineralization. In contrast, public access features like trails and kayak launches were associated with increased surface CO₂ efflux and marginally reduced soil organic horizon depth. Removing invasives had little impact on detrital carbon pools and fluxes. Incorporating detrital C dynamics improved a multivariate model for variation in C pool sizes across sites. Overall, our results suggest that management objectives influence the C production and retention capacity of restored coastal habitats with restored uplands and public access points storing less C than relatively inaccessible wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data  cTampa Bay Estuary Program  cSarasota Bay Estuary Program  cProvost's Office of New College of Florida 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aecological restoration 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amineralization 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganic horizons 3aorganic matter 3asoil water 3atopography 3aFlorida1 aBreithaupt, Joshua1 aMcTigue, Angela M.1 aStryker, Race1 aCladas, Misty1 aRaulerson, Gary1 aYoung, Darcy F.0 tRestoration ecology.g2022 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.e13563-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.135633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245008100196500002000277520132800297592002801625596005801653650002301711650002301734650001101757650001201768650001801780650002701798650001501825650001001840650001401850650001301864650001301877650001901890651001701909700002401926700001601950700002301966773012201989856007402111852000902185655001202194IND60775640020221118031000.0220426e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077564002DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.135622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, Andie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8190-859510aRestoration of a Lake Ontario‐connected fen through invasive Typha removal  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLake‐level regulation that began in 1960 eliminated large fluctuations of Lake Ontario water levels, altering coastal wetland plant communities. More than a half century later, the altered hydroperiod supports dense, monotypic stands of invasive cattail (Typha angustifolia and Typha × glauca), which have diminished overall plant community diversity. As a result, Lake Ontario coastal wetlands are less capable of providing many of their traditional ecological functions. One such wetland is Buttonwood Fen, a floating, lake‐connected peatland on Lake Ontario's southern shore near Rochester, NY. We implemented cattail‐control measures from 2016 to 2018 with the goal of decreasing live and dead cattail biomass and increasing cover of native fen taxa. Site manipulation included removal of dead cattail biomass, cutting new cattail growth when rhizome carbohydrate reserves were at their lowest, and hand‐wicking regrowth with herbicide in early fall. Results showed a decrease in live cattail stem density and cover and dead biomass cover, as well as an increase in cover of fen taxa. Although not a replicated study, our results suggest that removing dead cattail biomass and targeted treatment of live cattail stems via cutting and hand‐wicking with glyphosate can reduce cattail and improve site quality.  aPublisher supplied data  a0501.15.048886cNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation 3aConocarpus erectus 3aTypha angustifolia 3aautumn 3abiomass 3acarbohydrates 3aecological restoration 3aglyphosate 3alakes 3apeatlands 3aregrowth 3arhizomes 3awetland plants 3aLake Ontario1 aMudrzynski, Bradley1 aPolzer, Eli1 aWilcox, Douglas A.0 tRestoration ecology.g2022 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.e13562-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.135623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016500170300001400335520154100349592002801890650001901918650001201937650001801949650001501967650001601982650001901998650002102017650003302038650001302071650002402084650001202108650001002120650001702130650002602147650001302173650001902186650001502205650001502220650002502235653002102260653002702281653003402308653003202342653002402374700001702398700001602415700001802431700001702449700001902466700001702485773011102502856008802613852000902701655001202710IND60565465120221121053958.0181010e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056546512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jianhua10aUnraveling microbial structure and diversity of activated sludge in a full-scale simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal plant using metagenomic sequencing  ap. 16-25.  aActivated sludge contains highly complex microbial communities, which play crucial roles in pollutant removal performance in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Metagenomic sequencing was applied to characterize microbial community and functional profiles within activated sludge from a full-scale municipal WWTP carrying out simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorous removal (SNPR). We applied the assembled contigs (N90 of 591bp) and predicted genes to conduct taxonomic and function annotations, respectively. Results revealed the extraordinary microbial diversity of activated sludge, which included detection of minority populations that are difficult to be explored by traditional molecular methods. Taxonomic analysis indicated that the dominant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. The abundance of the key organisms involved in nitrogen and phosphorous removal were qualified. Aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria distinctly dominate over ammonia-oxidizing archaea and anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria. Various key enzymes involved in the global nitrogen cycle were annotated in the activated sludge. High abundance of the known polyphosphate accumulating organisms was detected (approximately 4.89% of the overall population reads), supporting good phosphorous removal performance. This study provides a comprehensive insight into the community structure and diversity of the SNPR system, and will provide foundation for optimal operation of nutrient removal systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aArchaea 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aNitrospirae 3aProteobacteria 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacteria 3acommunity structure 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3awastewater treatment 0aActivated sludge 0aMetagenomic sequencing 0aMicrobial community structure 0aBiological nitrogen removal 0aBacterial diversity1 aNi, Bing-Jie1 aHan, Xiaoyu1 aChen, Xueming1 aBond, Philip1 aPeng, Yongzhen1 aYuan, Zhiguo0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2017 July, v. 102 p.16-25dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015400161300001800315520176600333592002802099650001102127650003502138650001102173650001202184650001802196650001102214650001102225650000902236650001902245650002302264650001202287650001402299650001402313650001502327650001102342650000902353650001902362650001402381650001002395650001402405650001802419650002402437650001902461650001302480650001102493650001102504650002502515650001402540650001602554650001302570650001302583650000902596700001902605773014702624856008202771852000902853655001202862IND60590017520221120093810.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059001752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-017-0790-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ni10aFully automated focused infrared microashing combined with use of ICP-based instruments for rapid analysis of multiple elements in biological samples  ap. 1489-1499.  aA fully automated focused infrared microashing sample preparation system was proposed for preparation of biological samples with high organic matter content for the determination of multiple elements combined with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The whole ashing procedure, including sample transfer, carbonization and oxidation of the sample, dissolution of ash, constant volume control, and homogenization of the solution, was automatically controlled. Gold-plated infrared tubes were used to produce and focus infrared radiation to heat the sample. Ozone was used to accelerate the carbonization of samples at a lower temperature to avoid the production of large amounts of empyreumatic oil. In addition, the self-designed double-layer tube serves as a site for ashing and carbonization of the sample and as a container for dissolving ash, as well as for holding the solution. This is the only container in the entire system to reduce the risk of pollution. Eight biological certified reference materials were used as examples to evaluate the performance of the proposed device. A sample ashing pretreatment cycle, from solid sample to liquid solution, took only 40 min and simultaneously treated 12 samples. Except for individual results, the relative errors between the certified values and recorded values for 38 micro and trace elements, including Ca, Mg, Na, P, Li, Be, Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Mo, Ag, Cs, Ba, Tl, Th, U, and rare earth elements, were typically less than 30%. The relative standard deviations for five determinations were typically less than 15%. Graphical abstract Automated dry ashing sample preparation system.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as an emerging class of porous materials exhibit some unique advantages, including controllable composition, a large surface area, high porosity, and so on. These attractive characteristics of MOFs have led to their potential applications in energy storage and conversion devices, drug delivery, adsorption and storage, sensors, and other areas. However, powdered MOFs have limited practical applications owing to poor processability, safety hazards from dust formation, and poor recyclability. In addition, the inherent micro/mesoporosities of MOFs also reduce the accessibility and diffusion kinetics for large molecules. To improve their processability for practical applications, MOFs are often deposited as MOF layers or films (i.e., MOF-coated composites) on supporting materials or are formed into 3D structured composites, such as aerogels and hydrogels. In this article, we review recent researches on these MOF composites, including their synthetic methods and potential applications in energy storage devices, heavy metal ion adsorption, and water purification. Finally, the future outlook and challenges associated with the large-scale fabrication of MOF-based composites for practical applications are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaerogels 3acoordination polymers 3adrugs 3adust 3aenergy 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogels 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asurface area 3awater purification1 aWang, Chaohai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3133-19591 aKaneti, Yusuf Valentino1 aEguchi, Miharu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4007-74381 aLin, Jianjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9424-33231 aYamauchi, Yusuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7854-927X1 aNa, Jongbeom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3890-78770 tLangmuir.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 36, no. 16 p.4231-4249dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c002363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005300139245007900192500002000271520183900291592002802130650002202158650001102180650002502191650002702216650001802243650001802261650001202279650001402291650001402305650002202319651001602341700002102357700002202378773012202400856007402522852000902596655001202605IND60775640120221118030955.0220426e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077564012DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.135612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlder, Al1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8360-649414aThe importance of stock selection for improving transplantation efficiency  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe restoration of shellfish reefs to soft‐sediment environments often relies on the translocation of donor stock, typically from aquaculture, to the seafloor. In New Zealand, subadult green‐lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus) grown on subtidal aquaculture long‐lines are being considered over adult conspecifics to increase restoration efficiency but are currently limited by predation and hydrodynamic dislodgment following transfer to the seabed. In this study, the survival of subadult mussels from five different sources representing a range of growth conditions (i.e. subtidal aquaculture long‐lines 1 and 2, subtidal shellfish aquaculture baskets 1, wild intertidal reefs 1 and 2) were compared across separate translocations (1 and 2) to see if careful consideration of stock source could improve subadult mussel survival following transfer to the seafloor. Mussel morphology (shell strength, attachment thread structure) and clumping behavior (perimeter:area ratios, clump densities, clump complexity) were compared among populations to explain relationships among prior stock growth conditions, mussel size, and survival. Following experimental translocations, high survival (>90%) was closely related to decreases in perimeter:area ratios of mussel clumps and increases in clump complexity. High survival groups of mussels were selected from stock with high shell compression strength (subtidal aquaculture long‐line 2, 95.5% survival), greater attachment thread number and thickness (aquaculture basket 1, 92.3% survival), or some combination of the two (wild intertidal reef 2, 99.3% survival). This study supports further consideration for incorporating subadult mussels into restoration provided they are selected from sources that produce individuals with the resistant characteristics outlined in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerna canaliculus 3aadults 3acompression strength 3aecological restoration 3ahydrodynamics 3alittoral zone 3amussels 3apredation 3ashellfish 3ashellfish culture 3aNew Zealand1 aJeffs, Andrew G.1 aHillman, Jenny R.0 tRestoration ecology.g2022 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.e13561-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.135613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008300173300001400256520101400270592002801284650001801312650001501330650001401345650001401359650001001373650002401383650001101407650001801418650001201436650001901448650001401467650002401481653000801505653000801513653001001521653000901531653000801540653001501548653000901563653000801572653000801580653000801588653000901596653000801605653000901613653002201622653003001644653001401674653001301688653001401701653002201715653002501737653001801762653003201780653002801812700002201840700001201862700002101874700001901895773009801914856008102012852000902093655001202102IND60551095320221121152855.0161016e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055109532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2015.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVettermann, Christian12aA signaling-enhanced chimeric receptor to activate the ICOS pathway in T cells  ap. 14-19.  aActivation of the inducible costimulator (ICOS) signaling pathway in T cells is difficult to assess with bioassays, because most T cell lines do not constitutively express ICOS. Additionally, engagement of ICOS by its natural ligand B7 related protein 1 (B7RP1) is insufficient to elicit ICOS signaling, but requires simultaneous costimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) to be effective. Here we describe a genetically engineered human T cell line that expresses a chimeric receptor (ICOS–CD3) consisting of full-length human ICOS fused at its C-terminal end to the cytoplasmic domain of human CD3 zeta. When engaged by B7RP1, ICOS–CD3 initiated signaling independently of TCR costimulation and induced substantially more IL-2 secretion in Jurkat T cells compared to wildtype ICOS. We demonstrate that this signaling-enhanced chimeric receptor can be used in simple and sensitive bioassays to detect bioactive B7RP1, anti-B7RP1 drugs, and the presence of corresponding neutralizing anti-drug antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3abioassays 3achimerism 3adrugs 3agenetic engineering 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-2 3aligands 3aneutralization 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 0aADA 0aCD3 0aB7RP1 0aICOS 0aTCR 0aICOS–CD3 0aITAM 0aNAb 0aPLS 0aPNS 0aPTEN 0aRLU 0aSHIP 0aT cell activation 0aFollicular T helper cells 0aSignaling 0aBioassay 0aNAb assay 0aLot release assay 0aBioactive drug assay 0aPotency assay 0aBiological characterization 0aGenetic fusion receptor1 aVictor, Hannah P.1 aSun, Yu1 aPlewa, Cherylene1 aGupta, Shalini0 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2015 Sept., v. 424 p.14-19dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2015.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016600169300001800335520212100353592002802474650004402502650002202546650001502568650001402583650002102597650003002618650001502648650001102663650001302674650000902687650001302696650001802709650000702727650001502734650000902749650002302758650001802781650001602799700001902815700006102834700006302895773011402958856008403072852000903156655001203165IND60691169020221118032751.0200428e20200403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069116902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c002522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoldoozy, Sara10aIn Situ and Real-Time ATR-FTIR Temperature-Dependent Adsorption Kinetics Coupled with DFT Calculations of Dimethylarsinate and Arsenate on Hematite Nanoparticles  ap. 4299-4307.  aTemperature-dependent kinetic studies of the adsorption of critical pollutants onto reactive components in soils and removal technologies provide invaluable rate information and mechanistic insight. Using attenuated total internal reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, we collected in situ spectra as a function of time, concentration, and temperature in the range of 5–50 °C (278–323 K) for the adsorption of arsenate (iAs) and dimethylarsinate (DMA) on hematite nanoparticles at pH 7. These experimental data were modeled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the energy barriers between surface complexes. The Langmuir adsorption kinetic model was used to extract values of the fast (<5 min) and slow (6–10 min) observed adsorption rate, initial rate constants of adsorption and desorption, Arrhenius parameters, effective activation energies (ΔEₐ), and pre-exponential factors (A). The trend in the kinetic parameters correlated with the type of surface complexes that iAs and DMA form, which are mostly bidentate binuclear compared to a mix of outer sphere and monodentate, respectively. The observed initial adsorption rates were found to be more sensitive to changes in the aqueous concentration of the arsenicals than slow rates. On average, iAs adsorbs 2.5× faster and desorbs 4× slower than dimethylarsinate (DMA). The ΔEₐ and A values for the adsorption of iAs bidentate complexes are statistically higher than those extracted for outer-sphere DMA by a factor of 3. The DFT results on adsorption energies and ΔEₐ barriers are consistent with the experimental data and provide a mechanistic explanation for the low ΔEₐ values observed. The presence of defect sites with under-coordinated Fe atoms or exchangeable surface water (i.e., Fe–OH₂ groups) lowers activation barriers of adsorption. These results suggest that increasing organic substitutions on arsenate at the expense of As–O bonds decreases the effective energy barrier for complex formation and lowers the number of collisional orientations that result in binding to the hematite surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3aarsenates 3achemical bonding 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3aenergy 3ahematite 3airon 3akinetics 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apollutants 3asoil 3asorption isotherms 3asurface water 3atemperature1 aTrinh, Anthony1 aKubicki, James D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9277-90441 aAl-Abadleh, Hind A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9425-06460 tLangmuir.g2020 Apr. 03, v. 36, no. 16 p.4299-4307dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c002523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245012100166300001600287520145000303536011801753592002801871650001601899650001801915650002701933650000901960650001201969650001401981650001401995650001702009650002002026650001502046653004202061653000902103653002302112653001502135700002502150700002202175700001802197700002202215773013202237856008002369852000902449655001202458IND60615627820221117173324.0181011e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061562782DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387155879342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwann, James W.10aHistologic and clinical features of primary and secondary vasculitisba retrospective study of 42 dogs (2004–2011)  ap. 489-496.  aInflammation of the blood vessel wall has been reported infrequently in dogs, and it may occur without apparent cause (primary vasculitis) or as a pathologic reaction to a range of initiating insults (secondary vasculitis). The aims of our study were to report histologic, clinical, and survival data from a large series of cases with primary and secondary vasculitis, and to compare the clinical parameters and outcome data between groups. Clinical data was collected retrospectively from the medical records of 42 client-owned dogs with a histologic diagnosis of primary or secondary vasculitis, and follow-up information was obtained. Cases were grouped according to clinical and histologic descriptors, and biochemical, hematologic, and survival data was compared between groups. Several forms of primary vasculitis were observed, and vascular inflammation was observed in conjunction with numerous other diseases. Female dogs were more likely to develop primary vasculitis, and serum globulin concentration was greater in dogs with primary vasculitis compared to those with underlying disease. All dogs with primary vasculitis of the central nervous system died or were euthanized shortly after presentation, but other forms of primary vasculitis could be managed effectively. In conclusion, presentation of clinical cases in this series was variable, and there did not appear to be well-defined vasculitic syndromes as described in people.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3ablood vessels 3acentral nervous system 3adogs 3afemales 3aglobulins 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3amedical records 3avasculitis 0aAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies 0adogs 0afibrinoid necrosis 0avasculitis1 aPriestnall, Simon L.1 aDawson, Charlotte1 aChang, Yu-Mei1 aGarden, Oliver A.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 27, no. 4 p.489-496dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387155879343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245007200199500002000271520169900291592002801990596006202018596003902080650002002119650001502139650001602154650002302170650002202193650001802215650001702233650001802250650001502268650001902283650003702302700002002339700001802359700001902377700001802396773012202414856007402536852000902610655001202619IND60775640220221118030931.0220426e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077564022DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.135492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheeke, Tanya E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5335-622510aRole of soil biota in grassland restorations in high nutrient soils  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil biota are abundant in grasslands; however, disturbances such as invasions or conversion to agriculture may alter soil communities in ways that reduce the success of native species and/or increase the competitiveness of invasive plants. Predicting the magnitude and direction of these effects on plant growth remains challenging, particularly in high nutrient soils, which can impact plant‐microbe and plant–plant interactions in different ways. In greenhouse experiments, invasive and native Palouse prairie plants were grown individually and in a community with soil from a Palouse prairie remnant, soil invaded by Bromus tectorum, a nutrient release treatment, or no treatment. We tested (1) whether arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal infectivity and function of soil biota differ in invaded versus remnant prairie soil; (2) if growth responses to soil biota are related to plant nutrient demands; (3) if individual plant responses to soil biota predict competitive outcomes; and (4) if successional status predicts plant growth response to soil biota in high nutrient soils. We found no difference in mycorrhizal inoculation potential or function in invaded versus remnant prairie soil. We show a continuum of plant growth responses to soil biota, which correlate with nutrient responses, even under the high baseline soil nutrient conditions. We found that growth response to soil biota may increase with native plant successional stage. Understanding how different plant species respond to soil biota and assessing functionality of soil biota at a site will help managers plan restorations in high nutrient soils, and inform whether inoculations may be beneficial at a particular site.  aPublisher supplied data  cM.J.

The hydrazide tag reacts efficiently with the glycans, increasing their non-polar surface area, allowing for reversed-phase separations and increased ionization efficiency. We have taken the INLIGHT™ strategy and adopted it for use with O-linked glycans. A central composite design was utilized to find optimized tagging conditions (45% acetic acid, 0.1 μg/μL tag concentration, 37 C, 1.75 h). Derivatization at optimized conditions was much quicker than any hydrazide derivatization strategy used previously. Human immunoglobulin A (IgA) and bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) were then deglycosylated through hydrazinolysis and the removed glycans were tagged under optimum conditions. XIC of tagged glycans and MS2 data show successful hydrazide tagging of O-linked glycans for the first time. Graphical abstract The INLIGHT™ hydrazide tag was optimized using a central composite design for derivatization of O-linked glycans. Two glycoprotein standards were deglycosylated through hydrazinolysis and tagged at the optimized conditions. MS/MS data shows INLIGHT™ derivatization of glycans demonstrating successful hydrazide tagging of O-glycans for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acattle 3aderivatization 3aexperimental design 3ahumans 3ahydrazides 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aionization 3amucins 3apolysaccharides 3asurface area1 aHecht, ElizabethS.1 aMuddiman, DavidC.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2018 Feb., v. 410, no. 5 p.1409-1415dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-017-0828-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245008100212500002200293500001500315520107600330592002801406650001501434650001701449650001601466650001201482650000901494650003701503650001001540650003301550650001101583650001701594653002001611653001801631653002701649653001501676653001101691653000701702700006701709700001901776700001601795773006901811856008401880852000901964655001201973IND60571128820221122081424.0170710s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057112882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoya-Costa, Raquel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2405-341X10aStructure and composition of tooth enamel in quaternary soricines (Mammalia)  aPre-press version  a2019-12-06  aOne of the main characteristics of the soricines (Eulipotyphla, Mammalia) is the red pigmentation of the outer part of the enamel in the cusps of the teeth. This gives the group its popular name: the red-toothed shrews. Several studies of extant species show that they have a complex enamel structure with three different parts and that the pigmentation is related to the presence of Fe oxides or hydroxides in the outer enamel. We have prepared transverse sections of the incisors of fossil shrews. These belong to the Early Pleistocene shrew Dolinasorex glyphodon and to an indeterminate species of Sorex. FESEM and EDS analyses of the sections show that Fe percentages reach their highest values in the outer part of the intermediate layer of the enamel and in the internal part of the outermost layer. The variations in Fe content are related to the change in direction of the enamel prisms in the intermediate parts of the enamel, instead of being at the surface as previous studies suggested. The location of the Fe seems to be related to the strength of the tooth.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydroxides 3apigmentation 3airon oxides 3afossils 3airon 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aSorex 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashrews 3atooth enamel 0aSoricine enamel 0aFossil shrews 0aBackscattered electron 0aBiomineral 0aoxides 0aFe1 aCuenca Bescós, Gloria,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5125-96511 aBauluz, Blanca1 aRofes, Juan0 tQuaternary International.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013300162300002000295520207400315592002802389596005902417650000902476650001602485650001002501650001802511650001902529650001902548650001402567650001302581650001502594700001802609700001602627700001502643700001502658773015602673856008302829852000902912655001202921IND60750768620221120094112.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075076862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14188-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jifu10aHighly stable halide perovskite with Na incorporation for efficient photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes in water solution  ap. 50813-50824.  aTo overcome water instability and low photocatalytic activity of lead-free halide perovskite for the degradation of organic dyes, we report a novel photocatalyst of lead-free halide perovskite with Na incorporation and employ it for the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes in water solution under visible light irradiation. The main purpose of this work is to confirm the feasibility of lead-free halide perovskite with Na incorporation for improving the photocatalytic efficiency and recyclability in water solution and further to explore the mechanism behind the enhancement of photocatalytic performance after Na incorporation. The results show that Cs₂Ag₀.₆₀Na₀.₄₀InCl₆ can increase the dye degradation rate by at least 50% than the lead-free halide perovskite (Cs₂AgInCl₆) and the photocatalyst of Ag substituted by Na (Cs₂NaInCl₆). The degradation efficiency of rhodamine 6G catalyzed by Cs₂Ag₀.₆₀Na₀.₄₀InCl₆ reaches 94.94% over 60 min, which is 72% higher than that catalyzed by Cs₂NaInCl₆ and 27% higher than that catalyzed by Cs₂AgInCl₆. What’s more, the degradation efficiency of methyl orange catalyzed by Cs₂Ag₀.₆₀Na₀.₄₀InCl₆ is 90.39% within 150 min, which is 66% higher than that catalyzed by Cs₂NaInCl₆ and 54% higher than that catalyzed by Cs₂AgInCl₆. Moreover, the photocatalyst of Cs₂Ag₀.₆₀Na₀.₄₀InCl₆ exhibits a desirable recyclability by water exposure, retaining the degradation efficiency over 90% after five cycles. The strengthened photocatalytic performance in the presence of Cs₂Ag₀.₆₀Na₀.₄₀InCl₆ is ascribed to an increase of radiative recombination rate and an improvement of average lifetime to 204 ns since an appropriate Na incorporation at the atomic ratio of Na/Ag=4:6 breaks the original crystal lattice and meanwhile increases the electron and hole overlap. The work proves a great potential of halide perovskite with Na incorporation for the highly efficient photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes in water solution.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019M652432cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China 3adyes 3airradiation 3alight 3amethyl orange 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollution 3aresearch 3arhodamines1 aYang, Zhijuan1 aLi, Longzhi1 aZhang, Yue1 aZou, Guifu0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 36 p.50813-50824dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14188-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006900170500002200239520151200261592002801773650001001801650001901811650001601830650001501846651001101861700002201872700002001894700006801914700005901982700001702041700006102058773006902119856008402188852000902272655001202281IND60571128920221122055827.0170710s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057112892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimelmitz, Ron14aThe Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic of Sefunim Cave, Israel  aPre-press version  aSefunim Cave, Mount Carmel, Israel was previously excavated in the 1960s and is one of the main sites known for the occurrence of the cultural entity termed the Levantine Aurignacian. Renewed excavations at Sefunim Cave provide new insights into the Late Pleistocene occupations of the site and reveal a rich Epipaleolithic layer, in addition to the previously recorded Middle to Upper Paleolithic sequence. The recent work helps us re-evaluate the record of cultural and environmental shifts within the Upper Paleolithic and early Epipaleolithic sequence and places the results of earlier excavations in a higher resolution context in terms of human-environment relationships. The current work reports the first radiometric dating results from the Upper Paleolithic layers at this key site. In addition, we provide a preliminary description of finds collected during the new campaigns. The finds encompass both the material culture and environmental setting of Sefunim, and include investigations of micromorphology, lithics, use-wear, fauna, microfauna, ocher and shells. Important new findings include the identification of rich symbolic activity at the site. In the Levantine Aurignacian assemblage it is represented primarily by the presence of numerous shell ornaments, a trend which parallels Upper Paleolithic sites of the northern Levant. Other manifestations of symbolic activity are represented by ocher exploitation throughout the sequence and a unique engraved artifact from the Epipaleolithic.  aPublisher supplied data 3afauna 3amicrostructure 3aoccupations 3aradiometry 3aIsrael1 aFriesem, David E.1 aClark, Jamie L.1 aGroman-Yaroslavski, Iris1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5102-31631 aWeissbrod, Lior1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3401-81801 aPorat, Naomi1 aKandel, Andrew W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9889-94180 tQuaternary International.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.05.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015000171300001800321520146500339592002801804650002201832650002401854650002001878650001101898650001301909650004401922650001501966650002001981650001502001650001502016650001302031650001102044650001202055650002002067650001602087700001702103700001702120700005702137773011402194856008402308852000902392655001202401IND60691169420221118032742.0200428e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069116942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c003362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolbe, Felicitas10aPhosphate–Silica Interactions in Diatom Biosilica and Synthetic Composites Studied by Rotational Echo Double Resonance (REDOR) NMR Spectroscopy  ap. 4332-4338.  aBiosilica is a biogenic composite material produced by organisms like diatoms.

In the present work, we use distance-dependent solid-state NMR experiments, especially the ³¹P{²⁹Si} Rotational Echo Double Resonance (REDOR) technique, to study the environment of phosphate moieties in biosilica and in vitro synthesized SiO₂-based composites. In contrast to the heterogeneous mixtures of biomolecules found in native biosilica, the described in vitro silicification experiments make use of a single synthetic phosphopeptide and an LCPA of well-defined and uniform structure. The heteronuclear correlations measured from these silica composites provide reliable ³¹P–²⁹Si dipolar second moments and information about the distribution of the phosphopeptide within the silica material. The calculated second moment indicates close contact between phosphopeptides and silica. The phosphopeptides are incorporated into the silica composite in a disperse manner. Moreover, the REDOR data acquired for diatom biosilica also imply that phosphate groups are part of the silica–organic interface in this material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3acomposite materials 3adata collection 3alysine 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphates 3aphosphopeptides 3aphosphorus 3apolyamines 3aproteins 3asilica 3asilicon 3astable isotopes 3azwitterions1 aDaus, Fabian1 aGeyer, Armin1 aBrunner, Eike1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3511-98990 tLangmuir.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 36, no. 16 p.4332-4338dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c003363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01328naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009500169300001800264500002200282520026400304592002800568650002500596650001300621650001300634650002300647700001900670700002400689700003000713700002100743773014700764856008200911852000900993655001201002IND60590018120221120103350.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059001812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-017-0797-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossetti, Cecilia10aCorrection to: Exploring the peptide retention mechanism in molecularly imprinted polymers  ap. 1607-1608.  aPublished Erratum  aThe authors would like to call the reader’s attention to the fact that unfortunately due to the file formatting during the exporting of the data matrix from the program Unscrambler (used for the development of the statistical model) to the Word office file.  aPublisher supplied data 3amolecular imprinting 3apeptides 3apolymers 3astatistical models1 aOre, OddGøran1 aSellergren, Börje,1 aHalvorsen, TrineGrønhaug1 aReubsaet, Léon,0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2018 Feb., v. 410, no. 5 p.1607-1608dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-017-0797-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245007400170300001600244520119300260536029001453592002801743650002001771650001701791650001001808650002001818650001301838650002401851650001501875650001401890650001401904650001101918650001501929650001901944650002601963650001301989650001802002650002402020653001802044653001102062653001402073653001502087653001502102653001202117653001302129700002302142700002102165700002902186700001902215700002302234700002002257773013202277856008002409852000902489655001202498IND60615628220221117173304.0181011e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061562822DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387155906522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComolli, Jessica R.10aAmeloblastoma in a wild black rat snake (Pantherophis alleghaniensis)  ap. 536-539.  aReports of neoplasia in captive reptiles are becoming more frequent; however, there is still scarce knowledge of the occurrence of neoplasia in wild reptiles. A wild black rat snake (Pantherophis alleghaniensis) was presented to the Zoological Medicine service of the University of Georgia’s Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a 3 cm in diameter solid mandibular mass that was partially ulcerated. Radiographically, the mass was radiopaque with small bone spicules and partial osteolysis of the adjacent mandible. Histologic examination of the mass revealed a neoplasm composed of cuboidal to polygonal cells arranged in islands, anastomosing cords, and trabeculae of pseudostratified epithelium with a palisading peripheral layer of densely packed columnar cells with cytoplasmic clearing. The neoplastic tissue was separated from the mesenchyme by a prominent band of fine collagen. Neoplastic cells were positive for cytokeratin and negative for smooth muscle actin. Electron microscopy highlighted the presence of tonofilaments and microvilli. These findings led to the diagnosis of ameloblastoma, an odontogenic epithelial tumor known to occur in humans and most veterinary species.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The publication of this article was financially supported by the Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaphe obsoleta 3aPantherophis 3aactin 3abone resorption 3acollagen 3aelectron microscopy 3aepithelium 3ahistology 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3amicrovilli 3aneoplasm cells 3aodontogenic neoplasms 3areptiles 3asmooth muscle 3aveterinary medicine 0aAmeloblastoma 0aepulis 0aneoplasia 0aoral tumor 0arat snakes 0areptile 0awildlife1 aOlsen, Haley M.

MDA5 was used as an adjuvant to enhance the humoral immune response against influenza virus. In the current study, truncated chicken MDA5 [1–483 aa, chMDA5(483aa)] expressed by recombinant adenovirus was administered to specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens to improve the immune response induced by inactivated NDV vaccine. A total of 156 SPF chickens were divided into six groups, and after two rounds of immunization, the humoral immune response, cell-mediated immune (CMI) response and the protective efficacy of the vaccines against NDV challenge were evaluated. The results showed that co-administration of chMDA5(483aa) expressed by adenovirus increased the NDV-specific antibody response by 1.7 times and chickens received chMDA5(483aa) also gained a higher level of CMI response. Consistently, the protective efficacy of the inactivated NDV vaccine against virulent NDV (vNDV) challenge was improved by co-administrate with chMDA5(483aa), as indicated by the reduced morbidity and pathological lesions, lower levels of viral load in organs and reduced virus shedding. Our study demonstrated that chMDA5(433aa) expressed by adenovirus could enhance the immune efficacy of inactivated NDV vaccine in chickens and could be a potential adjuvant candidate in developing chicken NDV vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3aadjuvants 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3ahumoral immunity 3amelanoma 3aantibodies 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3amorbidity 3avaccines 3avirulence 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aviral load 3aviral shedding 3aAdenoviridae 0aSDS-PAGE 0aRIG-I 0aSI 0aTh 0aIgG 0aMOI 0aND 0aNewcastle disease virus 0aHI 0arAd-GFP 0achMDA5 0aIBDV 0achMx 0aIFN 0achIFN-β 0aANOVA 0aPRR 0aPBL 0aRLR 0aRT-qPCR 0aMAVS 0aHA 0aCPE 0aAdjuvant 0aCMI 0avNDV 0aIBV 0aImmune response 0aIM 0aCTD 0aNDV 0aIFA 0arAd-chMDA5 0aCARD 0aTCID50 0aMDA5 0aMHC 0aSPF1 aGao, Xiaolong1 aChu, Zhili1 aWang, Xiangwei1 aEisa Addoma Adam, Fathalrhman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3837-08381 aZhang, Shuxia1 aJia, Yanqing1 aQiu, Xinxin1 aWang, Xinglong1 aYang, Zengqi0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2019 Feb., v. 208 p.44-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2018.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010900165300001600274520199000290592002802280650001702308650002602325650002002351650001502371650001502386650001402401650001502415650002502430650002302455650001502478650001902493650001202512650001802524650002402542650001202566650001302578651001102591773008502602856004802687852000902735655001202744IND50061074620221119184431.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006107462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-010-9373-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi-fong, Chen14aThe indigenous ecotourism and social development in Taroko National Park area and San-Chan tribe, Taiwan  ap. 805-815.  aThis paper explores the socio-cultural influence of the newly established ecotourism, which integrates cultural revitalization, ecological conservation and social development, in both Taroko National Park area and San-Chan aboriginal community. Many cases in different parts of the world indicate that the Indigenous peoples have developed patterns of resource use and management practices that reflect detailed knowledge of local geography and ecosystem, and contribute to the natural conservation through their living practices. The guidelines of Indigenous knowledge and culture lay the base for the development of ecotourism. A critical evaluation of the conceptualization of Indigenous knowledge is therefore, essential to the success of an alternative strategy to development for aboriginal communities. Participatory observation in the field of ecotourism activities and brief interviews are the major study methods, with several workshops conducted to supplement data collection for the two case studies. The Taroko area came into contact with tourists in a relative early era due to its famous natural features and national park. Its growing ecotourism is the result of cooperation among local residents, environmentalists, and academics, each with very different concepts of ecotourism operation. The national park and public sectors have also played significant role in shaping the content of ecotourism. In San-Chan community, due to the negative impacts generated by the unregulated mass tourism expansion, the local Indigenous people decide to close the public access to the attractive creek for 3 years, while at the same time promote ecotourism for poverty alleviation. These two cases embrace the ‘Nature’ as an important element in their construction of new place identity and community development. However, their spatial location in- or outside the national park produces significant differences and sociopolitical implications on the operations of ecotourism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acommunity development 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aecotourism 3ageography 3aguidelines 3aindigenous knowledge 3aindigenous peoples 3ainterviews 3anational parks 3apoverty 3apublic sector 3aresource management 3astreams 3atourists 3aTaiwan0 tGeoJournal.g2012 Dec., v. 77, no. 6 p.805-815dSpringer-Verlagx0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-010-9373-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245012800151300001800279500002000297520142800317592002801745596006201773596006401835650002501899650001601924650001601940650001001956650001401966650001901980650001901999650001302018650001702031650001502048650001002063700001502073700001302088700001602101700005502117773012602172856007302298852000902371655001202380IND60789073620221119062434.0220818e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078907362DNAL7 a10.1002/wer.15722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing10aEnhanced photocatalytic degradation activity of Z‐scheme heterojunction BiVO4/Cu/g‐C3N4 under visible light irradiation  ap. 2010-2024.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA novel BiVO₄/Cu/g‐C₃N₄ heterostructure photocatalyst was synthesized by thermal condensation, hydrothermal, and in situ precipitation method. The microscopic morphology and chemical composition of the synthesized samples were analyzed by XRD, SEM, FT‐IR, XPS, and other characterizations. BiVO₄/Cu/g‐C₃N₄ (BiVO₄/Cu:g‐C₃N₄ mass ratio was 1:1) photocatalyst had the optimal photocatalytic degradation activity for tetracycline (TC) wastewater under visible light irradiation (120 min, 74.8%). The introduction of Cu and Z‐scheme heterojunction was further confirmed by UV‐vis, PL, EIS, and capture mechanism analysis, which effectively accelerated the separation and transfer rate of photogenerated electron holes and enhanced the strong oxidation of h⁺ and •O₂⁻ active species. BiVO₄/Cu/g‐C₃N₄ heterojunction photocatalytic material has potential application value in the removal of refractory pollutants in wastewater. PRACTITIONER POINTS: A novel Z‐scheme BiVO₄/Cu/g‐C₃N₄ photocatalyst with excellent photocatalytic activities and stability was prepared to treat tetracycline (TC) wastewater. 1:1 CBCN (BiVO₄/Cu:g‐C₃N₄ mass ratio was 1:1) photocatalyst exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance for TC wastewater. The Z‐scheme heterojunction and Cu act as the interfacial charge transfer medium accelerated the transfer and separation of carriers.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019‐JC03cShaanxi Key Laboratory of Land Consolidation  a2019JM‐429cShaanxi Nature Science Basic Research Program 3achemical composition 3aenvironment 3airradiation 3alight 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aresearch 3atetracycline 3awastewater 3awater1 aMa, Yuxuan1 aXu, Yuan1 aLi, Pengtao1 aGuo, Jifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1682-893X0 tWater environment research.g2021 Oct., v. 93, no. 10 p.2010-2024dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:21189x1061-43037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.15723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245007000183300001200253520083400265592002801099650004401127650001401171650001601185650001701201650001601218650001901234650001701253650001201270650001301282650002101295650001601316653002001332653001601352653002201368653001901390700002401409700002301433700001901456700001801475700002301493700002301516700002201539700002801561773011301589856008601702852000901788655001201797IND60565466020221121054120.0170709e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056546602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.03.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Túlio Ítalo S.10aBionanocomposite films based on polysaccharides from banana peels  ap. 1-8.  aPectin and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) isolated from banana peels were used to prepare films. The effects of a reinforcing phase (CNCs) and a crosslinker (citric acid, CA) on properties of pectin films were studied. Glycerol-plasticized films were prepared by casting, with different CNC contents (0–10wt%), with or without CA. Overall tensile properties were improved by intermediate CNC contents (around 5wt%). The water resistance and water vapor barrier properties were also enhanced by CNC. Evidences were found from Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra supporting the occurrence of crosslinking by CA. Additionally, the tensile strength, water resistance and barrier to water vapor were improved by the presence of CA. The 13C ssNMR spectra indicated that both CA and CNC promoted stiffening of the polymer chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acellulose 3acitric acid 3acrosslinking 3afruit peels 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3apectins 3apolymers 3atensile strength 3awater vapor 0aPolysaccharides 0aBiopolymers 0aBionanocomposites 0aFood packaging1 aRosa, Morsyleide F.1 aRidout, Michael J.1 aCross, Kathryn1 aBrito, Edy S.1 aSilva, Lorena M.A.1 aMazzetto, Selma E.1 aWaldron, Keith W.1 aAzeredo, Henriette M.C.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Aug., v. 101 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.03.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245007800208300001400286506007600300520115500376592002801531506003701559650002401596650002501620650001301645650001401658650002001672650001901692650002501711650003501736650003201771650001901803650002201822650002101844650001201865650001601877650001601893650001801909650001401927650003601941653000901977653000801986653001001994653000702004653000702011653000802018653001102026653001502037653001402052653001602066653001202082653001902094653002802113700001802141700002102159700002802180700002502208700002302233773009702256856008102353852000902434655001202443IND60551096020221207115255.0161016e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055109602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2015.04.0222doi7 aPMC46205502pmcid7 a259679512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerrazas, Cesar10aUncovering Leishmania–macrophage interplay using imaging flow cytometry  ap. 93-98.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHost–pathogen interaction is an area of considerable interest. Intracellular parasites such as Leishmania reside inside phagocytes such as macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. Macrophages can be activated by cytokines such as IFN-γ and Toll like receptor (TLR) agonists resulting in enhanced microbicidal activity. Leishmania parasites hijack the microbicidal function of macrophages, mainly by interfering with intracellular signaling initiated by IFN-γ and TLR ligands. Here we used transgenic Leishmania donovani parasites expressing the red fluorescent protein DsRed2 and imaging-flow cytometry technology to evaluate parasitic loads inside the macrophage in vitro. Further, this methodology enables us to visualize impairment in NFκB translocation to the nucleus in L. donovani infected macrophages. Additionally we show that uninfected bystander macrophages have a similar impairment in NFκB translocation as in L. donovani infected macrophages in response to the TLR4 agonist LPS. This evidence suggests a possible immunosuppressive role for infected macrophages in regulating the activation of uninfected bystander macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania donovani 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aagonists 3acytokines 3adendritic cells 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent proteins 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aimage analysis 3aimmunosuppression 3ainterferon-gamma 3aligands 3amacrophages 3aneutrophils 3aparasite load 3aparasites 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aBMDM 0aLPS 0aNFκB 0aCL 0aVL 0aTLR 0aIFN-γ 0aLeishmania 0aAutomated 0aMacrophages 0aImaging 0aFlow cytometry 0aIntracellular signaling1 aOghumu, Steve1 aVarikuti, Sanjay1 aMartinez-Saucedo, Diana1 aBeverley, Stephen M.1 aSatoskar, Abhay R.0 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2015 Aug., v. 423 p.93-98dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2015.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013000164300002000294520094100314592002801255596006401283596006401347650001101411650001401422650001101436650002101447650002101468650001201489650003101501650001301532650001601545650000901561650001401570650001401584650001101598700001601609700001801625700001401643700001401657700001401671700001401685773016901699856008301868852000901951655001201960IND60688843320221116202804.0201024e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068884332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-07840-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xianxi14aThe recycling of the expired donkey-hide gelatin pulp for N/S co-doped hollow carbon nano-spheres anode in sodium ion battery  ap. 13467-13476.  aHow to reasonably manage and reutilize the waste expired liquid medicines has always been a puzzling public concern. For this reason, the waste expired medicine of donkey-hide gelatin pulp was recycled by hydrothermal carbonization and hard template for N/S co-doped hard carbon material, and its electrochemical Na-storage performances were also evaluated. The results showed that the resultant N/S co-doped hard carbon material manifested the morphology of hollow nano-spheres with the mean diameter of about 242.3 nm and the shell thickness of about 15 nm; N and S elements evenly distributed in carbon structure by in situ co-doping. Furthermore, N/S co-doped hard carbon also delivered the satisfactory electrochemical Na-storage capacities due to the synergistic effect of the unique hollow nano-spheres with thin shell and N/S co-doping. No doubt, the results would promote the circular economy mode of waste expired medicines.  aPublisher supplied data  a51566006cthe National Natural Science Foundations of China  a51363011cthe National Natural Science Foundations of China 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acircular economy 3aelectrochemistry 3agelatin 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3amedicine 3ananospheres 3apulp 3arecycling 3asynergism 3awastes1 aYu, Chengyi1 aHou, Hongying1 aXu, Zhiyu1 aMeng, Kun1 aZhu, Jing1 aWang, Lei0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Apr., v. 27, no. 12 p.13467-13476dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-07840-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245013600174506011700310506007600427520137400503592002801877506003701905650002501942650001701967650001601984650001102000650001502011650001902026650001102045650002802056650001602084650002202100650001602122653002102138653003002159653002302189653002502212653001602237700001702253700002802270700002402298773012502322856008202447852000902529655001202538IND60793627220221207103008.0220929e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079362722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1139682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe la Peña-Armada, R.10aHigh hydrostatic pressure assisted by food-grade enzymes as a sustainable approach for the development of an antioxidant ingredient  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aApple is one of the most important fruits in the world. The elaboration of apple-based products such as cider or apple juice generates around 3–4.2 million tonnes of apple by-product that are annually discarded. Apple by-product has been described as an interesting source of bioactive compounds, including polyphenols. These valuable components, once extracted, could enable the usage of the apple by-product as a natural antioxidant ingredient. The aim of the present work was to address the effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), and HHP assisted by two alternative food-grade enzymes, Celluclast®, and Ultraflo®. For that purpose, the total phenolic content was measured by Folin-Ciocalteu and Fast-Blue BB assays. Furthermore, antioxidant capacity was determined by three analytical methods (DPPH, ORAC and FRAP) and the characterization of phenolic compounds was carried out by Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry analysis. Results indicated a significant increase of the total phenolic content and the antioxidant capacity after the HHP aided by Celluclast® or Ultraflo® treatment. Conversely, the exclusive application of HHP induced minor changes. Thus, the combination of HHP and the food-grade enzymes Celluclast® or Ultraflo®, has proved to be an effective strategy for the extraction of natural antioxidant compounds from the apple by-product.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapple juice 3aapples 3abyproducts 3achromatography 3aciders 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aingredients 3amass spectrometry 3apolyphenols 0aApple by-product 0aHigh hydrostatic pressure 0aFood-grade enzymes 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aPolyphenols1 aRupérez, P.1 aVillanueva-Suarez, M.J.1 aMateos-Aparicio, I.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 169 p.113968-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1139683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245016500168300001600333520177000349536032002119592002802439650003202467650001502499650001602514650002702530650003802557650001002595650001602605650001002621650001302631650001502644653003202659653001402691653004302705653001702748700002402765700002402789700001802813700001802831700001702849773013202866856008002998852000903078655001203087IND60615628520221117173250.0181011e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061562852DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387155924462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPannhorst, Katrin10aEvaluation of an Eʳⁿˢ-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to distinguish Classical swine fever virus–infected pigs from pigs vaccinated with CP7_E2alf  ap. 449-460.  aInfections with Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) are a major economic threat to pig production. To combat CSF outbreaks and to maintain trade, new marker vaccines were developed that allow differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA principle). The chimeric pestivirus CP7_E2alf was shown to be safe and efficacious. Its DIVA strategy is based on the detection of CSFV Eʳⁿˢ-specific antibodies that are only developed on infection. However, for the new marker vaccine to be considered a valuable control tool, a validated discriminatory assay is needed. One promising candidate is the already commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, PrioCHECK CSFV Eʳⁿˢ ELISA (Prionics BV, Lelystad, The Netherlands). Four laboratories of different European Union member states tested 530 serum samples and country-specific field sera from domestic pigs and wild boar. The ELISA displayed a good robustness. However, based on its reproducibility and repeatability, ranges rather than single values for diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were defined. The ELISA displayed a sensitivity of 90–98% with sera from CSFV-infected domestic pigs. A specificity of 89–96% was calculated with sera from domestic pigs vaccinated once with CP7_E2alf. The ELISA detected CSFV infections in vaccinated domestic pigs with a sensitivity of 82–94%. The sensitivity was lower with sera taken ≤21 days post-challenge indicating that the stage of CSFV infection had a considerable influence on testing. Taken together, the PrioCHECK CSFV Eʳⁿˢ ELISA can be used for detection of CSFV infections in CP7_E2alf-vaccinated and nonvaccinated domestic pig populations, but should only be applied on a herd basis by testing a defined number of animals.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement 227003 CP-FP (CSFV_goDIVA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aherds 3ahog cholera 3aswine 3avaccines 3awild boars 0aClassical swine fever virus 0aCP7_E2alf 0aDIVA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0aDIVA vaccine1 aFröhlich, Andreas,1 aStaubach, Christoph1 aMeyer, Denise1 aBlome, Sandra1 aBecher, Paul0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 27, no. 4 p.449-460dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387155924463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245012400178300002000302520124300322592002801565650002301593650002101616650002001637650001401657650001301671650001801684700006001702700003201762773015601794856008301950852000902033655001202042IND60750769220221120103825.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075076922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14314-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarif Sanayei, Hamed Reza10aAssessment of confined aquifer response to recharge variations and water inflow distributions using analytical approach  ap. 50878-50889.  aQuantification of the amount of the exchanged water between the surface water and a confined aquifer is a basic step in water balance and environmental hydraulics. The hydraulic connection between a surface water and a confined aquifer may occur through different recharge variations. The current research presents new analytical solutions for confined aquifer response to recharge variations and different inflow distributions. Different cases were studied, where a constant piezometric head is applied at the right boundary of the 2D confined aquifer plane and various distributions of water inflow through the recharging windows are considered on a part and/or parts of the left boundary. Finally, a uniform water inflow distribution on parts of the left boundary and a uniform distribution of water outflow at the right boundary was considered. Both steady and unsteady state problems can be solved using proposed equations. The performance of developed analytical solutions was examined compared to the numerical finite difference modeling. The results show reasonable precision of the developed analytical solutions. The developed solutions can be used as a benchmark to verify numerical approaches with similar boundary conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aconfined aquifer 3afluid mechanics 3apollution 3aresearch 3asurface water1 aJavdanian, Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9921-31851 aRakhshandehroo, Gholam Reza0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 36 p.50878-50889dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14314-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245018000171300001600351520118100367592002801548650003901576650001101615650001901626650002401645650001301669650001501682650002701697650002201724653000801746653001001754653000801764653000801772653000801780653001101788653002601799653001801825653002501843700001801868700002101886700002001907700001801927700001901945700001901964773012101983856008202104852000902186655001202195IND60089677320221121033613.0160728e20130104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008967732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.10.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTondera, Christoph10aVisualization of cyclooxygenase-2 using a 2,3-diarylsubstituted indole-based inhibitor and confocal laser induced cryofluorescence microscopy at 20K in melanoma cells in vitro  ap. 301-306.  aThis study aimed at visualization of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expression in melanoma cells by confocal laser induced cryofluorescence microscopy using 4-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-indol-2-yl)benzene-sulfonamide (C1) representative for a novel class of autofluorescent 2,3-diarylsubstituted indole-based selective COX-2 inhibitors.COX-2 expression was measured in human melanoma cell lines A2058 and MelJuso by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting.

Control experiments using celecoxib and, additionally, implemented fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed specificity of both cellular uptake and intracellular association of C1.Cryofluorescence microscopy in combination with spectroscopy allowed for visualization of COX-2 protein expression in melanoma cells in vitro using a selective COX-2 inhibitor at very low concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3aimmunocytochemistry 3amelanoma 3amicroscopy 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotein synthesis 0aBSA 0aCOX-2 0aFCS 0aPBS 0aTPA 0aCoxibs 0aTumor inflammogenesis 0aPigment cells 0aFluorescence imaging1 aLaube, Markus1 aWimmer, Christin1 aKniess, Torsten1 aMosch, Birgit1 aGroßmann, Kay1 aPietzsch, Jens0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Jan. 04, v. 430 p.301-306dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.10.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006900167300002000236520094400256592002801200596007901228596007601307596005901383596005501442650002701497650001601524650002401540650002001564650000901584650001701593650002101610650001501631650001501646650001701661650001301678650001401691650001201705650002501717700001701742700001101759700001801770700001601788700001401804700005301818773016901871856008302040852000902123655001202132IND60688843420221116202741.0201024e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068884342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-07858-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaofang10aCharacterization of binding interaction of triclosan and trypsin  ap. 13409-13416.  aTriclosan (TCS), a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, exhibits a high exposure in the environment. However, the residual TCS in the environment poses a potential risk to human health. In this study, spectroscopic methods, molecular docking and animal experiment were conducted to completely understand the interaction between trypsin and TCS. The formation of the TCS-trypsin complex was spontaneously achieved through hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces with a binding constant (Kₐ) between 10³ and 10⁴ L mol⁻¹. In addition, the trypsin activity in fish intestine was inhibited by TCS exposure, revealing the potentially negative effects of TCS on metabolism. The results might be explained by changes in the conformation of the trypsin, inducing the content of unordered coil increasing significantly (from 36.2% to over 80%). This work provides useful information for assessing the toxicity of TCS at the molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data  a21307043, 21577083, 21506076cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017ZX07203001cNational Major Science and Technology Projects of China  a2016M590411cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China  a1601230CcJiangsu Postdoctoral Research Foundation 3aanimal experimentation 3aantibiotics 3acomputer simulation 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3ahuman health 3ahydrogen bonding 3aintestines 3ametabolism 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 3atriclosan 3atrypsin 3avan der Waals forces1 aHui, Hongjie1 aYu, An1 aJiang, Ziyang1 aYu, Hongyan1 aZou, Luyi1 aTeng, Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2115-72480 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Apr., v. 27, no. 12 p.13409-13416dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-07858-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245017000163300001400333520179900347592002802146650002802174650001002202650001602212650001302228650001902241650001902260650001802279650002602297650001902323650002202342650002002364650001702384653000902401653001002410653000902420653000902429653000702438653000802445653000802453653002902461653002702490653000702517653001002524653001002534653001602544700002502560700002002585700002102605773009702626856008102723852000902804655001202813IND60551096220221121152825.0161016e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055109622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2015.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHazin, John12aA novel method for measuring cellular antibody uptake using imaging flow cytometry reveals distinct uptake rates for two different monoclonal antibodies targeting L1  ap. 70-77.  aMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as a promising tool for cancer therapy. Differing approaches utilize mAbs to either deliver a drug to the tumor cells or to modulate the host's immune system to mediate tumor kill. The rate by which a therapeutic antibody is being internalized by tumor cells is a decisive feature for choosing the appropriate treatment strategy. We herein present a novel method to effectively quantitate antibody uptake of tumor cells by using image-based flow cytometry, which combines image analysis with high throughput of sample numbers and sample size. The use of this method is established by determining uptake rate of an anti-EpCAM antibody (HEA125), from single cell measurements of plasma membrane versus internalized antibody, in conjunction with inhibitors of endocytosis. The method is then applied to two mAbs (L1-9.3, L1-OV52.24) targeting the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM) at two different epitopes. Based on median cell population responses, we find that mAb L1-OV52.24 is rapidly internalized by the ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3ip while L1 mAb 9.3 is mainly retained at the cell surface. These findings suggest the L1 mAb OV52.24 as a candidate to be further developed for drug-delivery to cancer cells, while L1-9.3 may be optimized to tag the tumor cells and stimulate immunogenic cancer cell killing. Furthermore, when analyzing cell-to-cell variability, we observed L1 mAb OV52.24 rapidly transition into a subpopulation with high-internalization capacity. In summary, this novel high-content method for measuring antibody internalization rate provides a high level of accuracy and sensitivity for cell population measurements and reveals further biologically relevant information when taking into account cellular heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell adhesion molecules 3adrugs 3aendocytosis 3aepitopes 3aflow cytometry 3aimage analysis 3aimmune system 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneoplasm cells 3aovarian neoplasms 3aplasma membrane 3atherapeutics 0amAbs 0aEpCAM 0aADCC 0aLSCM 0aL1 0aWGA 0aISX 0aAntibody internalization 0aImaging flow cytometry 0aL1 0aL1CAM 0aEpCAM 0aEndocytosis1 aMoldenhauer, Gerhard1 aAltevogt, Peter1 aBrady, Nathan R.0 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2015 Aug., v. 423 p.70-77dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2015.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245022500168300001600393520105500409536053001464592002801994650003002022650001502052650002802067650000902095650001902104650001102123653002802134653001402162653001802176653003002194700002202224700002102246700001902267700002202286700002002308700002202328700002202350700002902372773013202401856008002533961001302613852000902626655001202635IND60615628720221117173246.0181011e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061562872DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387155933682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpraker, Terry R.10aProgressive accumulation of the abnormal conformer of the prion protein and spongiform encephalopathy in the obex of nonsymptomatic and symptomatic Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) with chronic wasting disease  ap. 431-441.  aThe purpose of our study was to describe the progressive accumulation of the abnormal conformer of the prion protein (PrPCᵂᴰ) and spongiform degeneration in a single section of brain stem in Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) with chronic wasting disease (CWD). A section of obex from 85 CWD-positive elk was scored using the presence and abundance of PrPCᵂᴰ immunoreactivity and spongiform degeneration in 10 nuclear regions and the presence and abundance of PrPCᵂᴰ in 10 axonal tracts, the subependymal area of the fourth ventricle, and the thin subpial astrocytic layer (glial limitans). Data was placed in a formula to generate an overall obex score. Data suggests that PrPCᵂᴰ immunoreactivity and spongiform degeneration has a unique and relatively consistent pattern of progression throughout a section of obex. This scoring technique utilizing a single section of obex may prove useful in future work for estimating the presence and abundance of PrPCᵂᴰ in peripheral tissues and the nervous system in elk with CWD.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was partially funded by National Park Service project no.

The bacteriocin-WUH3 and bacteriocin-M4L1, using ethyl acetate, anion exchange, gel chromatography, and RP-HPLC, were purified for identifying the bacteriocins and mining silent genes. The molecular weight of bacteriocin-WUH3 measured by MALDI-TOF-MS was 4299.801 Da, highly matched with the molecular weight of Plantaricin E analyzed by whole-genome sequencing. Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis predicted the amino acid sequence of novel bacteriocin-M4L1 and molecular weight as 3748.9643 Da. The whole-genome sequencing results were compared with Bagel4 to determine the bacteriocin encoded by Lactobacillus plantarum, and then the genes encoding bacteriocin were mined through uniport. The results of whole-genome sequencing and mass spectrometry showed that the expression levels of Enterocin _ X _ chain _ beta, Pediocin, Plantaricin K, and Plantaricin EF were very low, so the genes encoding these bacteriocins were silent. Mining silenced genes can provide functional gene donors for subsequent expression, regulate bacteriocin synthesis and improve production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aamino acid sequences 3aanion exchange 3aethyl acetate 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aplantaricins 0aBacteriocin 0aMass spectrum 0aWhole-genome sequencing 0aMine1 aGuo, Lidan1 aZhang, Xiaoyan1 aMu, Haoqiang1 aSha, Shenfei1 aLin, Yi1 aHou, Hongwei1 aWang, Liping0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 169 p.113975-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1139753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245014300210300001100353506007600364520159200440592002802032596005602060506003702116650001202153650001002165650002502175650001302200650001502213650002002228650001402248650001902262650001902281650002202300650001302322650004302335650005202378650000902430650003502439700002002474700002402494700002202518700002502540700001902565773010802584856008202692852000902774655001202783IND60647021520221207105216.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064702152DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-019-1187-82doi7 aPMC65675792pmcid7 a311962042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeshavarz, Mohsen10aAssociation of polymorphisms in inflammatory cytokines encoding genes with severe cases of influenza A/H1N1 and B in an Iranian population  ap. 79.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The increased levels of blood cytokines is the main immunopathological process that were attributed to severe clinical outcomes in cases of influenza A, influenza B and people with influenza-like illness (ILI). Functional genetic polymorphisms caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in inflammatory cytokines genes can influence their functions either qualitatively or quantitatively, which is associated with the possibility of severe influenza infections. The aim of the present case-control study was to investigate the association of polymorphisms in inflammatory cytokines genes with influenza patients and ILI group in an Iranian population. METHODS: Total number of 30 influenza B, 50 influenza A (H1N1) and 96 ILI inpatient individuals were confirmed by Real-time RT-PCR and HI assays. The genotype determination was assessed for defined SNPs in IL-1β, IL-17, IL-10 and IL-28 genes. RESULTS: The frequencies of the IL-1β rs16944 (P = 0.007) and IL-17 rs2275913 (P = 0.006) genotypes were associated with severe influenza disease, while the frequencies of IL-10 rs1800872 and IL-28 rs8099917 were not associated with the disease (P > 0.05). Also, the absence of A allele in IL-17 rs2275913 SNP increased the risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that influenza A- (H1N1) and B-infected patients and also ILI controls have different profiles of immune parameters, and individuals carrying the specific cytokine-derived polymorphisms may show different immune responses towards severe outcome.  aPublisher supplied data  aD/96/MB/1837cTehran University of Medical Sciences0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3ablood 3acase-control studies 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aimmune response 3ainfluenza 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-1beta 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aNamdari, Haideh1 aFarahmand, Mohammad1 aMehrbod, Parvaneh1 aMokhtari-Azad, Talat1 aRezaei, Farhad0 tVirology journal.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.79-79dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1187-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245008000204300001600284506007600300520125400376592002801630506003701658650001501695650001401710650002001724650001901744650001901763650002001782650001101802650001601813650002601829650001601855650002601871650001801897650001201915653003501927653001901962653001501981653001501996700001902011700002302030773009902053856008102152852000902233655001202242IND60551096520221207103916.0161016e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055109652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2015.04.0272doi7 aPMC45221972pmcid7 a260036242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wenpu12aA novel image-based quantitative method for the characterization of NETosis  ap. 104-110.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNETosis is a newly recognized mechanism of programmed neutrophil death. It is characterized by a stepwise progression of chromatin decondensation, membrane rupture, and release of bactericidal DNA-based structures called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Conventional ‘suicidal’ NETosis has been described in pathogenic models of systemic autoimmune disorders. Recent in vivo studies suggest that a process of ‘vital’ NETosis also exists, in which chromatin is condensed and membrane integrity is preserved. Techniques to assess ‘suicidal’ or ‘vital’ NET formation in a specific, quantitative, rapid and semiautomated way have been lacking, hindering the characterization of this process. Here we have developed a new method to simultaneously assess both ‘suicidal’ and ‘vital’ NETosis, using high-speed multi-spectral imaging coupled to morphometric image analysis, to quantify spontaneous NET formation observed ex-vivo or stimulus-induced NET formation triggered in vitro. The use of imaging flow cytometry allows automated, quantitative and rapid analysis of subcellular morphology and texture, and introduces the potential for further investigation using NETosis as a biomarker in pre-clinical and clinical studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3achromatin 3aclinical trials 3aflow cytometry 3aimage analysis 3ain vivo studies 3amodels 3amorphometry 3amultispectral imagery 3aneutrophils 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 3atexture 0aNeutrophil extracellular traps 0aFlow cytometry 0aMicroscopy 0aCell death1 aFogg, Darin K.1 aKaplan, Mariana J.0 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2015 Aug., v. 423 p.104-110dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2015.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010200170300001600272520132300288592002801611650001601639650002501655650001201680650001301692650001501705650002601720650001301746650001101759650001601770650001201786773010001798852000901898856008801907655001201995IND4381633620221118040914.0160420e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438163362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01592.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmithson, Ann10aPollinator limitation and inbreeding depression in orchid species with and without nectar rewards  ap. 419-430.  a• Many orchids produce no nectar rewards. Foraging pollinators should visit more flowers per inflorescence in species with nectar, which could increase geitonogamous self‐fertilization. If a history of selfing decreases genetic load, then nectar‐producing orchids should harbour lower inbreeding depression than nectarless species. • Here, I tested this hypothesis by quantifying inbreeding depression and pollinator limitation in populations of three closely related orchid species, one of which provides nectar. I also compared inbreeding depression for nectarless and nectar‐producing species of orchids using published studies. • All field populations expressed pollinator limitation, but the nectar‐providing species was intermediate to the two nectarless species. All populations expressed inbreeding depression, and levels increased in later life‐history stages. There was no tendency for nectarless species to express higher inbreeding depression either in experiments or published studies. • Nectarless orchids may not express higher levels of inbreeding depression because pollinators fail to visit more flowers in nectar‐bearing species, because such visitations do not result in greater selfing, and/or because higher selfing may be ineffective in purging the mutations that cause load.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrchidaceae 3adevelopmental stages 3aflowers 3aforaging 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding depression 3amutation 3anectar 3apollinators 3aselfing0 tnew phytologist.g2006 Jan., v. 169, no. 2 p.419-430dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01592.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02504naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006200172300001600234520117700250592002801427650001301455650002301468650002101491650001301512650002001525650001001545650001001555650001101565650002401576650001901600650002201619650001201641650001301653653002301666653001701689653002101706653001301727653001901740700001901759700002001778700002401798773011701822856008601939852000902025655001202034IND60565466720221121042839.0170711e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056546672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Célia F.10aPeptide—protein interactions within human hair keratins  ap. 805-814.  aWe selected 1235 decapeptides from human hair proteins encoded by human genes of keratins and keratin associated proteins. The peptides were linked to glass arrays and screened for their affinity towards a solution of human hair extracted keratin fraction. Based on the physicochemical properties of the peptides, ten variables were studied: content of different types of amino acid side chains (cysteine, hydrophobic, polar, basic, acidic, aromatic rings, amide, alcohol side chains), isoelectric point, and net charge. We found differences statistically significant on the binding affinity of peptides based on their content of cysteine, hydrophobic and polar amino acids, mainly containing alcohols. These results point to the formation of hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds between small peptides and human hair keratins as the main driving forces for the interaction of possible cosmetic peptides, namely designed to strength human hair. As so, our results enlighten the nature of the interaction of keratin based materials with human hair, which are claimed to enhance hair fiber strength, and enable a more directed and sustained hair care peptide design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaromatic compounds 3abinding capacity 3acysteine 3adisulfide bonds 3agenes 3aglass 3ahumans 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aisoelectric point 3akeratin 3apeptides 0aPeptide microarray 0aHair keratin 0aCosmetic peptide 0aCysteine 0aHydrophobicity1 aAzoia, Nuno G.1 aMatamá, Teresa1 aCavaco-Paulo, Artur0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Aug., v. 101 p.805-814dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245011000199300001600309500002000325520159300345592002801938596014001966650001502106650002602121650001602147650001002163650001102173650001402184650000902198650001102207650001302218650001902231650001202250650004802262650001302310650001702323650002102340700001302361700001802374700001402392700001702406700001702423773011002440856008002550852000902630655001202639IND60790367120221119134338.0220824e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079036712DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.130262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6403-935610aMiR‐22 modulates the expression of lipogenesis‐related genes and promotes hepatic steatosis in vitro  ap. 322-332.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly correlated with obesity, and lifestyle changes to reduce weight remain the main therapeutic approach. The noncoding RNA miR‐22 has previously been reported to be highly abundant in the sera of NAFLD patients. In addition, miR‐22 directly targets peroxisome proliferative‐activated receptor, Pgc‐1α, peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor α, and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which are important factors involved in fatty acid metabolism. Given that miR‐22 directly targets genes involved in the control of metabolism and obesity, we investigated whether miR‐22 contributes to metabolic alterations induced by obesity. We observed increased expression of miR‐22, decreased expression of Sirt1, and alterations in the expression of adipogenesis‐related genes in a mouse model of obesity and a human hepatocyte cell line. We identified that miR‐22 and the 3′‐UTR of Sirt1 are complementary. Mutation of the complementary fragment abolishes the ability of miR‐22 to regulate the Sirt1 gene. Furthermore, treatment of hepatic steatosis cells with miR‐22 mimics or inhibitors showed that miR‐22 can promote hepatic steatosis, and miR‐22 inhibitors effectively reduced triglyceride levels without affecting cell activity. Finally, we validated that miR‐22 has similar effects on downstream lipid metabolism‐related genes. Our data reveal the pathways and mechanisms through which miR‐22 regulates lipid metabolism and suggest that miR‐22 inhibitors may have potential as candidate drugs for NAFLD and obesity.  aPublisher supplied data  a131031107000160002cOperating Project of Public Health Emergency Response Mechanism of National Institute for Nutrition and Health, CDC 3acell lines 3afatty acid metabolism 3afatty liver 3agenes 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3amice 3amodels 3amutation 3anon-coding RNA 3aobesity 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3asirtuins 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols1 aQin, Wen1 aHuo, Junsheng1 aZhuo, Qin1 aWang, Jingbo1 aWang, Liyuan0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2021 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.322-332dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.130263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245013000203300001600333500001900349520145100368592002801819650002301847650004401870650001501914650001901929650002701948650002201975650002301997650004402020650001802064650002002082650002502102650001802127650001302145650001502158650001402173653001102187653001902198653001502217653001702232653003002249700001702279773014602296856008302442852000902525655001202534IND60676534520221120213829.0200210e20200205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067653452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Yiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0248-659610aEffects of separation and purification on structural characteristics of polysaccharide from quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa willd)  ap. 286-291.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of separation and purification on structural characteristics of polysaccharide from quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd) was investigated. Using quinoa as raw material, the quinoa polysaccharide (QP) was extracted by ultrasonic-assisted method and isolated and purified to obtain three sub-fractions (QPI, QPI-I, QPI-I-I) by resin adsorption, anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography, respectively. After separation and purification, the polysaccharide content of quinoa polysaccharide increased from 83.29% to 90.12%. XRD and Congo red experiments showed that this process contributed to the formation of crystal structure and triple helix structure. Moreover, the intensity of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ¹H and ¹³C Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), particle size, dispersion index gradually decreased according to separation and purification, which indicated that a more uniform and stable polysaccharide structure was formed. In addition, FT-IR, ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR analysis showed that QP, QPI, QPI-I, QPI-I-I were all neutral polysaccharides. The above results suggested that the separation and purification process significantly enhanced the stability of polysaccharide structure. In this process, the aggregation state changed with the polarity change, and the final structure changed, which led to the change of its solubility, viscosity and other physical and chemical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aanion exchange 3acarbohydrate structure 3acrystal structure 3agel chromatography 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size 3apolysaccharides 3apurification methods 3araw materials 3aresearch 3asolubility 3aviscosity 0aQuinoa 0aPolysaccharide 0aSeparation 0aPurification 0aStructural characteristic1 aLiu, Shuxing0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 522, no. 2 p.286-291dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245016500176300001800341520099700359592002801356650002001384650001301404650002601417650001501443650000901458650001901467650001601486650005101502650004101553650005501594650004401649650001301693650001901706650003701725650002001762653001001782653001401792653001201806653001501818653001001833653001301843700002301856700001601879700001901895700002001914773013201934852000902066856007502075655001202150IND4465139820221119042938.0160905e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446513982DNAL7 a233796922pmid7 a10.1021/jf305003h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStahl, Thorsten10aLong-Term Lysimeter Experiment To Investigate the Leaching of Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) and the Carry-over from Soil to Plants: Results of a Pilot Study  ap. 1784-1793.  aTo study the behavior of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in soil and the carry-over from soil to plants, technical mixtures of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at a concentration of 25 mg/kg soil were applied to 1.5 m³ monolithic soil columns of a lysimeter. Growth samples and percolated water were analyzed for PFASs throughout a period of 5 years. In addition to PFOA/PFOS plant compartments and leachate were found to be contaminated with short-chain PFASs. Calculation showed significant decreasing trends (p < 0.05) for all substances tested in the growth samples. Short-chain PFASs and PFOA pass through the soil much more quickly than PFOS. Of the 360 g of PFOA and 367.5 g of PFOS applied to the soil, 96.88% PFOA and 99.98% PFOS were still present in the soil plot of the lysimeter after a period of 5 years.

Bioconcentration, bioaccumulation and translocation factors were estimated in 10 individuals of each investigating plant species. The plant and soil samples used in the research were collected along the National Highway-76 from Chittorgarh to Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. The concentration of cadmium and lead in roadside soil, plant roots, stems and leaves shows a correlation. The highest bioconcentration factor of Cd and Pb was 0.22 ± 0.04 and 0.13 ± 0.02 estimated in Bougainvillea spectabilis Willd. The highest translocation factor of Cd was 1.30 ± 0.50 in Pongamia pinnata L., and the highest translocation factor of Pb was 1.63 ± 0.45 estimated for Nerium oleander L. The average concentrations of Cd and Pb were 11.35 ± 1.60 and 223.70 ± 68 mg kg⁻¹ in investigated roadside soil. The average concentrations of accumulated Cd and Pb in B. spectabilisWilld. were 2.38 ± 0.49, 1.97 ± 0.51, 3.07 ± 0.78 and 29.34 ± 7.82,18.96 ± 5.62, 37.75 ± 12.93 mg kg⁻¹ in roots, stems and leaves, respectively.

Variations in the timing of passage during autumn and spring migration can have consequences at individual and population levels. We assessed whether global climatic indexes and increasing air temperature over a 28 yr period were concurrent with shifts in the autumn migration phenology of 16 eastern North American raptor species. We used count data from 7 eastern North American raptor-migration watch sites and examined whether key species-specific traits such as migration strategy (complete vs. partial and trans-equatorial vs. not), diet specialization, body mass, flight strategy (soaring vs. flapping), and latitude of the northern limit of breeding distribution were associated with a shift in the timing of autumn migration. Our results suggest an overall delay across species in autumn migration passage date of ∼1 day decade⁻¹, which coincided with an increase in temperature across eastern North America. This shift in average autumn passage date was more pronounced in short-distance migrants (+1.03 days decade⁻¹); no shift was detected in trans-equatorial migrants. Although we did not detect clear links between annual climatic indexes and the other life-history traits studied, the results nonetheless indicate that the autumn migration phenology of eastern North American raptors may be delayed by ongoing climate change. However, the amplitude of these effects varies on a species-by-species basis. Our results—combined with new evidence of an earlier passage during spring migration for the same species in the same area—suggest that, since 1985, most raptors spent ∼2 additional days decade⁻¹ north of our study's migration sites. Such an increase in time spent at northern latitudes in a large number of terrestrial avian predators over a wide geographic area may have profound impacts on population and ecosystem dynamics. Unraveling such impacts will require linking interspecific and intraspecific variations in phenological adjustments to ongoing climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3abirds of prey 3abreeding 3aclimate change 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aflight 3alatitude 3alife history 3aphenology 3aspring 3aNorth America 0aclimate change 0alife-history traits 0amigration 0aNorth America 0aphenology 0araptors1 aLecomte, Nicolas1 aZgirski, Thomas1 aJaffré, Mikaël,1 aBeardsell, Andréanne1 aGoodrich, Laurie J.1 aBêty, Joël1 aFranke, Alastair1 aZlonis, Edmund1 aBildstein, Keith L.0 tAuk.g2017 Oct., v. 134, no. 4 p.871-881dThe American Ornithologists' UnionwJournal:19765x1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-17-5.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245008800205300001600293520094800309592002801257650002201285650001501307650003801322650002201360650001601382650001301398650001601411650002301427653003001450653002401480653002501504653001401529700006101543773010001604856008501704852000901789655001201798IND60546492220221118150235.0160903e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054649222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8234-263410aPreparation of sub-micron nitrocellulose particles for improved combustion behavior  ap. 224-228.  aA novel method to prepare sub-micron nitrocellulose particles with spherical shape is demonstrated.

Ciliates provide an opportunity for the discovery of factors that specifically contribute to chromosome segregation based on a bipolar spindle, by identification of factors that affect the micronuclear but not the macronuclear division. Kinesin‐14 is a conserved minus‐end directed microtubule motor that cross‐links microtubules and contributes to the bipolar spindle sizing and organization. Here, we use homologous DNA recombination to knock out genes that encode kinesin‐14 orthologues (KIN141, KIN142) in Tetrahymena. A loss of KIN141 led to severe defects in the chromosome segregation during both mitosis and meiosis but did not affect amitosis. A loss of KIN141 altered the shape of the meiotic spindle in a way consistent with the KIN141's contribution to the organization of the spindle poles. EGFP‐tagged KIN141 preferentially accumulated at the spindle poles during the meiotic prophase and metaphase I. Thus, in ciliates, kinesin‐14 is important for nuclear divisions that involve a bipolar spindle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aTetrahymena thermophila 3achromosome segregation 3acrosslinking 3agenes 3ameiosis 3ametaphase 3amicrotubules 3amitosis 3aprophase1 aTakaine, Masak1 aNakano, Kentaro1 aSugai, Toshiro1 aVasudevan, Krishna Kumar1 aGuha, Mayukh1 aJiang, Yu‐Yang1 aGaertig, Jacek1 aNumata, Osamu0 tjournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2017 May, v. 64, no. 3 p.293-307dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl49624x1066-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeu.123663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04113naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245015700193300001800350500002000368520189100388592002802279596005502307596007102362650002502433650002802458650002302486650002602509650002902535650002502564650001802589650001902607650002002626650002602646650001902672650001002691650003302701650001902734650001902753650003002772650002002802650001502822650001602837650002102853650001202874650001302886650002902899650002602928650001102954700001602965700001702981700001302998700001703011700001603028700001303044700001903057700001803076700001503094700001203109700001503121700002103136700001703157700001903174773011603193856007303309852000903382655001203391IND60743179020221117084643.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074317902DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.152492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4276-248X10aBdFAR4, a root‐specific fatty acyl‐coenzyme A reductase, is involved in fatty alcohol synthesis of root suberin polyester in Brachypodium distachyon  ap. 1468-1483.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSuberin is a complex hydrophobic polymer of aliphatic and phenolic compounds which controls the movement of gases, water, and solutes and protects plants from environmental stresses and pathogenic infection. The synthesis and regulatory pathways of suberin remain unknown in Brachypodium distachyon. Here we describe the identification of a B. distachyon gene, BdFAR4, encoding a fatty acyl‐coenzyme A reductase (FAR) by a reverse genetic approach, and investigate the molecular relevance of BdFAR4 in the root suberin synthesis of B. distachyon. BdFAR4 is specifically expressed throughout root development. Heterologous expression of BdFAR4 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) afforded the production of C20:0 and C22:0 fatty alcohols. The loss‐of‐function knockout of BdFAR4 by CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated gene editing significantly reduced the content of C20:0 and C22:0 fatty alcohols associated with root suberin. In contrast, overexpression of BdFAR4 in B. distachyon and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) resulted in the accumulation of root suberin‐associated C20:0 and C22:0 fatty alcohols, suggesting that BdFAR4 preferentially accepts C20:0 and C22:0 fatty acyl‐CoAs as substrates. The BdFAR4 protein was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts and Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells. BdFAR4 transcript levels can be increased by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid treatment. Furthermore, yeast one‐hybrid, dual‐luciferase activity, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the R2R3‐MYB transcription factor BdMYB41 directly binds to the promoter of BdFAR4. Taken together, these results imply that BdFAR4 is essential for the production of root suberin‐associated fatty alcohols, especially under stress conditions, and that its activity is transcriptionally regulated by the BdMYB41 transcription factor.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018T111107cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2019JZ‐19cNatural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabscisic acid 3aacid treatment 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afatty alcohols 3agenes 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahydrophobicity 3aleaf epidermis 3aloss-of-function mutation 3aoxidoreductases 3apolyesters 3aprotoplasts 3areverse genetics 3asuberin 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts1 aXu, Jiajing1 aHe, Zhaofeng1 aHu, Ning1 aLuo, Wenqiao1 aLiu, Xiaoyu1 aShi, Xue1 aLiu, Tianxiang1 aJiang, Qinqin1 aAn, Peipei1 aLiu, Le1 aSun, Yulin1 aJetter, Reinhard1 aLi, Chunlian1 aWang, Zhonghua0 tplant journal.g2021 June, v. 106, no. 5 p.1468-1483dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.152493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008400165520130700249592002801556650001501584650002501599650001601624650002001640650002301660650001101683650002601694650001301720650001601733650001801749650001501767650001901782650003201801650001401833650001301847650003501860650001601895653003601911653001401947653001801961653001501979653002301994700001902017700002502036700001902061700002002080773012202100856008102222852000902303655001202312IND60702535320221121113920.0220103e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070253532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1098822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapoor, Swati10aExtraction and characterization of guava seed oil: A novel industrial byproduct  aGuava processing industry generates seed and peel as major waste fractions with seeds being a promising source of oil. Guava seed oil extracted from the dried seeds using solvent extraction resulted in 13.63% higher oil yield as compared to supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. Guava seed oil as characterized by Gas chromatography (GC) was found to be rich in poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), particularly linoleic acid (75.25%), one of the essential fatty acids whereas among mono unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), oleic acid contributed majorly. Total saturated fatty acids amounted up to 13.52% of total fatty acids. Physico-chemical properties revealed guava seed oil to be quite stable due to its low acid value (0.40 ± 0.02 mg KOH/mg) and peroxide value (0.62 ± 0.05%). Sufficient amount of tocopherols (654 ± 11.00 ppm) and carotenoids (19.24 ± 0.38 ppm) were found in guava seed oil. Antioxidant activity was found to be 58.90%. Thermal properties like melting and crystallization behavior was also studied. Around 33 volatile constituents were found in guava seed oil with major contribution by fatty acid esters. The study outlines nutritional significance of guava seed oil to be utilized as functional ingredient for the development and formulation of new food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid value 3aantioxidant activity 3acarotenoids 3acrystallization 3agas chromatography 3aguavas 3aindustrial byproducts 3aindustry 3aingredients 3alinoleic acid 3aoleic acid 3aperoxide value 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aseed oils 3asolvents 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atocopherols 0aSuper critical fluid extraction 0aViscosity 0aLinoleic acid 0aTocopherol 0aThermal properties1 aGandhi, Neeraj1 aTyagi, Sanjeev Kumar1 aAmarjeet Kaur,1 aMahajan, B.V.C.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Oct., v. 132 p.109882-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1098823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03667naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245010400186300001600290520221300306592002802519650002502547650001702572650001602589650001302605650001102618650000902629650001302638650001302651650001702664650000902681650002202690650002602712650001202738650001002750650002102760650001202781653000802793653001002801653001802811653001602829653001602845700001502861700002102876700001902897700001902916773011102935856008203046852000903128655001203137IND60516104120221120102457.0190804e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051610412DNAL7 a243082982pmid7 a10.1017/S175173111300222X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStavrakakis, S.10aLongitudinal gait development and variability of growing pigs reared on three different floor types  ap. 338-346.  aBiomechanical investigation into locomotor pathology in commercial pigs is lacking despite this being a major concern for the industry.

Previous studies have compared pigs housed on different floor types using clinical, subjective assessment of leg weakness and lameness. However, reliability studies generally report a low repeatability of clinical lameness scoring. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess the long-term effect of pen floors, reflected in the biomechanical gait characteristics and associated welfare of the pigs. A cohort of 24 pigs housed on one of three different floor types was followed from 37 to 90 kg average liveweight, with gait analysis (motion capture) starting at 63 kg. The three floor types were fully slatted concrete, partly slatted concrete and deep straw-bedded surfaces, all located within the same building. Pigs underwent five repeated camera-based motion captures, 7 to 10 days apart, during which 3D coordinate data of reflective skin markers attached to leg anatomical landmarks were collected. Pigs walked on the same solid concrete walkway during captures. One-way ANOVA and repeated measures ANOVA were used to analyse the gait data. Results revealed changes over time in the spatiotemporal gait pattern which were similar in magnitude and direction for the pigs from different floor types. Significant increases in elbow joint flexion with age were observed in all pigs (P⩽0.050; +6°). There were few differences between floor groups, except for the step-to-stride ratio in the hind legs being more irregular in pigs housed on partly slatted floors (P=0.012; 3.6 times higher s.d.) compared with those on 5 to 10 cm straw-bedding in all pen areas. As the level of clinical problems was generally low in this cohort, it may be that floors elicit problems only when there is a primary predisposing factor increasing weakness in susceptible tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abiomechanics 3abody weight 3aconcrete 3afloors 3agait 3aindustry 3alameness 3aleg weakness 3alegs 3along term effects 3aproduction technology 3arearing 3aswine 3aswine production 3atissues 0apig 0afloor 0agait analysis 0avariability 0adevelopment1 aGuy, J.

In mycobacteria, there is a scarcity of such intrinsic terminators. However, secondary structures having G/C-rich stem devoid of any U’s or with suboptimal U-tracts were identified earlier as terminators and found to be functional both in vitro and in vivo. Two different observations - that a mycobacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) does not function at intrinsic terminators devoid of U-tracts and the identification of an altogether new motif for termination in mycobacteria necessitated re-examining a number of putative terminators for their function as terminators. When these in silico identified non-canonical terminators were subjected to experimental validation, they were found to dissociate RNA from the elongating RNAP. Termination is observed when the U-tracts were reduced, or totally absent both in vitro and in vivo. Our results, thus indicate that the presence of U-tract following the G/C-rich stem in an intrinsic terminator may not be an essential determinant for transcription termination in mycobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA 3acomputer simulation 3aresearch 3atranscription termination 0aTranscription 0aIntrinsic termination 0aMycobacteria 0aGene expression 0aRNA polymerase 0aRNAP 0aTEC 0aEC 0aGeSTer 0aTRIT 0aMsRNAP 0aSigA1 aHegde, Shubhada R.1 aNagaraja, V.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9711-59330 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Jan. 29, v. 522, no. 1 p.226-232dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.11.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03749naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245012200181300001400303520196400317592002802281650002802309650002202337650002202359650002402381650002702405650002502432650002102457650002002478650002702498650001702525650001202542650001202554650002602566650001802592650001102610650001602621650001202637650002002649650000902669650001602678650002202694650001102716650002002727650001502747650001702762650001002779650001102789653002602800653001402826653001502840653001202855653001802867653001902885700002702904773010102931856008203032852000903114655001203123IND60481107020221118151813.0200619e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048110702DNAL7 a10.2478/v10245-012-0003-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBłażewicz-Woźniak, Marzena10aInfluence of ridge cultivation and phacelia intercrop on weed infestation of root vegetables of the Asteraceae family  ap. 21-32.  aThe field experiment focused on three high-inulin vegetable crops: chicory (Cichorium intybus L. var. sativum Bisch), black salsify (Scorzonera hispanica L.) and common salsify (Tragopogon porrifolius L.), and took into account two cultivation methods (flat soil and ridges) and a phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia L.) intercrop, the biomass of which was mixed with the soil during pre-winter ploughing. Cultivation without an intercrop served as the control. The studies aimed at evaluating the influence of ridge cultivation using a phacelia intercrop on the species composition and population of vegetable weeds as compared to traditional flat-soil cultivation with no intercrop. In total, 24 taxa in the primary and 31 taxa in the secondary weed populations (mostly characteristic for vegetable crops) were recorded in high-inulin species plantations. Monocarpic species such as Senecio vulgaris, Chenopodium album and Lamium amplexicaule dominated in the spring, while Stellaria media, Capsella bursa-pastoris and Urtica urens were most numerous at the end of the vegetation period. Applying phacelia as the intercrop and ploughing its biomass before winter significantly reduced the primary weed population for all of the cultivated crop species as compared to the no-intercrop cultivations. Phacelia grown as the intercrop reduced the occurrence of Senecio vulgaris, while favouring the development of Lamium amplexicaule. The cultivation system affected the primary weed infestation of vegetables, whereas it had no impact on the level of secondary weed infestation. At the beginning of the vegetation periods, fewer weeds grew in ridges than in the flat soil system. The crop species had no effect on the primary weed infestation, while it influenced weed numbers in the secondary. The lowest number of weeds was recorded in the secondary weed infestation of chicory, the well-developed leaf rosettes of which efficiently eliminated most of the weeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsella bursa-pastoris 3aChenopodium album 3aCichorium intybus 3aLamium amplexicaule 3aPhacelia tanacetifolia 3aScorzonera hispanica 3aSenecio vulgaris 3aStellaria media 3aTragopogon porrifolius 3aUrtica urens 3abiomass 3achicory 3afield experimentation 3aintercropping 3aleaves 3aplantations 3aplowing 3aroot vegetables 3asoil 3asoil ridges 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3avegetable crops 3avegetation 3aweed control 3aweeds 3awinter 0aflat-soil cultivation 0aploughing 0acatch-crop 0achicory 0ablack salsify 0acommon salsify1 aKonopiński, Mirosław0 tFolia horticulturae.g2012 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.21-32dVersitawJournal:2057x2083-59657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10245-012-0003-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010200161300001800263520167200281592002801953650002401981650002102005650002102026650002302047650002002070650000902090650001702099650002202116650001302138650001802151650002102169650001502190650001002205650002602215650001202241650002102253650001902274650001502293650002402308650002702332650001402359650001602373700001702389700001702406700001602423700001202439700001402451700001702465773012802482856007402610852000902684655001202693IND60468444420221121061712.0151208e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046844442DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.123252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGang, Chengcheng10aSynergistic Effect of Chemical Treatments on Storage Quality and Chilling Injury of Honey Peaches  ap. 1108-1117.  aThe effects of calcium chloride (CaCl₂), gibberellic acid (GA₃) and salicylic acid (SA) either alone or in various combinations on the fruit quality and chilling injury of honey peaches were investigated during 20 days of cold storage and subsequent 3 days of ambient temperature storage (simulating shelf life). Results showed that the effects of the combined treatments were better than those of each individual treatment. The combination of CaCl₂ and SA was the most effective treatment in alleviating chilling injury by controlling membrane permeability, inhibiting respiration rate and delaying polyphenol oxidase activity. The single CaCl₂ treatment was the most viable in maintaining fruit quality by keeping firmness and retarding weight loss rate during cold and subsequent ambient temperature storage. Therefore, the combined treatment of CaCl₂ and SA was the most effective in peach preservation, and the single CaCl₂ treatment can also be promoted. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The combination of CaCl₂ and SA is an effective method in alleviating the chilling injury and keeping the storage quality of honey peaches under cold storage. The CaCl₂ treatment alone presents promising options for commercialization because of its low cost and ease of application. The significance of this research is ascribed to the postharvest application of nontoxic chemicals that cannot only extend the storage life of honey peaches, but can also promote the effectiveness of environmentally friendly methods in fruit storage. Overall, the outcomes of this study may serve as practical guidelines on honey peach storage for both fruit producers and consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acalcium chloride 3acatechol oxidase 3achemical treatment 3achilling injury 3acold 3acold storage 3acommercialization 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3agibberellic acid 3aguidelines 3ahoney 3amembrane permeability 3apeaches 3arespiratory rate 3asalicylic acid 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3asustainable technology 3asynergism 3aweight loss1 aLi, Jianlong1 aChen, Yizhao1 aWang, Yijia1 aLi, Hui1 aPan, bin,1 aOdeh, Inakwu0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2015 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.1108-1117dFood & Nutrition Press.x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.123253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014900165520107300314592002801387650001301415650002501428650002001453650001301473650001301486650001201499650002201511650001301533650001101546650002201557653001501579653001101594653001901605653003201624653003401656700001501690700001601705700001801721700001801739700001101757700001701768700001801785700001701803700001801820700001201838773012201850856008101972852000902053655001202062IND60702535420221121113904.0211030e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070253542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1098892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Ningxuan10aOptimization of anthocyanidins conversion using chokeberry pomace rich in polymeric proanthocyanidins and cellular antioxidant activity analysis  aChokeberry pomace contains abundant polymeric proanthocyanidins with low antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility. In this study, polymeric proanthocyanidins from chokeberry pomace were converted into anthocyanidins with higher antioxidant activity. Optimal conversion conditions were determined by full factorial design. The composition of anthocyanidin was analyzed by TOF-MS and UPLC. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the conversion products was evaluated by PSC and CAA assays. The results showed that the yield of anthocyanidins was 11.59 mg/g when the pomace was treated with 95% ethanol concentration, 50:1 liquid-solid ratio, 4% hydrochloric acid and 0.2 mg/mL ammonium ferric citrate concentration at 80 °C for 30 min. The newly generated anthocyanidins were identified as cyanidin, which accounting for 51.3% of the total anthocyanidins. The antioxidant activity values of PSC and CAA increased 2.81 and 4.77 folds respectively.

The aim of the study was to provide the understanding of the genetic structure and variability of the analysed pramenka sheep populations, and to give indications for conservation strategies based on the population diversity and structure information. The genetic variation of the sheep populations, examined at the nuclear level using 27 microsatellite loci, revealed considerable levels of genetic diversity, similar to the diversity found in other European indigenous low-production sheep breeds. Population-specific alleles were detected at most loci and in breeds analysed. The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.643 (in Lika pramenka) to 0.743 (in Vlasic pramenka), and the expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.646 (in Lika pramenka) to 0.756 (in Dalmatian pramenka). Significant inbreeding coefficients were found for half of the populations studied and ranged from 0.040 (Pag island sheep) to 0.091 (Kupres pramenka). Moderate genetic differentiation was found between the studied sheep populations. The total genetic variability observed between different populations was 5.29%, whereas 94.71% of the variation was found within populations. Cres island sheep, Lika pramenka and Istrian sheep were identified as the most distinct populations, which was confirmed by the factorial analysis of correspondence and supported through a bootstrapping adjustment to correct for the difference in the sample sizes. The population structure analysis distinguished 12 clusters for the 12 sheep breeds analysed. However, the cluster differentiation was low for Dalmatian, Vlasic, Stolac and Krk pramenka. This systematic study identified Lika pramenka and Rab island sheep as those with the lowest diversity, whereas Istrian sheep and Pag island sheep had the highest. Conservation actions are proposed for Istrian, Rab and Cres island sheep, Lika and Kupres pramenka because of high estimated coefficients of inbreeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDalmatian 3aalleles 3acorrespondence analysis 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3asheep 3asheep breeds 3aBosnia-Herzegovina 3aCroatia 0asheep breeds 0agenetic diversity 0apopulation structure 0amicrosatellites1 aGutierrez-Gil, B.1 aArranz, J.

Fisher 344 rats were fed diets of 55% (w/w, dry basis) starch for 8 weeks. Cecal contents were collected from sacrificed rats. A corn starch control was compared against three RS diets. The RS diets were high-amylose corn starch (HA7), HA7 chemically modified with octenyl succinic anhydride, and stearic-acid-complexed HA7 starch. To calibrate the FTIR-PAS analysis, samples from each diet were analyzed using an enzymatic assay. A partial least-squares cross-validation plot generated from the enzymatic assay and FTIR-PAS spectral results for starch fit the ideal curve with a R² of 0.997. A principal component analysis plot of components 1 and 2 showed that spectra from diets clustered significantly from each other. This study clearly showed that FTIR-PAS can accurately quantify starch content and identify the form of starch in complex matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn starch 3aphotoacoustic spectroscopy 3aprincipal component analysis 3arats 3aresistant starch 2aAnimals 2aCecumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 2aStarchxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aZea maysxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aresistant starch 0afecal analysis 0aFourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy 0apartial least squares 0aprincipal component analysis1 aAi, Yongfeng1 aJones, Roger

Kuntze) grown in growth chambers in perlite irrigated with a nutrient solution. Dry matter production was reduced significantly by both low B supply and water stress. Shoot-root translocation of B declined in water-stressed plants. In addition, the re-translocation of B was impaired under drought, which was reflected in a significantly lower ratio of B content of young to old leaves in both B-deficient and B-sufficient plants. Leaf photochemical parameters were negatively influenced by B deficiency and water stress in the old but not in the young leaves. Although B-deficient plants were more conservative in relation to water loss following elevated stomatal limitation, their water potential was lower than in B-sufficient plants irrespective of the watering regime. Under the combined effects of B deficiency and water stress, the reduction in the CO₂ assimilation rate was more prominent than that under a single stress factor. The reduction of the net assimilation rate (A) in B-deficient plants due to water stress and in water-stressed plants due to low B supply were not accompanied by significant changes in the stomatal conductance, suggesting an involvement of non-stomatal factors. The activity of antioxidant enzymes and proline content increased under B deficiency and water stress conditions. Our results suggested that, in young leaves that have been developed under water stress, an acclimation to water stress conditions occurred that was well reflected in their more stable photochemistry, water relations and an efficient antioxidant defence system compared with the older leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aacclimation 3aantioxidants 3aboron 3acarbon dioxide 3adrought 3adry matter accumulation 3aenzyme activity 3agrowth chambers 3aleaves 3anet assimilation rate 3anutrient solutions 3aperlite 3aphotochemistry 3aproline 3aroots 3ashoots 3astomatal conductance 3atea 3awater potential 3awater stress 0aantioxidant defence 0agas exchange 0aleaf photochemistry 0awater relations1 aBastani, Soodabe0 tFolia horticulturae.g2012 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.41-51dVersitawJournal:2057x2083-59657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10245-012-0005-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009300158300001800251520103000269592002801299650001001327650001801337650001301355650001401368650000901382650000701391650001801398650001601416650001901432650002301451650001101474650002501485650001601510650001801526700001401544700001901558700002001577700001701597773012801614856007401742852000901816655001201825IND60468444620221122194017.0151208e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046844462DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.123652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiaoyan10aSeparation of Peanut Protein by Reverse Micelles: Optimization of the Forward Extraction  ap. 1457-1465.  aBis(2‐ethylhexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT) reverse micelles were applied to extract the protein from peanut cake. In this study, the effect of temperature, amounts of peanut cake flour, particle size of peanut cake flour, pH, water content (W₀), KCl concentration and time on the forward extraction efficiency of peanut protein were investigated. The main influencing factors were optimized using a three‐factor five‐level quadratic general rotary unitized (QGRU) in order to effectively extract protein, and the interactions among main factors were determined. After statistical analysis and process optimization, the results showed that the highest forward extraction efficiency of peanut protein achieved 88.12% under pH 7, W₀ 18 and KCl concentration 0.05 M. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Reverse micelle is a novel bioseparation method, and can simultaneously separate the oil and proteins from oil crops. The knowledge provided by this work may promote the application of reverse micelles in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflour 3afood industry 3amicelles 3aoil crops 3aoils 3apH 3aparticle size 3apeanut cake 3apeanut protein 3apotassium chloride 3asodium 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3awater content1 aChen, Jun1 aChen, Xiangyan1 aWang, Xianchang1 aWang, Yifeng0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2015 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.1457-1465dFood & Nutrition Press.x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.123653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016700172300001400339520129800353592002801651650002201679650001401701650001201715650001001727650001101737650000901748650002301757650001301780650001301793650001101806650002101817650001501838650001001853651001301863653002201876653002501898653003301923653001001956700002301966773010101989856008202090852000902172655001202181IND60481107320221118152502.0200619e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048110732DNAL7 a10.2478/v10245-012-0006-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoilova, Tsvetelina10aDifferences in growth and productivity between genotypes of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) in the Sadovo region of Bulgaria  ap. 53-59.  aThe study examined the differences between 10 accessions of common bean and cowpea during the vegetation period. Different stages of development and elements of yield were analysed in the climatic conditions of Sadovo (Bulgaria), which is characterised by hot summers and insufficient rainfalls. All genotypes were planted in the second 10 days of April. They emerged 10-15 days after sowing. The flowering stage occurred after 28-34 days in common bean and 45-60 days in cowpea. The vegetation period duration was much longer in cowpea (over 98 days) than in the common bean (less then 80 days). The reproductive organs (number of pods and seeds per plant, size of pods and seeds, weight of pods and seeds per plant) were quite different for the two crops. The mean number of pods per plant was 8.84 in common beans and 13.22 for cowpea; the number of seeds per pod was 4.05 for beans 10.56 for cowpea; the number of seeds per plant was 25.65 for beans and 93.47 for cowpea. The bean seeds were larger than the cowpea seeds, with 100-seed weights of 41.86 g and 15.73 g, respectively. Under the climatic conditions of Sadovo, the cowpea accessions showed a more stable yield, resulting in more pods and seeds per plant and weight of seeds per plant, when compared with common bean accessions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3aflowering 3acowpeas 3aseeds 3asowing 3apods 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3agenotype 3aplanting 3asummer 3aclimatic factors 3avegetation 3acrops 3aBulgaria 0agenetic resources 0amorphological traits 0aprincipal component analysis 0ayield1 aBerova, Malgozhata0 tFolia horticulturae.g2012 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.53-59dVersitawJournal:2057x2083-59657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10245-012-0006-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245011800201300001600319500002000335520163400355592002801989596002602017650002402043650001502067650002502082650001802107650001202125650001302137650001302150773011002163856008002273852000902353655001202362IND60790367820221119134418.0220824e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079036782DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.130422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sangmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7262-159X10aAsn‐linked N–acetylglucosamine of the amylin receptor 2 extracellular domain enhances peptide ligand affinity  ap. 195-206.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe calcitonin receptor (CTR) has a large extracellular domain (ECD) with multiple N‐glycosylation sites. An asparagine (Asn)‐linked N‐acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) of CTR ECD N130 was previously reported to enhance peptide hormone binding affinity for CTR ECD. CTR forms a complex with an accessory protein RAMP, and the RAMP:CTR complex gains affinity for peptide hormone amylin as the amylin receptor (AMY). Although N‐glycosylation of AMY ECD was reported to enhance peptide hormone affinity, it remains underexplored which N‐glycosites of AMY ECD are responsible for peptide affinity enhancement and it is unclear whether an Asn‐linked GlcNAc of the N‐glycosites plays a critical role. Here, I investigated the role of the Asn‐linked GlcNAc of CTR N130 in the affinity of an antagonistic amylin analog (AC413) for AMY₂ ECD (the RAMP2 ECD:CTR ECD complex). I used Endo H‐treated CTR ECD in which N‐glycans were trimmed to an Asn‐linked GlcNAc on each of the N‐glycosites. I incubated Endo H‐treated CTR ECD with excess of glycan‐free RAMP2 ECD to produce the RAMP2 ECD:CTR ECD complex. Using this coincubation system, I found that the RAMP2 ECD complex with Endo H‐treated CTR ECD with N130D mutation showed a fourfold decrease in AC413 affinity compared with the RAMP2 ECD complex with Endo H‐treated CTR ECD WT. In contrast, RAMP2 ECD N‐glycosylation did not affect peptide binding affinity. These results indicate that the Asn‐linked GlcNAc of CTR N130 is an important peptide affinity enhancer for AMY₂ ECD and reveals a significant role of the Asn‐linked GlcNAc in AMY₂ function.  aPublisher supplied data  cHigh Point University 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3aasparagine 3acalcitonin receptors 3aglycosylation 3aligands 3amutation 3apeptides0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2021 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.195-206dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.130423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100007400145245014600219300001600365500002000381520161900401592002802020596003402048596004902082596005102131596004002182650002202222650001702244650002502261650002102286650002302307650000902330650002202339650001302361650002402374650001602398650002202414700005802436700002802494700006302522773011002585856008002695852000902775655001202784IND60790367920221119134416.0220824e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079036792DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.130412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHjörleifsson, Jens Guðmundur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0471-855X14aThe high catalytic rate of the cold‐active Vibrio alkaline phosphatase requires a hydrogen bonding network involving a large interface loop  ap. 173-184.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe role of surface loops in mediating communication through residue networks is still a relatively poorly understood part in the study of cold adaptation of enzymes, especially in terms of their quaternary interactions. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) from the psychrophilic marine bacterium Vibrio splendidus (VAP) is characterized by an analogous large surface loop in each monomer, referred to as the large loop, that hovers over the active site of the other monomer. It presumably has a role in the high catalytic efficiency of VAP which accompanies its extremely low thermal stability. Here, we designed several different variants of VAP with the aim of removing intersubunit interactions at the dimer interface. Breaking the intersubunit contacts from one residue in particular (Arg336) reduced the temperature stability of the catalytically potent conformation and caused a 40% drop in catalytic rate. The high catalytic rates of enzymes from cold‐adapted organisms are often associated with increased dynamic flexibility. Comparison of the relative B‐factors of the R336L crystal structure to that of the wild‐type confirmed surface flexibility was increased in a loop on the opposite monomer, but not in the large loop. The increase in flexibility resulted in a reduced catalytic rate. The large loop increases the area of the interface between the subunits through its contacts and may facilitate an alternating structural cycle demanded by a half‐of‐sites reaction mechanism through stronger ties, as the dimer oscillates between high affinity (active) or low phosphoryl group affinity (inactive).  aPublisher supplied data  a247732cNorges Forskningsråd  a060219021‐3cIcelandic Centre for Research  a141619‐05‐3cIcelandic Centre for Research  cUniversity of Iceland Research Fund 3aVibrio splendidus 3aactive sites 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaquatic bacteria 3acatalytic activity 3acold 3acrystal structure 3ahydrogen 3areaction mechanisms 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aHelland, Ronny1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6271-14361 aMagnúsdóttir, Manuela1 aÁsgeirsson, Bjarni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4275-27320 tFEBS Open Bio.g2021 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.173-184dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.130413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009400154300001800248520154400266592002801810650002701838650002201865650001401887650001601901650001401917650001301931650001301944650001201957650001101969650001301980650001901993650001502012650003102027650001902058650004402077650001402121650001002135700001202145700001202157700001502169700001902184700001702203773012802220856007402348852000902422655001202431IND60468444920221121220359.0151208e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046844492DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.124792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Zhe10aNonenzymatic Softening Mechanism of Collagen Gel of Sea Cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus)  ap. 2322-2331.  aHSC (sea cucumbers treated by high pressure steam) were easy to degrade during storage, even if microorganism and endogenous enzyme were inactivated. To explore the softening mechanism of HSC, packaged samples were stored at 37C for 33 days. The hardness value decreased sharply from 374.60 to 35.00 gf in 33 days, as well as springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness and restorability. The proportion of transverse relaxation time (T₂₃) increased from 0.841 to 0.917 in 24 days, indicating that the proportion of free water ascended significantly. Nuclear magnetic resonance images showed that part of bound water in body wall transformed into free water in 18 days. Collagen fibers were broken in 27 days as Van Gieson stained images showed. Ammonia nitrogen and ε‐amino group increased significantly, and free hydroxyproline level also increased from 8.33 to 24.12 μg/g, indicating the degradation of HSC. Therefore, softening of HSC may be caused by moisture migration, break of collagen fiber and degradation of collagen. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: High pressure steam treatment can inactivate microorganisms and enzymes without affecting the flavor and nutrition of sea cucumbers. However, sea cucumbers treated with high pressure steam (HSC) can also degrade after being stored for several days. This restricts the development of sea cucumber products. Therefore, it is important to study the nonenzymatic softening mechanism of HSC during storage. This will be a basis for the study in resolving the autolysis of sea cucumbers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aammonium nitrogen 3aautolysis 3abound water 3achewiness 3acohesion 3acollagen 3aenzymes 3aflavor 3ahardness 3ahydroxyproline 3aintegument 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amicroorganisms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrition 3asteam1 aHou, Hu1 aBu, Lin1 aLi, Bafang1 aZhang, Zhaohui1 aXue, Changhu0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2015 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.2322-2331dFood & Nutrition Press.x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.124793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011900171520129200290592002801582650002701610650002701637650002601664650002901690650001701719650001501736650001701751650001101768650001501779650001601794650001701810650002101827650001901848650000701867650001501874650001001889650001901899650001801918651002001936653002101956653002701977653002402004653001702028700001602045700002602061700003102087773012202118856008102240852000902321655001202330IND60702535820221121065152.0220103e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070253582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1098972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhialdin, Belal J.10aMetabolomics profiling and antibacterial activity of fermented ginger paste extends the shelf life of chicken meat  aFermented ginger paste is a traditional condiment in South East Asia used to marinate meat to extend the shelf life and improve the taste. The present study aimed to determine the metabolomics profile of fermented ginger and the effects on the shelf life of chicken meat. Sterilised chicken meat slices were marinated using the fermented and fresh ginger paste and incubated at 8 °C to determine the effects on the microbial growth. The bioactive metabolites were identified using ¹H NMR based analysis. The results demonstrated that fermentation significantly (p˂0.05) increased the antibacterial activity of the ginger paste against Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (97%), Listeria monocytogenes (97%) and Staphylococcus aureus (100%), with the microbial load significantly (p < 0.05) reducing to 4.0 and 4.5 Lₒg₁₀ CFU g⁻¹ in the chicken meat slices marinated in fermented ginger. Fermented ginger paste significantly reduced the pH value, moisture content and water activity of chicken meat slices after the incubation for 2 days at 8 °C. A total of 25 metabolites were identified in the fermented ginger paste. These results revealed the potential application of fermented ginger paste to enhance the safety of chicken meat via reducing the microbial load.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3achicken meat 3acondiments 3afermentation 3aginger 3amarinating 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amicrobial growth 3amicrobial load 3apH 3ashelf life 3ataste 3awater activity 3awater content 3aSouth East Asia 0aBio-preservation 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aBioactive compounds 0aChicken meat1 aKadum, Hana1 aFathallah, Salahaldin1 aMeor Hussin, Anis Shobirin0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Oct., v. 132 p.109897-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1098973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009600178300001600274520090700290536022101197592002801418596011201446596011401558650002201672650002001694650001501714650001301729650001901742650001201761650001301773650001301786650001201799650001201811650003301823650001201856653002001868653004001888700002201928700003301950700003201983700002402015700002902039700002902068773013002097856008502227852000902312655001202321IND60654183920221122204133.0190722e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065418392DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2019.15968452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCassab Azevedo, Marina10aEssential oil profiling of six new citrus hybrids from Murcott tangor and Pera sweet orange  ap. 400-408.  aThe yield and the composition of the peel essential oils (EO) of six new citrus hybrids obtained from the crosses between Murcott tangor—TM [Citrus reticulata Blanco x Citrus sinensis (L.)

Elucidating such correlations is essential to understand the adoption of alternative strategies between morphs and the role they play in the maintenance of colour polymorphisms within a population. Using field experiments, we tested the hypothesis that four visually discrete morphs (orange, yellow, yellow with a central orange patch (orange-yellow) and grey) of the tawny dragon lizard, Ctenophorus decresii, display alternative behavioural strategies. Specifically, we compared the response of colour morphs to simulated conspecific territorial intruders and predators in the wild. Although the orange-yellow morph can be objectively classified, it may behaviourally resemble the orange or yellow morph; therefore we compared statistical models in which the orange-yellow morph was considered a separate morph (four-morph model) or grouped with either pure orange or pure yellow individuals (three-morph models). For aggression, a three-morph model with orange-yellow individuals grouped as yellow morphs best fitted the data. The orange morph showed consistently high aggression to all morphs, while the grey morph showed consistently low aggression. Aggression of the yellow morph was conditional on the morph of the intruder. In addition to being the least aggressive, the grey morph was the least bold. Although the orange morph was the most aggressive, it was only the boldest under a three-morph model, which was equally likely compared to a four-morph model. Overall our results support the view that tawny dragon lizard morphs adopt different behavioural strategies, the orange and grey morphs exhibiting more aggressive and cautious strategies, respectively, and the yellow morph changing its aggression depending on its competitor's colour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3acolor 3afield experimentation 3alife history 3alizards 3amorphs 3aphysiology 3apredators 3asexual selection 3astatistical models 0aaggression 0aalternative strategies 0aboldness 0acolour polymorphism 0aCtenophorus decresii 0aflight initiation distance 0alizard1 aPryke, Sarah1 aStuart-Fox, Devi0 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Jan., v. 111 p.329-339dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010400169300001800273520172300291592002802014650001202042650001502054650002602069650001902095650001602114650002202130650001302152650001902165650001202184650003102196650001602227650000902243700001602252700005102268700001702319700001102336700001802347773011902365856008702484852000902571655001202580IND60604974220180918000000.0180719e20180613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060497422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b040512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fushui10aInvestigation on Soot Characteristics of Gasoline/Diesel Blends in a Laminar Coflow Diffusion Flame  ap. 7841-7850.  aGasoline addition in diesel fuel could not only improve the overall energy efficiency, but also could reduce the soot emission on diesel engine. However, the influence of gasoline on the soot forming characteristics has not been revealed fundamentally. A liquid burner system, modified from a Gülder burner, was applied to create strict laminar diffusion flame to carry out the related study. Also, optical diagnostics technologies including digital camera imaging and high speed two-dimension line-of-sight attenuation (2D-LOSA) were used to record the natural luminosity flame structure, smoke point, and soot volume fraction. During the experiments, the diesel ratio was varied as 0%, 20%, and 40% by volume, while the fuel flow rate was varied from 6 to 9 g/h. The results show that diffusion flames of blends can be distributed into three typical parts, soot free region, soot growth region, and soot oxidation region. With the fuel flow rate increasing, more soot was generated and the flame height was lifted. With the diesel ratio increasing in gasoline/diesel blends, the visible flame height decreased, the flame luminosity intensity decreased, the smoke point increased, and the 2D soot volume fraction value reduced, which indicates that diesel is less likely to produce soot than is gasoline in the laminar diffusion flame. The soot reducing effect of diesel is regarded because diesel can enhance the cool flame combustion in the free soot region due to its more obvious NTC (negative temperature coefficient) effect. It is also reasonable to expound that the soot emission reduces with addition of gasoline in diesel on engines mostly because of its volatility rather than its chemical characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acombustion 3adiagnostic techniques 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy efficiency 3agasoline 3aimage analysis 3aliquids 3aphysicochemical properties 3asmoke point 3asoot1 aGao, Yongli1 aWu, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9113-97741 aZhang, Zheng1 aHe, Xu1 aLi, Xiangrong0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 June 13, v. 32, no. 7 p.7841-7850dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b040513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013800195300001600333500002000349520235000369592002802719650002802747650001202775650002902787650001702816650001702833650001102850650002002861650001602881650002202897650001702919650001802936650002802954650001302982651001002995700005403005700006003059773013603119856007303255852000903328655001203337IND60743179820221117084938.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074317982DNAL7 a10.1111/ajr.127122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Dejian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5746-763810aEffects of a family dyadic partnership program for people with hypertension in a rural community: A pilot randomised controlled trial  ap. 435-448.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of a theory‐based patient‐family carer partnership intervention for people with hypertension in a Chinese rural community. DESIGN: A pilot randomised controlled trial using pretest and post‐test design. SETTING: Rural China PARTICIPANTS: Forty‐four hypertensive patients and their family carers (family dyads) were randomly recruited from a village clinic located in China between November 2019 and January 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to either an intervention group receiving a five‐session patient‐family carer partnership intervention over 10 weeks or a control group receiving usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The feasibility and acceptability of patient‐family carer partnership intervention and the changes in patients' systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and percentage of normal controlled blood pressure. RESULTS: The patient‐family carer partnership intervention was a feasible and acceptable program with high recruitment (81.5%) and completion rates (95.5%) and positive feedback from participants. Greater improvement in the percentage of normal controlled blood pressure was identified in the intervention group tested by the χ² tests, with P = .03. Two‐way ANOVA results indicated its interaction (Group × Time) effects on patients' systolic blood pressure (P < .001), diastolic blood pressure (P < .001), dyadic partnership quality (P = .002), self‐care (P < .001), self‐efficacy (P = .02), antihypertensive drug treatment rate (P = .02), prescription adjustment (P = .03), perceived anxiety (P < .001) and health‐related quality of life (EuroQol five‐dimensional five‐level: P = .02; EuroQol visual analogue scale: P < .001); family carers' dyadic partnership quality (P = .002), perceived depression (P = .04) and health‐related quality of life (P = .02) were significant. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the feasibility and acceptability of the patient‐family carer partnership intervention and indicate benefits in improving patients' blood pressure control, dyadic relationship and psychological well‐being of family dyads in rural area. Further research to test the longer‐term effect in a large‐sized population is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantihypertensive agents 3aanxiety 3adiastolic blood pressure 3adrug therapy 3ahypertension 3apeople 3aquality of life 3arural areas 3arural communities 3arural health 3aself-efficacy 3asystolic blood pressure 3avillages 3aChina1 aYang, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1415-87521 aChien, Wai-Tong,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5321-57910 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2021 June, v. 29, no. 3 p.435-448dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000053x1038-52827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.127123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03803naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245017600167300001600343500001900359520164000378592002802018650001702046650001002063650001602073650001702089650001202106650001902118650002002137650002402157651001102181700001902192700002202211700002402233700002302257700002302280700002002303700002402323700002802347700002402375700003602399700002002435700001702455700002402472700002402496700002202520700002102542700002302563700001802586700002202604700001702626700002302643700001702666700003002683700002502713700002002738700002102758700003002779700002802809700007302837773011502910856008303025852000903108655001203117IND60678806220221122025147.0210402e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067880622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02549-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMason, Lucy R.10aPopulation responses of bird populations to climate change on two continents vary with species’ ecological traits but not with direction of change in climate suitability  ap. 337-354.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClimate change is a major global threat to biodiversity with widespread impacts on ecological communities. Evidence for beneficial impacts on populations is perceived to be stronger and more plentiful than that for negative impacts, but few studies have investigated this apparent disparity, or how ecological factors affect population responses to climatic change. We examined the strength of the relationship between species-specific regional population changes and climate suitability trends (CST), using 30-year datasets of population change for 525 breeding bird species in Europe and the USA. These data indicate a consistent positive relationship between population trend and CST across the two continents. Importantly, we found no evidence that this positive relationship differs between species expected to be negatively and positively impacted across the entire taxonomic group, suggesting that climate change is causing equally strong, quantifiable population increases and declines. Species’ responses to changing climatic suitability varied with ecological traits, however, particularly breeding habitat preference and body mass. Species associated with inland wetlands responded most strongly and consistently to recent climatic change. In Europe, smaller species also appeared to respond more strongly, whilst the relationship with body mass was less clear-cut for North American birds. Overall, our results identify the role of certain traits in modulating responses to climate change and emphasise the importance of long-term data on abundance for detecting large-scale species’ responses to environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3abody weight 3aclearcutting 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ahabitat preferences 3aEurope1 aGreen, Rhys E.1 aHoward, Christine1 aStephens, Philip A.1 aWillis, Stephen G.1 aAuniņš, Ainārs,1 aBrotons, Lluís1 aChodkiewicz, Tomasz1 aChylarecki, Przemysław1 aEscandell, Virginia1 aFoppen, R.

The main project stages are as follows: (i) cloning of the central hydrophilic region of the ASFV gene CP204L (p30) into a prokaryotic vector; (ii) expression and chromatographic purification of the recombinant product p30 with thioredoxin and poly‐histidine site (p30e1_TrxA_6xHis); (iii) development of the immunoblotting test system (Rec p30‐IB) using the highly purified recombinant p30; and (iv) evaluation of Rec p30‐IB using sera and organ samples from domestic pigs and wild boars experimentally or naturally infected by ASFV. Testing of the Rec p30‐IB showed the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the assay to be 98.75% and 100.00%, respectively. High sensitivity of the Rec p30‐IB allowed the detection of ASFV‐specific antibodies in samples of organs of the immune system and blood sera, collected from domestic pigs and wild boars, starting from 6 to 8 days post‐infection, regardless of virus virulence, seroimmunotype and geographic origin of the samples (East Europe, South Europe, West Europe, Central and south‐east Africa).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican swine fever 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3achromatography 3adiagnostic specificity 3agenes 3ahydrophilicity 3aimmune system 3aimmunoblotting 3amolecular cloning 3aprovenance 3arecombinant proteins 3aserodiagnosis 3aswine 3athioredoxins 3avirulence 3aviruses 3awild boars 3aAfrica 3aRussia 3aWestern European region1 aImatdinov, I.

This fruit is used in traditional pastries, the flavedo for the preparation of liqueurs by hydroalcoholic infusion. We investigated the chemical composition and bioactivity of the essential oil obtained by hydro-distillation from the peel of pompia (PEO). Gas chromatographic analysis allowed us to determine the PEO chemical composition: the major compound was limonene (LM) (803.8 mg/mL). PEO showed antioxidant activity in the β-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching test and radical-scavenging activity in the DPPH assay. PEO significantly reduced viability in HeLa and B16F10 cancer cells, and its toxic effect was mainly associated with LM cytotoxicity. PEO significantly increased intracellular free radical levels in cancer cells, without affecting the cellular phospholipid composition. The HPLC-DAD analysis of the cancer cell medium after PEO-treatment revealed the presence of perillic acid, a LM metabolite with anticancer activity. Our findings provide new insights for the PEO nutraceutical potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCitrus limon 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-carotene 3ableaching 3achemical composition 3acytotoxicity 3adietary supplements 3aessential oils 3afree radicals 3afruits 3agas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrodistillation 3alimonene 3alinoleic acid 3aliqueurs 3ametabolites 3aneoplasm cells 3apastries 3aphospholipids 3aviability 3aItaly 3aSardinia 0aPompia fruit 0aflavedo essential oil 0acell ROS generation1 aNieddu, Mariella1 aPetretto, Giacomo Luigi1 aSarais, Giorgia0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2019 Sept. 3, v. 31, no. 5 p.390-399dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43444x2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2019.16067403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04177naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024001900122040001800141100002400159242022000183245015900403300001600562520229300578592002802871650002202899650002502921650001002946650001202956650001202968650001102980650001002991650001103001650001403012650000903026650001803035650001203053650000903065650000903074650001403083650001403097650001903111653001203130653001903142653002303161653002303184653002903207653001303236653003303249653001903282700002503301700002203326700002203348700002103370773011303391856007403504852000903578655001203587IND60594769120221117214353.0180522e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059476912DNAL7 a10.1642/AUK-17-7.12doi4 atauk-134-03-22  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrłowski, Grzegorz10aLas regiones manchadas y no pigmentadas de las cáscaras de los huevos de aves difieren en la sedimentación materna de calcio y metales: un aspecto químico hasta ahora ignorado del proceso de machado de los huevos10aSpeckled and plain regions of avian eggshells differ in maternal deposition of calcium and metals: A hitherto overlooked chemical aspect of egg maculation  ap. 721-731.  aAlthough it has been strongly implied that studies on structural function might resolve certain conflicting theories regarding the huge variability of coloration in avian eggs, including maculation, the fundamental physiological question about the functional role of eggshell speckling in the maternal deposition of micronutrients into maculated (pigment spots) and plain (unpigmented) eggshell regions remains largely unanswered. We measured (within the same egg) the concentrations of 2 micronutrients, the staple components of avian eggshells (calcium and magnesium), and 6 trace elements (copper, manganese, iron, cobalt, cadmium, and lead) in maculated (a superficial layer of brown pigment) and unpigmented areas of eggshells in 2 groups of Japanese Quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) eggs representing 2 extremes of eggshell coloration: those with darker eggshells and more extensive pigment spots vs. those with bright eggshells and small, more clearly demarcated pigment spots. We found evidence that the concentrations of calcium and magnesium and of 2 trace elements (copper and cadmium) in both types of egg were significantly higher in speckled eggshell areas (where the shells were also significantly thicker) than in unpigmented ones. Conversely, lead (a toxic element) peaked markedly in the plain areas of eggshells compared with the speckled ones, whereas the concentrations of the 3 other trace elements (manganese, iron, and cobalt) measured in the speckled and unpigmented eggshell regions were variable and dependent on egg coloration. Our results give a clear indication that egg maculation can play a functional role in the chemistry of avian eggs, one that enables females to distribute micronutrients and trace elements into pigment spots and unpigmented regions of an eggshell to varying extents. This presumably represents a mechanism permitting prompt physiological adjustment to varying levels of maternal resources. It is possible that elements sequestered into protoporphyrin speckles are not further utilized by developing embryos; this might be a form of physiological chemoprotection through the disposal or deactivation of certain elements in pigment speckles, which do not (or only marginally) contribute to the biochemical processes of embryogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3abiochemical pathways 3abirds 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acobalt 3acolor 3acopper 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aprotoporphyrin 0acalcium 0aegg maculation 0aeggshell thickness 0amaternal resources 0amicronutrient allocation 0apigments 0aprotoporphyrin pigment spots 0atrace elements1 aPokorny, Przemysław1 aDobicki, Wojciech1 aŁukaszewicz, Ewa1 aKowalczyk, Artur0 tAuk.g2017 July, v. 134, no. 3 p.721-731dThe American Ornithologists' UnionwJournal:19765x1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-17-7.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245011300180300001600293520122900309592002801538650002101566650002201587650002201609650001501631650001201646650001701658650002201675650001601697650001801713650002101731650002201752650001901774650001701793650003701810653002201847653002201869653001901891653002801910653001701938700002301955700001901978700002401997773010002021856008502121852000902206655001202215IND60546493220221118145612.0160903e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054649322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKauffer, Florence-Anaïs10aIncidence of the core composition on the stability, the ROS production and the toxicity of CdSe quantum dots  ap. 246-255.  aMercaptosuccinic acid-capped CdSe and alloyed CdSe(S) QDs were prepared in aqueous solution at 100 and 170°C, respectively. These dots were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV–vis and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The dots were found to be of similar size (ca. 2nm) but differ in their composition and surface chemistry. The photostability of the QDs was found to correlate with their ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light activation. CdSe QDs produce hydroxyl radicals immediately after irradiation due to their modest photostability, while CdSe(S) QDs start to generate the hydroxyl radicals only once they start to be bleached (ca. 30min). Cytotoxicity experiments conducted on Escherichia coli cells revealed that CdSe QDs were the more toxic despite being the least loaded in cadmium. In addition, consistent with ROS assays, the cytotoxicity of the CdSe QDs appeared light-dependent and is in accordance with a light-dependent oxidative stress observed with an oxyR-based whole cell biosensor. Our results demonstrate the crucial role played by nanoparticles synthesis process on their PL properties, their stability and their toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosensors 3acadmium 3acytotoxicity 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3aoxidative stress 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotostability 3aquantum dots 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCdSe quantum dots 0aAqueous synthesis 0aPhotostability 0aReactive oxygen species 0aCytotoxicity1 aMerlin, Christophe1 aBalan, Lavinia1 aSchneider, Raphael,0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 268 p.246-255dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007600148245007500224300001600299500001900315520150400334592002801838650000801866650002001874650001301894650001201907650001901919650001101938650001801949650000901967650001601976650001501992650002302007650002002030650001702050651001202067700001502079700002202094773011502116856008302231852000902314655001202323IND60678806420221122034909.0210402e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067880642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02574-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiverpool-Tasie, Lenis Saweda O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2990-588810aClimate change adaptation among poultry farmers: evidence from Nigeria  ap. 527-544.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThough climate events pose increasing challenges for crop and animal production in Africa, most climate adaptation studies focus on staple food crops. Few studies have examined climate adaptation for livestock with even fewer looking at small animals such as poultry. Heat stress associated with climate change is a severe challenge to poultry farmers due to its negative effect on chicken growth and productivity. As poultry plays an important food security role across Africa (being a source of livelihood and an important source of animal protein), understanding how farmers deal with the realities of poultry production due to climate change is critical. This study explores the level and determinants of the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among poultry farmers in Nigeria. A multivariate probit analysis (which allows for the possibility that the decision to adopt various practices are jointly made) reveals that while poultry farmers are adapting to climate change, there is a clear heterogeneity of adaptation strategies at different production scales. Small farms tend to invest in traditional strategies such as the stocking of local breeds while medium and large farms adopt modern technologies such as air and water ventilation as well as the use of low energy bulbs that emit less heat. Our study finds that farmers who have experienced heat-related losses are more likely to adopt modern practices and more likely to adopt multiple adaptation strategies concurrently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanimal proteins 3achickens 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3afood security 3aheat 3aheat stress 3alivelihood 3apoultry production 3aprobit analysis 3astaple foods 3aNigeria1 aSanou, Awa1 aTambo, Justice A.0 tClimatic change.g2019 Dec., v. 157, no. 3-4 p.527-544dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02574-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009500168500001400263520099000277592002801267650001201295650002401307650001701331650001301348650001701361650001801378650002101396650001701417650002001434653001701454653001801471653002501489653002201514700003401536700002001570700001801590700001901608773009801627856008201725852000901807655001201816IND60702536220221121093518.0210320e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070253622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1180712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMounier, Noha M.10aChemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI): An overview of etiology and pathogenesis  aNAL-light  aMany cancer patients treated with chemotherapy develop chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI), often referred to as chemo-brain, which manifest during or post-treatment with variable degrees, onset and duration thereby affecting the patients' quality of life. Several chemotherapeutic agents have been studied to determine its possible association with cognitive impairment and to fully comprehend their contribution to CICI. A vast number of studies have emerged proposing several candidate underlying mechanisms and etiologies contributing to CICI such as direct neurotoxicity, BBB disruption, decreased hippocampal neurogenesis, white matter abnormalities, secondary neuro-inflammatory response and increased oxidative stress; however, the exact underlying mechanisms are still not well defined. This review summarizes CICI associated with most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents with emphasizes the possible underlying pathogenesis in both animal and clinical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3acognitive disorders 3adrug therapy 3aetiology 3aneurogenesis 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aquality of life 0aChemotherapy 0aImmunotherapy 0aCognitive impairment 0aNeuroinflammation1 aAbdel-Maged, Amany El-Shahawy1 aWahdan, Sara A.1 aGad, Amany M.1 aAzab, Samar S.0 tLife sciences.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 258 p.118071-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1180713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010600161300001600267500002000283520093700303592002801240650001501268650001001283650001801293650001401311650001601325650001401341650001801355650000901373651002101382651001501403700001901418700001801437700001701455773013401472856007301606852000901679655001201688IND60587711820221120191842.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058771182DNAL7 a10.1111/jeu.123812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Kyung‐Min10aPseudonotohymena antarctica n. g., n. sp.

The new genus Pseudonotohymena is morphologically similar to the genus Notohymena Blatterer and Foissner in the following characteristics: 18 fronto‐ventral‐transverse cirri, a flexible body, undulating membranes, dorsomarginal kineties, and the number of cirri in the marginal rows. However, Pseudonotohymena differs from Notohymena particularly in the dorsal ciliature, that is, in possessing a nonfragmented dorsal kinety (vs. fragmented). In addition, the molecular phylogenetic relationship of the new species differs from that of Notohymena species. On the basis of the morphological features, the genetic data, and morphogenesis, we establish P. antarctica n. g., n. sp. In addition, the cyst morphology of this species is described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3agenes 3amorphogenesis 3anew genus 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aJung, Jae‐Ho1 aMin, Gi‐Sik1 aKim, Sanghee0 tjournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2017 July, v. 64, no. 4 p.447-456dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl49624x1066-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeu.123813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016800171300001600339520105300355536044701408592002801855596015801883596012702041596009602168596005102264650003402315650002302349650002502372650001802397650001402415650001502429650000902444650001902453650002802472650001802500650002002518650004102538650002202579650001602601650002402617650001202641650001802653650001102671650001502682653001802697653001802715653001002733653002202743653001802765700002002783700002602803700001902829700002102848773013002869856008502999852000903084655001203093IND60654184320221121232140.0190722e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065418432DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2019.16105162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjenane, Djamel10aEffect of the aromatisation with summer savory (Satureja hortensis L.) essential oil on the oxidative and microbial stabilities of liquid whole eggs during storage  ap. 444-455.  aThe Algerian essential oil (EO) extracted by hydro-distillation from Satureja hortensis L. (S. hortensis) was characterised by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). S. hortensis (summer savory) was chemotype carvacrol (54.2%) and γ-terpinene (21.1%). In its second part, the present study was conducted to evaluate in vitro, antioxidant activity of savory EO using the 2,2-di-phenyl-1-picrilhydrazyl (DPPH•) free radical scavenging assay. Finally, the EO was screened for biological activities in liquid whole eggs (LWE). The ability of savory EO to scavenge the free radical (DPPH∙) was very high, exceeding 80%. The long-term oxidative and microbial stability of LWE was positively influenced by EO treatments, increasing the shelf life to more than eight (> 8) days under refrigeration. Therefore, the results obtained in this work confirm savory EO treatment as a promising technology to extend the commercial shelf life of liquid egg products, as well as to maintain the quality of LWE as ingredient in innovative food products.  aThe present research was carried out with the financial support of the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation for Development (AECID) within the Interuniversity Cooperation and Scientific Research Program (PCI) [grant A/033506/10].

Some of these changes may not result solely from host responses, but actively induced changes by parasites/parasitoids to manipulate the host to acquire some benefit (e.g. parasite/parasitoid survivorship or dispersal ability). Field experiments investigating the effects of host behavioural alterations on parasite or parasitoid survivorship and the mechanisms involved in these changes are important for confirmation of behavioural manipulation. In the present study, we examined web design modification in the host spider species Cyclosa fililineata and Cyclosa morretes, which are attacked by the polysphinctine ectoparasitoid wasps Polysphincta sp. nr. purcelli and Polysphincta janzeni, respectively. We tested whether changes in orb spider web design (1) result from nutritional restrictions imposed by parasitoids and (2) increase the chances of adult wasp emergence from the cocoon. Furthermore, we describe changes in web design consistent with parasitoid larval development. Results, for both spider species, showed that web design modifications occurred only during the night preceding host spider death, and that modifications involved a reduction in the number of spirals and radii of orb webs. Food restriction did not generate web design modification, suggesting that observed changes in host behaviour resulted from direct actions of parasitoid larvae rather than as a by-product of nutritional deficiencies. Rain events were the major factor causing web rupture and subsequent parasitoid mortality. Modifications in web design reduced the frequency of web ruptures, increasing parasitoid adult emergence, and thus survivorship probability, during the pupal stage. These results confirm that web modifications by spiders are adaptive to parasitoid wasps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneidae 3aHymenoptera 3aadults 3aanimal behavior 3abehavior change 3abyproducts 3adeath 3afield experimentation 3ahosts 3alarvae 3alarval development 3anutrient deficiencies 3aparasitic wasps 3aphenotype 3aprobability 3apupae 3arain 3asurvival rate 3awebs 0abehaviour manipulation 0acocoon web 0aCyclosa fililineata 0aCyclosa morretes 0aorb web 0aparasitoid fitness 0aPolysphincta1 aGonzaga, Marcelo Oliveira1 aRoxinol, José Augusto Martins1 aSperber, Carlos Frankl0 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Jan., v. 111 p.289-296dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245010300199300001600302500002000318520185300338592002802191596005402219650001102273650002002284650002402304650002202328650001702350651001302367700001802380700002402398773013602422856007302558852000902631655001202640IND60743180220221117083735.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074318022DNAL7 a10.1111/ajr.127242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreen, Rachel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2727-576310aIncentives for smoking cessation in a rural pharmacy setting: The Tobacco Free Communities program  ap. 455-463.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: Investigate the smoking‐related outcomes and feasibility of a pharmacy‐led financial incentive program for smoking cessation. DESIGN: Multi‐site single‐arm trial of the Tobacco Free Communities program. SETTING: Community pharmacies within the Glamorgan Spring Bay (Site 1) and George Town (Site 2) municipalities of Tasmania. PARTICIPANTS: Adult smokers. Based on funding, the recruitment target was 76 smokers. INTERVENTIONS: Pharmacy staff provided quitting advice through 7 sessions over 3 months. At 6 sessions, abstinent participants (no cigarettes in the previous week and expired carbon monoxide ≤4 ppm) were rewarded with AU$50 vouchers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Smoking‐related outcomes were decreased smoking (self‐reported cigarettes per day and carbon monoxide levels) and abstinence rates. Feasibility outcomes were meeting the recruitment target, participant retention and participants' views of the program (measured by interview data from Site 2). RESULTS: Ninety individuals enrolled. Sixty‐two participants were included in analyses; remaining participants were excluded from analyses because they did not consent to use of their data within this study or had carbon monoxide ≤4 ppm at enrolment. Smoking (carbon monoxide and cigarettes per day) significantly decreased between enrolment and the first financial incentive session. Twelve participants (19.35%) were abstinent at the end of the program. Yet retention was poor; only 13 participants (20.97%) attended all sessions. Interviews suggested participants found the program beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Providing financial incentive within rural community pharmacies could be a viable method of encouraging smoking reductions and quit attempts. Additional work is needed to increase retention and compare effects to usual care pharmacy practices.  aPublisher supplied data  cTasmanian Department of Health and Human Services 3aadults 3acarbon monoxide 3aeconomic incentives 3arural communities 3arural health 3aTasmania1 aFrandsen, Mai1 aFerguson, Stuart G.0 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2021 June, v. 29, no. 3 p.455-463dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000053x1038-52827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.127243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001900123040001800142100002700160242012300187245014500310300001400455520155900469592002802028650002202056650001002078650001902088650002002107650001302127650002002140650001902160650000902179650002202188650001102210650001002221650001602231650002002247650001602267650002302283650001102306650001102317650002102328650001402349651001702363653001302380653001902393653003202412653001402444653001502458653002302473700002402496773011102520856007502631852000902706655001202715IND60594769320221117214314.0180522e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059476932DNAL7 a10.1642/AUK-17-79.12doi4 atauk-135-01-15  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberkircher, Meghan C.10aVariación Estacional en el Estrés Crónico y la Condición Energética en Dumetella carolinensis y Melospiza melodia10aSeasonal variation in chronic stress and energetic condition in Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia)  ap. 83-90.  aMigration and the breeding season are periods in which birds face many physical and energetic challenges that may cause changes in stress levels and body condition. Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis) and Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) were captured in 3 consecutive seasons—spring migration, the summer breeding period, and fall migration—in 2014 at a long-term bird-banding station located on the south shore of Lake Ontario to determine patterns of chronic stress and physiological condition related to seasonal shifts in their annual cycles. The heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio was used to assess chronic stress; and plasma metabolite concentrations (triglyceride and uric acid), along with a scaled body mass index, were used as indicators of the physiological condition and fuel utilization of Gray Catbirds and Song Sparrows. Plasma triglycerides were highest during migration periods for Gray Catbirds, while plasma uric acid was greater in spring and summer than in fall, indicating a seasonal shift in diet, possibly related to seasonal fruit availability. Gray Catbirds had elevated H/L ratios during spring, which suggests that spring migration is a period of modest stress for this species, and this spring stress seemed to be predominantly associated with earlier migration passage through the area. Our results suggest that physiological and immune function can vary across seasons in these species, perhaps in parallel with factors related to food availability at stopover or breeding sites during different times of the year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelospiza melodia 3abirds 3abody condition 3abody mass index 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3abreeding sites 3adiet 3afood availability 3afruits 3afuels 3aheterophils 3aimmune response 3ametabolites 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atriacylglycerols 3auric acid 3aLake Ontario 0abreeding 0achronic stress 0aheterophil/lymphocyte ratio 0amigration 0apasserines 0aplasma metabolites1 aPagano, Susan Smith0 tAuk.g2018 Jan., v. 135, no. 1 p.83-90dThe American Ornithologists' UnionwJournal:19765x1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-17-79.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011700165506011700282506007600399520146400475592002801939506003701967650001102004650001102015650001502026650001302041653001302054653003402067653002802101653001902129653001702148700001502165700001602180700001402196700001302210773009302223856008602316852000902402655001202411IND60791426820221207084922.0220914e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079142682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e103382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bo10aStrength prediction and application of cemented paste backfill based on machine learning and strength correction  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCemented paste backfill (CPB) is wildly used in mines production practices around the world. The strength of CPB is the core of research which is affected by factors such as slurry concentration and cement content. In this paper, a research on the UCS is conducted by means of a combination of laboratory experiments and machine learning. BPNN, RBFNN, GRNN and LSTM are trained and used for UCS prediction based on 180 sets of experimental UCS data. The simulation results show that LSTM is the neural network with the optimal prediction performance (The total rank is 11). The trial-and-error, PSO, GWO and SSA are used to optimize the learning rate and the hidden layer nodes for LSTM. The comparison results show that GWO-LSTM is the optimal model which can effectively express the non-linear relationship between underflow productivity, slurry concentration, cement content and UCS in experiments (R=0.9915, RMSE = 0.0204, VAF = 98.2847 and T = 16.37 s). The correction coefficient (k) is defined to adjust the error between predicted UCS in laboratory (UCSM) and predicted UCS in actual engineering (UCSA) based on extensive engineering and experimental experience. Using GWO-LSTM combined with k, the strength of the filling body is successfully predicted for 153 different filled stopes with different stowing gradient at different curing times. This study provides both effective guidance and a new intelligent method for the support of safety mining.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acement 3amodels 3aprediction 3aslurries 0aBackfill 0aUniaxial compressive strength 0aCemented paste backfill 0aNeural network 0aOptimization1 aLi, Keqing1 aZhang, Siqi1 aHu, Yafei1 aHan, Bin0 tHeliyon.g2022 Aug., v. 8, no. 8 p.e10338-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e103383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245006900209300001600278500001900294520127900313592002801592596006501620596006001685596006001745650001101805650001901816650000901835650001501844650001001859650001701869650001101886650001701897650000901914651001201923700001601935700003201951773011501983856008302098852000902181655001202190IND60678806620221122034850.0210402e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067880662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02570-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfleiderer, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1493-459810aIncreasing risks of apple tree frost damage under climate change  ap. 515-525.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnthropogenic climate change is affecting agriculture and crop production. The responses of horticultural and agricultural systems to changing climatic conditions can be non-linear and at times counter-intuitive. Depending on the characteristics of the system, the actual impact can arise as a result of a combination of climate hazards or compound events. Here, we show that compound events can lead to increased risk of frost damage for apple fruit trees in Germany in a 2 °C warmer world of up to 10% relative to present day. Although the absolute number of frost days is declining, warmer winters also lead to earlier blossom of fruit trees, which in turn can lead to regionally dependent increased risks of the occurrence of frost days after apple blossom. In southern Germany, warmer winters may also lead to an increase in years in which apple yield is negatively affected by a lack of sufficient amount of cold days to trigger the seasonal response of the trees. Our results show how cropping system responses to seasonal climate can lead to unexpected effects of increased risk of frost damage as a result of warmer winters. An improved understanding of ecosystem responses to changes in climate signals is important to fully assess the impacts of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a01LN1711AcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (DE)  a01LN1711AcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung  a01LS1711EcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 3aapples 3aclimate change 3acold 3aecosystems 3afrost 3afrost injury 3afruits 3ahorticulture 3arisk 3aGermany1 aMenke, Inga1 aSchleussner, Carl-Friedrich0 tClimatic change.g2019 Dec., v. 157, no. 3-4 p.515-525dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02570-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245018000170300001800350500001500368520062800383592002801011650001801039650001601057650002101073650001101094650001701105650001201122650007001134650003401204650006701238650002501305650002201330650000901352650002401361650007101385650002801456650003001484653003401514653004101548653001701589653003001606700001601636700001501652700001701667700001501684700001601699700001601715700001401731773014701745852000901892856007501901655001201976IND4465141020221119043340.0160905e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446514102DNAL7 a233686442pmid7 a10.1021/jf305256w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi10aIsolation, Structural Elucidation, MS Profiling, and Evaluation of Triglyceride Accumulation Inhibitory Effects of Benzophenone C-Glucosides from Leaves of Mangifera indica L.  ap. 1884-1895.  a2019-12-05  aSeventy percent ethanol–water extract from the leaves of Mangifera indica L.

Commercial effective vaccine is not available, for that reason control of the disease depends on diagnostic tools. To improve the efficiency of the diagnostic program in Cuba, LABIOFAM Group, developed an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ELISA kit, to complement the diagnostic system that currently uses the agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) kit. The ELISA AIE-LAB Kit was evaluated in a Mexican context, compared with the gold standard test Agar gel immunodiffusion, AGID AIE-LABIOFAM, and commercial AGID kit. The analytical sensitivity was determined using serial dilutions twofold of the positive control serum to establish the range of detected antibodies in relation to the cutoff value of the plate (OD 0.300). A precision study was carried out to evaluate repeatability, intermediate precision, and reproducibility by estimating the standard deviation and coefficient of variation. The precision results were satisfactory and the values of the coefficient of variation were considered adequate to guarantee an excellent consistency of the ELISA AIE-LAB. The diagnostic performance of the ELISA AIE-LAB involved the evaluation of specificity, sensitivity, and concordance in comparison with both AGID tests. The diagnostic sensitivity was 100% and the specificity 97.6%, with a very good degree of concordance (Kappa = 0.9). The results suggest that the ELISA AIE-LAB test could be used in Mexico as a diagnostic system for the detection of specific antibodies against the equine infectious anemia virus, as per current international norms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquine infectious anemia virus 3aagar 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequine infectious anemia 3agels 3ahorses 3astandard deviation 3avaccines 3aveterinary medicine 3aCuba 3aMexico 0aEquine 0aEIAV 0aELISA 0aAGID 0aDiagnostic1 aMontes-de-Oca-Jiménez, Roberto1 aVázquez Chagoyan, Juan Carlos1 aPliego, Alberto Barbabosa1 aVarela Guerrero, Jorge Antonio1 aCoroas González, Laura Ileana1 aBernabé, Salvador Lagunas0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2021 Mar., v. 98 p.103372-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1033723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006600167300002000233520144500253592002801698596005901726596005901785596008701844596005001931650004401981650003402025650001502059650001102074650001202085650003702097650001002134650001402144650000702158650001402165650001302179650001602192650001202208650001602220650001502236700001602251700001402267700001702281700001502298700001902313700001602332700001702348700001402365700006002379773015602439856008302595852000902678655001202687IND60750765420221120094107.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075076542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14238-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Hongliang10aEfficiently immobilizing uranium (VI) by oxidized carbon foam  ap. 50471-50479.  aOxidized carbon foam (oxidized CF) was prepared by using a facile chemical oxidation treatment at relatively low temperature of 450 °C and applied to capture uranyl cation [U(VI)] from aqueous solutions. The effects of pH, contact time, initial U(VI) concentration, and temperature on the U(VI) absorption performance of oxidized CF were investigated by batch experiments. The oxidized CF was illustrated to exhibit fast sorption kinetics (92% removal within 15 min and 98% removal in 2 h) and high sorption capacity (305.77 mg g⁻¹ at pH 5) toward U(VI). Integrated analyses combining energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were applied on the U(VI)-loaded oxidized CF, showing the introduction of carboxyl groups as U(VI) sorption sites on the surface of CF after oxidation treatment. Furthermore, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was employed to identify the binding modes of U(VI) indicating that each UO₂²⁺ cation is coordinated with one or two carboxyl groups on the equatorial plane. Notably, the low content of U(VI) in wastewater can be efficiently immobilized by the oxidized CF, and the immobilized U(VI) can be further concentrated and converted into Na₂U₂O₇ or U₃O₈ by a simple sintering step.

Physiological constraints such as sperm depletion and senescence are a likely cause. Also, maternal control in response to female age may be an alternative explanation. Here valvifer or abdominal tip movements were used to assess whether age-dependent sex ratio was due to physiological constraints or maternal control with an ichneumonid wasp, Pimpla nipponica ; the offspring sex ratio at the time of wasp emergence was compared with the sex ratio predicted from abdominal tip movements. When the female was relatively young, there was little difference between the sex ratios examined. However, as the age of the females increased, the realized offspring sex ratio at wasp emergence was more male-biased than the sex ratio predicted at the time of oviposition. Thus, there was an inconsistency between the sex ratios. Curiously, the predictions of continuous movements for male egg deposition were always perfect, regardless of maternal age; fertilization control failure was detected when the females had decided to lay female eggs. Thus, physiological constraints are a likely explanation for the inconsistency in relation to female age for P. nipponica .  aPublisher supplied data 3aPimpla 3aeggs 3afemales 3amales 3aoviposition 3aparasitic wasps 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3asex allocation 3asex ratio 3aspermatozoa 3awasps2 aNihon Gakujutsu Shinkōkai,eFunder0 tPsyche.g2014, v. 2014dCambridge Entomological Club]x0033-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155%2F2014%2F3631743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245013700202300001800339500002000357520193800377592002802315596007202343596007802415596006402493596005602557596007902613650002502692650001402717650002202731650001302753650000902766650003702775650001302812650001202825650001402837650001002851650001802861650002202879650001302901650001302914650001102927650002002938650001202958650002002970650001602990651001103006700002203017700002403039700001903063773011903082856007303201852000903274655001203283IND60695748120221121085610.0200519e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069574812DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.134972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorissette, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5037-909310aDeciphering lifelong thermal niche using otolith δ18O thermometry within supplemented lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations  ap. 1114-1127.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe selection of thermal habitat by fish is strongly regulated by physiology and behaviour. However, delineation of a species lifelong thermal niche remains technically challenging. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) survival and productivity are recognised as being tightly linked to a somewhat restricted thermal habitat. The factors guiding temperature selection during each life stage remain poorly understood. In this study, we tested the significant factors controlling the realised thermal niche of lake trout from two southern Quebec small boreal lakes that experienced supplementation stocking during the last 20 years. We used oxygen stable isotope (δ¹⁸O) thermometry of otolith calcium carbonates (aragonite) using secondary‐ion mass spectrometry to estimate experienced lifelong temperatures. We investigated the thermal habitat of lake trout with known genotypes (local, hybrid, and stocked). Ontogeny and genetic origin influenced temperature selection in both studied lake trout populations. Young‐of‐the‐year consistently used warmer, shallower habitats (10.7 ± 2.6°C, 7.5 m depth) prior to a juvenile transition to colder and deeper waters (8.5 ± 3.3°C, 10 m depth). Stocked lake trout, originating from a genetically distinct ecotype, exhibited a more variable thermal niche, with some individuals consistently using warmer habitat (10.4 ± 1°C) than local fish. Their hybrid progeny also occupied a warmer thermal niche, intermediate to the parental strains. We propose that increased fat content and genetic origin are potential explanatory factors for warmer temperature use. This study reiterates that high‐resolution otolith δ¹⁸O thermometry is a uniquely well‐suited approach for unravelling the multiple factors that influence lifelong temperature selection in fish. Our results illustrate that the realised thermal niche is influenced by a genetic–environment interaction.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada  cCanadian Research Chair in Genomics and Conservation of Aquatic Resources  cChaire de recherche sur les espèces aquatiques exploitées  cRessources Aquatiques Québec (RAQ) Research Center  cFonds de Recherche du Québec – Nature et Technologies FRQNT scholarship 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3aaragonite 3acalcium carbonate 3aecotypes 3afish 3agenotype-environment interaction 3ahabitats 3ahybrids 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3alipid content 3amass spectrometry 3aontogeny 3aotoliths 3aoxygen 3aoxygen isotopes 3aprogeny 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3aQuebec1 aBernatchez, Louis1 aWiedenbeck, Michael1 aSirois, Pascal0 tFreshwater biology.g2020 June, v. 65, no. 6 p.1114-1127dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.134973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012600166300001600292520167600308592002801984650001202012650001602024650001302040650001002053650002102063650002302084650002402107650002702131650001202158650001402170650003202184650001202216650001002228650001102238653000802249653000802257653000702265653000702272653000802279653000902287653000802296653001202304653001002316653001302326653001102339653001202350653001902362700002202381700001402403773012402417856008602541852000902627655001202636IND60533343220221119230838.0190319e20150212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053334322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2014.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAina, O.O.10aCulture vessel and auxin treatments affect in vitro rooting and ex vitro survival of six Arachis paraguariensis genotypes  ap. 167-171.  aArachis paraguariensis Chodat and Hassl. is a wild peanut with very high morphogenic potential but limited rooting ability in vitro has hampered production of large number of surviving plantlets. The present study evaluated in vitro rooting and ex vitro survival of micro-shoots utilizing a 6×3×3×2 factorial experiment. Six A. paraguariensis genotypes were treated with three auxins at three concentration levels inside either 11.4cm×8.6cm×10.2cm polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) vessel or 2.5cm×15cm glass tube. The auxin treatments included indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) at 0.2, 0.6 and 1mgL−1. Across all auxin treatments, PETG vessel was superior to glass tube in terms of rooting percentage (68% vs 17%), and survival at acclimatization (38% vs 6%) respectively. Further analysis of plantlets cultured inside PETG vessel showed that rooting and post acclimatization survival were high on MS medium without any auxin (90% and 80%) and on 0.2mgL−1 IBA (92% and 76%) or IAA (86% and 74%) respectively. Contrariwise, none of the shoots treated with 1mgL−1 NAA survived acclimatization. The 0.2mgL−1 of IAA and IBA treatments also exhibited high number of roots per plantlet (7 and 5), and lowest number of days to root initiation (11 and 12 days) respectively. Since rooting was delayed (26 days) on MS medium without auxin, we recommend supplementation of nutrient medium with 0.2mgL−1 IBA or IAA whenever rapid rooting is desired. Overall, the results showed that genotype, auxin type, and auxin concentration significantly altered in vitro rooting of A. paraguariensis plantlets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis 3aacclimation 3agenotype 3aglass 3ain vitro studies 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3apeanuts 3aplantlets 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3arooting 3aroots 3ashoots 0aIAA 0aIBA 0aBA 0aMS 0aNAA 0aPETG 0aTDZ 0aArachis 0aAuxin 0aIn vitro 0aPeanut 0aRooting 0aTissue culture1 aQuesenberry, K.H.1 aGallo, M.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2015 Feb. 12, v. 183 p.167-171dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245014400184300001400328520114800342592002801490650002501518650001301543650001801556650001401574650002701588650001001615650001201625650002201637650001201659650001301671650001401684650001101698650001101709650002401720650005101744650004801795650001801843650002301861650002901884650003301913650005001946650002801996650001302024650003202037700001402069700001702083700002102100773011902121856005502240852000902295655001202304IND4477831720221122231623.0120302e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447783172DNAL7 a220990592pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2011.01089.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Dali10aEMBRYONIC FACTOR 19 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein that is Essential for the Initiation of Zygotic Embryogenesis in Arabidopsis  ap. 55-64.  aEarly embryogenesis is the most fundamental developmental process in biology. Screening of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)‐mutagenized populations of Arabidopsis thaliana led to the identification of a zygote‐lethal mutant embryonic factor 19 (fac19) in which embryo development was arrested at the elongated zygote to octant stage. The number of endosperm nuclei decreased significantly in fac19 embryos. Genetic analysis showed fac19 was caused by a single recessive mutation with typical mendelian segregation, suggesting equal maternal and paternal contributions of FAC19 towards zygotic embryogenesis. Positional cloning showed that FAC19 encodes a putative mitochondrial protein with 16 conserved pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs. The fac19 mutation caused a conversion from hydrophilic serine located in a previously unknown domain to hydrophobic leucine. Crosses between FAC19/fac19 and the T‐DNA insertion mutants in the same gene failed to complement the fac19 defects, confirming the identity of the gene. This study revealed the critical importance of a PPR protein‐mediated mitochondrial function in early embryogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acrossing 3aembryogenesis 3aendosperm 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3agenes 3aleucine 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3amutation 3ascreening 3aserine 3azygote 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aSeedsxgrowth & development1 aJiang, Li1 aGong, Huaqin1 aLiu, Chun‐Ming0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2012 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.55-64dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2011.01089.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245009300176300001100269520187800280592002802158650002502186650002102211650001402232650002602246650001802272700006102290773011902351856008302470852000902553655001202562IND60751336320221119173321.0220112e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075133632DNAL7 a10.1186/s13028-021-00603-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRovroy, Lynn Bernadette10aAge of puppies at referral to veterinary cardiology specialists for murmur investigation  ap. 37.  aBACKGROUND: Cardiac auscultation is an important screening test at the first health examination of puppies because most clinically relevant congenital cardiac anomalies cause a loud murmur from birth. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the age at which dogs with suspected congenital cardiac anomalies were referred to a veterinary cardiology specialist for murmur investigation. A secondary aim was to establish the time interval between the visit to the cardiologist and the first available murmur documentation. The digital archive of a veterinary teaching hospital was searched for dogs with congenital cardiac anomalies and puppies with innocent murmurs during a 5-year period. Dogs had to be referred because of a murmur, and they had to undergo physical examination and echocardiography by a veterinary cardiology specialist. The health certificate section of the pet passport, and the medical records from the referring veterinarian, were reviewed to identify the date when the murmur was first documented. RESULTS: Of the 271 included dogs, 94% had a congenital cardiac anomaly and 6% had an innocent murmur. The dogs’ median age was 190 days when they were examined by the cardiologist. Only 10% of the dogs were referred by the breeder’s veterinarian, while 90% of the dogs were referred by the new owner’s veterinarian. The median age of the first available murmur documentation by a first opinion veterinary practitioner was 95 days. CONCLUSIONS: Only 10% of the puppies in the present study were referred to a veterinary cardiology specialist for murmur investigation before they were sold to a new owner. Referral prior to re-homing would have been feasible if the murmur had been detected and documented by the breeder’s veterinarian, if referral was offered by the breeder’s veterinarian and the referral was accepted by the breeder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical examination 3aechocardiography 3ahospitals 3aretrospective studies 3aveterinarians1 aSzatmári, Viktor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0273-65860 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2021 Dec., v. 63, no. 1 p.37-37dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-021-00603-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245006700165300001800232520149700250592002801747650000801775650001401783650001501797650002101812650002001833650000901853650000901862650001801871650001901889650003101908650003001939650003401969650003002003650001302033700001702046700002002063773009102083856007802174852000902252655001202261IND60375072820221121101747.0150820e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6037507282DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2015000492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardo, Wilmer A.10aSignal enhancement in ultraflat electrochemical DNA biosensors  ap. 1905-1911.  aThe ability of holding back the undesired molecules, but at the same time to provide the right distribution and orientation of the bioreceptors, are critical targets to reach an efficient hybridization and enhanced detection in electrochemical DNA biosensors. The main actors responsible of these key functions are the substrate of the sensor and the interface auto‐assembled on it. In this paper we present the annealing as a method to improve commercial gold evaporated substrates for biosensor applications. The restructuring of granulated gold surface by means of annealing heating treatment leads to the formation of ultraflat gold lamellar terraces. The formation of terraces was characterized with scanning tunneling microscopy and optical interferometry. The performance of the sensor sensitivity on granular substrates and ultraflat substrates was studied, concerning the orientation and surface coverage of the bioreceptor interface applied in electrochemical biosensor. The hybridization efficiency of ferrocene‐labeled DNA amplified by PCR was characterized with surface plasmon resonance and electrochemistry. The experimental results demonstrate that annealing process, positive influence on optical and voltammetric readings, due to a structured organization of the bioreceptors on the flat substrate, gaining more efficient immobilization and DNA hybridization. The results suggest the annealing as a powerful tool for improving gold substrates in biosensors applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aannealing 3abiosensors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrophoresis 3agold 3aheat 3ahybridization 3ainterferometry 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3asurface plasmon resonance 3aterraces1 aMir, Mònica1 aSamitier, Josep0 tElectrophoresis.g2015 Aug., v. 36, no. 16 p.1905-1911dVerlag Chemiex0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2015000493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013300168300001000301500001900311520158400330592002801914650001901942650002301961650002801984650002602012650002902038650002702067650002002094650001802114650002302132650001102155650001502166650002802181650002202209650001302231650001502244650003702259650002402296650001302320650002302333650001502356650001302371700006302384700002402447700002102471700001902492773011502511856008202626852000902708655001202717IND60683309120221118141930.0201203e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068330912DNAL7 a10.1186/s10152-020-0536-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarya, Mehrnoosh10aAntifouling and antibacterial activities of bioactive extracts from different organs of the sea cucumber Holothuria leucospilota  ap. 4.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, antifouling and antibacterial properties of polar, semi polar and non-polar bioactive compounds derived from the sea cucumber Holothuria leucospilota were investigated. A series comprising n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from four different organs of sea cucumber (body wall, gonad, digestive tract and respiratory tree) were investigated for their antibacterial and antifouling activity against two species of microalgae, larvae of barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite and a non-target organism: larvae of Artemia salina. Results showed that the highest antibacterial activity was found in the ethyl acetate extract of body wall against Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.250 mg/mL. The MIC of ethyl acetate extract of body wall ranged between 0.062 and 0.250 mg/mL against two microalgal strains. All extracts showed moderate to low toxicity against larvae of barnacles. The most pronounced anti-barnacle activity was found in the ethyl acetate extract of body wall with median lethal concentration (LC₅₀) value of 0.049 mg/mL. Among the twelve extracts, the ethyl acetate extracts of body wall showed the maximum antibacterial and antifouling activities. The bioactive compounds of the ethyl acetate extract of the sea cucumber body wall were determined using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Fatty acids and terpenes were the major compounds, which may be responsible for antibacterial and antifouling activity of the ethyl acetate extract of body wall of the sea cucumber H. leucospilota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia salina 3aBalanus amphitrite 3aHolothuria leucospilota 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifouling activities 3adigestive tract 3aethyl acetate 3agas chromatography 3ahexane 3aintegument 3alethal concentration 50 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amicroalgae 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anontarget organisms 3aresearch 3arespiratory system 3aterpenoids 3atoxicity1 aSajjadi, Mir Masoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7221-84611 aYousefzadi, Morteza1 aSourinejad, Iman1 aZarei, Maaroof0 tHelgoland marine research.g2020 Dec., v. 74, no. 1 p.4-4dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000000238x1438-387X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10152-020-0536-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245006700163300001400230520169800244592002801942650001101970650002301981650001702004650002302021650001302044650002602057650002302083650001702106650001702123650001302140650001402153650002802167650000902195650001902204653002502223653001102248653001902259653003102278700001402309700001902323700001702342700001302359700001502372700001702387700001602404773011502420856007902535852000902614655001202623IND60674722520200302000000.0191030e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067472252DNAL7 a10.2478/cerce-2019-00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaqib, H.M.U.10aEffect of Compost Application on the Growth of Acacia nilotica  ap. 66-73.  aAcacia nilotica is an important agroforestry specie, which is used in both compact and linear forms. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of compost on the growth performance and biomass production of A. nilotica. Completely randomized design (CRD) was used to analyze the variations among several growth morphological traits. Two parallel trials, pot trial (seedlings), field trial (saplings) were conducted simultaneously. Compost and litter mixture were applied in mentioned trials. Following treatments were used: T0 – control; T1 - 25% of compost and 75% of nursery soil; T2 - mixture of 50% nursery soil and 50% compost; T3 - mixture of 75% compost and 25% of nursery soil; T4 - where 100% compost was applied. Increase in plant growth was observed with the increases in the amount of compost mixture. In field trial maximum plant height, shoot length, root length, rootshoot ratio and biomass production was observed when 100% compost level was applied, while minimum was observed without any compost appli-cation. In pot trials, the maximum plant height, rootshoot ratio and biomass production was recorded when 75% compost level was applied. Overall, Acacia performed better with 100% of compost application in field trail and 75% of compost application in pot trial. The results of this study demonstrated the positive effects of compost on the growth of Acacia. The seedling development was improved considerably with different levels having greater percentage of organic fertilizer and it was concluded that compost improves soil fertility and it should be used as organic fertilizer in farming and forestry practices for improving crop growth and yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aVachellia nilotica 3aagroforestry 3abiomass production 3acomposts 3afield experimentation 3agrowth performance 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3asaplings 3aseedlings 3asilvicultural practices 3asoil 3asoil fertility 0amorphological traits 0alitter 0aorganic manure 0acomplete randomized design1 aAhmad, I.1 aRashid, M.H.U.1 aFarooq, T.H.1 aAsif, M.1 aKashif, M.1 aIkpāl, Ē.,1 aNawaz, M.F.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 52, no. 1 p.66-73dSciendowJournal:6287x2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/cerce-2019-00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011300206300001400319520183300333592002802166596016102194650001602355650001602371650001302387650001602400650001402416650002102430650001202451650000902463650002602472650001102498650001002509650001502519650001502534650001202549650001102561700001502572700001902587700001802606773011602624856008302740852000902823655001202832IND60683309220221118141934.0200422e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068330922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-019-00359-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoudel, Sanjok1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2394-880910aConfinement influenced the diurnal behavior of Katahdin rams and Kiko wethers in southern-pine silvopastures  ap. 29-40.  aPrevious studies with Kiko wethers rotationally stocked in southern-pine silvopastures showed a significant debarking of 10-11-year-old pine trees during winter and spring. There is a need to identify suitable animals and management strategies to protect trees in silvopastures. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of confinement on diurnal behavior and distribution pattern of Katahdin rams and Kiko wethers cograzing in southern-pine silvopastures during the cool-season grazing period. Diurnal behavior and distribution pattern of Kiko wethers (n = 6; 61.5 ± 1.58 kg live weight) and Katahdin rams (n = 6; 72.7 ± 4.80 kg live weight) were monitored in two sets of studies: (1) animals were rotationally stocked in three silvopasture plots with confinement (plot-gate closed), and (2) the same study was repeated with non-confinement (plot-gate open), allowing access to wooded area and open space located outside the silvopasture plots. Rams did not debark pine trees irrespective of confinement. They spent less time (17%) grazing (p < 0.05) and stayed out of the silvopasture plots for a significant period (42%) with non-confinement. Wethers showed some debarking (2%) of pine trees with confinement, but none without confinement. With non-confinement, wethers’ grazing time decreased (53%) (p < 0.0001), browsing time increased (48×) (p < 0.0001), and distribution outside the silvopasture plots remained significant (73%). Katahdin rams were found safe to use in southern-pine silvopastures consisting of 12-year-old longleaf and loblolly pine trees; however, non-confinement would be necessary while using Kiko wethers to safeguard young southern-pine trees in small silvopasture plots containing similar understory vegetation during the cool-season grazing period.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016-68006-24764cUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) 3aPinus taeda 3abody weight 3abrowsing 3acold season 3adebarking 3adiurnal activity 3agrazing 3arams 3asilvopastoral systems 3aspring 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avegetation 3awethers 3awinter1 aKarki, Uma1 aKarki, Yubaraj1 aTillman, Asha0 tAgroforestry systems.g2020 Feb., v. 94, no. 1 p.29-40dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34245x0167-43667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-019-00359-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008200172300001600254520148600270592002801756650001701784650001801801650001401819650000901833650002201842650001801864650001301882650002201895650001801917650001201935650001001947651001201957700002001969773008501989856008302074852000902157655001202166IND60096733320221119090400.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009673332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2010.09.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIacobescu, Flavius10aMetamorphoses of cogeneration-based district heating in Romania: A case study  ap. 269-280.  aThe paper presents the birth and evolution of the cogeneration-based district heating (DH) system in a medium size city in Romania (Targoviste). The evolution of the industrialization degree was the main factor which controlled the population growth and led to a continuous reconfiguration of the DH system. The DH system assisted by cogeneration emerged as a solution in a certain phase of the demographic development of the city. The political and social changes occurring in Romania after 1990 have had important negative consequences on the DH systems in small towns. In Targoviste the DH system survived but in 2001 the solution based on cogeneration became economically inefficient, due to the low technical quality of the existing equipment and the low gas prices, to the procedure of setting the DH tariffs and the service cost at consumer’s level and to some bureaucratic problems. Energy policy measures taken at national and local levels in 2003 and 2005 led to the re-establishment of the cogeneration-based district heating in 2005. However, a different technical solution has been adopted. Details about the present (2009) cogeneration-based DH system in Targoviste are presented together with several technical and economical indicators. The main conclusion is that by a proper amendment of the technical solutions, cogeneration could be a viable solution for DH even in case of abrupt social and demographic changes, such as those occurring in Romania after 1990.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy policy 3aequipment 3aheat 3aindustrialization 3amarket prices 3apolitics 3apopulation growth 3asocial change 3atariffs 3atowns 3aRomania1 aBadescu, Viorel0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.269-280dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2010.09.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100002200197245011000219300001600329506007600345506003100421520144600452592002801898596004501926596004601971506003702017650002802054650001402082650001202096650002502108650001802133650001702151650001602168650001202184650000902196650001602205650002302221650001902244650001102263650001302274650001902287650000902306650001302315653001702328653002402345653001902369653001202388653002302400700002502423700003102448700001502479700002202494700005702516700001302573773011902586856008802705852000902793655001202802IND60633295020221207092813.0190628e20190610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063329502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4412chorus7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWordofa, Dawit N.10aBiogeochemical fate of ferrihydrite-model organic compound complexes during anaerobic microbial reduction  ap. 216-223.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAssociations of organic carbon (OC) with iron (Fe) oxide minerals play an important role in regulating the stability of OC in soil environments. Knowledge about the fate and stability of Fe-OC complexes is impaired by the heterogeneity of OC. Additional biogeochemical variables in soil environments, such as redox conditions and microbes, further increase complexity in understanding the stability of mineral-associated soil OC. This study investigated the fate and stability of model organic compounds, including glucose (GL), glucosamine (GN), tyrosine (TN), benzoquinone (BQ), amylose (AM), and alginate (AL), complexed with an Fe oxide mineral, ferrihydrite (Fh), during microbial reduction. During a 25-d anaerobic incubation with Shewanella putrefaciens CN32, the reduction of Fe followed the order of Fh-BQ > Fh-GL > Fh-GN > Fh-TN > Fh-AL > Fh-AM. In terms of OC released during the anaerobic incubation, Fh-GN complexes released the highest amount of OC while Fh-AM complexes released the lowest. Organic carbon regulated the reduction of Fe by acting as an electron shuttle, affecting microbial activities, and associating with Fh. Benzoquinone had the highest electron accepting capacity, but potentially can inhibit microbial activity. These findings provide insights into the roles of different organic functional groups in regulating Fe reduction and the stability of Fh-bound OC under anaerobic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000150 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aShewanella putrefaciens 3aalginates 3aamylose 3aanaerobic conditions 3abenzoquinones 3aferrihydrite 3aglucosamine 3aglucose 3airon 3airon oxides 3amicrobial activity 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3amoieties 3aorganic carbon 3asoil 3atyrosine 0aFerrihydrite 0aMicrobial reduction 0aOrganic carbon 0aQuinone 0aElectron transport1 aAdhikārī, Dineśa,1 aDunham-Cheatham, Sarrah M.1 aZhao, Qian1 aPoulson, Simon R.1 aTang, Yuanzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7741-86461 aYang, Yu0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 10, v. 668 p.216-223dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009600171506002800267520139900295592002801694506003701722650001601759650001201775650002801787650001501815650000901830650001001839650001401849650001301863650001301876700002101889700002101910700002001931773009601951856008302047852000902130655001202139IND60740129320221207113224.0201207s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074012932DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202027000192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasily, Dorozhkin10aComparative effectiveness of means to reduce negative effects of lead, cadmium and nitrates  aResource is Open Access  aAccording to the constant deterioration of the environmental situation, the issue of preserving health of agricultural animals and obtaining safe livestock products is acute. One of the most effective ways to reduce the accumulation and ecotoxicants impact is pharmacological drugs usage and feed additives with different mechanisms of action. A comparative assessment of various agents exposed to heavy metals and nitrates in laboratory animals is presented. It was found that using feed with an increased content of heavy metals and nitrates increased the level of ecotoxicants in the organs and tissues of animals. Solvimin selenium enabled to reduce the accumulation of cadmium and lead in organism (up to 45 %), restore the normal amount of hemoglobin and the summation threshold, animals’ weight, protein and carbohydrate metabolism. However, it did not restore the indicators of the liver and kidneys functional state. The use of laricarvit showed a fairly high protective efficiency in removing cadmium (25– 30 %) and reducing the nitrates accumulation in the blood and muscles, normalizing the body weight of animals, the number of white blood cells, lymphocytes and methemoglobin. Detox injections successfully reduced the content of nitric nitrogen in the blood, in the liver and, to some extent, in the kidneys, while complete normalization of blood parameters was not observed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody weight 3acadmium 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3ahemoglobin 3alead 3aliver 3alivestock 3anitrogen 3aselenium1 aGalina, Pavlenko1 aNatalia, Pavlova1 aDmitry, Drozdov0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 27 p.00019-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202027000193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04096naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245023500172300001600407520213600423592002802559650001302587650002002600650002402620650001202644650001102656650001702667650002602684650001802710650002302728650001302751650001002764651001102774653001702785653001002802653002202812653003702834653002802871653001702899653001702916653001202933653003202945653002502977700002103002700002403023700002703047700002403074700002203098700002003120700002403140700002503164700001903189773020603208856008303414852000903497655001203506IND60623397520190621000000.0181127e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062339752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2018.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesbordes, Florine10aÉtat nutritionnel des résidents d’un établissement d’hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes (EHPAD) et liens entre la dénutrition, la consommation de compléments nutritionnels oraux et le service à l’assiette  ap. 225-229.  aIn Nursing Homes (NH), undernutrition is frequent, with severe consequences. Paradoxically, few studies in France have determined the nutritional status of residents of NH and/or the influence of the consumption of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) and the practice of a service on the plate (SOP) on the nutritional status of the residents. The objectives of the study were to determine (i) the nutritional status of residents in a large NH and (ii) the possible link between the consumption of ONS, the practice of a SOP and the presence of undernutrition.The study was retrospective descriptive transverse monocentric. The data came from all the medical files consulted between July 2017 and January 2018. The nutritional status was determined according to the French criteria for adults and the elderly. The results are presented in median [IQ25–75] for the quantitative variables, and percentage for the qualitative variables. Univariate analyzes and multivariate analyses were performed to establish an association between the presence of undernutrition and the variables of interest recorded.The NH included 258 seats. The study population consisted of 248 residents (age: 88.0 [83.0–93.0] years), of whom 78.2 % were women ; the weight was 62.8 [52.9–74.4] kg, BMI 25.7 [21.9–29.4] kg/m2, albumin 35.8 [31.6–37.8] g/l. In total, 39.5 % of the residents were malnourished, consistent with the usual data. In univariate analysis, undernourished residents were older, consumed more ONS, and had less SOP than non-undernourished residents (P=0.002, P<0.0001, P=0.01, respectively). In multivariate analysis, there was a negative association between the presence of undernutrition and BMI level, albumin and CRP concentration. Taking ONS and SOP were not associated with undernutrition.The NH studied, although large, seemed representative of French public institutions for the number of seats, age distribution and gender of residents. Nearly 40 % of the patients were undernourished. The multivariate analysis suggested that the use of ONS and the implementation of SOP in this NH should be better specified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3abody mass index 3adietary supplements 3aelderly 3agender 3amalnutrition 3amultivariate analysis 3anursing homes 3anutritional status 3apatients 3awomen 3aFrance 0aDénutrition 0aEHPAD 0aPersonnes âgées 0aCompléments nutritionnels oraux 0aService à l’assiette 0aMalnutrition 0aNursing home 0aElderly 0aOral nutritional supplement 0aService on the plate1 aJouveau, Sylvain1 aBroussaudier, Alice1 aNoailletas, Véronique1 aFayemendy, Philippe1 aMorin, Béatrice,1 aMisset, Blanche1 aRebière, François1 aDesport, Jean Claude1 aJésus, Pierre0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2018 Nov., v. 32, no. 4 p.225-229dElsevier Masson SASaAssociation pour le développement de la recherche en nutrition (ADREN)wJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2018.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012100165300001600286520137700302592002801679650001101707650001901718650001701737650002601754650001401780650002001794650003101814650000901845650001501854650001501869650002201884650001901906650001601925650001701941651001901958700001701977773008501994856008302079852000902162655001202171IND60096733520221119090213.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009673352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2010.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonahan, J.12aA comparison of the energy and carbon implications of new systems of energy provision in new build housing in the UK  ap. 290-298.  aThe built environment needs to develop sustainable, decarbonised, low energy systems and approaches that are socially acceptable and economically beneficial. The UK mainstream house construction industry is being driven, through policy and regulation, towards achieving this end without evidence of how these new systems of provision are used by passively adopting households. In this paper energy use, consequential emissions of CO₂, and annual running costs for a case study comprising 14 newly constructed low energy affordable homes are evaluated. Four different energy typologies are compared: ground sourced heat pumps; active solar (thermal and photovoltaic); passive solar and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery; conventional high efficiency gas boiler. The carbon embodied in construction and emitted over a 20 year occupation period for each typology is calculated. Ground source heat pumps have the highest annual primary energy demand, CO₂ emission and annual running costs over the 20 year period. The homes with active solar technologies provided most benefit across all three evaluation criteria. Energy and CO₂ emissions associated with end uses other than heating were similar to the UK average. This poses significant questions on the probability of policy application in the real world to deliver projected reductions in emissions of CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aconstruction industry 3aemissions 3aenergy recovery 3aenergy use and consumption 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3aprimary energy 3aprobability 3asolar energy 3aUnited Kingdom1 aPowell, J.C.0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.290-298dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2010.09.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006200168300001600230520079500246592002801041650002101069650001501090650001701105650002201122650002001144650001301164650002001177700001401197700001901211700002401230773010401254856008401358852000901442655001201451IND60088382120221118234901.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008838212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuirink, Joen10aBiogenesis of inner membrane proteins in Escherichia coli  ap. 965-976.  aThe inner membrane proteome of the model organism Escherichia coli is composed of inner membrane proteins, lipoproteins and peripherally attached soluble proteins. Our knowledge of the biogenesis of inner membrane proteins is rapidly increasing. This is in particular true for the early steps of biogenesis — protein targeting to and insertion into the membrane. However, our knowledge of inner membrane protein folding and quality control is still fragmentary. Furthering our knowledge in these areas will bring us closer to understand the biogenesis of individual inner membrane proteins in the context of the biogenesis of the inner membrane proteome of Escherichia coli as a whole.

The flotation of low-rank coal suffers poor efficiency with hydrocarbon oils unless it is at a high dose. A representative non-polar oil, diesel oil (DO), was used as a collector to float a long-frame coal. The feasibility of oxidized paraffin soap (OPS) was explored to improve flotation performance. Experimental measurements (polarized optical microscopy, zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact-angle analysis) were used to explore the influence of OPS in low-rank-coal flotation. Poor flotation performances of coal samples were received using OPS or DO as collectors at an economical dose. The flotation efficiency of coal samples was improved considerably upon addition of OPS plus DO. OPS reduced the surface tension of aqueous solutions and promoted dispersion of DO in suspensions. Addition of OPS plus DO reduced the absolute value of the zeta potential on coal particles. Moreover, OPS improved DO adsorption on low-rank coal particles, and the hydrophobicity of low-rank coal was improved visibly. OPS reduced the contact angles of coal–bubble and coal–DO in aqueous solution, which enhanced the adhesion probability of particles to bubbles. This study suggests that OPS is an effective surfactant for improving the floatability of low-rank coal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acoal 3acontact angle 3adiesel fuel 3ahydrophobicity 3alight microscopy 3aoils 3aoxidation 3apollution 3aprobability 3asoaps 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3azeta potential 3aChina1 aGao, Lihui1 aWang, Junchao1 aRong, Guoqiang1 aCao, Yijun0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 17, v. 10, no. 26 p.15098-15106dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra02361b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245009100209300001600300506007600316520070100392592002801093506003701121650002201158650002201180650002401202650001301226650002301239650001801262650001001280650001201290650001501302650002701317650001301344650001401357650001001371700001801381700002001399700002201419700002101441700002001462700002101482773012501503856007901628961001301707852000901720655001201729IND60302097420221207142038.0150704e20130816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030209742DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12390222doi7 aPMC47489512pmcid7 a238112222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaintenac, Cyrille10aIdentification of Wheat Gene Sr35 That Confers Resistance to Ug99 Stem Rust Race Group  ap. 783-786.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aResistance May Not Be Futile Recently, Ug99, a particularly devastating strain of wheat stem rust fungus, has emerged, which could potentially threaten food security.

Here, we evaluated the effects of flurbiprofen, an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent, on the increased thermal responses observed in REM sleep deprived rats.Forty female rats were divided into four groups following 96-hour REM sleep deprivation: intraperitoneal injections of placebo, and flurbiprofen 5mg/kg, 15mg/kg and 40mg/kg were made in CONT (n=10), FBP5, FBP15 and FBP40 groups respectively. Pain threshold measurements were performed three times at baseline (0.hour), at the end of REM sleep deprivation (96.hour) and at 1h after injections (97.hour) by hot plate and tail-flick tests.REM sleep deprivation induced a significant decrease in pain thresholds of all rats (hotplate: 0.hour vs 96.hour, 9.75±2.85 vs 5.10±2.02, p<0.001; tail flick: 0.hour vs 96.hour, 11.92±4.62 vs 7.92±5.15, p<0.001). Flurbiprofen in 15mg/kg and 40mg/kg doses significantly improved pain tolerance measured by tail flick test (tail flick in FBP15 and FBP40 groups: 96.hour vs 97.hour, 7.01±4.97 vs 8.34±3.61 and 5.06±1.57 vs 7.04±2.49, p<0.05 for both).96h of REM sleep deprivation resulted in reduced pain thresholds in both hot plate and tail flick tests. Flurbiprofen was used for the first time in a rat model of REM sleep deprivation, and it provided anti-nociceptive effects in 15mg/kg and 40mg/kg doses. Flurbiprofen may have the potential for treatment of painful syndromes accompanying insomnia or sleep loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aeyes 3afemales 3apain 3aplacebos 3arats 3asleep deprivation 3asomatosensory disorders 3atail 3atail flick test 0aSleep loss 0aFlurbiprofen 0aAnti-nociceptive 0aPain threshold 0aREM deprivation1 aUral, Keremcan1 aÖztürk, Gülnur1 aÖztürk, Levent0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2014 Apr. 10, v. 128 p.155-158dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245009200175300001800267520095200285592002801237650002101265650001301286650002001299650001001319650001001329650001101339650001701350650002301367650001101390650001701401650001001418700002301428700002001451700002101471773011701492856008201609990002301691852000901714655001201723IND60090895820221118010224.0141102e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009089582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohd-Pahmi, Siti Hajar10aSynthesis, modelling and kinetic assays of potent inhibitors of purple acid phosphatase  ap. 3092-3094.  aPurple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are binuclear metallohydrolases that have been isolated from various mammals, plants, fungi and bacteria. In mammals PAP activity is associated with bone resorption and can lead to bone metabolic disorders such as osteoporosis; thus human PAP is an attractive target to develop anti-osteoporotic drugs. Based on a previous lead compound and rational drug design, acyl derivatives of α-aminonaphthylmethylphosphonic acid were synthesised and tested as PAP inhibitors. Kinetic analysis showed that they are good PAP inhibitors whose potencies improve with increasing acyl chain length. Maximum potency is reached when the number of carbons in the acyl chain is between 12 and 14. The most potent inhibitor of red kidney bean PAP is the dodecyl-derivative with Kᵢc=5μM, while the most potent pig PAP inhibitor is the tetradecyl-derivative with Kᵢc=8μM, the most potent inhibitor of a mammalian PAP yet reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3abacteria 3abone resorption 3adrugs 3afungi 3ahumans 3akidney beans 3ametabolic diseases 3amodels 3aosteoporosis 3aswine1 aHussein, Waleed M.1 aSchenk, Gerhard1 aMcGeary, Ross P.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2011 May 15, v. 21, no. 10 p.3092-3094dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.03.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013500166500001900301520131700320592002801637650001601665650001601681650001001697650001401707650002001721650001101741650001101752650001601763650001901779650002401798650001101822650001901833653001001852653001201862653001401874653001301888653001801901653002401919700002101943700001901964700001801983773010902001856008602110852000902196655001202205IND60737497920221119005836.0210610e20210825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073749792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1102232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Wei14aThe role of organ - and daylength - specific gene expression in bulb development and resource management in onion (ALLIUM CEPA L.)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOnion development is a complex process with each developmental event depending on the adequate supply of resources. Also, these resource components themselves are crucial nutrients in onion when consumed as food. For higher yield and better quality in onion production, it is essential to not only have a high level of photosynthesis but also effective transportation of photosynthetic products. A comprehensive set of spatial and developmental time-course experiments detailed the gene expression in onion leaf and bulb tissues during the development of a long-day onion cultivar under long-day and short-day conditions. Candidates included well characterised functional clock genes in Arabidopsis flowering pathway, as well as some novel sequences differentially expressed in bulb tissues. Both AcFT1 and AcFT4 showed significant increasing expression level during plant development, with AcFT1 being expressed in long-days during bulb formation and AcFT4 in short-days where bulbs are not formed. The data further support the role of AcFT1 as a promoter and AcFT4 as inhibitor in onion bulb formation. A number of genes associated with onion carbohydrate metabolism, sulphur metabolism and bulb development were identified as having different tissue-specific expression and provide targets for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aArabidopsis 3abulbs 3acultivars 3agene expression 3aleaves 3aonions 3aphotoperiod 3aphotosynthesis 3aresource management 3asulfur 3atransportation 0aOnion 0aBulbing 0aDaylength 0aFT genes 0aSugar sensing 0aResource allocation1 aHarun-Ar-Rashid,1 aStark, Richard1 aThomas, Brian0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Aug. 25, v. 286 p.110223-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1102233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008300166300001500249520109400264592002801358650001001386650002001396650001201416650001301428650001201441650001501453650000901468650001401477650001301491650001301504653002001517653002301537653002701560653001701587653002401604653001901628700001801647700001901665700001601684700001801700700001701718700001801735700002101753700001501774700001401789773012701803856008401930852000902014655001202023IND60553677420221119210916.0180831e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055367742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobakova, E.10aNew bio-hybrid materials for bioremoval of crude oil spills from marine waters  ap. 99-107.  aWe report, for the first time, on the successful use of the new type of bio-hybrid materials (BHM) on the basis of polymeric nonwoven material made from methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile (MA) which is an efficient oil-absorbent. The biomass and biomass-derived cell-structured support materials of duckweed plants (Wolffia arrhiza, Lemna minuscula) were incorporated into polymeric fibers and association of oil-degrading bacteria was immobilized. The bacteria immobilized on BHM with duckweeds structures (BHM + AD) degraded 93–97% of n-alkanes in artificial sea water after 25 days of incubation and removed the adsorbed oil from the polymer fibers almost completely whereas the oil-degrading efficiency of the bacteria immobilized on the additive-free MA was ca. twice lower. It is suggested that, in oligotrophic sea water, the plant-derived structures might furnish biogenic elements for the immobilized microorganisms increasing their oil degrading activity. The possibilities of the use of the new type of BHM for bioremoval of crude oil spills from marine waters are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLemna 3aWolffia arrhiza 3aalkanes 3abacteria 3abiomass 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apolymers 3aseawater 0aWater treatment 0aOil biodegradation 0aOil-degrading bacteria 0aOil sorbents 0aPolymeric materials 0aImmobilization1 aVasilieva, S.1 aKashcheeva, P.1 aIvanova, E.1 aDolnikova, G.1 aChekanov, K.1 aIdiatulov, R.1 aKirpichnikov, M.1 aBuznik, V.1 aDedov, A.0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2016 Mar., v. 108 p.99-107dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245016800207300001600375520136500391592002801756650002501784650002201809650002501831650002101856650002401877650002001901650001901921650002201940650001501962650001501977650001401992650001002006650001402016650001102030650002602041650002102067650001602088650002902104650001302133653001902146653002202165653004002187653002002227653002202247653001502269653000702284653000802291653000802299653000802307653000802315653000902323653001002332653000802342700002602350700001802376700002002394700001802414773012802432856008402560852000902644655001202653IND60553677620221119210959.0180831e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055367762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonda, Sándor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9776-024910aEfficient biotransformation of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs by endophytic and epiphytic fungi from dried leaves of a medicinal plant, Plantago lanceolata L.  ap. 115-121.  aIn the current study, decomposition of diclofenac, diflunisal, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid and piroxicam was tested using nine identified strains of endophytic and epiphytic fungi (from Ascomycota) adapted to natural products resembling the pharmaceuticals. The strains were isolated from a medicinal plant, Plantago lanceolata leaves. Metabolites were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS³).Eighteen of the 45 combinations resulted in significant decrease of the concentration of the NSAIDs in model solutions. The most active strains were Aspergillus nidulans and Bipolaris tetramera, while Epicoccum nigrum and Aspergillus niger showed somewhat less potency. Piroxicam and diclofenac were most resistant to biotransformation, while ibuprofen and mefenamic acid were efficiently metabolized by most strains. Ten metabolites could be tentatively identified, including hydroxy-metabolites of all tested NSAIDs, and a dihydroxy-metabolite of piroxicam. This biotransformation is likely to modify the toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of these pharmaceuticals.The results highlight the applicability of polyphenol-rich dried medicinal plant materials as an excellent source of fungi with high biotransforming potential. The results also suggest more in-depth testing of these fungi for biodegradation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aAspergillus niger 3aCurvularia spicifera 3aEpicoccum nigrum 3aPlantago lanceolata 3abioaccumulation 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3adiclofenac 3aendophytes 3aepiphytes 3afungi 3aibuprofen 3aleaves 3aliquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolites 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 0aBiodegradation 0aBiotransformation 0aNon-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs 0aEpiphytic fungi 0aPhylloplane fungi 0aEndophytes 0aCE 0aDIC 0aDIF 0aIBU 0aMEF 0aMEKC 0aNSAID 0aPIR1 aKiss-Szikszai, Attila1 aSzűcs, Zsolt1 aBalla, Borbála1 aVasas, Gábor0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2016 Mar., v. 108 p.115-121dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245013400162300001600296520103500312592002801347650001301375650001501388650001801403650002801421650001801449650001101467650002001478650001301498650001101511650002301522650001601545650001001561650001001571650001701581650002401598650001701622653002201639653001201661653001001673700002101683700002501704700002501729700002501754700002301779700002801802773011401830856007101944852000902015655001202024IND60629864720221118133757.0190202s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062986472DNAL7 a10.1071/AN177982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez, C.

A total of 105 non-castrated male lambs were randomly assigned to one of three treatments (5 replicates per treatment): Control (CON, similar to commercial concentrates), Camelina (CAM, where camelina meal replaced 50% of the crude protein from the soybean meal in the CON concentrate), and Fibrous (FIB, concentrate without cereals and soybean meal, with camelina meal in addition to several by-products, and 20% less energy). The CAM treatment performed as well as the CON one. The FIB treatment increased feed conversion rate and tended to improve the redness and the oxidative stability. The CAM and FIB were economically more favourable. We found that a concentrate for feedlot lambs based on alternative ingredients, including several by-products, could be a feasible alternative to typical cereal-soybean meal-based concentrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelina 3abyproducts 3acamelina meal 3acarcass characteristics 3acrude protein 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3afeedlots 3agrains 3agrowth performance 3aingredients 3alambs 3amales 3ameat quality 3aoxidative stability 3asoybean meal 0aalternative feeds 0afeedlot 0asheep1 aBlanco, F.

A prerequisite for the implementation of this approach into compliance monitoring regulations is its robustness and reproducibility of obtained results. In the framework of regular compliance monitoring of a Scottish salmon farm, we therefore collected sediment samples along a transect from the salmon cages to reference sites in duplicates (biological replicates). Aliquots of both biological replicate samples were then processed by two different laboratories using independently the same eDNA metabarcoding protocol (technical replicates). Measures of alpha diversity and beta diversity, as well as taxonomic profiles of benthic bacterial communities were highly congruent among technical replicates, which even showed less variations then the biological replicates that were processed within each laboratory. Both technical replicate datasets identified the same bacterial indicator taxon groups and ASVs that are characteristic for the environmental quality (EQ) categories to which each of the samples was assigned based on traditional macroinvertebrate biomonitoring of the same samples. In a supervised machine learning (SML) approach, we could classify all individual samples from one technical replicate dataset into the correct EQ category using all samples of the other technical replicate dataset as a training dataset for the SML algorithm. We conclude that eDNA metabarcoding is sufficiently robust that different laboratories come to the same conclusions regarding officially regulated action criteria for environmental impact assessments in salmon aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aalgorithms 3acompliance 3adata collection 3aenvironmental DNA 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aenvironmental quality 3afish farms 3aindicator species 3amacroinvertebrates 3asalmon 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 0aBenthic bacterial communities 0aeDNA metabarcoding 0aEnvironmental compliance monitoring 0aInfaunal Quality Index 0aMacroinvertebrates 0aSalmon aquaculture1 aBalliet, Heinrich1 aFrühe, Larissa1 aDäumer, Martin1 aThielen, Alexander1 aGallie, Sheena1 aBerrill, Iain1 aStoeck, Thorsten1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5180-56590 tEcological indicators.g2021 Feb., v. 121 p.107049-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1070493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01624naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007600154300002000230520056700250592002800817650002300845650002300868650001600891650002200907700001800929700001400947700002200961700002100983700001801004700001401022700001901036773013601055856007401191852000901265655001201274IND60677966120221120160736.0191213e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067796612DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc07517h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tun10aHierarchy of interfacial passivation in inverted perovskite solar cells  ap. 14996-14999.  aThe crucial hierarchy of the interfacial passivation at different positions of perovskite solar cells together with the corresponding mechanism has been studied despite the selection of passivation mediums in this work.

Hence unbiased use of males and females in animal studies and specific reporting of animal details are increasingly required by funding bodies and scientific journals worldwide. An analysis to determine how males and females are used in animal studies involving the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) was undertaken as part of a process to review and further support best practice. In the study 178 publications that contain animal studies and include CSIRO researchers published between January 2014 and December 2016 were analysed for the sex of animals used. The overall sex distribution was males only 26.4% (47/178), females only 15.7% (28/178), males and females 18.0% (32/178) and sex of animals unspecified 39.9% (71/178). Reasons for this distribution include species biology, farming practices and commercial relevance. Although including sex as an experimental variable provides the most information, using both sexes in an animal study requires careful consideration and planning. Furthermore, there are valid biological and experimental reasons why sex distribution in a study may not be balanced. Biological reasons include cases where the severity of disease in a given model differs between males and females, superior husbandry or production traits in one sex and hermaphroditic species that change sex with age. Examples where experiments can only be undertaken in one sex of animal include animal models of female breast cancer, female reproductive traits, male fertility studies and post-castration welfare outcomes. Where there is no biological or experimental reason for using a single sex of animal, future studies should obtain an estimate of sex effect either from the literature or with a pilot study, and experiments should be planned and reported accordingly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abiomedical research 3abreast neoplasms 3afarming systems 3afemales 3afunding 3ahermaphroditism 3alaboratory animals 3amale fertility 3amales 3aplanning 3areproductive traits 0abias 0afemale 0amale 0areproducibility0 tAnimal production science.g2019, v. 59, no. 3 p.401-407dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN180323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009400173300001600267520134300283592002801626650001201654650001301666650002601679650001901705650001201724650001201736650001501748650001001763650001301773650001001786650001501796650001401811650002201825650003301847650002201880650001501902650000901917651001201926653001801938653002701956653002601983653001302009653001202022653001702034700002302051700002302074700002002097700002402117773012802141856008402269852000902353655001202362IND60553677820221119210905.0180831e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055367782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikolouli, Katerina10aProkaryotic diversity in biodeteriorated wood coming from the Bükkábrány fossil forest  ap. 181-190.  aThe oldest standing paleo-forest in the world is located at Bükkábrány in Hungary. Some 7 million years ago a sudden and rapid deposition of sands from a prograding delta resulted in rise of the level of Lake Pannon that covered the landscape. The flood created an anoxic burial environment which preserved unmineralised tree trunks to the present day. Examination of wood sample coming from these trunks using light and scanning electron microscopy revealed extended wood biodeterioration. Culture-independent molecular methods were used to study prokaryotic diversity present in biodeteriorated wood. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S gene clone libraries and 454 pyrosequencing analysis revealed the presence of prokaryotes, including methylotrophic bacteria and bacteria that could be members of the indigenous microbiota found inside the trunk. The rest of identified bacteria are commonly isolated from freshwater habitats possibly reflecting the shift of bacterial biota that occurred in the wood and its close environment after the rise of Lake Pannon. Moreover Archaea were detected in biodeteriorated wood for the first time. The detection of Archaea raises for the first time the question of their possible implication in wood biodeterioration as well as their possible interactions with bacterial communities that colonize wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3aforests 3afossils 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ahabitats 3alakes 3alandscapes 3aphylogeny 3aprokaryotic cells 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asequence analysis 3atree trunk 3awood 3aHungary 0aBükkábrány 0aPaleontological forest 0aWood biodeterioration 0aBacteria 0aArchaea 0aMetagenomics1 aPournou, Anastasia1 aMcConnachie, Glenn1 aTsiamis, George1 aMossialos, Dimitris0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2016 Mar., v. 108 p.181-190dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012200169300002000291520153000311592002801841596005101869650001801920650002201938650001301960650002101973650001901994650001102013650002402024650001902048650001502067650001502082650002602097650001502123700001902138700002202157700001802179700002402197700002302221700002702244700001802271700002602289773016902315856008302484852000902567655001202576IND60655166420221120135122.0191213e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065516642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05599-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRózsa, Georgina10aTransformation of atrazine by photolysis and radiolysis: kinetic parameters, intermediates and economic consideration  ap. 23268-23278.  aFour techniques, UV₂₅₄ ₙₘ photolysis, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV₁₇₂ ₙₘ) photolysis, combined UV₂₅₄ ₙₘ/VUV₁₈₅ ₙₘ photolysis and gamma (γ) radiolysis were used to induce the transformation of atrazine in aqueous solution. The effects of dissolved oxygen (atrazine concentration 1 × 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹ and 4.6 × 10⁻⁷ mol L⁻¹) and matrix (high purity water/purified wastewater, atrazine concentration 4.6 × 10⁻⁷ mol L⁻¹) and the electric energy requirements were investigated. The calculation of the energy input in cases of the photolyses was based on the lamp’s power. In radiolysis, the absorbed dose (J kg⁻¹) was the basis. In UV photolysis, atrazine transforms to atrazine-2-hydroxy; this product practically does not degrade during UV photolysis; due to this reason, the mineralisation is very slow. This and some other products of atrazine decomposition degrade only in radical reactions. Dissolved oxygen usually slightly enhances the degradation rate. At 10⁻⁷ mol L⁻¹ concentration level, the matrix, high purity water/purified wastewater, has not much influence on the degradation rates in UV photolysis and radiolysis. In the VUV and UV/VUV systems, considerable matrix effects were observed. Comparing the electric energy requirements of the four degradation processes, radiolysis was found to be the economically most feasible method, requiring 1–2 orders of magnitude less electric energy than UV/VUV, VUV and UV photolysis.  aPublisher supplied data  a151955cDeutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst 3aabsorbed dose 3aaqueous solutions 3aatrazine 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3amineralization 3aphotolysis 3aradiolysis 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater1 aFazekas, Ákos1 aNáfrádi, Máté1 aAlapi, Tünde1 aSchrantz, Krisztina1 aTakács, Erzsébet1 aWojnárovits, László1 aFath, Andreas1 aOppenländer, Thomas,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Aug., v. 26, no. 23 p.23268-23278dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05599-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014400167500001900311520177600330592002802106650001802134650002502152650001402177650001402191650001702205650001002222650001302232650000902245650001302254650001502267653001602282653001202298653002202310653001002332653000902342653000802351653001402359653001002373700002102383700005902404700001702463700002302480700001602503700001902519773011002538856008602648852000902734655001202743IND60737498420221119010124.0210615e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073749842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1102352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, Jyoti10aInheritance and stability studies of multi–flowering trait in vegetable pea (Pisum sativum L.), and its contribution in yield improvement  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMulti–flowering (MF) is considered a rare trait in vegetable pea (Pisum sativum L.), and detailed studies about its inheritance in different background or stability across season and location is not yet thoroughly investigated. In this study, nine cross combinations were studied, involving five parental genotypes forming 01 to 05 flowers per peduncle (FPP). The F₂ progenies of two cross combinations viz., [VRP–386 (2FPP) × VRP–500 (3FPP)] and [VRP–386 (2FPP) × VRPM–501 (3FPP)] showed 13:3 (2FPP:MF) segregation or inhibitory gene action regulating the MF trait. Whereas, in other three cross combinations viz., [VRPSel–17(1FPP) × VRPM–501(3FPP)], [VRPSel–17(1FPP) × VRPM–901–5(5FPP)] and [VRP–500(3FPP) × VRPSel–17(1FPP)], the F₂ plants segregated in 12:3:1 (2FPP:1FPP:MF) ratio, showing presence of dominant epistasis. Further, the frequency of 3FPP varied from 3.89% to 19.76% in different parental genotypes. When studied together, the inheritance of flower colour and number of FPP showed an independent assortment in F₂ generation. The stability analysis was performed to identify the most stable MF genotype and AMMI analysis of variance for pod yield showed significant environment, genotype, and G × E interactions (p = 0.0001). The higher Principal Component (PC1 and PC2) scores of the MF genotype VRPM–901–5 (G8) showed its better yield potential (mean yield 176.22 q/ha) and stability. Further, the MF genotype VRPM–901–5 (G8) yielded nearly 3-times and 1.5-times more than the 1FPP [VRPSel–17 (G1)] and the 2FPP cultivars [PC-531 (G2) and VL-8 (G3)], respectively. Thus, these MF genotypes are the potential parents to increase the number of FPP, and also to boost the yield of vegetable pea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aanalysis of variance 3acultivars 3aepistasis 3aflower color 3agenes 3agenotype 3apeas 3apeduncle 3avegetables 0aInheritance 0aLinkage 0aMulti–flowering 0aPisum 0aAMMI 0aGGE 0aStability 0aYield1 aDubey, Rakesh K.1 aMishra, Gyan P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7023-26381 aSagar, Vidya1 aVerma, Ravindra K.1 aSingh, P.M.1 aSingh, Jagdish0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 287 p.110235-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1102353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245012300205520212000328592002802448650002002476650001902496650001502515650004302530650001402573650001502587651001002602653002702612653001502639653001002654653001602664653001002680653001902690700005202709773010102761856008602862852000902948655001202957IND60716441120221119132837.0210708e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071644112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1070552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Linli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7709-754X10aEvaluation and comparison of growing season metrics in arid and semi-arid areas of northern China under climate change  aThe differences of three key growing season metrics, namely, the start of growing season (SOS), the end of growing season (EOS) and the length of growing season (LOS), derived from ground observations, satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and air temperature were compared, and the spatial distribution and temporal trend of NDVI-based growing season metrics were analyzed in the arid and semi-arid areas of northern China. The results show that the growing season metrics obtained by three methods were quite different. The temperature-based SOS dates were earlier than those observed at the four phenological sites, while the NDVI-based SOS dates were the latest. The EOS (LOS) derived from NDVI and temperature were later (longer) than the observed values. At 240 meteorological stations, temperature-based SOS and EOS dates were generally earlier than the NDVI-based results, leading to longer temperature-based LOS than that derived from NDVI. From 1982 to 2015, the NDVI-based SOS was advanced by 2.3 days per decade, and the NDVI-based EOS was delayed by 9.5 days per decade, causing a prolonged LOS of 11.8 days per decade. Earlier SOS, later EOS and prolonged LOS were significantly appeared at 44.3%, 40.6% and 52.6% of the vegetated area respectively. The significant advanced SOS was concentrated in the central Inner Mongolia, northern Hebei, northern Shanxi and northwestern Xinjiang, while the significant delayed EOS was mainly distributed in the majority of western and northern Xinjiang and northern Inner Mongolia, resulting in the significant prolonged LOS in most of the study area. Each method has its distinct advantages and disadvantages. It is suggested to use high spatial and temporal resolution satellite images and appropriate methods to establish phenological models for different land cover types and to take into account the powerful vegetation indices and key climatic factors such as daytime temperature and precipitation and their interactions, which are of great significance for large-scale and accurate phenological monitoring and assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3aland cover 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3asatellites 3aChina 0aGrowing season metrics 0aComparison 0aANOVA 0aTemperature 0aTrend 0aNorthern China1 aShi, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1354-29870 tEcological indicators.g2021 Feb., v. 121 p.107055-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1070553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013800169500001400307520166900321592002801990650003002018650001502048650001902063650002202082650001802104650001002122650002202132650001202154650002402166653001902190653002202209653001202231653003302243653002502276700001502301700001802316700002102334773011602355856008702471852000902558655001202567IND60717332820221118070115.0201216e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071733282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1136122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiang10aThermodynamic analysis and multi-objective optimization of a transcritical CO2 waste heat recovery system for cruise ship application  aNAL-light  aTo develop the energy-efficient and flexible waste heat recovery process for cruise ship application, a novel combined system with transcritical CO₂ Rankine cycle and ejector refrigeration cycle (ETCRC) is presented. The proposed system driven by main engine exhaust gas can be selectively operated in a specific mode with adjustable capacities of heating, cooling and power to satisfy shipboard demands. The simulation model is developed for performance analysis from the thermodynamic aspect. Moreover, a typical transcritical CO₂ Rankine cycle coupled with valve-expansion refrigeration process (VTRCR) and a conventional regenerative organic Rankine cycle (RORC) using R123 are considered as reference systems. Parametric investigation and performance comparison between the present system and each considered reference system in different operation modes are respectively conducted. Furthermore, based on artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and fast-non-dominated sorting technique, multi-objective optimization for the proposed system is performed to maximize useful energy productions. According to the results, the proposed combined cycle is found to be more efficient than the reference cycle in each of the specified operation mode. Under the optimal conditions, the maximum cooling effect and net power of the ETCRC in Mode-S operation are 863.3 kW and 202.9 kW, respectively. And the maximum high-temperature heating output and net power of the ETCRC for Mode-SAW operation are 960.5 kW and 272.7 kW, respectively. The performance characteristics of the proposed cycle theoretically demonstrate its advantages for application in cruise ships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aalgorithms 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy efficiency 3arefrigeration 3aships 3asimulation models 3asorting 3awaste heat recovery 0aCombined cycle 0aTranscritical CO2 0aEjector 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aMarine diesel engine1 aLuo, Zewei1 aZhao, Yongjie1 aPavel, Suniaikin0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 227 p.113612-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1136123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01759naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010600173300001600279520080500295592002801100650001301128650001001141650001901151650002501170651002101195651001001216700002001226773012101246856008101367852000901448655001201457IND60569680220221120061431.0170608e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056968022DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-016-0560-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaj, K.

The present study used the potential of Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) high resolution LISS IV multispectral data to generate the latest inventory of glacial lakes in Uttarakhand Himalaya. A combination of five different types and a total of the 362 glacial lakes were identified in Uttarakhand Himalaya. The historical Corona and Hexagon data were analysed for the growth of selected glacial lakes. Pro-glacial/moraine-dammed lakes are growing consequent to the recession of the glaciers. The inventory shows eight glacial lakes are critical considering the outburst potential. This shows the glacial lakes are dynamics in nature and vary, dimension and type in time and space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglaciers 3alakes 3aremote sensing 3atime series analysis 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aKumar, K.

In this regard, this paper investigates the recycling of carbon dioxide from gas-fired power plant emissions into synthetic natural gas based on a novel power-to-gas process with the aim of chemical energy storage and emission reduction. The hybrid power-to-gas process proposed in this paper integrates the power generated from the gas plant and renewable energies. To make a precise evaluation of system performance, the referenced system is analyzed from technical, economic, and environmental points of view. The process is optimized through the reaction operation conditions and the energy utilization of the process. The results demonstrate that the power-to-gas process achieves a reaction synthetic natural gas production yield of over 97% at the optimal operation conditions. Regarding energy and environmental outlook, the power plant provides 15.4% of the power-to-gas total energy consumption, with the remaining 84.6% supplied from renewable energy resources. From the synthetic natural gas produced, the power-to-gas process provides total annual energy storage of 2.9 × 10⁷ GJ and recycles 1.6 Mton of carbon dioxide for the power plant flues, resulting in a reduction of the plant emissions by around 66%. According to the economic data, with the consideration of the selling price of oxygen, the cost of the synthetic natural gas produced results in 1738 $/ton. The obtained results indicate that the system designed can reduce production costs due to hybrid electricity and offers two unique attributes: energy storage capability and drastic reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy conversion 3ahybrids 3amarket prices 3anatural gas 3aoxygen 3apaper 3apower plants 3aproduction costs 3araw materials 3arecycling 3arenewable energy sources 3astorage 0aCO2 utilization 0aPower-to-gas 0aProcess design 0aReaction kinetics 0aCO2 methanation 0aSNG1 aSoltani, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0878-62741 aHosseinpour, M.1 aNathwani, Jatin0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 227 p.113613-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1136133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008900165300001800254520048400272592002800756650001600784650002000800650001400820650002000834650000900854650001400863700002400877700001900901700002200920700002200942700001700964700001900981700002001000700001801020700002001038700002001058700001501078700001901093700001601112700001701128700001901145700002001164700002201184700002201206700002201228700001801250700002201268773011701290856008201407990002301489852000901512655001201521IND60090896420221118010515.0141102e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009089642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.03.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuay, Daniel10aSynthesis and SAR of pyrimidine-based, non-nucleotide P2Y₁₄ receptor antagonists  ap. 2832-2835.  aA weak antagonist of the pyrimidinergic receptor P2Y₁₄ containing a dihydropyridopyrimidine core was identified through high-throughput screening.

Current mapping approaches however may present coarse spatial resolutions, and often fail to consider how UES flows serve resident demand at the appropriate micro-scale. In addition, prohibitive costs involved in collecting primary data to validate UES model parameters to local conditions may enforce the use of proxy methods, thereby inferring ambiguity in parameterisation and uncertainty in mapping outputs. This study examines both issues through the implementation of a high-spatial resolution approach to map multiple urban regulating ecosystem service (temperature regulation, stormwater absorption, and carbon storage) deprivation in Manchester, UK. Poorly performing UES areas are defined as the lowest 10% combined ecosystem service indicator values (‘coldspots’) at 100m grid resolution. Coldspots are compared to population demand levels, disaggregated from weighted population estimates, indicating neighbourhoods deprived of UES. Ambiguity in proxy method implementation is examined using combinations of UES parameter settings (n = 16) within various demand measures (n = 3) to measure changes in relationships between UES, and variation in final map outputs across the study area. Uncertainty is therefore quantified as an interactive process, whereby input parameter ambiguity affects local uncertainty in map outputs, due to varying landcover composition. As explicit sensitivity analysis in current UES mapping studies is limited, the study demonstrates how ambiguity in method parameterisation may impact UES mapping exercises. Complex interactions governing spatial variance in map uncertainty may therefore be addressed through identification of consistent areas of interest (e.g. hotspots, coldspots) by contrasting outputs realised from different parameterisations. As such, the study demonstrates the mapping approach as a transferable city-wide visualisation tool, using accessible data and methods, to investigate regulating UES deprivation at practical scales required to retrofit existing urban infrastructure with green-blue infrastructure investment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystem services 3ainfrastructure 3aland cover 3astormwater 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aurban areas 3avariance 0aUES 0aUGBI 0aSCS-CN 0aCN 0aRegulating ecosystem services 0aMapping 0aDeprivation 0aUrban 0aEnvironmental risk 0aUncertainty analysis1 aSmith, Graham R.1 aMarsden, Stuart J.1 aCavan, Gina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8429-870X0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Feb., v. 121 p.107058-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1070583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245019900169520131900368592002801687650001001715650001701725650002401742650001201766650001501778650002201793650000901815650002001824650002501844650001501869653001401884653002301898653002601921653002901947653003701976700002502013700002102038700002102059700002102080700002902101700002402130773011402154856008602268852000902354655001202363IND60770787720221117155826.0220517e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077078772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1286882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZdarta, Jakub10aBioremoval of estrogens by laccase immobilized onto polyacrylonitrile/polyethersulfone material: Effect of inhibitors and mediators, process characterization and catalytic pathways determination  aThe presence of micropollutants in water, wastewater and soil are a global problem due to their persistent effect on ecosystems and human health. Although there are many methods of removal of environmental pollutants, they are often ineffective for degradation of pharmaceuticals, including estrogens. In presented work we proposed fabrication of electrospun material from polyacrylonitrile/polyethersulfone (PAN/PES) as a support for laccase immobilization by covalent binding. Oxidoreductase was attached to the electrospun fibers using polydopamine as a linker and produced system was used for degradation of two estrogens: 17β-estradiol (E2) and 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2). It was shown that 92% of E2 and 100% of EE2 were degraded after 24 h of the process. Moreover, the effect of surfactants, metal ions and mediators on conversion efficiencies of estrogens was investigated and it was confirmed that immobilized enzyme possessed higher resistance to inhibitory agents as well as thermal and storage stability, compared to its native form. Finally, estrogenic activities of E2 and EE2 solutions decreased around 99% and 87%, respectively, after enzymatic conversion, that corresponds to significant reduction of the total organic carbon and formation of low-toxic final products of estrogens degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3ahuman health 3aimmobilized enzymes 3alaccase 3apollutants 3apolyacrylonitrile 3asoil 3astorage quality 3atotal organic carbon 3awastewater 0aEstrogens 0aElectrospun fibers 0aEnzyme immobilization 0aBioconversion efficiency 0aProducts of enzymatic conversion1 aJankowska, Katarzyna1 aStrybel, Urszula1 aMarczak, Łukasz1 aNguyen, Luong N.1 aOleskowicz-Popiel, Piotr1 aJesionowski, Teofil0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 June 15, v. 432 p.128688-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1286883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245004300169300001500212500001100227520163900238592002801877650001101905650002001916650001401936650002201950650001301972650001601985650002202001650002202023650001302045650001702058650001202075650001702087650001302104650001402117650001802131773012802149856008302277852000902360655001202369IND60646477820221121033354.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064647782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-019-03043-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Seon-Cheol10aNeurogenesis and antidepressant action  ap. 95-106.  aReview  aA theoretical framework is proposed to gain insight into the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite being a relatively weak argument, the neurogenesis theory is suggested to compensate for the limitations of the monoamine theory. In the adult hippocampus, neurogenesis is functionally related to regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, inflammatory processes, cognitive functions and other aspects that contribute to etiological factors that lead to MDD and promote recovery from MDD. Despite a lack of investigation into neurogenesis and antidepressant action, it is proposed that chronic administration of antidepressant(s) can induce the recruitment and integration of newborn neurons into the dentate gyrus and, ultimately, lead to the remission of MDD. The extant body of literature indicates that the suppression of neurogenesis per se may be associated with an impaired response to antidepressant treatment rather than with the induction of depressive-like behaviors. Moreover, recent studies have shown that increasing the survival rate and incorporation of new neurons can alleviate depressive-like behaviors and promote stress resilience. According to the neurogenic reserve hypothesis, hippocampal neurogenesis supports specific cortical functions, including executive functions, pattern separation and contextual information processing, control over the HPA axis and behavioral coping mechanisms in response to stressful situations. Therefore, hippocampal neurogenesis may be a promising biological indicator of stress resilience and antidepressant response in patients with MDD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantidepressants 3acognition 3acoping strategies 3aetiology 3ahippocampus 3aindicator species 3amental depression 3aneonates 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aremission 3asurvival rate0 tCell and tissue research.g2019 July, v. 377, no. 1 p.95-106dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-019-03043-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009000172300001600262520158200278592002801860650002201888650001601910650001301926650002601939650001901965650001301984650001001997650001102007650000902018650001302027650001302040650001602053650001302069653002302082653001202105653002102117653001302138653001602151653000802167653000902175700001902184700002402203700002002227700002602247700003002273773009102303856008502394852000902479655001202488IND60551208520221119195510.0161018e20140410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055120852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasehi, Mohammad10aSwimming improves the emotional memory deficit by scopolamine via mu opioid receptors  ap. 237-246.  aThe aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of swimming exercise on elevated plus-maze (EPM)-associated memory deficit induced by intra-CA1 injection of scopolamine (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist used to model Alzheimer's disease in rodents) in male mice. In addition, involvement of the mu opioid receptors in this phenomenon was investigated.Bilateral guide cannulae were implanted to allow intra-CA1 microinjections.Data showed that mice with 10 and 20days of swimming, only acquired the emotional memory, while 30days of swimming exercise improved it. On the other hand, pretest intra-CA1 injection of scopolamine at the doses of 2 and 3 but not 1μg/mouse reduced the emotional memory. Our results demonstrated that 20days of swimming by itself and without any drug injection restored the emotional memory deficit induced by intra-CA1 injection of scopolamine, only at the dose of 2 but not 3μg/mouse. Moreover, once daily injection of the subthreshold doses of morphine (2.5 and 5mg/kg, i.p.) during the last 7days of the 20day-swimming intervention, improved the emotional memory deficit induced by scopolamine (3μg/mouse) and this effect could be blocked by the subthreshold doses of naloxone (0.2 and 0.4mg/kg). It was noted that all previous interventions did not alter the anxiety-like behaviors.Swimming improved the emotional memory by itself and restored the emotional memory deficit induced by the intra-CA1 injection of scopolamine. Mu opioid receptor-dependent mechanism(s) is(are) suggested to play a role in this phenomenon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aantagonists 3acannulas 3acholinergic receptors 3adrug injection 3aexercise 3amales 3amemory 3amice 3amorphine 3analoxone 3ascopolamine 3aswimming 0aElevated plus-maze 0aAnxiety 0aEmotional memory 0aSwimming 0aScopolamine 0aCA1 0aMice1 aNasehi, Maryam1 aRahmani-Nia, Farhad1 aMirzaei, Bahman1 aTorabi-Nami, Mohammad1 aZarrindast, Mohammad-Reza0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2014 Apr. 10, v. 128 p.237-246dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009800165500001900263520102500282592002801307650002001335650001101355650002501366650001701391650001001408650001601418650001001434650001301444650001401457650001101471650001001482650002701492653003101519653002301550653002001573653001501593653002101608653001601629700001601645700001401661700002001675700001501695700001201710700001601722700001601738700001601754700001401770700002001784700001701804773011001821856008601931852000902017655001202026IND60737498720221119010106.0210615e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073749872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1102462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Quan10aStorage with apple fruit to improve peel color and maintain freshness of Newhall navel orange  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel biological treatment of staying with commercially mature apple fruits was proposed to promote the peel coloration of ‘Newhall’ navel orange fruit (Citrus sinensis Osbeck), which could conduce to the formation of uniform orange red peel color. At 15 days after treatment (DAT), the staying with apple (SWA) treatment led to a nearly 4-fold increase in the total carotenoid content compared with the control. Specifically, the red color apocarotenoid β-citraurin showed the highest degree of enhancement (~6 fold) under SWA treatment. Simultaneously, the expression level of β-citraurin biosynthetic gene carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 4b (CCD4b) was dramatically induced (about 35 folds). Furthermore, SWA had the same effect of promoting coloration and obviously alleviate calyx senescence of citrus fruit compared with ethylene treatment. In conclusion, SWA treatment is a potential environment-friendly and recyclable postharvest technology to improve peel color and maintain fruit freshness for citrus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus sinensis 3aapples 3abiological treatment 3abiosynthesis 3acalyx 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3aethylene 3afreshness 3afruits 3agenes 3apostharvest technology 0a‘Newhall’ navel orange 0astaying with apple 0apeel coloration 0acarotenoid 0acalyx senescence 0apostharvest1 aHe, Yizhong1 aYe, Junli1 aZheng, Xiongjie1 aZhou, Cong1 aFu, Ang1 aWei, Ranran1 aYin, Yingzi1 aChai, Lijun1 aXu, Qiang1 aCheng, Yunjiang1 aDeng, Xiuxin0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 287 p.110246-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1102463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01566naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300002000288520029000308592002800598650002300626650002300649650001800672650001200690650002000702650001700722650001900739650001600758700001800774700001900792700001400811700002100825700001600846700001700862700001600879700001400895700001500909773013700924856007401061852000901135655001201144IND60677966520221120170751.0191213e20191212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067796652DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc07553d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Huifang10aGreen synthesis of mesoporous MnNbOₓ oxide by a liquid induced self-assembly strategy for low-temperature removal of NOₓ  ap. 15073-15076.  aHerein, we present a facile, sustainable, and highly efficient ionic liquid induced self-assembly protocol to construct a highly porous MnNbOₓ oxide with exceptionally high catalytic activity for NOₓ removal at low temperatures and excellent tolerance to H₂O and SO₂ poisoning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3anitrogen oxides 3aporous media 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature1 aFeng, Guodong1 aYang, Zhenzhen1 aWang, Tao1 aOkejiri, Francis1 aTan, Junbin1 aZhao, Minjie1 aLiu, Jixing1 aLiu, Jian1 aZhao, Zhen0 tChemical communications.g2019 Dec. 12, v. 55, no. 100 p.15073-15076dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc07553d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245012900175300001600304520171100320592002802031650001902059650002102078650001402099650001502113650001502128650002602143650001902169650002302188650001702211650001102228650001602239650001902255650001402274650001802288650001702306650001902323650001302342650002002355650001802375650002502393650001502418700002202433700002402455700002402479700003602503773010802539856008302647852000902730655001202739IND60629865220221118133734.0190202e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062986522DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.00000000000002342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondrashina, Victoria10aInfluence of Activated Carbon and Other Additives on Bioremediation Rate and Characteristics of Petroleum-Contaminated Soils  ap. 150-158.  aThe main objective of this research was to study remediation of petroleum-contaminated soils after treating with granular activated carbon (AC) in combination with diatomite and a biopreparation (BP). Bioremediation rate and properties of petroleum-contaminated soils were used to explore associated mechanisms. Experiments were conducted under microfield conditions with three types of soils surficially contaminated with crude oil followed by weathering. Soil samples were amended with BP and two doses of AC (in combination or separately) or with diatomite alone (D) and mixed with AC (ACD). Natural attenuation decreased the concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in the soils (initially 28–29 g kg) by 50% at 2 and 72% at 13 months. More efficient reduction of TPH (by 81% at 2 and 85% at 13 months) was achieved during the same period via in situ bioremediation by activating indigenous petroleum degraders, whereas the impact of BP alone was negligible. Soil amendment with the ACD mixture produced the best results; TPH content was reduced by 90% at 2 and 92% at 13 months, and soil phytotoxicity was low during most of the incubation period. Results demonstrated the potential of ACD as an adsorbent for accelerated bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soils. Addition of the ACD mixture creates better conditions for degrading microorganisms and plant growth due to reversible adsorption of toxic petroleum components and metabolites, an increase in soil water-holding capacity, and total porosity, as well as a liming effect, increased plant resistance to abiotic stress in the presence of ACD, and better availability of compounds adsorbed to AC in the presence of diatomite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aactivated carbon 3aadditives 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiological production 3abioremediation 3adiatomaceous earth 3ahydrocarbons 3aliming 3ametabolites 3amicroorganisms 3apetroleum 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant growth 3apolluted soils 3aporosity 3asoil amendments 3asoil sampling 3asoil water retention 3aweathering1 aStrijakova, Elena1 aZinnatshina, Lidija1 aBocharnikova, Elena1 aVasilʹeva, G.

The liver is of particular interest given its vital roles in maintaining homeostasis and health as well as regulating nutrient utilization and overall metabolism. We aimed to evaluate whether and how response to psychosocial stress is reflected by physiological molecular pathways in liver tissue. A pig mixing experiment was conducted to induce psychosocial stress culminating in skin lesions which reflect the involvement in aggressive behavior and fighting. At 27weeks of age, animals prone to psychosocially low- and high-stress were assigned to mixing groups. Skin lesions were counted before mixing and after slaughter on the carcass. Individual liver samples (n=12) were taken. The isolated RNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip porcine Genome Arrays. Relative changes of mRNA abundances were estimated via variance analyses. Molecular routes related to tRNA charging, urea cycle, acute phase response, galactose utilization, and steroid receptor signaling were found to be increased in psychosocially high-stressed animals, whereas catecholamine degradation and cholesterol biosynthesis were found to be decreased. In particular, psychosocially high-stressed animals show decreased expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) which has been linked to molecular mechanisms regulating aggressiveness and stress response. The expression patterns of high-stressed animals revealed metabolic alterations of key genes related to energy-mobilizing processes at the expense of energy consuming processes. Thus, the coping following psychosocial challenges involves transcriptional alterations in liver tissue which may be summarized with reference to the concept of allostasis, a strategy which is critical for survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abiosynthesis 3acatechol O-methyltransferase 3acatecholamines 3acholesterol 3acortisol 3aenergy 3afighting behavior 3agalactose 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amixing 3anutrient utilization 3apsychological stress 3askin lesions 3aslaughter 3asteroid receptors 3astress response 3aswine 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfer RNA 3aurea 0aAllostasis 0aLiver 0aMicroarray 0aMixing 0aPig 0aPsychosocial stress1 aMuráni, E.1 aPonsuksili, S.1 aD'Eath, R.B.1 aTurner, S.P.1 aEvans, G.1 aThölking, L.1 aKurt, E.1 aKlont, R.1 aFoury, A.1 aMormède, P.1 aWimmers, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9523-67900 tPhysiology & behavior.g2014 Apr. 10, v. 128 p.159-165dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245010500208520106300313592002801376650001901404650001601423650002001439650001201459650001501471650001001486650001701496650002501513650001801538650001701556651001901573651001201592653001501604653001701619653002801636700002301664700002001687700002001707700005801727773009401785856008201879852000901961655001201970IND60751971620221116172538.0211030e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075197162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2021.1074182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzékvári, Kinga1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1508-229110aNew complete mitogenome datasets and their characterization of the European catfish (Silurus glanis)  aWe present new complete mitogenome sequences of Silurus glanis (S. glanis) from 4 samples such as male and female individuals from two countries (Hungary, Czech Republic).

Due to damming and climate change, the water level during the middle of dry season (MDS) had a significant tendency of increasing in the two lakes. The habitat suitability for Anatidae, Charadriidae, Ardeidae and Laridae between the MDS with increasing of water level (DIW) and those with normal water level (DNW) were compared in this study, using geo-spatial overlay calculation, to reveal the responses of habitat suitability for migratory birds to increased water level during MDS in DTL and PYL. The results showed that the increased water level during MDS 1) had a negative influence on the habitat suitability for Anatidae and Charadriidae in DTL and PYL, and this influence in PYL was stronger than that of DTL; 2) had a neutral influence on the habitat suitability for Ardeidae in DTL and PYL, and this influence in PYL also was stronger than that of DTL; and 3) had a lesser negative influence on the habitat suitability for Laridae in DTL and had no influence on that of PYL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnatidae 3aArdeidae 3aCharadriidae 3aLaridae 3aclimate change 3adry season 3afreshwater 3afreshwater lakes 3ahabitats 3amigratory behavior 3aAustralia 3aChina 0aHabitat suitability 0aMigratory bird 0aDry season 0aWater level 0aDongting Lake 0aPoyang Lake1 aDai, Juan1 aSun, Shiquan1 aDu, Chunyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0700-51091 aLong, Yuannan1 aChen, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8937-38041 aYu, Guanlong1 aYe, Shujing1 aChen, Jing0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Feb., v. 121 p.107065-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1070653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009000169300001600259520167200275592002801947650002801975650000902003650001602012650001302028650002002041653001802061653002202079653002202101653002102123653003302144653001502177700002402192773009102216856008502307852000902392655001202401IND60551208920221119195517.0161018e20140422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055120892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Pankaj10aBreakdown of selection-mediated correlation between development time and clock period  ap. 110-117.  aPreviously we have reported that selection for faster pre-adult development in fruit flies speeded-up development by ~29-h and shortened the clock period (τ) by ~0.5h, which suggests that development time and τ are correlated. Since it is known that τ is altered following exposure to light/dark (LD) cycles, we asked whether this correlation persists in the faster developing (FD) and control (BD) flies by examining the τ of the activity/rest rhythm and its difference between the two stocks following exposure to a variety of cyclic conditions. We assayed the activity/rest behavior of FD and BD flies under DD, following a week-long exposure to (a) LD cycles of 10:10h, 12:12h and 14:14h, or (b) LD12:12h with different light intensities (10, 100 and 1000lx), or (c) 12:12h warm/cold (WC) cycles of 25:18°C (WC1) and 29:25°C (WC2), or (d) WC1 or WC2, in-phase or out-of-phase with LD. The results revealed that both LD and WC altered the τ of FD and BD flies, and considerably reduced the selection-mediated difference between the two stocks. LD10:10 caused more severe after-effects on τ compared to LD12:12 and LD14:14. Among the WC cycles, WC1 which had a higher contrast caused period shortening. Irrespective of the phase relationship, imposition of LD cycles on WC cycles made no difference to the extent of after-effects; however, interestingly there was a reversal in the trend, in that, now WC2 with LD caused most drastic reduction in τ. These results suggest that cyclic environments modulate the circadian organization of Drosophila melanogaster altering the selection-mediated correlation between pre-adult development time and clock period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3acold 3afruit flies 3afruiting 3alight intensity 0aAfter-effects 0aCircadian rhythms 0aLight/dark cycles 0aWarm/cold cycles 0aThermophase/Cryophase cycles 0aDrosophila1 aSharma, Vijay Kumar0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2014 Apr. 22, v. 129 p.110-117dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014200174520140800316592002801724650001801752650001601770650001201786650001301798650001801811650001301829650001301842650001201855650002701867650002401894650002501918650001701943650001901960650001901979650002601998650002502024650001802049650001902067650001502086650001402101653004602115653002202161653002202183653003202205653003302237700001802270700001602288700001602304773011402320856008602434852000902520655001202529IND60770788220221117155813.0220517e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077078822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1286982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez-Huerta, C.10aInfluence of biofilm thickness on the removal of thirteen different organic micropollutants via a Membrane Aerated Biofilm Reactor (MABR)  aThe presence of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in natural water bodies has become an emerging concern due to their fast dissemination into natural water sources, high persistence, ubiquitous nature, and detrimental impact on the environment and human health. This study evaluated the Membrane Aerated Biofilm Reactor (MABR) efficiency in the removal of 13 OMPs commonly reported in water. Results demonstrated that OMPs removal is dependent on biofilm thickness and bacterial cell density, microbial community composition and physicochemical properties of OMPs. Effective removals of ammonium and organic carbon (COD, >50%), acetaminophen (70%) and triclosan (99%) were obtained even at early stages of biofilm development (thickness < 0.33 mm, 2.9 ×10⁵ cell mL⁻¹). An increase in biofilm thickness and cell density (1.02 mm, 2.2 ×10⁶ cell mL⁻¹) enhanced the system performance. MABR achieved over 90% removal of nonpolar, hydrophobic and hydrophilic OMPs and 22–69% removal of negatively charged and acidic OMPs. Relative abundances of Zoogloea, Aquabacterium, Leucobacter, Runella, and Paludilbaculum bacteria correlated with the removal of certain OMPs. In addition, MABR achieved up to 96% nitrification and 80% overall COD removal by the end of the experiment. The findings from this study demonstrated MABRs to be a feasible option to treat municipal wastewater polluted by OMPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAquabacterium 3aLeucobacter 3aRunella 3aZoogloea 3aacetaminophen 3aammonium 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental impact 3ahuman health 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrobial communities 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrification 3aorganic carbon 3apollutants 3atriclosan 0aPharmaceutical and personal care products 0aBiofilm processes 0aBiofilm thickness 0aBiofilm microbial community 0aAerobic wastewater treatment1 aFortunato, L.1 aLeiknes, T.1 aHong, P.-Y.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 June 15, v. 432 p.128698-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1286983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012600168300002000294520163200314592002801946650002201974650001401996650002402010650002102034650002502055650001502080650002202095650001702117650002502134650001802159650001402177650001302191650001902204650000702223650001902230650001902249650002202268650001402290650002202304650001502326650002502341650002002366700001802386700001902404700005402423773016902477856008302646852000902729655001202738IND60655167520221120135019.0191213e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065516752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05646-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandra, Ramesh10aMulti-core-shell composite SnO2NPs@ZIF-8: potential antiviral agent and effective photocatalyst for waste-water treatment  ap. 23346-23358.  aWith increasing environment pollution and bacterial transmitted viral diseases globally, the development of new, effective, and low-cost materials/strategies is the current major challenge. To combat with this alarming problem, three new multi-functional and thermally stable SnO₂NPs@ZIF-8 composites (NC1, NC2, and NC3) were synthesized by a facile and sustainable approach involving in situ encapsulation of SnO₂NPs (150, 300, and 500 μL suspension in methanol) within zeolitic imidazole framework at room temperature. The morphology and crystallinity of ZIF-8 remained unchanged upon the proper encapsulation of SnO₂NPs in its matrix. Herein, for the first time, the antiviral potential of ZIF-8 and SnO₂NPs@ZIF-8 against chikungunya virus is reported by investigating their cytotoxicity against Vero cell line (employing MTT ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)) assay). The maximum non-toxic doses were 0.04 mg mL⁻¹ for ZIF-8 and SnO₂NPs@ZIF-8 and 0.1 mg mL⁻¹ for SnO₂NPs. Further, NC1 exhibited (based on plaque assay) reduction in viral load/titers up to > 80% during post-treatment and > 50% during pre-treatment, greater than that of ZIF-8 and SnO₂NPs due to synergistic effect. Further, NC1 (10 mg) exhibited enhanced photocatalytic efficiency (≥ 96%) for degradation of methylene blue (0.5 × 10⁻⁵ M) at pH ˃ 7.0. The probable mechanism for their antiviral activity and photocatalytic activity has been discussed.

To analyse this in a systematic way, different time series sample periods are constructed from annual data for 17 OECD countries covering the overall period 1960 to 2008. The specific price decomposition under consideration, often used to estimate asymmetric price response models of energy demand, separates the impact of prices above the previous maximum, of a price recovery below the previous maximum and of a price cut. Therefore, the analysis does not just involve using different time periods; instead, for each time period investigated, a new dataset is constructed and for each dataset, the price variable is decomposed in this way. An energy demand relationship allowing for asymmetric price responses is therefore estimated for each different sample period and the results suggest that recalculation of the decomposed price variables for each different period does affect the stability of the estimated energy demand responses. In contrast, a similarly estimated energy demand relationship with symmetric price responses for each different sample period is found to have less instability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenergy 3amodels 3aprices 3atime series analysis1 aEvans, Joanne1 aHunt, Lester Charles0 tEnergy economics.g2013 Nov., v. 40 p.90-109dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2013.05.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012600170300001600296520141800312592002801730650001401758650001801772650002601790650001601816650002401832650002501856650001501881650001601896650001301912650002801925650001601953650002601969650002101995650001202016650001202028650002102040653001502061653001702076653002002093653001502113653001402128653001802142700001702160700001802177700001802195700006002213700002202273700001602295700002802311773012402339856008502463852000902548655001202557IND60623395020221122060222.0190620e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062339502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpinedi, Nahuel10aExploring the response of Marchantia polymorpha: Growth, morphology and chlorophyll content in the presence of anthracene  ap. 570-574.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified as hazardous contaminants that are ubiquitous and persistent in aquatic environments, where bryophytes sensu lato (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) are frequently present. Marchantia polymorpha (Class Hepaticae; thalloid liverwort) is known to respond fast to changes in the environment; it accumulates toxic substances in its tissues due to the lack of vascular and radicular systems and a reduced or absent cuticle. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of increasing concentrations of anthracene (0, 50 100, 280 μM) on the germination of propagules, plant morphology and chlorophyll content index (CCI) in M. polymorpha under in vitro cultures. The results show that anthracene had no statistical effect on germination or propagula formation. However, plants exposed to anthracene for 30 days showed significantly lowered the content of chlorophyll (measured as CCI), irregular growth patterns and the induction of thalli asexual reproduction as evidenced by the production of multicellular viable propagules in gemmae cups. Results of epifluorescence microscopy also showed concomitant accumulation of anthracene in the cell walls. All of these distinctive morphological and physiological adaptive responses indicators, clearly suggest that M. polymorpha are capable of resisting high (coal tar) anthracene concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3aHepaticopsida 3aMarchantia polymorpha 3aanthracenes 3aaquatic environment 3aasexual reproduction 3acell walls 3achlorophyll 3acoal tar 3afluorescence microscopy 3agermination 3amosses and liverworts 3aplant morphology 3athallus 3atissues 3atoxic substances 0aAnthracene 0aBioindicator 0aBioaccumulation 0aBryophytes 0aLiverwort 0aPhytotoxicity1 aRojas, Nadia1 aStorb, Romina1 aCabrera, Juan1 aAranda, Elisabet1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5915-24451 aSalierno, Marcelo1 aSvriz, Maya1 aScervino, José Martín0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 Feb., v. 135 p.570-574dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015600169300001500325520113700340592002801477650002301505650002601528650001901554650001601573650001301589650001501602650000901617650001501626650001001641650001001651650001401661650001701675650002401692650001401716650001301730700002401743700002301767773008401790856004801874852000901922655001201931IND50062244620221122234650.0130321e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006224462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-012-9471-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinuz, Alfonso10aPost-infection development of Meloidogyne incognita on tomato treated with the endophytes Fusarium oxysporum strain Fo162 and Rhizobium etli strain G12  ap. 95-104.  aThe endophytic fungus Fusarium oxysporum strain Fo162 and the endophytic bacterium Rhizobium etli strain G12 have been shown to enhance plant resistance toward the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. The individual inoculation of tomato seedlings with these antagonists lead to significant reductions in the number of juveniles that penetrated the root and ultimately the number of galls and egg-masses produced. The present study determined the influence of Fo162 and G12 root colonization on juvenile development inside the root system over time after a synchronized nematode infection. The results showed that 14 and 21 days after nematode inoculation, the development into the third-stage juvenile as well as into the adult-stage was significantly lower in endophyte-treated plants when compared to the untreated control, respectively. In addition, Fo162 and G12 treatment led to a significant reduction in the number of eggs per female 35 days after nematode inoculation. The results demonstrated that both Fo162 and G12 not only reduce M. incognita root penetration, but also reduce their development and reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aRhizobium etli 3aantagonists 3abacteria 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agalls 3ajuveniles 3aroot systems 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aseedlings 3atomatoes1 aSchouten, Alexander1 aSikora, Richard A.0 tBioControl.g2013 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.95-104dSpringer-Verlagx1386-61417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-012-9471-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245005800214300001600272520175000288592002802038650001702066650001402083650001102097650001502108650002102123650001102144650001502155650001702170650001002187650001602197653001702213653002702230653002302257653001702280653002002297653001902317700001702336700002202353700002502375700002202400700002102422700002302443700002502466700002802491700001702519700002102536700002102557700001602578700001902594700002502613700002202638700002602660700002702686700003202713700002402745700002202769700002602791700002302817773011902840856008802959852000903047655001203056IND60633292220221120081228.0191214e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063329222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarot, Sébastien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5910-538X10aUrban ecology, stakeholders and the future of ecology  ap. 475-484.  aThe world human population is more and more urban and cities have a strong impact on the biosphere. This explains the development of urban ecology. In this context, the goal of our work is fourfold: to describe the diversity of scientific questions in urban ecology, show how these questions are organized, to assess how these questions can be built in close interactions with stakeholders, to better understand the role urban ecology can play within ecological sciences. A workshop with scientists from all relevant fields (from ecology to sociology) and stakeholders was organized by the Foundation for Research on Biodiversity (FRB). Three types of scientific issues were outlined about (1) the biodiversity of organisms living in urban areas, (2) the functioning of urban organisms and ecosystems, (3) interactions between human societies and urban ecological systems. For all types of issues we outlined it was possible to distinguish both fundamental and applied scientific questions. This allowed building a unique research agenda encompassing all possible types of scientific issues in urban ecology. As all types of ecological and evolutionary questions can be asked in urban areas, urban ecology will likely be more and more influential in the development of ecology. Taken together, the future of towns, their biodiversity and the life of city dwellers is at stake. Increasing the space for ecosystems and biodiversity within towns is more and more viewed as crucial for the well-being of town dwellers. Depending on research and the way its results are taken into account, very different towns could emerge. Urban areas can be viewed as a test and a laboratory for the future of the interactions between human and ecological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiosphere 3acities 3aecosystems 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3ascientists 3astakeholders 3atowns 3aurban areas 0aBiodiversity 0aEcological engineering 0aEcosystem services 0aStakeholders 0aResearch agenda 0aHuman sciences1 aAbbadie, Luc1 aAuclerc, Apolline1 aBarthélémy, Carole1 aBérille, Etienne1 aBillet, Philippe1 aClergeau, Philippe1 aConsales, Jean-Noël1 aDeschamp-Cottin, Magali1 aDavid, Ambre1 aDevigne, Cédric1 aDham, Véronique1 aDusza, Yann1 aGaillard, Anne1 aGonzalez, Emmanuelle1 aHédont, Marianne1 aLabarraque, Dorothée1 aLe Bastard, Anne-Marie1 aMorel, J.

Here, we investigated physiological changes during an additional 6-month period on a self-selected and self-prepared CRHP diet. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with T2DM were instructed to consume a CRHP diet (30% of energy from carbohydrate and 30% from protein) for 24 weeks, after an initial 2 × 6-week trial when all food was prepared and provided to them. Patients received dietary advice every 2 weeks. At weeks 0, 6, 12 and 36, they underwent a 3-h intravenous glucose tolerance test, a 4-h mixed meal test, and a 48-h continuous glucose monitoring. Liver, muscle, pancreas, and visceral fat contents were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: During the 24-week self-selected diet period (weeks 12–36), body weight, visceral fat, liver fat, and glycated haemoglobin were maintained at the same levels achieved at the end of the fully provided diet period, and were still lower than at baseline (P < 0.05). Postprandial insulinaemia and insulin secretion were significantly greater (P < 0.05). At week 36, fasting insulin and C-peptide levels increased (P < 0.01) and daily glycaemia decreased further (P < 0.05) when compared with the end of the fully provided diet period. CONCLUSION: Substituting dietary carbohydrate for protein and fat has metabolic benefits in patients with T2DM. These beneficial effects are maintained or augmented over the next 6 months when patients self-select and self-prepare this diet in a dietitian-supported setting.

Engineered lungs may be derived from animal sources after removing cellular content, exposing the extracellular matrix to serve as a scaffold for recellularization with human cells. However, the use of xenogeneic tissue sources in human transplantation raises concerns due to the presence of the antigenic Gal epitope. In the present study, lungs from wild type or α-Gal knockout pigs were harvested, decellularized, and implanted subcutaneously in a non-human primate model to evaluate the host immune response. The decellularized porcine implants were compared to a sham surgery control, as well as native porcine and decellularized macaque lung implants. The results demonstrated differential profiles of circulating and infiltrating immune cell subsets and histological outcomes depending on the implanted tissue source. Upon implantation, the decellularized α-Gal knockout lung constructs performed similarly to the decellularized wild type lung constructs. However, upon re-implantation into a chronic exposure model, the decellularized wild type lung constructs resulted in a greater proportion of infiltrating CD45⁺ cells, including CD3⁺ and CD8⁺ cytotoxic T-cells, likely mediated by an increase in production of Gal-specific antibodies. The results suggest that removal of the Gal epitope can potentially reduce adverse inflammatory reactions associated with chronic exposure to engineered organs containing xenogeneic components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3achronic exposure 3acytotoxicity 3aepitopes 3aexposure models 3aextracellular matrix 3ahistology 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3alungs 3apatients 3asurgery 3aswine 3atissue engineering 0aXenotransplantation 0aLung 0aDecellularized scaffold 0aBiocompatibility 0aHost immune response 0aNon-human primate1 aBonvillain, Ryan W.1 aSkillen, Clint D.1 aBurger, Brandon L.1 aHara, Hidetaka1 aLee, Whayoung1 aTrygg, Cynthia B.1 aDidier, Peter J.1 aGrasperge, Brooke F.1 aPashos, Nicholas C.1 aBunnell, Bruce A.1 aBianchi, John1 aAyares, David L.1 aGuthrie, Kelly I.1 aBrown, Bryan N.1 aPetersen, Thomas H.0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Dec., v. 187 p.93-104dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.09.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245008800176300001600264520109700280592002801377650001101405650001201416650002001428650001101448650002601459650001401485651001101499700002601510773008201536856008301618990002301701852000901724655001201733IND60096730420221119091940.0141104e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009673042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2013.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuintino, Derick David10aQuantitative analysis of feasibility of hydrous ethanol futures contracts in Brazil  ap. 927-935.  aBrazil's first ethanol futures contract, which was implemented in 2000, failed to offer sufficient liquidity to attract market agents. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new ethanol futures contracts launched by BMF-BOVESPA in 2010 meet the requirements to render them feasible. The originality of this work stems from its approach in analyzing different cross-hedging possibilities in the food and energy chains. This analysis, which covers the period of May 2010 to April 2012, evaluates the degree of competition in the sector, the price volatility of the spot market, the price correlations between its possible substitutes, as well as the possibility of cross-hedging Brazil's ethanol with contracts in international futures markets and their potential degree of substitution. The results of this study indicate that the new configuration of BMF-BOVESPA ethanol futures contracts meets the most requirements for viability. Nevertheless, the ethanol distribution sector is relatively concentrated, which may limit the liquidity of BMF-BOVESPA ethanol futures contracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afutures trading 3aprices 3aquantitative analysis 3aviability 3aBrazil1 aDavid, Sergio Adriani0 tEnergy economics.g2013 Nov., v. 40 p.927-935dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2013.07.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011600168300001800284520156500302592002801867596005101895650002701946650001001973650001301983650001101996650002202007650001802029650001602047650001302063650004302076650001402119650001702133700001702150700002702167700006002194773012502254856008302379852000902462655001202471IND60718075920221119053405.0211001e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071807592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05959-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholami, Samira10aApamin administration impact on miR-219 and miR-155-3p expression in cuprizone induced multiple sclerosis model  ap. 9013-9019.  aMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic debilitating disease that attacks the central nervous system. This study aims to investigate miR-219 and miR-155-3p expression levels involved in the myelination process following the administration of apamin peptide in the model of multiple sclerosis disease. Forty-four 8 week C57BL/6 male mice (22 ± 5 g) randomly divided into six groups. Apamin (100 µg/kg/BW) was administered intraperitoneally as a co-treatment during phase I (demyelination) or post-treatment phase II (remyelination) twice a week in cuprizone induced MS model. At the end of study myelin content and microRNA expression levels were measured with LFB staining and quantitative Real-Time PCR method, respectively. It was observed that the intended microRNAs were dysregulated during the different phases of disease induction. After 6 weeks of cuprizone exposure, miR-219 downregulated in phase I in comparison with the negative control. On the other hand, the apamin co-treatment significantly inhibit the miR-155-3p upregulation during the phase I as compared with the cuprizone group (p < 0.0001). Apamin has more impact on the miR155-3p reduction in phase I than miR-219 elevation in phase II. It could be considered as a therapeutic option for decreasing plaque formation during the exacerbation phase of the MS disease.

The main problem of conventional base catalysed transesterification reaction is that the reactants are not readily miscible and thus high reaction temperature and longer reaction time is required for the transesterification reaction to complete. The addition of co-solvent such as THF (tetrahydrofuran) enables the reaction to occur in single phase. The base catalysed ethyl ester production aided with tetrahydrofuran as co-solvent was optimised in terms of amount of KOH catalyst, ethanol to oil molar ratio, THF to ethanol ratio, reaction time and reaction temperature. The efficient reaction conditions using tetrahydrofuran as co-solvent were 2% catalyst concentration, 8:1 ethanol to oil molar ratio, THF to ethanol ratio of 0.27, reaction time 45 min and reaction temperature 40 °C. The maximum recovery and conversion of oil into ethyl ester was reported to be 75.8 and 95%. The co-solvent assisted transesterification thus can save time, energy and labour for large scale production of biodiesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3aethanol 3alabor 3arice bran oil 3atemperature 3atetrahydrofuran 3atransesterification 0aEthyl ester 0aCo-solvent 0aBase-catalysed transesterification 0areaction time 0areaction temperature1 aSoni, Rajesh1 aSingh, S.K.1 aSooch, Sarbjit Singh1 aSangha, M.K.0 tJournal of Biofuels.g2014, v. 5, no. 2 p.62-67dIndianJournals.comwJournal:2210x0976-47637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-4763.2014.00008.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245023600167300001600403520185900419592002802278650001902306650001702325650001702342650001702359650001902376650001302395650001202408650001702420650003102437650002502468650001602493650001402509650001402523650002602537650002202563650001702585650001902602700001502621700001602636700001802652700001802670700001802688773014002706856008102846852000902927655001202936IND60751334120221119173603.0211102e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075133412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-021-1235-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Shengxiang10aBrevibacterium limosum sp. nov., Brevibacterium pigmenatum sp. nov., and Brevibacterium atlanticum sp. nov., three novel dye decolorizing actinobacteria isolated from ocean sediments [Erratum: November 2021, v.59(11), pp.1064-1065]  ap. 898-910.  aDuring a study of the marine actinobacterial biodiversity, a large number of Brevibacterium strains were isolated. Of these, five that have relatively low 16S rRNA gene similarity (98.5–99.3%) with validly published Brevibacterium species, were chosen to determine taxonomic positions. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and BOX-PCR fingerprinting, strains o2ᵀ, YB235ᵀ, and WO024ᵀ were selected as representative strains. Genomic analyses, including average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), clearly differentiated the three strains from each other and from their closest relatives, with values ranging from 82.8% to 91.5% for ANI and from 26.7% to 46.5% for dDDH that below the threshold for species delineation. Strains YB235ᵀ, WO024ᵀ, and o2ᵀ all exhibited strong and efficient decolorization activity in congo red (CR) dyes, moderate decolorization activity in toluidine blue (TB) dyes and poor decolorization in reactive blue (RB) dyes. Genes coding for peroxidases and laccases were identified and accounted for these strains’ ability to effectively oxidize a variety of dyes with different chemical structures. Mining of the whole genome for secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters revealed the presence of gene clusters encoding for bacteriocin, ectoine, NRPS, siderophore, T3PKS, terpene, and thiopeptide. Based on the phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic data, strains o2ᵀ, YB235ᵀ and WO024ᵀ clearly represent three novel taxa within the genus Brevibacterium, for which the names Brevibacterium limosum sp. nov. (type strain o2ᵀ = JCM 33844ᵀ = MCCC 1A09961ᵀ), Brevibacterium pigmenatum sp. nov. (type strain YB235ᵀ = JCM 33843ᵀ = MCCC 1A09842ᵀ) and Brevibacterium atlanticum sp. nov.

Such biomaterials can enhance tissue-specific differentiation of adult stem cells, suggesting that structuring different ECMs into multi-layered scaffolds can form the basis of new strategies for regenerating damaged interfacial tissues such as the osteochondral unit. In this study, mass spectrometry is used to demonstrate that growth plate (GP) and articular cartilage (AC) ECMs contain a unique array of regulatory proteins that may be particularly suited to bone and cartilage repair respectively. Applying a novel iterative freeze-drying method, porous bi-phasic scaffolds composed of GP ECM overlaid by AC ECM are fabricated, which are capable of spatially directing stem cell differentiation in vitro, promoting the development of graded tissues transitioning from calcified cartilage to hyaline-like cartilage. Evaluating repair 12-months post-implantation into critically-sized caprine osteochondral defects reveals that these scaffolds promote regeneration in a manner distinct to commercial control-scaffolds. The GP layer supports endochondral bone formation, while the AC layer stimulates the formation of an overlying layer of hyaline cartilage with a collagen fiber architecture better recapitulating the native tissue. These findings support the use of a bi-layered, tissue-specific ECM derived scaffolds for regenerating spatially complex musculoskeletal tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult stem cells 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3acartilage 3acell differentiation 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3afreeze drying 3agoats 3agrowth plate 3amass spectrometry 3aregulatory proteins 3atissue repair 0aExtracellular matrix 0aScaffold 0aGrowth plate 0aArticular cartilage 0aOsteochondral defect1 aDíaz-Payno, Pedro J.1 aSheehy, Eamon J.1 aCritchley, Susan E.1 aAlmeida, Henrique V.1 aPitacco, Pierluca1 aCarroll, Simon F.1 aMahon, Olwyn R.1 aDunne, Aisling1 aLevingstone, Tanya J.1 aMoran, Conor J.1 aBrady, Robert T.1 aO'Brien, Fergal J.1 aBrama, Pieter A.J.1 aKelly, Daniel J.0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Jan., v. 188 p.63-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.09.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245016400166300001800330520146200348592002801810650001501838650000901853650002001862650002101882650001601903650003901919650001301958650002101971650003701992650002302029650001702052700001802069700002002087700002402107700002302131773012502154856008102279852000902360655001202369IND60578912320221119190926.0170815e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057891232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b021642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinard, Erica N.10aBioavailability of Carbon Nanomaterial-Adsorbed Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to Pimphales promelas: Influence of Adsorbate Molecular Size and Configuration  ap. 9288-9296.  aDespite carbon nanomaterials’ (CNMs) potential to alter the bioavailability of adsorbed contaminants, information characterizing the relationship between adsorption behavior and bioavailability of CNM-adsorbed contaminants is still limited. To investigate the influence of CNM morphology and organic contaminant (OC) physicochemical properties on this relationship, adsorption isotherms were generated for a suite of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and exfoliated graphene (GN) in conjunction with determining the bioavailability of the adsorbed PAHs to Pimphales promelas using bile analysis via fluorescence spectroscopy. Although it appeared that GN adsorbed PAHs indiscriminately compared to MWCNTs, the subsequent bioavailability of GN-adsorbed PAHs was more sensitive to PAH morphology than MWCNTs. GN was effective at reducing bioavailability of linear PAHs by ∼70%, but had little impact on angular PAHs. MWCNTs were sensitive to molecular size, where bioavailability of two-ringed naphthalene was reduced by ∼80%, while bioavailability of the larger PAHs was reduced by less than 50%. Furthermore, the reduction in bioavailability of CNM-adsorbed PAHs was negatively correlated with the amount of CNM surface area covered by the adsorbed-PAHs. This study shows that the variability in bioavailability of CNM-adsorbed PAHs is largely driven by PAH size, configuration and surface area coverage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abile 3abioavailability 3acarbon nanotubes 3acorrelation 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agraphene 3amolecular weight 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area1 aApul, Onur G.1 aKaranfil, Tanju1 avan den Hurk, Peter1 aKlaine, Stephen J.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 51, no. 16 p.9288-9296dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.7b021643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245014100170300001400311520189500325592002802220650001802248650002002266650001902286650001002305650001402315650001602329650002002345650001002365650000902375650001702384650001102401650001802412650001702430650002202447650002802469650002402497650001702521650001302538650001902551653001402570653002102584653001502605653001802620653001902638700001802657700001402675700001702689700001602706700001702722700001802739700001702757700001702774700001702791700001702808700001402825700001802839700001602857773009102873856009102964852000903055655001203064IND60616004920221121153931.0181025e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061600492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei10aIn vivo hepatocellular expression of interleukin-22 using penetratin-based hybrid nanoparticles as potential anti-hepatitis therapeutics  ap. 66-80.  aHepatocellular injury is the pathological hallmark of hepatitis and a crucial driver for the progression of liver diseases, while the treatment options are commonly restricted. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) has attracted special attention as a potent survival factor for hepatocytes that both prevents and repairs the injury of hepatocytes through activation of STAT3 signaling pathway. We hypothesized that the ability to generate potent expression of IL-22 locally for the treatment of severe hepatocellular injury in hepatitis was a promising strategy to enhance efficacy and overcome off-target effects. Accordingly, we developed a polypeptide penetratin-based hybrid nanoparticle system (PDPIA) carrying IL-22 gene by a self-assembly process. This nanocomplex modified with penetratin featured direct translocation across the cellular or endosomal membrane but mild zeta-potential to facilitate the high cellular internalization and endosomal escape of the gene cargos as well as scarcely Kupffer cells uptake. More importantly, PDPIA afforded preferential liver accumulation and predominant hepatocytes internalization following systemic administration, which showed pharmacologically suitable organ and sub-organ-selective properties. Subsequent studies confirmed a considerable protective role of PDPIA in a model of severe hepatitis induced by concanavalin A, evidenced by reduced hepatocellular injury and evaded immune response. The locally expressed IL-22 by PDPIA activated STAT3/Erk signal transduction, and thus promoted hepatocyte regeneration, inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation as well as prevented the dysfunction of mitochondrial. In addition, this system did not manifest side effects or systemic toxicity in mice. Collectively, the high versatility of PDPIA rendered its promising applications might be an effective agent to treat various hepatic disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKupffer cells 3aadverse effects 3aconcanavalin A 3agenes 3ahepatitis 3ahepatocytes 3aimmune response 3aliver 3amice 3amitochondria 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apolypeptides 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3azeta potential 0aHepatitis 0aEndosomal escape 0aHepatocyte 0aGene delivery 0aInterleukin-221 aLuan, Jingyun1 aWei, Gang1 aZhang, Xuyao1 aFan, Jiajun1 aZai, Wenjing1 aWang, Shaofei1 aWang, Yichen1 aLiang, Yanxu1 aNan, Yanyang1 aYin, Chuzhen1 aLi, Yubin1 aLiu, Ming-lin1 aJu, Dianwen0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Dec., v. 187 p.66-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245007300212300001600285520202500301592002802326650002102354650002202375650001302397650001102410650002302421650001902444650001402463650001202477650002202489650001502511651001602526651001002542653002602552653001402578653001602592653002602608653003102634653001902665700006102684700005802745700005802803773011902861856008802980852000903068655001203077IND60633292820221120055805.0190628e20190610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063329282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchi, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0499-255610aChannel control works and sediment connectivity in the European Alps  ap. 389-399.  aThe need for reducing erosion and sediment transport, and protecting human settlements has urged the construction of channel control works in mountain streams. Such works include different structures, the check dams being probably the most widespread and archetypical. The performance of channel control works in mountain streams has usually been evaluated based on their effectiveness in stabilizing the channels and the adjacent hillslopes, and in retaining sediment. The widespread presence of channel control works in mountain streams of various regions, however, has also a significant impact on hillslope-channel coupling and on sediment transfer across the channel system. Taking into account the impact of channel control works on sediment connectivity at the catchment scale has remarkable importance for planning new control structures and managing the existing ones and, more in general, for sediment management in mountain catchments. In this paper, we consider the channel control works within the conceptual framework of sediment connectivity and related terminology, and we analyze the spatial and temporal scales of the interactions between channel control works and sediment coupling-decoupling. Some examples from the Italian Alps outline the impact of check dams and other hydraulic structures on sediment connectivity and show the potential of geomorphometry in assessing such impacts. The overall effect of control works on sediment connectivity consists of an alteration of the sediment cascade with a decrease in the efficiency of sediment transfer. Sediment is partly retained behind grade-control dams within the catchment or in sediment traps equipped with retention check dams near the alluvial fan apex. These works contribute to decouple the alluvial fans from the upslope catchment. On the contrary, channel bed lining on alluvial fans favors sediment transfer to the receiving river, but this effect usually involves small amounts of sediment not retained by the check dams built upstream.  aPublisher supplied data 3adams (hydrology) 3ahuman settlements 3aplanning 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediment traps 3asediments 3astreams 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds 3aAlps region 3aItaly 0aChannel control works 0aCheck dam 0aDebris flow 0aSediment connectivity 0aHillslope-channel coupling 0aGeomorphometry1 aComiti, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9840-01651 aCrema, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8828-31291 aCavalli, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5937-454X0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 10, v. 668 p.389-399dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245007600178300001600254520137500270592002801645650002901673650002801702650002501730650001701755650001301772650002501785650002601810650002701836650001101863650001201874650002201886650001801908700001901926700002201945700002201967773010401989856008402093852000902177655001202186IND60088378820221120115553.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008837882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Ballmoos, Christoph10aProton transfer in ba₃ cytochrome c oxidase from Thermus thermophilus  ap. 650-657.  aThe respiratory heme-copper oxidases catalyze reduction of O₂ to H₂O, linking this process to transmembrane proton pumping. These oxidases have been classified according to the architecture, location and number of proton pathways. Most structural and functional studies to date have been performed on the A-class oxidases, which includes those that are found in the inner mitochondrial membrane and bacteria such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Paracoccus denitrificans (aa₃-type oxidases in these bacteria). These oxidases pump protons with a stoichiometry of one proton per electron transferred to the catalytic site. The bacterial A-class oxidases use two proton pathways (denoted by letters D and K, respectively), for the transfer of protons to the catalytic site, and protons that are pumped across the membrane. The B-type oxidases such as, for example, the ba₃ oxidase from Thermus thermophilus, pump protons with a lower stoichiometry of 0.5 H⁺/electron and use only one proton pathway for the transfer of all protons. This pathway overlaps in space with the K pathway in the A class oxidases without showing any sequence homology though. Here, we review the functional properties of the A- and the B-class ba₃ oxidases with a focus on mechanisms of proton transfer and pumping.

Fuel emulsion is one of those solutions that can be implemented. The main focus of this study is to formulate water-in-diesel (W/D) fuel emulsion and investigate its properties. The fuel emulsion is formulated successfully by adding varying concentration of water, a blend of Span 80 and Tween 80 surfactants with high speed homogenising mixing. The analysis of physical properties of stable emulsions is carried out in terms of viscosity, density, etc. It is investigated that 10% W/D emulsion shows almost the same properties as that of pure fuel. This formulated W/D emulsion is stable even at slosh and vibration. It has a very less evaporation rate than that of pure fuel. It is noncorrosive even after 30 days of contact time with mild steel and copper.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acopper 3aemulsions 3aevaporation rate 3apolysorbates 3asteel 3avibration 3aviscosity 0aFuel emulsion 0aExhaust gas emission 0aStability 0aMicroexplosion 0aBurning test1 aGadhave, Ashish D.1 aMane, Swapnil1 aWaghmare, Jyotsna0 tJournal of Biofuels.g2015, v. 6, no. 1 p.1-7dIndianJournals.comwJournal:2210x0976-47637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-4763.2015.00001.X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01658naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010900158300002000267500001900287520055200306592002800858650001000886650001700896650001600913650002600929700001600955700001700971700001500988700001301003700001601016700001301032700001501045700001601060773012501076856007401201852000901275655001201284IND60689781520221119234407.0200423e20200420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068978152DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra01594f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tianlin10aDual stimuli-responsive lanthanide-based phosphors for an advanced full-color anti-counterfeiting system  ap. 15573-15578.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDual stimuli-responsive lanthanide (Ln)-based phosphors were prepared for constructing a multi-level full color anti-counterfeiting system.

Non-edible TBOs (tree-borne oilseed) crops are known to be potential producer of biodiesel and also multipurpose trees in agriculture system. India has a great potential for production of biodiesel from non-edible oil seeds. Among the consortia of species wild apricot (Prunus armeniaca), simrauba (Simarouba glauca) and mahua (Madhuca indica) are the most promising species. This review paper assesses and integrates the biological and chemical attributes of the plant and describes about the different treeborne oilseeds in India, extraction of oil from tree-borne oilseeds, properties, characteristics and composition. These species also provide for production of energy from seed oil on par with petro diesel. With the proper planning it can be commercially exploited and make rapidly growing country self-sufficient in energy. Moreover, other environmental, socio-economic benefit enhances land value and promotes to take it on commercial basis. For generation of model on TBOs integrated research by national institutions, industry and people is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMadhuca longifolia 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aSimarouba glauca 3aanimals 3aapricots 3abiodiesel 3adiesel engines 3aenergy 3aindustry 3aland values 3amodels 3aoilseeds 3aseed oils 3asocioeconomics 3avegetables 3aIndia 0aTree-borne oilseeds 0aTransesterification 0aWild apricot 0aSimarouba 0aMahua1 aKumar, Dinesh0 tJournal of Biofuels.g2015, v. 6, no. 1 p.15-21dIndianJournals.comwJournal:2210x0976-47637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-4763.2015.00003.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012300160300001600283520178800299592002802087650002102115650001302136650002502149650001302174650001202187650001302199650001502212650001102227650001502238650001402253650002202267700001702289700001702306700001702323700001602340700001602356700001502372773014002387856008202527852000902609655001202618IND60751334720221119173641.0211102e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075133472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-021-1292-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Bin10aDiscovery of novel glycoside hydrolases from C-glycoside-degrading bacteria using sequence similarity network analysis  ap. 931-940.  aC-Glycosides are an important type of natural product with significant bioactivities, and the C-glycosidic bonds of C-glycosides can be cleaved by several intestinal bacteria, as exemplified by the human faeces-derived puerarin-degrading bacterium Dorea strain PUE. However, glycoside hydrolases in these bacteria, which may be involved in the C-glycosidic bond cleavage of C-glycosides, remain largely unknown. In this study, the genomes of the closest phylogenetic neighbours of five puerarin-degrading intestinal bacteria (including Dorea strain PUE) were retrieved, and the protein-coding genes in the genomes were subjected to sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis. Only four clusters of genes were annotated as glycoside hydrolases and observed in the genome of D. longicatena DSM 13814ᵀ (the closest phylogenetic neighbour of Dorea strain PUE); therefore, genes from D. longicatena DSM 13814ᵀ belonging to these clusters were selected to overexpress recombinant proteins (CG1, CG2, CG3, and CG4) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). In vitro assays indicated that CG4 efficiently cleaved the O-glycosidic bond of daidzin and showed moderate β-D-glucosidase and β-D-xylosidase activity. CG2 showed weak activity in hydrolyzing daidzin and pNP-β-D-fucopyranoside, while CG3 was identified as a highly selective and efficient α-glycosidase. Interestingly, CG3 and CG4 could be selectively inhibited by daidzein, explaining their different performance in kinetic studies. Molecular docking studies predicted the molecular determinants of CG2, CG3, and CG4 in substrate selectivity and inhibition propensity. The present study identified three novel and distinctive glycoside hydrolases, highlighting the potential of SSN in the discovery of novel enzymes from genomic data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adaidzein 3adaidzin 3agenomics 3aglycosides 3ahumans 3aintestines 3aphylogeny 3asequence homology1 aWang, Ya-Kun1 aYu, Jin-Biao1 aWang, Si-Jia1 aYu, Yan-Lei1 aXu, Xue-Wei1 aWang, Hong0 tjournal of microbiology.g2021 Oct., v. 59, no. 10 p.931-940dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-021-1292-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245013800163300001600301520104100317592002801358650003501386650001101421650001201432650001101444650001701455650001201472650002101484650002001505650001001525650001301535650002101548650000901569650001701578653004001595653003801635653001801673700002301691700002501714773012401739856007801863852000901941655001201950IND60674720620200211000000.0191030e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067472062DNAL7 a10.2478/agri-2019-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNouri, Mohamed10aResponses of Two Barley Subspecies to In vitro-Induced Heavy Metal Stress: Seeds Germination, Seedlings Growth and Cytotoxicity Assay  ap. 107-118.  aIn this work three heavy metals: cadmium (as CdSO₄), cobalt (as CoCl₂) and zinc (as ZnSO₄), were used to determine and compare their toxicity towards two subspecies of barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare L. and Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichum L.), focusing on seeds germination, seedlings growth, and cytological parameters. The results indicate that the effect of these heavy metals depends on the metal kind, the metal concentrations and the plant subspecies. Generally, in the case of H. vulgare, the heavy metal salts understudy did not influence significantly seed germination and seedling growth parameters. However, these metal salts influence significantly these parameters for H. distichum. The cytological test showed significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the mitotic index among the increase of the heavy metal concentrations when evaluated with the control for H. vulgare and H. distichum. Consequently, H. vulgare seemed to be more tolerant of the increase of the three heavy metals concentrations than H. distichum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare 3abarley 3acadmium 3acobalt 3aheavy metals 3amitosis 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseeds 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3azinc 3azinc sulfate 0aHordeum vulgare subsp. distichum L. 0aHordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare L. 0amitotic index1 aEl Rasafi, Taoufik1 aHaddioui, Abdelmajid0 tAgriculture = Pol̕nohospodárstvo.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 65, no. 3 p.107-118dSciendowJournal:J000000043x1338-43767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/agri-2019-00113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001500162245009500177300001600272520141200288592002801700650002301728650001601751650001001767650001601777650001101793650003801804650002001842650003701862650001101899650001801910650000901928650003201937651001001969651001401979773009901993856004402092852000902136655001202145IND50073397320221120060514.0140227e200112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007339732DNAL7 a119159692pmid7 a10.1007/s0026700102642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJim, C.

Its urban morphology is inherently not conducive to extensive or high-grade greening. Recent renewal of old areas has squeezed out some limited interstitial plantable space, although in new development areas modest spaces have been earmarked for greenery. The study aims at evaluating the major constraints to urban trees and their companion urban soil envelopes and at providing specific recommendations to improve tree management in the city. The analysis covers the above-ground confinements that dampen tree performance, the less tangible but rather difficult institutional restrictions that impose a somewhat unnecessary lid on tree planting, the multiplicity of players and stakeholders involved in urban-tree management that militates against coordination and cooperation, the widespread occupation of underground space by utility lines often to the exclusion of trees, and the extremely poor quality of urban soils that are often used without amelioration to support tree growth. The management recommendations furnish practical suggestions and hints to improve the short- and long-term welfare of trees in terms of quality, quantity, and spatial distribution. The conclusion enumerates some concrete measures for consideration by decision-makers to upgrade the city's greenery to close the gap between science and policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3apopulation density 3atree growth 3atrees 3aurban soils 2aCities 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDecision Making 2aFacility Design and Construction 2aHumans 2aPublic Policy 2aSoil 2aTreesxgrowth & development 3aChina 0aHong Kong0 tEnvironmental management.g2001 Dec., v. 28, no. 6 p.819-832dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002670010264  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011100174300001600285520131500301592002801616650002901644650002801673650002501701650001701726650002501743650001401768650001701782650001101799650001401810650001101824650001501835650001201850650001201862700003101874773010401905856008402009852000902093655001202102IND60088379320221120074841.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008837932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiletsky, Sergey A.10aCytochrome c oxidase: Charge translocation coupled to single-electron partial steps of the catalytic cycle  ap. 476-488.  aThe paper presents a survey of time-resolved studies of charge translocation by cytochrome c oxidase coupled to transfer of the 1st, 2nd 3rd and 4th electrons in the catalytic cycle. Single-electron photoreduction experiments carried out with the A-class cytochrome c oxidases of aa₃ type from mitochondria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Paracoccus denitrificans as well as with the ba₃-type oxidase from Thermus thermophilus indicate that the protonmotive mechanisms, although similar, may not be identical for different partial steps in the same enzyme species, as well as for the same single-electron transition in different oxidases. The pattern of charge translocation coupled to transfer of a single electron in the A-class oxidases confirms major predictions of the original model of proton pumping by cytochrome oxidase [Artzatbanov, V.

Consumers are extensively exposed to advertisements, but the human brain can only process a limited amount of this information. Thus, products must be differentiated in order to stand out in the market place. Branding provides one manner in which products can be differentiated. This study investigated red meat consumers’ attention towards beef brand labelling in the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality. A complete dataset for 307 respondents was extracted and used to generate the results for this study. Results showed that 30.6% of the participants preferred to purchase their beef from a certain brand. Correlation results showed that higher educated, younger and consumers from higher income groups were more likely to pay attention to a less familiar beef brand. Consumers in higher income groups, however, took longer before paying attention to the brand label for the first time. No significant correlation was found for a more familiar beef brand. When new beef brands plan to enter a market, they should identify a market that has a large number of young, highly educated consumers who earn higher incomes, since they are more likely to pay attention to an unfamiliar beef brand.  aWe would like to thank the Red Meat Research and Development South Africa for their support and funding for this project.  aPublisher supplied data  cRed Meat Research and Development Trustdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009775 3aadvertising 3abeef 3aconsumer behavior 3adata collection 3aincome 3amarkets 3ared meat 0aBeef brands 0arecollection 0aattention 0apreference 0aQ131 aVan Zyl, J.

This study was carried out in two steps, production of milk dairy waste scum biodiesel followed by performance and emission tests on a single cylinder, four-stroke CI engine with water cooled system at a fixed engine speed of 1500 rpm and at different load conditions. The impact of milk dairy waste scum oil biodiesel and its blends as a fuel on brake-specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency and brake-specific energy consumption and exhaust gas emissions has been investigated and presented. From the experimental results it is concluded that the performance and emission characteristics of B20 are satisfactory compared to all other blends. Hence, blend B20 can be used as an alternative fuel source in CI engine without any modifications in engine hardware.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3abiodiesel 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3amilk 3aoils 3atransesterification 0aMilk dairy waste scum 0aPerformance 0aEmission 0aEngine hardware 0aBrake specific fuel consumption 0aBrake thermal efficiency1 aVenkatesh, J.1 aSharanappa, Godiganur0 tJournal of Biofuels.g2015, v. 6, no. 1 p.27-37dIndianJournals.comwJournal:2210x0976-47637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0976-4763.2015.00005.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04375naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245006000209300001800269520280000287592002803087596009003115596009003205650001703295650002103312650001203333650002403345650002403369650001003393650003403403650001303437650001703450650001703467650001603484650001403500650001403514650000903528650001903537650001203556700002503568700002403593700002303617700002403640773013703664856008303801852000903884655001203893IND60755941120221123010437.0211107e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075594112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-021-02517-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarvid, Maryam S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1783-418610aTypes of carbohydrate intake and breast cancer survival  ap. 4565-4577.  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of different types of carbohydrate intake after breast cancer diagnosis with breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We prospectively assessed post-diagnostic intake of total sugar, added sugar, and natural sugar as well as carbohydrate from different sources, among 8932 women with stage I–III breast cancer that were identified in the Nurses’ Health Study from 1980 to 2010 and Nurses’ Health Study II from 1991 to 2011. Participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire every four years after diagnosis and were followed up for death. RESULTS: We prospectively documented 1071 deaths due to breast cancer and 2532 all-cause deaths, over a mean of 11.5 years of follow-up. After adjustment for confounding variables, greater post-diagnostic total sugar intake was suggestively associated with greater risk of breast cancer-specific mortality [hazard ratio (HR)Q₅ᵥₛQ₁ = 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.95–1.41; Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.02] and significantly associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality (HRQ₅ᵥₛQ₁ = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.08–1.41; Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.0001). Greater post-diagnostic added sugar intake was significantly associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality (HRQ₅ᵥₛQ₁ = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.06–1.36; Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.001). Post-diagnostic natural sugar (occurring in foods and not added as an ingredient) intake was not associated with mortality risk. Greater post-diagnostic fructose intake was significantly associated with greater risk of breast cancer-specific mortality (HRQ₅ᵥₛQ₁ = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.10–1.64; Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.005) and all-cause mortality (HRQ₅ᵥₛQ₁ = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.02–1.32; Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.01). High post-diagnostic intake of sucrose was associated with higher risk of breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. Increased post-diagnostic intake of carbohydrate from fruit juice was significantly associated with higher risk of breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality and carbohydrate from vegetables was significantly associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality. High post-diagnostic intake of carbohydrate from potatoes was suggestively associated with higher risk of breast cancer-specific mortality and carbohydrate from refined grains was suggestively associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We found that higher total sugar intake, especially added sugar, sucrose, and fructose, as well as carbohydrate from fruit juice after a breast cancer diagnosis were associated with poorer prognosis. High post-diagnostic intake of carbohydrate from vegetables was associated with reduced risk of mortality.  aPublisher supplied data  aU01 CA176726cDivision of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute  aUM1 CA186107cDivision of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute 3aadded sugars 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acarbohydrate intake 3aconfidence interval 3adeath 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afructose 3afruit juices 3ahazard ratio 3aingredients 3amortality 3aprognosis 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asucrose1 aBarnett, Junaidah B.1 aSpence, Nicholas D.1 aRosner, Bernard A.1 aHolmes, Michelle D.0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2021 Dec., v. 60, no. 8 p.4565-4577dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-021-02517-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245012500162300001600287520144700303592002801750650001601778650002201794650001301816650001801829650001501847650001501862650002701877650000901904650001401913650001001927653002901937653001701966653001901983653002702002653001602029653002002045700002302065700002202088700001902110700001702129700002502146700002002171700002802191700003202219700002402251773008602275856007602361852000902437655001202446IND60536975920221117045830.0160807e20160224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053697592DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2015-01382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhi-Qiang10aMethod for accurate fiber length determination from increment cores for large-scale population analyses in Norway spruce  ap. 829-838.  aFiber (tracheid) length is an important trait targeted for genetic and silvicultural improvement. Such studies require large-scale non-destructive sampling, and accurate length determination. The standard procedure for non-destructive sampling is to collect increment cores, singularize their cells by maceration, measure them with optical analyzer and apply various corrections to suppress influence of non-fiber particles and cut fibers, as fibers are cut by the corer. The recently developed expectation-maximization method (EM) not only addresses the problem of non-fibers and cut fibers, but also corrects for the sampling bias. Here, the performance of the EM method has been evaluated by comparing it with length-weighing and squared length-weighing, both implemented in fiber analyzers, and with microscopy data for intact fibers, corrected for sampling bias, as the reference. This was done for 12-mm increment cores from 16 Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) trees on fibers from rings 8–11 (counted from pith), representing juvenile wood of interest in breeding programs. The EM-estimates provided mean-fiber-lengths with bias of only +2.7% and low scatter. Length-weighing and length²-weighing gave biases of -7.3% and +9.3%, respectively, and larger scatter. The suggested EM approach constitutes a more accurate non-destructive method for fiber length (FL) determination, expected to be applicable also to other conifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3abreeding programs 3aconifers 3ajuvenile wood 3amaceration 3amicroscopy 3anondestructive methods 3apith 3atracheids 3atrees 0aexpectation-maximization 0afiber length 0aincrement core 0aoptical fiber analyzer 0aPicea abies 0atracheid length1 aAbramowicz, Konrad1 aRaczkowski, Rafal1 aGanea, Stefana1 aWu, Harry X.1 aLundqvist, Sven-Olof1 aMörling, Tommy1 ade Luna, Sara Sjöstedt1 aGarcía Gil, María Rosario1 aMellerowicz, Ewa J.0 tHolzforschung.g2016 Feb. 24, v. 70, no. 9 p.829-838dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2015-01383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002900191245006600220300001600286506007600302520095700378592002801335506003701363650001801400650002501418650001901443650001201462650001201474650001101486650001601497650001201513700001801525700001401543773010401557856008401661852000901745655001201754IND60088379420221207135002.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008837942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.11.0182doi7 aPMC33021762pmcid7 a221727382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerguson-Miller, Shelagh10aGating and regulation of the cytochrome c oxidase proton pump  ap. 489-494.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs a consumer of 95% of the oxygen we breathe, cytochrome c oxidase plays a major role in the energy balance of the cell. Regulation of its oxygen reduction and proton pumping activity is therefore critical to physiological function in health and disease. The location and structure of pathways for protons that are required to support cytochrome c oxidase activity are still under debate, with respect to their requirements for key residues and fixed waters, and how they are gated to prevent (or allow) proton backflow. Recent high resolution structures of bacterial and mammalian forms reveal conserved lipid and steroid binding sites as well as redox-linked conformational changes that provide new insights into potential regulatory ligands and gating modes. Mechanistic interpretation of these findings and their significance for understanding energy regulation is discussed.

However, the functions of the PdeMYB transcription factor in colored-leaf poplar remain elusive. RESULTS: In the present study, genome-wide characterization of the PdeMYB genes in colored-leaf poplar (Populus deltoids) was conducted. A total of 302 PdeMYB transcription factors were identified, including 183 R2R3-MYB, five R1R2R3-MYB, one 4R-MYB, and 113 1R-MYB transcription factor genes. Genomic localization and paralogs of PdeMYB genes mapped 289 genes on 19 chromosomes, with collinearity relationships among genes. The conserved domain, gene structure, and evolutionary relationships of the PdeMYB genes were also established and analyzed. The expression levels of PdeMYB genes were obtained from previous data in green leaf poplar (L2025) and colored leaf poplar (QHP) as well as our own qRT-PCR analysis data in green leaf poplar (L2025) and colored leaf poplar (CHP), which provide valuable clues for further functional characterization of PdeMYB genes. CONCLUSIONS: The above results provide not only comprehensive insights into the structure and functions of PdeMYB genes but also provide candidate genes for the future improvement of leaf colorization in Populus deltoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3aleaves 3atranscription factors1 aShu, Xiaochun1 aLu, Xinya1 aWang, Tao1 aZhang, Fengjiao1 aWang, Ning1 aWang, Zhong0 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.432-432dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-03212-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002500191245011000216300001600326506007600342520130200418592002801720506003701748650002301785650001101808650002501819650002201844650001101866650002001877700002901897773010401926856008402030852000902114655001202123IND60088379620221207135003.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008837962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.10.0132doi7 aPMC42207352pmcid7 a220861492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopović, Dragan M.,10aCoupled electron and proton transfer reactions during the O→E transition in bovine cytochrome c oxidase  ap. 506-517.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA combined DFT/electrostatic approach is employed to study the coupling of proton and electron transfer reactions in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and its proton pumping mechanism. The coupling of the chemical proton to the internal electron transfer within the binuclear center is examined for the O→E transition. The novel features of the His291 pumping model are proposed, which involve timely well-synchronized sequence of the proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. The obtained pKₐs and Eₘs of the key ionizable and redox-active groups at the different stages of the O→E transition are consistent with available experimental data. The PT step from E242 to H291 is examined in detail for various redox states of the hemes and various conformations of E242 side-chain. Redox potential calculations of the successive steps in the reaction cycle during the O→E transition are able to explain a cascade of equilibria between the different intermediate states and electron redistribution between the metal centers during the course of the catalytic activity. All four electrometric phases are discussed in the light of the obtained results, providing a robust support for the His291 model of proton pumping in CcO.

These waste products contain valuable biopolymers but lack many attributes needed for use in applications such as food and medical or consumer products. This study reports on an investigation of the periodate oxidation of hardwood xylan and arabinoxylan (AX) from wheat bran to produce materials with new functionalities. The study explores how to control the oxidation degree and describes structural differences between the two xylan-based polymers. For the xylan samples, the oxidation resulted in a lowering of the glass transition temperature (Tg), indicating a more flexible chain due to ring-opening of the xylan anhydro-sugar units. For the AX samples, the arabinose side-groups were instead oxidized, hindering oxidation on part of the xylose units, which resulted in a crosslinked network with an unchanged Tg but reduced intrinsic viscosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarabinose 3aarabinoxylan 3abiopolymers 3acrosslinking 3aenergy 3afood production 3aglass transition temperature 3ahardwood 3aoxidation 3apulp 3athermal properties 3aviscosity 3awastes 3awheat bran 3axylan 3axylose 0aPolymer flexibility 0aXylan 0aArabinoxylan 0aPeriodate oxidation 0aDialdehyde 0aGlass transition temperature (Tg)1 aLarsson, Anette1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6119-84231 aWestman, Gunnar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6150-52031 aStröm, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9743-15140 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 202 p.280-287dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009800161300001600259520175600275592002802031650002202059650001202081650001902093650001602112650001502128650001402143650001202157650002202169650002202191650001602213650001402229650001002243650001402253650002002267650001402287650001102301650000902312650001102321650001602332650002102348650001002369650001802379650002002397650001702417650001002434653002702444653002202471700001702493700002802510700002202538700002002560773011202580856008002692852000902772655001202781IND60674720920221121033836.0191030e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067472092DNAL7 a10.2478/botcro-2019-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavia, Ivo10aScreening for drought resistance during germination of modern and old Iberian wheat cultivars  ap. 169-174.  aClimate change is expected to reduce water availability in several wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growing areas. Drought, during and immediately after sowing can compromise germination, seedling development, and ultimately crop yield. Our study’s objective was to investigate early drought stress resistance and evaluate genetic diversity of four bread wheat cultivars – three modern elite germplasm lines (‘Antequera’, ‘Jordão’ and ‘Roxo’) and an ancient Portuguese cultivar (‘Mestiço’) – at five water potentials, ranging from 0 to –1.5 MPa. Germination was annotated daily during eight days. Dry and fresh weights as well as root and shoot growth were measured. Genetic variability among cultivars was evaluated using start codon targeted (SCoT) markers. Overall, when water potential was lowered, germination rate and seedling growth were delayed. Final germination percentages were only affected by the higher stress intensity. This study reinforces the importance of research into ancient wheat cultivars, such as ‘Mestiço’. This cultivar showed the highest genetic difference when compared with the remaining cultivars. ‘Mestiço’ presented the highest coleoptile size, high vigor index values, and the lowest variation in water content due to stress conditions. Therefore, it may be able to germinate in extremly dry soil and be the least affected by drought stress. Still, due to the comparatively reduced yield of older wheat cultivars, stress tolerance should be researched within elite cultivars. Among these, Jordão revealed particularly good germination and early biomass development characteristics across water potentials, presenting a likely choice for future studies under drought stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acoleoptiles 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenetic variation 3agermination 3agermplasm 3aroots 3ascreening 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil 3asowing 3astart codon 3astress tolerance 3avigor 3awater content 3awater potential 3awater stress 3awheat 0aancient wheat cultivar 0agenetic diversity1 aRocha, Luís1 aMoutinho-Pereira, José1 aLima-Brito, José1 aCorreia, Carlos0 tActa botanica Croatica.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 78, no. 2 p.169-174dSciendowJournal:J000000039x1847-84767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/botcro-2019-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009700157300001800254520179600272592002802068650001202096650001102108650001302119650001702132650001002149650001202159650002102171650002602192650001602218650001402234650001702248650000902265651001102274700001802285700002102303773009202324856007302416852000902489655001202498IND60375070520221121055916.0150820e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6037507052DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.019132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarín, Linda12aA positive association between ants and spiders and potential mechanisms driving the pattern  ap. 1078-1088.  aBiotic interactions play a central role in determining species distribution and abundance. Some ants act as keystone species affecting the distribution and abundance of other species, including spiders. In coffee plantations Pocobletus sp. spiders are significantly more abundant in coffee plants patrolled by the aggressive arboreal ants Azteca sericeasur. However, it is unknown if other ant species influence this ant–spider association, how these associates are spatially distributed, and which are the potential drivers of this association. Here we examine the influence of ants, Azteca sericeasur and Pheidole synanthropica, and coffee branch density on Pocobletus abundance in a coffee farm in southern Mexico. We also analyze the spatial distribution and abundance of Pocobletus sp., in relation to the spatial distribution of A. sericeasur and P. synanthropica. Finally, we examine prey availability and enemy‐free space as potential mechanisms underlying this ant–spider association. Results show that Pocobletus abundance is positively correlated with coffee branch density and A. sericeasur and P. synanthropica presence. Furthermore, the spatial distribution analysis shows that in 20 × 20 m plots Pocobletus is strongly associated to A. sericeasur, but not to P. synanthropica. Results show that insect abundance in both Pocobletus's webs and sticky traps was significantly higher in the presence of A. sericeasur whereas the abundance of the predators of Pocobletus decreased in A. sericeasur's presence; suggesting positive direct and indirect effects of A. sericeasur on Pocobletus. Overall, this study highlights the strong influence of ants and plant characteristics on the abundance and spatial distribution of spiders as well their indirect effects on other taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aAzteca 3aPheidole 3abiogeography 3afarms 3ainsects 3akeystone species 3aplant characteristics 3aplantations 3apredators 3asticky traps 3awebs 3aMexico1 aJackson, Doug1 aPerfecto, Ivette0 tOikos.g2015 Aug., v. 124, no. 8 p.1078-1088dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.019133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011300168300001200281520162600293592002801919650001801947650001901965650001101984650001601995650001502011650001002026650002002036650002002056650000702076650001902083650001702102650002802119650001602147650001602163650001502179650001502194651001002209700001802219700001602237700001802253700001702271700001802288700001702306700001802323700001802341700001502359773010502374856008302479852000902562655001202571IND60751335220221119173428.0220621e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075133522DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-021-03215-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xiaodong10aResveratrol improves the iron deficiency adaptation of Malus baccata seedlings by regulating iron absorption  ap. 433.  aBACKGROUND: Resveratrol (Res), a phytoalexin, has been widely reported to participate in plant resistance to fungal infections. However, little information is available on its role in abiotic stress, especially in iron deficiency stress. Malus baccata is widely used as apple rootstock in China, but it is sensitive to iron deficiency. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the role of exogenous Res in M. baccata seedings under iron deficiency stress. Results showed that applying 100 μM exogenous Res could alleviate iron deficiency stress. The seedlings treated with Res had a lower etiolation rate and higher chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate compared with the apple seedlings without Res treatment. Exogenous Res increased the iron content in the roots and leaves by inducing the expression of MbAHA genes and improving the H⁺-ATPase activity. As a result, the rhizosphere pH decreased, iron solubility increased, the expression of MbFRO2 and MbIRT1 was induced, and the ferric-chelated reductase activity was enhanced to absorb large amounts of Fe²⁺ into the root cells under iron deficiency conditions. Moreover, exogenous Res application increased the contents of IAA, ABA, and GA3 and decreased the contents of DHZR and BL for responding to iron deficiency stress indirectly. In addition, Res functioned as an antioxidant that strengthened the activities of antioxidant enzymes and thus eliminated reactive oxygen species production induced by iron deficiency stress. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol improves the iron deficiency adaptation of M. baccata seedlings mainly by regulating iron absorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus baccata 3aabiotic stress 3aapples 3achlorophyll 3aetiolation 3afungi 3airon absorption 3aoxidoreductases 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoalexins 3areactive oxygen species 3aresveratrol 3arhizosphere 3arootstocks 3asolubility 3aChina1 aChen, Huifang1 aSu, Qiufang1 aWang, Caihong1 aSha, Guangli1 aMa, Changqing1 aSun, Zhijuan1 aYang, Xueqing1 aLi, Xiangyang1 aTian, Yike0 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.433-433dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-03215-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245018800167300001600355520143700371592002801808650001701836650001801853650001301871650002501884650001701909650001201926650001501938650001001953650001501963650002401978650001802002650001102020650001802031650001402049650001802063650001002081653001402091653001802105653001802123653002402141653002502165653001802190653001302208700001602221700002502237700002102262773008602283856007602369852000902445655001202454IND60536976320221117045658.0160807e20160314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053697632DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2015-02242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerashima, Noritsugu10aMonolignol glucosides as intermediate compounds in lignin biosynthesis. Revisiting the cell wall lignification and new 13C-tracer experiments with Ginkgo biloba and Magnolialiliiflora  ap. 801-810.  aA large amount of monolignol glucosides (MLGs: p-glucocoumaryl alcohol, coniferin, syringin) are found in lignifying soft xylem near cambium and they disappear with the progress of lignification. Recently, it became a matter of debate whether those MLGs are real intermediates in lignin biosynthesis or only a storage form of monolignols outside of the main biosynthetic pathway. The latter is partly based on a misinterpretation of ¹⁴C-tracer experiments and partly on the simple generalization of the results of gene manipulation experiments concerning the flexible and complex lignification. In the present paper, it could be confirmed by the most reliable ¹³C-tracer method that MLGs are real intermediates in the pathway from l-phenylalanine to macromolecular lignin-polysaccharides complexes in the cell walls. This pathway via MLGs is essential for transport and programmed delivery of specific monolignols in a stable form from intracellular space to specific lignifying sites within the cell wall. The pool size of MLGs is large in most gymnosperm trees and some angiosperm species that emerged in an early stage of phylogeny, while the pool size is small in most angiosperms. This difference in pool size is reasonably understandable from the viewpoint of plant evolution, in the course of which the role of MLGs changed to meet variation in type of major cells, reaction wood formation, and postmortem lignification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aGinkgo biloba 3aalcohols 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acambium 3acell walls 3agenes 3aglucosides 3aintracellular space 3alignification 3alignin 3aphenylalanine 3aphylogeny 3areaction wood 3atrees 0aconiferin 0aGinkgo biloba 0alignification 0aMagnolia liliiflora 0amonolignol glucoside 0areaction wood 0asyringin1 aKo, Chisato1 aMatsushita, Yasuyuki1 aWestermark, Ulla0 tHolzforschung.g2016 Mar. 14, v. 70, no. 9 p.801-810dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2015-02243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008500176300001600261520112400277592002801401650004401429650001701473650002101490650001301511650002601524650001001550650001601560650002301576650001101599650002101610650004401631650001301675650002101688653001301709653002901722653001401751653002601765700002601791700002701817700006301844700002801907773010801935856008602043852000902129655001202138IND60616005520221121185931.0190329e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061600552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahatsapan, Nitjawan10a6-Maleimidohexanoic acid-grafted chitosan: A new generation mucoadhesive polymer  ap. 258-264.  aThis study aims to synthesize and evaluate a new generation mucoadhesive polymer, 6-maleimidohexanoic acid-grafted chitosan; MHA-CS, for transmucosal drug delivery compared with a well-known mucoadhesive polymer, Cys-CS. The successful synthesis was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weight of the synthesized polymer. The quantity of maleimide on the polymer chain as well as the mucoadhesive properties and biocompatibility of the synthesized polymers were also assessed. The results revealed that the synthesized MHA-CS demonstrated excellent mucoadhesive properties which is superior to CS and Cys-CS. The maleimide content bound to synthesized polymer was 466 μmol per gram of the polymer. The cytotoxicity test assured the low toxicity of the synthesized polymer on the normal human gingival fibroblast cells. These data support the potential of MHA-CS as a novel material for developing mucoadhesive drug delivery system with enhanced mucoadhesive properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abioadhesives 3abiocompatibility 3achitosan 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3afibroblasts 3agel chromatography 3ahumans 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 0aChitosan 0a6-Maleimidohexanoic acid 0aMaleimide 0aMucoadhesive polymers1 aRojanarata, Theerasak1 aNgawhirunpat, Tanasait1 aOpanasopit, Praneet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4878-25291 aTonglairoum, Prasopchai0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 202 p.258-264dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008000159300001800239520184000257592002802097650001902125650002402144650002602168650001302194650001902207650001602226650002302242650002802265650001302293650002102306650002502327650001702352650001302369650002202382650001002404651001202414700001802426700002902444700002602473700001702499700001902516700002102535773009202556856007302648852000902721655001202730IND60375070620221121055905.0150820e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6037507062DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.019862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeimonen, Kaisa10aColonization of a host tree by herbivorous insects under a changing climate  ap. 1013-1022.  aClimate warming has been predicted to increase the abundance of herbivorous insects. Together with concurrent poleward shifts in many insect species this may increase herbivore pressure on plants. However, the manner in which plants at higher latitudes become colonized by herbivorous insects in the future is unknown. We established a translocation experiment using 26 micropropagated silver birch Betula pendula genotypes from six populations originating from 60°N to 67°N, to study the susceptibility of the translocated birches to local herbivores. The birches were planted at three different latitudes in Finland (60°N, 62°N and 67°N). We studied the effect of source population and latitudinal translocation on herbivore density, species richness, and community composition among the genotypes growing in the same environmental conditions in two years; 2011 and 2012. The source population explained the variation in the herbivore density only in 2012, whereas latitudinal translocation did not affect herbivore density. Variation in species richness was not explained by the source population or by the latitudinal translocation. At two of the study sites, the similarity of the herbivore communities among the populations decreased with increasing latitudinal distance of the source populations, possibly because birch populations that grow geographically closer to each other are genetically more similar, and therefore support a more similar composition of the arthropod community. All birch genotypes were colonized by local herbivores, suggesting that as herbivores shift their ranges polewards, they are able to colonize novel host‐plant genotypes. This enables compositional changes in insect communities on their host plants in the future, which in turn, might affect total herbivory and eventually, plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype 3aglobal warming 3ahost plants 3ainsect communities 3ainterspecific variation 3alatitude 3amicropropagation 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aFinland1 aValtonen, Anu1 aKontunen‐Soppela, Sari1 aKeski‐Saari, Sarita1 aRousi, Matti1 aOksanen, Elina1 aRoininen, Heikki0 tOikos.g2015 Aug., v. 124, no. 8 p.1013-1022dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.019863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245014200169300001400311520112700325592002801452650001901480650001201499650001301511650001101524650001101535650001701546650000901563650001501572650001401587650001501601650001401616650001201630650000901642651001001651653001701661653001701678653001301695653001701708700001901725700001501744700001901759700001501778700001701793700001701810700001801827773011701845856008801962852000902050655001202059IND60633293620221123003610.0190410e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063329362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Chengye10aComparative analysis of heavy metal accumulation and bioindication in three seagrasses: Which species is more suitable as a bioindicator?  ap. 41-48.  aThe present study aimed to assess the utilization of three seagrasses (Zostera marina, Z. japonica, and Z. caespitosa) along the eastern coast of the Shandong Peninsula as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution. Heavy metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) were investigated in the sediments and in the aboveground and belowground tissues of seagrasses. The results show that the aboveground tissues of seagrasses accumulated higher levels of Cd and Cu (excluding Z. caespitosa), whereas other metals, such as Cr, Pb and Zn, were mainly restricted to the belowground tissues. Compared to Z. japonica and Z. caespitosa, Z. marina had a higher enrichment capacity for heavy metals. Overall, the seagrasses can reflect the levels of metals in the sediments, especially Z. marina, whose heavy metal tissue levels were significantly and positively correlated with the levels of all metals in the sediments. This study showed that Z. marina could be used as an effective bioindicator for heavy metal pollution of sediments in ecological quality monitoring programs in the future, at least in the temperate waters of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZostera marina 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoasts 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amonitoring 3apollution 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3atissues 3azinc 3aChina 0aAccumulation 0aBioindicator 0aSeagrass 0aHeavy metals1 aYang, Xiaolong1 aGao, Lijia1 aZhang, Peidong1 aLi, Wentao1 aDong, Jianyu1 aLi, Changjun1 aZhang, Xiumei0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 15, v. 669 p.41-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.4253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012400165300001600289520122100305592002801526650001501554650002201569650001901591650000801610650001801618650002001636650001101656650001301667650000701680650001501687650002201702650001301724650002301737650001201760650002001772653002301792653001901815653001501834653001201849653002001861700001701881700001601898700001101914700005301925700001601978700001601994700001702010700005502027773010802082856008602190852000902276655001202285IND60616005620221121185846.0190329e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061600562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Tao10aNatural polymer konjac glucomannan mediated assembly of graphene oxide as versatile sponges for water pollution control  ap. 425-433.  aThree-dimensional network structure of konjac glucomannan/graphene oxide (KGM/GO) sponges was successfully prepared by ice template method. The KGM/GO sponges was rich in functional groups, negatively charged under pH 2 to 10. Batch adsorption experiment was conducted to investigate the adsorption performance of the as-prepared KGM/GO sponges for organic dye (malachite green (MG)) and radionuclide (uranium U(Ⅵ)). The results showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of KGM/GO sponges were 266.97, 189.96 mg/g for U(Ⅵ) and MG, respectively. Moreover, the KGM/GO sponges exhibited an excellent selectivity for capturing U(Ⅵ) in multi-ion system. The adsorption process was fitted better to pseudo-second order model, while adsorption isotherms for these pollutants were well matched up to Langmuir models. In addition, KGM/GO sponges can be easily separated from the aqueous solution and could be effectively reused for 5 times without obvious loss in adsorption performance. The advantages of eco-friendliness, low cost, simple preparation process, controllable shape and size, as well as high adsorption capacities for MG and U(Ⅵ), suggested that KGM/GO sponges promising in water pollution control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3agraphene oxide 3aice 3akonjac mannan 3amalachite green 3amodels 3amoieties 3apH 3apollutants 3apollution control 3apolymers 3asorption isotherms 3auranium 3awater pollution 0aKonjac glucomannan 0aGraphene oxide 0aAdsorption 0aUranium 0aMalachite green1 aShi, Peiheng1 aZhang, Jian1 aLi, Yi1 aDuan, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0944-69951 aDai, Lichun1 aWang, Liang1 aYu, Xiaofang1 aZhu, Wenkun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4116-62130 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 202 p.425-433dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.08.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01959naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009000168506002800258520097800286592002801264506003701292650001801329650001101347650001101358650001501369650001301384650001201397651001801409700001801427773009601445856008301541852000901624655001201633IND60740123220221207132543.0201009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074012322DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202024000482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikhail, Lezin10aSome promising sources of expansion of the introduction potential of Prunus pumila L.  aResource is Open Access  aPrunus pumila L is an introduction species that is well cultivated in the steppe regions of Russia and is used as a rootstock for plums and apricots and less often as an independent fruit crop. The cultivation efficiency is reduced due to instability to rotting in regions with higher snow cover. The species naturally spread in North America, where it is represented by several varieties that differ in morphological characters. Representatives of var. susquehanae Willd. spread on acidic substrates and sometimes occur in wetlands and probably can increase the adaptive potential of the introduction population. According to the characteristic feature of this species is the dense short pubescence of young twigs, 2 genotypes were identified in the introduction population, probably representing descendants of var. susquehanae. These genotypes are valuable for further introduction studies in regions with problems in the cultivation of the species due to plant rotting.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrunus pumila 3aRussia 3afruits 3arootstocks 3asnowpack 3asteppes 3aNorth America1 aNikolai, Glaz0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 24 p.00048-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202024000483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245009300167300001800260520153800278592002801816650002201844650002401866650002101890650001401911650001101925650001101936650002301947650001601970650001301986650001501999650002502014700002102039700002202060700002202082700001702104700002102121773012502142856008102267852000902348655001202357IND60578910620170925000000.0170815e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057891062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b013032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZubrod, Jochen P.10aHistory Matters: Pre-Exposure to Wastewater Enhances Pesticide Toxicity in Invertebrates  ap. 9280-9287.  aDisturbance regimes determine communities’ structure and functioning. Nonetheless, little effort has been undertaken to understand interactions of press and pulse disturbances. In this context, leaf-shredding macroinvertebrates can be chronically exposed to wastewater treatment plant effluents (i.e., press disturbance) before experiencing pesticide exposure following agricultural runoff (i.e., pulse disturbance). It is assumed that wastewater pre-exposure alters animals’ sensitivity to pesticides. To test this hypothesis, we exposed model-populations of the shredder Gammarus fossarum to wastewater at three field-relevant dilution levels (i.e., 0%, 50%, and 100%). After 2, 4, and 6 weeks, survival, leaf consumption, dry weight, and energy reserves were monitored. Additionally, animals were assessed for their sensitivity toward the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid using their feeding rate as response variable. Both wastewater treatments reduced gammarids’ survival, leaf consumption, dry weight, and energy reserves. Moreover, both wastewater pre-exposure scenarios increased animals’ sensitivity toward thiacloprid by up to 2.5 times compared to the control. Our results thus demonstrate that press disturbance as posed by wastewater pre-exposure can enhance susceptibility of key players in ecosystem functioning to further (pulse) disturbances. Therefore, applying mitigation measures such as advanced treatment technologies seems sensible to support functional integrity in the multiple-stress situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammarus fossarum 3aagricultural runoff 3achronic exposure 3aeffluents 3aenergy 3aleaves 3amacroinvertebrates 3athiacloprid 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aEnglert, Dominic1 aLüderwald, Simon1 aPoganiuch, Sandra1 aSchulz, Ralf1 aBundschuh, Mirco0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 51, no. 16 p.9280-9287dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.7b013033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012900172300001600301506002800317520188800345592002802233506003702261650001502298650001802313650002402331650001702355650001702372650001502389650001502404650002002419650001702439650002402456650001102480650001002491650001302501650001302514650001502527653001102542653001402553653002002567653001602587700001802603773016102621856008502782852000902867655001202876IND60740123420221207132551.0210403e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074012342DNAL7 a10.22077/jhpr.2020.3343.11422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaadati, Mohammad10aEffects of chlorpyriphos on the alpha-amylase activity in the in vivo and in vitro conditions: Case study: Sitophilus oryzea  ap. 189-198.  aResource is Open Access  aPurpose: Insect-insecticide interaction, as a dynamic system, increases our knowledge to improve chemical application. Although modes of action in the most insecticides is obvious (direct action) but the other targets which may be affected after treatment are not determined (indirect action). In this study digestive enzymes were considered as potential targets for insecticides. Research method: Some of (three sample) adults that were exposed to the different insecticide concentrations were selected for in vivo analysis. In this part, internal organs (midgut) were homogenates and enzyme activity was determined. On the other hand, in the in vitro assays, nontoxic adults were selected and after dissection of the guts, incubated to the different insecticide manually. Fifty microliters enzyme solution with 450 μl toxic solutions incubated 30 min in the room temperature before enzyme assay. Findings: Twenty hours after exposure to the insecticides, gut of adults were dissected and used for in vivo experiment. Our data showed that there was a significant difference in the enzyme activity among different concentrations of chlorpyriphos. The highest and lowest level of enzyme inhibitory was occurred in the 2000 and 0 ppm (control). There was no significant difference between control (0 ppm) and 300 ppm. Data in the in vitro experiment showed that enzyme activity was reduced in the toxic concentrations. Trend of enzyme inhibiting that occurred with chlorpyriphos was regular as the highest and lowest inhibiting were observed in the maximum (99.2 %) and minimum concentrations (7.4 %), respectively. Limitations: There is a problem in which how to correlate in vivo and in vitro results to practical toxicology. Originality/Value: Using of new insecticides with new and widespread mode of action can be recommended against postharvest pest in the practical entomology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSitophilus 3aalpha-amylase 3aambient temperature 3acase studies 3achlorpyrifos 3adissection 3aentomology 3aenzyme activity 3ahorticulture 3amechanism of action 3amidgut 3apests 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aenzyme 0ainhibitor 0apest management 0astored pest1 aRafiei, Zahra0 tJournal of horticulture and postharvest research.g2021 June, v. 4, no.

Surprisingly, photo dissociation of the uncharged carbon monoxide results in generation of a small-amplitude electric potential with the same sign as the physiological charge separation during activity. The number of electrogenic events after CO photolysis depends on the state of the enzyme. CO photolysis following immediately after activation by an enzymatic turnover, showed a two-component potential development. A fast (~1.5μs) phase was followed by slower potential generation with a time constant varying from 8μs at pH 7 to 250μs at pH 10. The amplitude of the fast phase was independent of the time of incubation after enzyme activation, whereas the slower phase vanished with a time constant of ~25min. CO photolysis from enzyme that had not undergone a prior single turnover showed the fast phase, but the amplitude of the slow phase was reduced to 10–30%. The amplitude of the fast phase corresponds to charge movement of 0.83Å perpendicular to the membrane dielectric, and is independent of the time after enzyme activation. Thus it can be used as an internal ruler for normalization of the electrogenic responses of CcO. The slow phase was absent in the K354M mutant with a blocked proton-conducting K channel. We propose that CO photolysis increases the pK of the K354 residue, which results in its partial protonation, and generation of electric potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParacoccus denitrificans 3acarbon monoxide 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adissociation 3aenzyme activation 3amutants 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphotolysis 3apotassium channels1 aBelevich, Ilya1 aVerkhovsky, Michael I.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Feb., v. 1817, no. 2 p.269-275dElsevier B.V.x0005-27287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01690naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003300143245007900176300001600255520081000271592002801081653001301109653001901122653002101141653002401162653001701186773012301203856007701326852000901403655001201412IND60536972720221117045420.0160807e20160726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053697272DNAL7 a10.1515/bog-2016-00392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerwe, Clinton David van der10aTourist guides’ perceptions of cultural heritage tourism in South Africa  ap. 117-130.  aHeritage tourism is a fast growing niche of cultural tourism worldwide. In Africa, several countries, including South Africa, place great emphasis on the growth of heritage tourism because of its potential for local economic development. Cultural and heritage tourism are being advocated as an important niche within the South African economy. This paper explores the perceptions of cultural heritage tourist guides in South Africa towards heritage tourism, it is argued that the country’s National Department of Tourism must improve the poor governance and poor management of South African heritage assets, and enhance the preservation, transformation and segmented marketing of South Africa’s cultural assets (at all levels of government) in order to sustain and grow cultural tourism in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 0acultural 0atourist guides 0aheritage tourism 0asustainable tourism 0aSouth Africa0 tBulletin of Geography.

CNDE is a modification based on neutralization dialysis. It was found that a higher NaCl concentration led to a higher open-circuit potential when the concentrations of acid and alkaline solutions were fixed. Upon closing of the circuit, the membrane potential was used as a driving force to move counter ions into the electrical double layers at the electrode–liquid interface, thereby creating an ionic current. Correspondingly, in the external circuit, electrons flow through an external resistor from one electrode to the other, thereby generating electrical energy directly. The influence of external resistances was studied to achieve greater energy extraction, with the maximum output of 110 mW/m² obtained by employing an external resistance of 5 Ω together with the AC-coated electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3adialysis 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aions 3amembrane potential 3aneutralization 3asodium chloride 3awastes1 aZhang, Yi1 aOu-Yang, Wei1 aBastos Sales, Bruno1 aSun, Zhuo1 aLiu, Fei1 aZhao, Ran0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 51, no. 16 p.9363-9370dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.7b014263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009100207300001600298500001900314520146000333592002801793596003801821650001101859650002501870650001901895650002001914650002301934650003001957650001101987650002201998650001402020700006302034700002102097700001402118700001602132773011402148856008202262852000902344655001202353IND60683304320221118002018.0200207e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068330432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-020-04595-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarios, Eugenio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4501-465210aPopulation projections of an endangered cactus suggest little impact of climate change  ap. 439-448.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPopulation projections coupled with downscaled climate projections are a powerful tool that allows predicting future population dynamics of vulnerable plants in the face of a changing climate. Traditional approaches used to predict the vulnerability of plants to climate change (e.g. species distribution models) fail to mechanistically describe the basis of a population’s dynamics and thus cannot be expected to correctly predict its temporal trends. In this study, we used a 23-year demographic dataset of the acuña cactus, an endangered species, to predict its population dynamics to the end of the century. We used integral projection models to describe its vital rates and population dynamics in relation to plant volume and key climatic variables. We used the resulting climate-driven IPM along with climatic projections to predict the population growth rates from 1991 to 2099. We found the average population growth rate of this population between 1991 and 2013 to be 0.70 (95% CI 0.61–0.79). This result confirms that the population of acuña cactus has been declining and that this decline is due to demographic structure and climate conditions. However, the projection model also predicts that, up to 2080, the population will remain relatively stable mainly due to the survival of its existing adult individuals. Notwithstanding, the long-term viability of the populations can only be achieved through the recruitment of new individuals.  aPublisher supplied data  aP16AC01027cNational Park Service 3aadults 3acacti and succulents 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aendangered species 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3aviability1 aGonzález, Edgar J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9113-10701 aRosen, Philip C.1 aPate, Ami1 aHolm, Peter0 tOecologia.g2020 Feb., v. 192, no. 2 p.439-448dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04595-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245010500207300001800312506007600330520216700406592002802573506003702601650001002638650001302648650000902661650001202670650001002682650001202692650001602704700002302720700002202743700002802765700001602793700002002809773011402829856007902943852000903022655001203031IND60375065920221207094909.0150820e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6037506592DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.123772doi7 aPMC45570592pmcid7 a258505642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaquet, Matthieu10aAntagonistic effect of helpers on breeding male and female survival in a cooperatively breeding bird  ap. 1354-1362.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCooperatively breeding species are typically long lived and hence, according to theory, are expected to maximize their lifetime reproductive success through maximizing survival. Under these circumstances, the presence of helpers could be used to lighten the effort of current reproduction for parents to achieve higher survival. In addition, individuals of different sexes and ages may follow different strategies, but whether male and female breeders and individuals of different ages benefit differently from the presence of helpers has often been overlooked. Moreover, only one study that investigated the relationship between parental survival and the presence of helpers used capture–mark–recapture analyses (CMR). These methods are important since they allow us to account for the non‐detection of individuals that are alive in the population but not detected, and thus, the effects on survival and recapture probability to be disentangled. Here, we used multi‐event CMR methods to investigate whether the number of helpers was associated with an increase in survival probability for male and female breeders of different ages in the sociable weaver Philetairus socius. In this species, both sexes reduce their feeding rate in the presence of helpers. We therefore predicted that the presence of helpers should increase the breeders' survival in both sexes, especially early in life when individuals potentially have more future breeding opportunities. In addition, sociable weaver females reduce their investment in eggs in the presence of helpers, so we predicted a stronger effect of helpers on female than male survival. As expected we found that females had a higher survival probability when breeding with more helpers. Unexpectedly, however, male survival probability decreased with increasing number of helpers. This antagonistic effect diminished as the breeders grew older. These results illustrate the complexity of fitness costs and benefits underlying cooperative behaviours and how these may vary with the individuals' sex and age. They also highlight the need for further studies on the sex‐specific effects of helpers on survival.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abirds 3abreeding 3aeggs 3afemales 3amales 3aparents 3aprobability1 aDoutrelant, Claire1 aHatchwell, Ben J.1 aSpottiswoode, Claire N.1 aCovas, Rita1 aGriffith, Simon0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2015 Sept., v. 84, no. 5 p.1354-1362dBlackwell Scientific Publ.x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.123773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245008300207300001800290520172700308592002802035596006602063596008102129650001402210650001902224650001602243650002502259650002302284650000902307650001102316650002202327650001302349650001302362650001202375700003202387700002202419700003102441700002202472700002102494700001902515700002002534773012502554856008302679852000902762655001202771IND60718074420221119053623.0211001e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071807442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05940-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseini, Vahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1422-235512aA mechanical non-enzymatic method for isolation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts  ap. 8881-8890.  aMouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) accessibility coupled with their simple generation make them as a typical embryonic cell model and feeder layer for in vitro expansion of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). In this study, a mechanical isolation technique was adopted to isolate MEFs and the efficiency of this technique was compared with enzymatic digestion method. The suspended MEFs were prepared either by mechanical method or 0.25% trypsin enzymatic digestion. The effect of tissue processing on cell apoptosis/necrosis, morphology, viable cell yield, population doubling time, surface marker expression, and the capacity to support PSCs were determined. The mechanical method yielded a significantly higher number of viable cells. However, it showed similar morphology and proliferation characteristics as compared to enzymatic digestion. The mechanical method induced slight apoptosis in MEFs; however, it did not exert the necrotic effect of trypsinization. Treatment of tissue slurry with trypsin solution caused cell lysis and subsequently cell clump formation. Mechanically isolated cells exhibited a higher expression of the MEF surface antigens Sca1, CD106, and CD105. The PSCs on mechanically isolated MEFs displayed a higher expression of pluripotency genes, and formed more compact colonies with a stronger tendency to crowding compared with those cultured on cells isolated by enzymatic digestion. The mechanical method based on tissue inter-syringe processing is relatively a rapid and simple method for MEF isolation. Compared to the enzymatic digestion, the cells obtained from this method show higher expression of embryonic fibroblasts markers and a more functional capacity in supporting PSCs culture.  aPublisher supplied data  aIR.TBZMED.REC.95/2-5/6cTabriz University of Medical Sciences  aIR.TBZMED.REC.1395.680cIranian Council of Stem Cell Research and Technology 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3afibroblasts 3aisolation techniques 3amechanical methods 3amice 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3anecrosis 3aslurries 3atrypsin1 aKalantary-Charvadeh, Ashkan1 aHasegawa, Kouichi1 aNazari Soltan Ahmad, Saeed1 aRahbarghazi, Reza1 aMahdizadeh, Amir1 aDarabi, Masoud1 aTotonchi, Mehdi0 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 Nov., v. 47, no. 11 p.8881-8890dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05940-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245016200166300001600328520135100344592002801695650002201723650002001745650001301765650001101778650001201789650001701801650001801818650001701836650001301853650001901866650001801885650001001903650001501913650001101928653002901939653003501968653002802003700002002031700001802051773011002069856008302179852000902262655001202271IND60721367720221120215849.0201224e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072136772DNAL7 a10.5958/j.0976-4763.3.2.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Preeti10aEvaluation of a Minimal Energy-Dependent Technique for Preparation of Ailanthus excelsa Hemicellulose Acid Hydrolysate Fermentable by Schefferomyces stipitis  ap. 103-111.  aA low-energy-dependent sustainable technique for the preparation of hemicellulose hydrolysate from the wood chip of low input and less care-demanding tree, Ailanthus excelsa Roxb., involving two-stage dilute acid hydrolysis technique followed by fermentation by pentose (PS)-fermenting yeast, Schefferomyces stipitis (NCIM 3507), was standardised. The main parameters optimised were acid concentration and heating period. The maximum sugar yield was obtained by hydrolysis with 10% (v/v) sulphuric acid applying pressure at 120°C for 4 min. The hydrolysate thus obtained and treated (treated hemicellulose acid pre-hydrolysate (THAP) with lime and sodium sulphite, however, could not be fermented with S. stipitis, indicating the presence of inhibitors in intolerable concentration. Though it contained lesser sugars, the hydrolysate obtained with 1% acid and treated as above (THAP) could be easily fermented by yeast. Ethanol yield as a result of fermentation of hydrolysate medium containing 40, 50 and 70% of THAP was 8.47, 6.28 and 5.09 g/l, respectively, after 120 h. This paper highlights the use of woody material, A. excelsa, a fast-growing tree adapted for marginal land, as a source of hemicellulose acid hydrolysate fermentable by S. stipitis by applying modified two-stage dilute acid hydrolysis technique with minimal energy input.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAilanthus excelsa 3aacid hydrolysis 3abiofuels 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afermentation 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysates 3apentoses 3asodium sulfite 3asulfuric acid 3atrees 3awood chips 3ayeasts 0aScheffersomyces stipitis 0aHemicellulose acid hydrolysate 0aLignocellulosic ethanol1 aSingh, Ravinder1 aSahay, Sanjay0 tJournal of Biofuels.g2012 July, v. 3, no. 2 p.103-111dIndianJournals.comwJournal:2210x0976-47637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/j.0976-4763.3.2.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001900158245016800177300001600345520106500361592002801426650002601454650002801480650002901508650001101537650002301548650001301571650001801584650002801602650005201630650002401682650003101706650002801737650004501765650007501810650003001885650003901915650005301954650003602007700002102043700001602064700001902080700001802099700002002117700002202137700001702159700002002176700001802196773009302214856004002307852000902347655001202356IND50072182820221119055555.0140123e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007218282DNAL7 a239058452pmid7 a10.1111/asj.120982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakagi, Shiaki10aSusceptibility difference between methicillin‐susceptible and methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus to a bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (BMAP‐28)  ap. 174-179.  aA bovine myeloid antimicrobial peptide antimicrobial peptide (BMAP‐28) is a member of the cathelicidin family and acts as a component of innate immunity. There are few reports of susceptibility difference of methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and susceptible strains (MSSA) against BMAP‐28. This study aims to clarify how a few amino acid substitutions of BMAP‐28 are related to its antimicrobial activity using four analog peptides of BMAP‐28. We also compared cellular fatty acid components of MSSA and MRSA using gas chromatography. We found that a few amino acid substitutions of BMAP‐28 do not change antimicrobial activity. It was also revealed that the percentage of cis‐11‐eicosenoic acid in total detected fatty acids of MRSA was significantly higher than that of MSSA. In addition, the percentage of palmitic acid in total detected fatty acids of MRSA tended to be lower than that of MSSA. Our results will provide new information to deal with the question of differences in bacterial susceptibility against BMAP‐28.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aamino acid substitution 3aantimicrobial properties 3acattle 3agas chromatography 3aimmunity 3apalmitic acid 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aChromatography, Gas 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxmetabolism 2aMethicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPalmitic Acidxmetabolism 2aProteinsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aNishimura, Junko1 aBai, Lanlan1 aMiyagi, Hikaru1 aKuroda, Kengo1 aHayashi, Shunji1 aYoneyama, Hiroshi1 aAndo, Tasuke1 aIsogai, Hiroshi1 aIsogai, Emiko0 tAnimal science journal =.g2014 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.174-179dBlackwellx1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.12098  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013000171300001600301520179900317592002802116650002202144650001202166650001202178650001402190650002502204650001902229650001502248650001102263650001102274650001702285650001002302650001102312650001002323650001402333650001302347650001702360653001202377653001202389653001002401653001702411653001902428700001602447700001702463700001902480700001702499700001802516700002002534700002002554773011902574856008802693852000902781655001202790IND60633290920221122101344.0191214e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063329092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.3942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Gao Ling10aAccumulation and distribution of arsenic and cadmium in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at different developmental stages  ap. 532-539.  aArsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) are known to be toxic to humans, and elevated concentrations have been documented in food crops worldwide. However, little is known regarding their uptake, translocation, and distribution in wheat plants during plant development. A series of experiments were conducted to investigate the spatial distribution and dynamics of As and Cd in two wheat cultivars (cv. JN12 and JM85; the latter is a low grain Cd accumulator) at different developmental stages. Root concentrations of As decreased by 84%, and those of Cd by 67%, from tillering to maturity. In contrast, As concentrations in the stems increased 3.1-fold. A significant decrease in root As accumulation was observed at the mature stage, whereas root Cd accumulation decreased largely at the elongation stage. The concentrations of Cd in all leaves and As in new leaves increased as plant growth advanced. However, As concentrations in old leaves decreased significantly from grain filling to maturity. In both cultivars, the upward transfer toward younger parts of shoots was greater in the case of Cd than of As. The remobilization of As and Cd from stems and roots differed between the two cultivars. Arsenic concentrations in rachis, glumes, and grain in JM85 were significantly higher than those in JN12, whereas As concentrations in roots and stems did not differ between the cultivars. Grain Cd was significantly higher in JN12 than in JM85, but Cd concentrations in rachis and glumes were similar between the cultivars. The difference in grain Cd concentration between the two cultivars depended on root and stem Cd remobilization and redistribution from rachis to glumes and grain; in contrast, accumulation of As in grain was influenced by As remobilization from the leaves and stem to the spike.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3afilling period 3afood crops 3ahumans 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3aroots 3ashoots 3astems 3atillering 3atoxicity 3awinter wheat 0aArsenic 0aCadmium 0aWheat 0aGrowth stage 0aRemobilization1 aLi, Dao Jun1 aWang, Susan,1 aLiu, Chang Hao1 aHu, Zhu Bing1 aLou, Lai Qing1 aRengel, Zdenko,1 aCai, Qing Sheng0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 01, v. 667 p.532-539dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.3943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245016500157300001600322520146900338592002801807650001601835650001901851650001401870650001801884650002001902650001701922650002101939650001001960650001301970650001701983650003402000650001102034650001702045650001602062650002402078650001102102650002002113700001802133700001902151700001602170773019202186856007302378852000902451655001202460IND60163138720221118220352.0150530e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6016313872DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.128462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Huadong10aEnzyme activities of Arabidopsis inositol polyphosphate kinases AtIPK2α and AtIPK2β are involved in pollen development, pollen tube guidance and embryogenesis  ap. 758-771.  aInositol polyphosphate kinase (IPK2) is a key component of inositol polyphosphate signaling. There are two highly homologous inositol polyphosphate kinases (AtIPK2α and AtIPK2β) in Arabidopsis. Previous studies that overexpressed or reduced the expression of AtIPK2α and AtIPK2β revealed their roles in auxiliary shoot branching, abiotic stress responses and root growth. Here, we report that AtIPK2α and AtIPK2β act redundantly during pollen development, pollen tube guidance and embryogenesis. Single knock‐out mutants of atipk2α and atipk2β were indistinguishable from the wild type, whereas the atipk2α atipk2β double mutant could not be obtained. Detailed genetic and cytological investigations showed that the mutation of AtIPK2α and AtIPK2β resulted in severely reduced transmission of male gametophyte as a result of abnormal pollen development and defective pollen tube guidance. In addition, the early embryo development of the atipk2α atipk2β double mutant was also aborted. Expressing either catalytically inactive or substrate specificity‐altered variants of AtIPK2β could not rescue the male gametophyte and embryogenesis defects of the atipk2α atipk2β double mutant, implying that the kinase activity of AtIPK2 is required for pollen development, pollen tube guidance and embryogenesis. Taken together, our results provide genetic evidence for the requirement of inositol polyphosphate signaling in plant sexual reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabiotic stress 3abranching 3aembryogenesis 3aenzyme activity 3agametophytes 3aknockout mutants 3amales 3amutation 3amyo-inositol 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3aroot growth 3asexual reproduction 3ashoots 3astress response1 aZhong, Yujiao1 aYang, Zhongnan1 aXia, Huijun0 tplant journal.g2015 June, v. 82, no. 5 p.758-771dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.128463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04020naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245019600211300001600407520223700423592002802660650002302688650001402711650002102725650002002746650002102766650001702787650001802804650001802822650000802840650001502848650002402863650002002887650001602907650002302923650001702946653002202963653002102985653002003006653001403026653000803040653000803048653000803056653000803064653001003072653000703082653001003089653001303099653001003112700006003122700002203182700002403204773011003228856008303338852000903421655001203430IND60696987120221122172506.0201223e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069698712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2020.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaguley, Brenton J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3974-810710aMediterranean-style dietary pattern improves cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in men with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy: A pilot randomised control trial  ap. 245-254.  aCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a prevalent and persistent symptom from androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer. The Mediterranean-style dietary pattern (MED-diet) offers a plausible mechanism to mitigate CRF through reducing inflammation and improving body composition. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 12-week MED-diet, compared to usual care, on CRF and quality of life in men with prostate cancer treated with ADT.Twenty-three men (65.9 ± 7.8 years; body mass index: 29.6 ± 2.7 kg/m²; ADT duration: 33.8 ± 35.6 months) receiving ADT for ≥3 months were randomly assigned (1:1) to 12-weeks of usual care or the MED-diet involving six individualised nutrition consults. Primary outcomes included CRF [Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale (FACIT-F) and quality of life [FACIT-General (FACIT-G)], secondary outcomes included body mass/composition and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 concentrations measured at baseline, 8-weeks and 12 weeks. Intervention feasibility was measured by intervention safety, study completion rate, consult attendance, and adherence to the MED-diet through the Mediterranean-diet adherence screener (MEDAS). Intention to treat linear mixed models were used to determine changes in outcomes between the MED-diet and usual care at baseline, 8-weeks and 12-weeks.The MED-diet improved CRF (FACIT-F) at 8-weeks [+4.8 (0.0, 9.8); P = 0.05] and 12-weeks [+7.2 (2.2, 12.0); P = 0.005], quality of life (FACIT-G) at 12-weeks [+9.2 (2.7, 15.8); P = 0.006], reduced total body mass at 8-weeks [−2.51 kg (−4.25, −0.78); P = 0.005] and 12-weeks [-2.97 kg (−4.71, −1.25); P = 0.001], lean mass at 8-weeks [−1.50 kg (−2.91, −0.10); P = 0.036], and IL-8 at 8-weeks [-0.18 ng/ml (−0.34, −0.02); P = 0.029] compared to usual care. The MED-diet demonstrated zero adverse events, 91% study completion, 100% attendance, and 81% adherence to the MEDAS.The MED-diet is safe and feasible, and has the potential to improve CRF and quality of life in overweight men treated with ADT compared to usual care. Further exploration of the MED-diet is warranted in a larger powered sample size to consolidate these findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aandrogens 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3achronic diseases 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amen 3aoverweight 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aquality of life 3asample size 3astatistical models 3atherapeutics 0aDiet intervention 0aCancer survivors 0aProstate cancer 0aNutrition 0aADT 0aAPD 0aBMI 0aCRF 0aFACIT 0aIL 0aMEDAS 0aMED-diet 0aSF-361 aSkinner, Tina L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5704-27411 aJenkins, David G.1 aWright, Olivia R.L.0 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.245-254dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009900172300001600271520131600287592002801603650001801631650002001649650001001669650001501679650002101694650001201715650001501727650001001742650001301752650002301765650002001788653001401808653002701822653001501849653002001864653001801884653002301902653002401925653002501949700001701974700002201991700002402013773015002037856008602187852000902273655001202282IND60532245120221123003912.0190214e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053224512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Michael P.14aThe active nightlife of diurnal birds: extraterritorial forays and nocturnal activity patterns  ap. 175-184.  aMost birds are socially monogamous, diurnally active and have small home ranges. These birds occasionally undertake extraterritorial forays, presumably to seek extrapair copulations. We used automated radiotelemetry to examine nocturnal forays and activity of a diurnal, socially monogamous passerine, the yellow-breasted chat, Icterina virens. Males and females forayed during both day and night, but night forays were more common. In addition to varying between day and night, there were sex- and breeding-stage-specific differences in foraying behaviour. Males forayed more than females and more frequently when their female was not fertile. Conversely, females primarily forayed when fertile. We suggest that females foray at night to avoid detection, because their mate's knowledge of potential extrapair copulations may result in harassment or decreased parental care. Both sexes were nocturnally active; however, the activity of males peaked when their mates were fertile, probably to prevent their mates from foraying and guarding them from foraying males. The nocturnal behaviour of chats suggest that extraterritorial forays may be more common than previously thought and that nocturnal behaviours may be crucial for understanding the strategies males and females use to acquire extrapair copulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3aanimal behavior 3abirds 3acopulation 3adiurnal activity 3afemales 3ahome range 3amales 3amonogamy 3anocturnal activity 3aradio telemetry 0acuckoldry 0aextraterritorial foray 0ahome range 0aIcterina virens 0amate guarding 0anocturnal activity 0anocturnal movements 0ayellow-breasted chat1 aAlessi, Mark1 aBenson, Thomas J.1 aChiavacci, Scott J.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2014 Feb., v. 88 p.175-184dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245013300169500002900302520159400331592002801925650002601953650002601979650001302005650001102018650001802029650001502047700002602062700002302088700004102111773012102152856007502273852000902348655001202357IND60718820820221118062936.0201126e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071882082DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101120562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharatsari, Chrysanthi 10aExtension and Advisory Organizations on the Road to the Digitalization of Animal Farming: An Organizational Learning Perspective  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aAgricultural digitalization emerged as a radical innovation, punctuating the gradual evolution of the agrifood sector and having the potential to fundamentally restructure the context within which extension and advisory organizations operate. Digital technologies are expected to alter the practice and culture of animal farming in the future. To suit the changing environmental conditions, organizations can make minor adjustments or can call into question their purposes, belief systems, and operating paradigms. Each pattern of change is associated with different types of organizational learning. In this conceptual article, adopting an organizational learning perspective and building upon organizational change models, we present two potential change and learning pathways that extension and advisory organizations can follow to cope with digitalization: morphostasis and morphogenesis. Morphostatic change has a transitional nature and helps organizations survive by adapting to the new environmental conditions. Organizations that follow this pathway learn by recognizing and correcting errors. This way, they increase their competence in specific services and activities. Morphogenetic change, on the other hand, occurs when organizations acknowledge the need to move beyond existing operating paradigms, redefine their purposes, and explore new possibilities. By transforming themselves, organizations learn new ways to understand and interpret contextual cues. We conclude by presenting some factors that explain extension and advisory organizations’ tendency to morphostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3afarmed animal species 3alearning 3amodels 3amorphogenesis 3atechnology1 aD.

Accordingly, the present study was conducted to investigate the distribution of male and female foals in the left and right ovaries in Thoroughbred mares. To do so, data associated with sex of foals, side of ovulation, stallion ID, and age and parity of mares at conception were collected from four horse centers. In total, data consisted of 238 birth records from 238 dams and 23 sires. Data were analyzed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The incidence of left and right ovulations were 51.3% (122/238) and 48.7% (116/238), respectively, which were not different (P > .05). Secondary sex ratio (SSR; the proportion of male foals at birth) in nulliparous mares (29/83, 34.9%) was lower than that in parous mares (82/155, 52.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.388; P = .005). Moreover, conception of oocyte ovulated from the left ovary resulted in higher proportion of males (70/122, 57.4%) than conception of oocyte ovulated from the right ovary (41/116, 35.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 3.636; P < .0001). Secondary sex ratio of right-sided ovulation was lower than the expected 50.0% SSR (odds ratio, 0.547; P = .026), but SSR of left-sided ovulation and overall SSR (111/238, 46.6%) did not differ from the expected 50.0% SSR (P > .05). In conclusion, the present study showed dissimilar distribution of male and female foals for left and right ovulations in ovaries of Thoroughbred mares. Moreover, the results indicated the effect of parity on the proportion of male foals in equine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThoroughbred 3aconception 3afoals 3amares 3aodds ratio 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aregression analysis 3asex ratio 3asires 3astallions 0aMare 0aSide of ovulation 0aSecondary sex ratio1 aGharagozlou, Faramarz1 aAkbarinejad, Vahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6979-28221 aYoussefi, Reza0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2015 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.31-35dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008100160520109000241592002801331650001501359650002201374650002201396650001301418650001101431650001701442650001601459651001601475700002401491700002701515773011801542856007301660852000901733655001201742IND60653554220221122031238.0190714e20190509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065355422DNAL7 a10.3390/w110509692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlamian, Rezvan 10aMulti-Objective Optimization of a Pitch Point Absorber Wave Energy Converter  aIn this paper, a pitch point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) is selected in order to be optimized for the wave characteristics of the Caspian Sea. The optimization process is a multi-objective optimization. For achieving the optimal WEC, mean absorbed power should be maximized while the construction cost should be minimized. The submerged surface area of the WEC is selected as a cost parameter. The amount of mean absorbed power depends on the installation site and also the shape of the WEC. For optimizing the shape of the WEC, various shapes are considered which are categorized into three different sections. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is used for optimization of the model, and the NEMOH software is used to simulate the wave-body interaction. The results show that the bottom flat and upside chamfered geometry with X:Y ratio of 10:1 is the best geometry for the desired application. Comparing the results from the final optimized shape with the optimized basic parallelepipedic hull shape reveals that much more extractable power can be achieved with less cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aenergy conversion 3ageometry 3amodels 3asurface area 3awater power 3aCaspian Sea1 aShafaghat, Rouzbeh 1 aSafaei, Mohammad  Reza0 tWater.g2019 May 09, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110509693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245009700187300001800284520121300302592002801515650001301543650001401556650001401570650001401584650002201598650001301620650001101633650001501644650003601659650002801695650005601723650001401779650001501793650002301808650003801831650002401869650002301893700002201916700002201938773011301960856005502073852000902128655001202137IND4465569220221119231602.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446556922DNAL7 a218959102pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02547.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalter, Ian14aThe effect of inorganic particle concentration on bacteria–virus–nanoflagellate dynamics  ap. 2768-2777.  aThe effect of inorganic particle concentrations on bacteria–virus–nanoflagellate dynamics in an oligotrophic coastal system was investigated using a model aluminosilicate, kaolinite, with a modal size of 2.1 µm. Virus‐only, bacteria‐only and bacteria–virus–nanoflagellate incubations were carried out at increasing kaolinite concentrations to elucidate the microbial response. The sorption of bacteria and viruses to kaolinite particles was negligible over a concentration range of 1–50 mg l−1. In contrast, the abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates was negatively correlated with kaolinite concentrations following both 48 and 96 h incubations. Calculated nanoflagellate bacterial ingestion rates were reduced by 5–35% depending on kaolinite particle concentration. In the bacteria–virus–nanoflagellate incubations viral production increased by 56 × 103 to 104 × 103 VLPs ml−1 h−1 as a function of kaolinite particle concentration. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the interaction of microbial populations with inorganic particles can shift the balance between protist and virally mediated mortality of marine heterotrophic prokaryotes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3aingestion 3akaolinite 3amortality 3aprokaryotic cells 3asorption 3avirion 2aAbsorption 2aBacteriaxmetabolismxvirology. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDinoflagellidaxmicrobiologyxphysiologyxvirology. 2aEcosystem 2aFood Chain 2aKaolinxmetabolism 2aSeawaterxmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aVirusesxmetabolism 2aWater Microbiology1 aBöttjer, Daniela1 aChristaki, Urania0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2011 Oct., v. 13, no. 10 p.2768-2777dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02547.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245010700180300001600287520139000303592002801693650001501721650001201736650001101748650002301759650002801782650001701810650000901827650001201836650001401848650001401862650001201876650002101888650000701909650003901916650001701955650002701972650001301999650002602012650001602038650001602054650002202070650000902092653002102101653001202122653002202134653001902156653002002175700002602195773011602221856008602337852000902423655001202432IND60556886620221120041643.0170709e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055688662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlajuyigbe, Folasade M.10aBiochemical characterization of an extremely stable pH-versatile laccase from Sporothrix carnis CPF-05  ap. 535-543.  aFunctionality of enzymes within narrow pH range and temperature is a major challenge which limits their industrial applications, hence, there is need to search for thermostable pH-versatile enzymes. Here, a novel thermostable pH-versatile laccase from Sporothrix carnis CPF-05 was purified by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) confirmed homogeneity of the enzyme with molecular weight of 56kDa. Enzyme yield was 3.9% and purification fold was 2.84. Purified laccase exhibited optimum activity at 50°C and retained 56% of its initial activity at 80°C after 180min of incubation with 2,2′ azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as substrate. The enzyme had optimum pH of 7.0 and was stable over pH range of 3.0 to 11.0. Laccase activity was enhanced by Cu2+ and Mn2+ ions but inhibited by Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+and Hg2+ ions. Purified laccase was mildly inhibited by urea, sodium azide and surfactants while exhibiting tolerance to organic solvents. The enzyme demonstrated broad substrate specificity. Kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax of the purified laccase for ABTS were 0.0316mM and 7.940mM/min, respectively. Thermostability, pH-versatility and other characteristics of laccase from S. carnis CPF-05 indicate its suitability for variety of industrial processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSporothrix 3acalcium 3acopper 3agel chromatography 3aindustrial applications 3aion exchange 3aions 3alaccase 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amercury 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asodium azide 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolvents 3asubstrate specificity 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aurea 0aCharacterization 0aLaccase 0aSporothrix carnis 0apH-versatility 0aThermostability1 aFatokun, Cornelius O.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Jan., v. 94 p.535-543dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.10.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01907naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245006700210300001400277520088000291592002801171653001201199653001001211653002101221653001701242653001201259653001601271700002601287700002201313773014301335856008201478852000901560655001201569IND60554820220221121133914.0161025e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055482022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jshs.2013.10.0022doi7 aPMC47010432pmcid7 a267446332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, Judy A.10aPreventing falls with Tai Ji Quan: A public health perspective  ap. 21-26.  aFalls among people aged 65 and older are a significant public health problem and one that is expected to increase as the population ages. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that Tai Ji Quan can reduce falls and associated injuries among older adults. In this paper, we describe how Tai Ji Quan community programs are being utilized by public health and aging services organizations to reduce older adult falls. We conclude that, to have a population-level impact on reducing falls and improving the health of older adults, Tai Ji Quan interventions must be translated into community programs that meet the needs and abilities of older adults. These programs must be adapted to fit into existing community structures, disseminated through multiple delivery channels, adopted and implemented broadly by organizations, and institutionalized to ensure sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 0aElderly 0aFalls 0aFalls prevention 0aOlder adults 0aTai Chi 0aTai Ji Quan1 aVoukelatos, Alexander1 aEhrenreich, Heidi0 tJournal of Sport and Health Science.g2014 Mar., v. 3 p.21-26dElsevier B.V.aShanghai University of SportwJournal:23381x2095-25467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245012200152300001600274520138600290592002801676650002501704650001701729650001001746650001001756650001601766650002001782650002201802650001201824650001901836650002201855650001501877650002701892700002001919773019201939856007302131852000902204655001202213IND60163149620221120193314.0150530e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6016314962DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.128452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jun12aA land plant‐specific thylakoid membrane protein contributes to photosystem II maintenance in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 731-743.  aThe structure and function of photosystem II (PSII) are highly susceptible to photo‐oxidative damage induced by high‐fluence or fluctuating light. However, many of the mechanistic details of how PSII homeostasis is maintained under photoinhibitory light remain to be determined. We describe an analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At5g07020, which encodes an unannotated integral thylakoid membrane protein. Loss of the protein causes altered PSII function under high‐irradiance light, and hence it is named ‘Maintenance of PSII under High light 1’ (MPH1). The MPH1 protein co‐purifies with PSII core complexes and co‐immunoprecipitates core proteins. Consistent with a role in PSII structure, PSII complexes (supercomplexes, dimers and monomers) of the mph1 mutant are less stable in plants subjected to photoinhibitory light. Accumulation of PSII core proteins is compromised under these conditions in the presence of translational inhibitors. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the mutant has enhanced PSII protein damage rather than defective repair. These data are consistent with the distribution of the MPH1 protein in grana and stroma thylakoids, and its interaction with PSII core complexes. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a role for MPH1 in the protection and/or stabilization of PSII under high‐light stress in land plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aembryophytes 3agenes 3agrana 3ahomeostasis 3alight intensity 3amembrane proteins 3amutants 3aphotosystem II 3aprotein depletion 3athylakoids 3atranslation (genetics)1 aLast, Robert L.0 tplant journal.g2015 June, v. 82, no. 5 p.731-743dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.128453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245013000168300001600298520125500314592002801569650002401597650001601621650001701637650002401654650002001678650002701698650001801725650001601743650002201759650001801781650000701799650002401806650002401830650001801854650002201872650001001894651001001904700001501914700001401929700001801943700001801961700001601979773009101995856004802086852000902134655001202143IND4473466820221120021612.0120425e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447346682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-011-1072-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucas-Borja, M.

METHODS: The effects of the forest stand composition on the soil organic matter dynamics and on the structure and activity of the soil microbial community have been determined using phospholipid fatty acid profiles and soil enzymatic activities. RESULTS: The soil and litter N and C contents were higher in Pinus nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii and Quercus ilex mixed forest stands (SBHO) and in long-term unmanaged Pinus nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii forest stands (SBPC) than in pure Pinus nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii forest stands (SBPA) and Pinus nigra Arn. ssp. salzmannii and Juniperus thurifera mixed forest stands (SBSJ). The bacterial biomass was significantly higher in SBSJ and SBPA than in SBPC and SBHO. The results show an uncoupling of the soil microbial biomass and its activity. pH is related to microbial biomass and its community structure under a Mediterranean humid climate. CONCLUSIONS: The tree species seem to affect the biomass of the soil microbial community and its structure. The pH, but not the C/N ratio, is a factor influencing the microbial dynamics, biomass, and community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus thurifera 3aPinus nigra 3aQuercus ilex 3acommunity structure 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acid composition 3aforest stands 3ahumid zones 3amicrobial biomass 3amixed forests 3apH 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic matter 3asoil profiles 3astand composition 3atrees 3aSpain1 aCandel, D.1 aJindo, K.1 aMoreno, J.

The objective of this study was to determine the reason for greater P efficiency in Yamhill. The cultivars were grown in three growth-chamber experiments to describe response to a factorial combination of P levels and soil fumigation, and to compare root growth rates, root hair formation, and tissue P concentrations. Cultivars did not differ in root growth rate, total P uptake, or response to fumigation. Root hair length was affected by an interaction between cultivars and P concentrations in the growth medium. At the 2 µM P level, Yamhill had significantly (P = 0.05) longer root hairs than Stephens. Yamhill produced significantly greater shoot dry weight per unit of P taken up (0.20 g mg⁻¹) than Stephens (0.17 g mg⁻¹). The greater P efficiency of Yamhill was attributed to greater P-use efficiency rather than to differences in P uptake. Oregon Agric. Exp. Stn.

Here, we suggest an injectable and sustained bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) release system using thermosensitive polymeric nanoparticles bearing dual interacting forces with BMP-2. For sustained BMP-2 release, hydrophobic and ionic interactions were introduced to thermosensitive poly(phosphazene). Hydrophobic isoleucine ethyl ester and hydrophilic poly-ethylene glycol were mainly substituted to the poly(phosphazene) back bone for amphiphilicity and hydrophobic interaction with BMP-2. Carboxylic acid moiety was additionally substituted to the back bone for ionic interaction with BMP-2. These dual interacting polymeric nanoparticles (D-NPs) formed compact nanocomplexes with BMP-2. The aqueous solution of BMP-2/D-NP nanocomplexes was transformed to hydrogel when the temperature of the solution increased. Loaded BMP-2 was sustain-released for three weeks from the BMP-2/D-NP nanocomplex hydrogel. The extended BMP-2 exposure caused higher osteocalcin secretion in C2C12 cells. Significant bone generations were observed at the target site by single injection of BMP-2/D-NP nanocomplexes in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aisoleucine 3ananoparticles 3aosteocalcin 3asecretion 3atemperature 0aPolymeric nanoparticles 0aDual interactions 0aInjectable hydrogel 0aBone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) 0aSustained BMP-2 release1 aChoi, Hyuck1 aKoh, Jeong-Tae1 aSong, Soo-Chang0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2015 July 10, v. 209 p.67-76dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245013500154300001600289520148800305592002801793650001001821650001601831650002001847650002201867650002301889650002401912650001401936650001401950650002301964650001701987650001802004650002402022650001002046653002202056653001802078653002302096653002302119700001302142700001502155700001302170773009602183856003802279852000902317655001202326IND4478053120221120021427.0120510s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447805312DNAL7 a10.1071/AN111852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMen, Xiao-Ming10aMuscle-fibre types in porcine longissimus muscle of different genotypes and their association with the status of energy metabolism  ap. 305-312.  aTo study the difference in muscle-fibre types in porcine muscle among different genotypes and its association with energy metabolism, composition of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) mRNA and energy metabolism indices were determined in the longissimus muscle (LM). Pig breeds included Jinhua (JHP), Zhongbai (ZBP), Duroc Ã Zhongbai cross (DZP) and Duroc Ã Yorkshire Ã Landrace cross (DYL). JHP pigs were found to have the highest proportions of MyHC I, IIa and IIx mRNA (P < 0.05), creatine kinase (CK) activity (P < 0.05) and the lowest glycolytic potential (GP) compared with the other genotypes. The proportions of MyHC I and IIa mRNA increased in the order of DYL < DZP < ZBP < JHP, whereas the trend was opposite for MyHC IIb mRNA. The proportions of MyHC I, IIa and IIx mRNA were positively correlated with CK activity and the turnover ratio of creatine phosphate (CP) (P < 0.01), and negatively correlated with GP, glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) and lactate (LA) contents (P < 0.01), with the trends being opposite for MyHC IIb mRNA. The results indicate that muscle-fibre type in porcine LM is influenced by the genetic background of pigs. For example, JHP pigs had more of Types I, IIa and IIx fibres than did other genotypes. Proportions of Types I, IIa and IIx fibres were positively correlated with CK reaction (ATP-CP) capacity and negatively correlated with GP. These data provide some evidence for exploring the effective mechanism of muscle-fibre type on pork quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3acorrelation 3acreatine kinase 3aenergy metabolism 3agenetic background 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3alactation 3alandraces 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat quality 3amessenger RNA 3amyosin heavy chains 3aswine 0aenergy metabolism 0apig genotypes 0amuscle-fibre types 0amyosin heavy chain1 aDeng, Bo1 aXu, Zi-Wei1 aTao, Xin0 tAnimal production science.g2012, v. 52, no. 5 p.305-312dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN11185  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245014400159300001600303520090800319592002801227650003001255650002101285650001101306650001201317650003101329650001201360650001001372650001401382650002401396700002401420773016101444856008101605852000901686655001201695IND60685897220221118062405.0200311e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068589722DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000203732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmkar, 10aFunctional Response of the Sevenspotted Lady Beetle, Coccinella septempunctata Linnaeus on the Mustard Aphid, Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach)  ap. 149-152.  aThe functional response of fourth instars, adult males and females of the sevenspotted lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), was studied at different densities of aphid, Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) (Homoptera: Aphididae). The maximum prey consumption was recorded for fourth instars at the highest prey density (800) and the minimum for the male lady beetle at the lowest prey density (25). The prey consumption by the predatory stages of the lady beetle was directly and the percent prey consumption inversely proportional to prey density. Prey handling time decreased with increasing prey density. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the log number of prey exposed for prédation and prey consumed. The predatory efficiency of the predator stages was directly proportional to prey density, indicating a Holling Type II functional response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccinella septempunctata 3aLipaphis erysimi 3aadults 3afemales 3afunctional response models 3ainstars 3amales 3apredation 3aregression analysis1 aSrivastava, Shefali0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2003 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.149-152dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584000203733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011000168300001400278520141400292592002801706650001301734650001101747650001201758650002501770650001101795653001001806653001801816653001701834653001401851700001901865700002201884700002501906700002001931700002201951773012501973856008302098852000902181655001202190IND60542671420221121050458.0190405e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054267142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazio, Esterina10aDynamics of Total and Free Iodothyronines of Jumping Horses on the Responses to Competition and Transport  ap. 49-53.  aThe aim of the research was to study the total and free iodothyronine (T3, T4, fT3, fT4) changes of trained horses transported before and/or after competition, and performing in show jumping competition, respectively. Six horses were studied in four different sessions during four consecutive weeks. During the first week, horses were submitted to transport before competition (sessions: t0 = before transport, T0 = after transport). Then, during the second week, horses were submitted to transport after competition (sessions: t1 = before transport, T1 = after transport). During the third week, horses participated in a competitive show jumping event (sessions: t2 = before competition, T2 = after competition). During the fourth week, horses were submitted to transport and to a competitive show jumping event (sessions: t3 = after transport and before exercise, T3 = after exercise). Compared with t0 session, t1 showed higher T3 (P < .01) and lower fT4 (P < .01) concentrations. Compared with t2 session, t3 showed higher T3 (P < .01) and lower fT3 (P < .01) concentrations. A significant effect of competition on fT3 changes (F = 4.227; P < .05) was recorded. The results obtained showed that transport and show jumping competition differently influenced the thyroid responses of trained sport horses to physiological and psychological stress, also according to the individual experimental sessions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexercise 3ahorses 3ajumping 3apsychological stress 3asports 0aHorse 0aIodothyronine 0aShow jumping 0aTransport1 aMedica, Pietro1 aCravana, Cristina1 aPellizzotto, Roberta1 aFragalà, Santo1 aFerlazzo, Adriana0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2015 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.49-53dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010300162300001800265506011700283506007600400520136600476592002801842506003701870650001801907650002001925650001601945650001001961650001101971650001501982650001301997653002602010653002402036653002202060700001802082700001702100700001402117773012802131856008302259852000902342655001202351IND60775597820221207134715.0220502s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077559782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2022.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aImproving the topology prediction of α-helical transmembrane proteins with deep transfer learning  ap. 1993-2000.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTransmembrane proteins (TMPs) are essential for cell recognition and communication, and they serve as important drug targets in humans. Transmembrane proteins' 3D structures are critical for determining their functions and drug design but are hard to determine even by experimental methods. Although some computational methods have been developed to predict transmembrane helices (TMHs) and orientation, there is still room for improvement. Considering that the pre-trained language model can make full use of massive unlabeled protein sequences to obtain latent feature representation for TMPs and reduce the dependence on evolutionary information, we proposed DeepTMpred, which used pre-trained self-supervised language models called ESM, convolutional neural networks, attentive neural network and conditional random fields for alpha-TMP topology prediction. Compared with the current state-of-the-art tools on a non-redundant dataset of TMPs, DeepTMpred demonstrated superior predictive performance in most evaluation metrics, especially at the TMH level. Furthermore, DeepTMpred could also obtain reliable prediction results for TMPs without much evolutionary feature in a few seconds. A tutorial on how to use DeepTMpred can be found in the colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/ISYSLAB-HUST/DeepTMpred/blob/master/notebook/test.ipynb).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiotechnology 3adata collection 3adrug design 3adrugs 3amodels 3aprediction 3atopology 0aTransmembrane protein 0aTopology prediction 0aTransfer learning1 aZhong, Haolin1 aXue, Zhidong1 aWang, Yan0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2022, v. 20 p.1993-2000dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2022.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008200176300001600258520178800274592002802062650002702090650001302117650002002130650001302150650001202163650001702175650001202192650001302204650001302217653001702230653003302247653000802280653003002288653002502318653003102343700002202374700002502396773015002421856008602571852000902657655001202666IND60532245920221119085619.0190214e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053224592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMumm, Christina A.S.10aVocal individuality in cohesion calls of giant otters, Pteronura brasiliensis  ap. 243-252.  aSocial calls conveying identity yield several advantages in managing social group living. Signalling identity to conspecifics and the perception of the calling individual by receivers allow for appropriate behavioural responses based on experience of previous interactions. Contact calls help maintain group cohesion and often provide individual signatures. Giant otters, endemic to Amazonian rainforests and wetlands, are a highly social and vocally active species. Their family groups consist of a monogamous alpha pair with offspring of different ages, and elder siblings assist in rearing the young. During collective fishing bouts, individuals frequently become separated from their group. Giant otters use two types of cohesion calls. The ‘contact call’ is often uttered when the otters are visually separated, and is then followed by the reunion of group members. The ‘hum’ is produced in close proximity to manage group movements. We predicted giant otters would have individually distinct cohesion calls and be able to discriminate between the cohesion calls of different individuals. We recorded and measured calls from wild and captive individuals and conducted habituation–dishabituation playbacks with two captive groups. Our results provided statistical evidence for a strong individual signature in contact calls but not in hums. Nevertheless, the giant otters were able to distinguish individuals in both cohesion calls tested. We conclude that individual signatures seem to be advantageous in terms of managing group movements. Giant otters might additionally benefit from discriminating individuals within their social group, where kin recognition is insufficient to identify equally related individuals that cooperate in hunting and rearing of the young.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteronura brasiliensis 3acohesion 3akin recognition 3amonogamy 3aprogeny 3arain forests 3arearing 3asiblings 3awetlands 0acontact call 0ahabituation–dishabituation 0ahum 0aindividual discrimination 0aplayback experiments 0avocal individual signature1 aUrrutia, Maria C.1 aKnörnschild, Mirjam0 tAnimal behaviour.g2014 Feb., v. 88 p.243-252dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002500169245017500194300001600369520106700385592002801452653001301480653003401493653003001527653001501557653001901572773011401591856011701705852000901822655001201831IND60124960220221116233817.0151101e200112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012496022DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0354:UTIWAB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberhard, William G.10aUnder the influence: webs and building behavior of plesiometa argyra (araneae, tetragnathidae) when parasitized by hymenoepimecis argyraphaga (hymenoptera, ichneumonidae)  ap. 354-366.  aOn the evening that it will kill its host, the orb-weaving spider Plesiometa argyra, the larva of the ichneumonid wasp Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga induces the spider to perform highly stereotyped construction behavior and build an otherwise unique “cocoon web” that is particularly well-designed to support the wasp larva's cocoon. Cocoon web construction behavior is nearly identical with the early steps in one subroutine of normal orb construction, and is repeated over and over. Usually all other normal orb construction behavior patterns are completely or nearly completely repressed. Experimental removal of the larva one or a few hours before cocoon construction would normally occur is sometimes followed by nearly normal cocoon web construction, and sometimes by construction of other highly altered web designs. The mechanism by which the larva induces these changes in the spider's behavior is thus apparently a fast-acting chemical, with effects that are manifested gradually. Partial recovery of orb designs sometimes occurred several days later.  aPublisher supplied data 0aParasite 0amanipulation of host behavior 0aorb construction behavior 0aPlesiometa 0aHymenoepimecis0 tJournal of arachnology.g2001 Dec., v. 29, no. 3 p.354-366dAmerican Arachnological Society.x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2F0161-8202%282001%29029%5B0354%3AUTIWAB%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014200174300001600316520128200332592002801614650001801642650001401660650002401674650002301698650001301721650001101734650001701745650002101762650001101783650003901794650000901833650001401842650001301856653003301869653001701902653002601919700002101945700002001966700002201986700002202008700002302030773011602053856008602169852000902255655001202264IND60556887120221120053517.0170105e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055688712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.10.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidorov, Alexandr10aFc fragments of immunoglobulin G are an inductor of regulatory rheumatoid factor and a promising therapeutic agent for rheumatic diseases  ap. 938-945.  aWe recently identified rheumatoid factor, the production of which neither predicts nor exacerbates experimental autoimmune disease, but the opposite, namely it is associated with autoimmune disease resistance and remission. We have named it regulatory rheumatoid factor (regRF). The aim of this study was to determine whether rat Fc fragments and human Fc fragments are an antigen for regRF, and to determine the conditions for obtaining them. The presence of an antigenic determinant for regRF on IgG fragments was inferred from the fragments’ ability to inhibit the agglutination caused by regRF and to induce regRF production in vivo. It was found that antigenic determinants for both human regRF and rat regRF are absent from native IgG and can be induced in the hinge region of Fc fragments of homologous IgG by papain digestion. The rat Fc fragments are susceptible to spontaneous reconfiguration, which results in loss of the antigenic determinants for regRF. Reconfiguration can be observed by SDS-PAGE. Immunization of arthritic rats with Fc fragments of rat IgG that carry antigenic determinants for rat regRF reduces the symptoms of collagen-induced arthritis. The Fc fragments can be viewed as the basis for a therapeutic vaccine to suppress autoimmune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagglutination 3aarthritis 3aautoimmune diseases 3adisease resistance 3aepitopes 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3apapain 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arats 3aremission 3avaccines 0aRegulatory rheumatoid factor 0aFc fragments 0aAntigenic determinant1 aBeduleva, Liubov1 aMenshikov, Igor1 aTerentiev, Alexey1 aStolyarova, Elena1 aAbisheva, Nadezhda0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Feb., v. 95 p.938-945dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.10.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011200169300001400281520181200295592002802107650002602135650002402161650001802185650001902203650001102222650002602233650001802259650001902277650001402296650001302310650003302323650001802356650001702374653002202391653002302413653003802436653001502474700002002489700001502509700002302524700001602547700002402563773009002587856008302677852000902760655001202769IND60611819020221117232644.0180904e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061181902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColombo, Ilaria10aMolecular imaging in drug development: Update and challenges for radiolabeled antibodies and nanotechnology  ap. 23-35.  aDespite the significant advancement achieved in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for cancer transformation and aberrant proliferation, leading to novel targeted cancer therapies, significant effort is still needed to “personalize” cancer treatment. Molecular imaging is an emerging field that has shown the ability to characterize in vivo the molecular pathways present at the cancer cell level, enabling diagnosis and personalized treatment of malignancies. These technologies, particularly SPECT and PET also permit the development of novel radiotheranostic probes, which provide capabilities for diagnosis and treatment with the same agent. The small therapeutic index of most anticancer agents is a limitation in the drug development process. Incorporation of molecular imaging in clinical research may help in overcoming this limitation and favouring selection of patient populations most likely to achieve benefit from targeted therapy. This review will focus on two of the most advanced theranostic approaches with promising potential for application in the clinic: 1) therapeutic monoclonal antibodies which may be linked to a radionuclide for SPECT or PET imaging to guide cancer diagnosis, staging, molecular characterization, and assessment of the response to treatment and 2) multifunctional nanotechnology that allows image guided drug delivery through encapsulation of multiple therapeutic, targeting and imaging agents into a single nanoparticle. Porphysome, a liposome-like nanoparticle, is an example of a novel and promising application of nanotechnology for cancer diagnosis and treatment. These technologies have proven to be effective in preclinical models, warranting further clinical investigation to advance their application for the benefit of cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiomedical research 3aencapsulation 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3apositron-emission tomography 3aradiolabeling 3atherapeutics 0aMolecular imaging 0aTheranostic probes 0aRadiolabelled monoclonal antibody 0aPorphysome1 aOverchuk, Marta1 aChen, Juan1 aReilly, Raymond M.1 aZheng, Gang1 aLheureux, Stephanie0 tMethods.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 130 p.23-35dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014500165506010400310506007600414520196000490592002802450506003702478650003402515650001602549650001302565650001902578650001202597650002702609650001902636650001902655650001002674650002402684653001902708653001502727653003202742653001402774653001902788653002402807653001702831653001402848700001802862700001402880700001802894700001902912700005802931773009202989856008303081852000903164655001203173IND60775598120221207132155.0220606s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077559812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fecs.2022.1000402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Shao-an10aAltitudinal variations of hydraulic traits in Faxon fir (Abies fargesii var. faxoniana): Mechanistic controls and environmental adaptability  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlobal climate change has been seen to result in marked impacts on forest ecosystems such as accelerated tree mortality worldwide due to incidental hydraulic failure caused by intensified and more frequent occurrence of extreme drought and heat-waves. However, it is well understood how the tree hydrological strategies would adjust to environmental variability brough about by climate changes. Here we investigated the hydraulic adjustment as a mechanism of acclimation to different climate conditions along an altitudinal gradient in Faxon fir (Abies fargesii var. faxoniana) ― a tree species that plays a key role in conservation of wildlife and maintenance of ecosystem services in subalpine forests. The hydraulic traits and selective morphological and physiological variables were measured seasonally along an altitudinal gradient from 2,800 to 3,600 ​m a.s.l. We found that the native percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) increased with altitude across the seasonal measurements. Both the native sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity (Kₛ) and native leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (Kₗ) significantly decreased with altitude for measurements in July and October, coinciding with the timing for peak growth and pre-dormancy, respectively. The morphological traits varied toward more conservative tree hydrological strategies with increases in altitude, exhibiting trade-offs with hydraulic traits. The total non-structural carbohydrates in both needle (NSCNₑₑdₗₑ) and branch (NSCBᵣₐₙcₕ) as well as photosynthetic capacity of current-year leaves played variable roles in maintaining the integrity of the hydraulic functioning and shaping the hydraulic adjustment under prevailing environmental conditions. Our findings indicate that Faxon fir possesses some degree of hydraulic adaptability to water limitation imposed by climate fluctuations in subalpine region through morphological and physiological modifications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAbies fargesii var. faxoniana 3aacclimation 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3adrought 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aphotosynthesis 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awildlife management 0aClimate change 0aEco-safety 0aEnvironmental vulnerability 0aFaxon fir 0aHydraulic risk 0aHabitat constraints 0aWater stress 0aSubalpine1 aHao, Guangyou1 aLi, Xuhua1 aFeng, Qiuhong1 aLiu, Xingliang1 aSun, Osbert J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8815-59840 tForest ecosystems.g2022, v. 9 p.100040-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21605x2197-56207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fecs.2022.1000403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013400167300001600301520179300317592002802110650000802138650002702146650001602173650002902189650001302218650002502231650001202256650001802268650002002286650001702306650002402323650001002347650001802357650002502375650001102400650001602411650001802427650001302445650001302458653002702471653001202498653001802510653001202528653001802540700002102558700002002579700001702599700001802616700001902634700002102653700007302674700006002747773009902807856008502906852000902991655001203000IND60566349520221122055635.0170711e20150710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056634952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaelo, Aida10aDisassembling bacterial extracellular matrix with DNase-coated nanoparticles to enhance antibiotic delivery in biofilm infections  ap. 150-158.  aInfections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria are a major threat to hospitalized patients and the main cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. There is an urgent necessity for novel therapeutic approaches, since current antibiotic delivery fails to eliminate biofilm-protected bacteria. In this study, ciprofloxacin-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles, which were functionalized with DNase I, were fabricated using a green-solvent based method and their antibiofilm activity was assessed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Such nanoparticles constitute a paradigm shift in biofilm treatment, since, besides releasing ciprofloxacin in a controlled fashion, they are able to target and disassemble the biofilm by degrading the extracellular DNA that stabilize the biofilm matrix. These carriers were compared with free-soluble ciprofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin encapsulated in untreated and poly(lysine)-coated nanoparticles. DNase I-activated nanoparticles were not only able to prevent biofilm formation from planktonic bacteria, but they also successfully reduced established biofilm mass, size and living cell density, as observed in a dynamic environment in a flow cell biofilm assay. Moreover, repeated administration over three days of DNase I-coated nanoparticles encapsulating ciprofloxacin was able to reduce by 95% and then eradicate more than 99.8% of established biofilm, outperforming all the other nanoparticle formulations and the free-drug tested in this study. These promising results, together with minimal cytotoxicity as tested on J774 macrophages, allow obtaining novel antimicrobial nanoparticles, as well as provide clues to design the next generation of drug delivery devices to treat persistent bacterial infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3abiofilm 3aciprofloxacin 3acystic fibrosis 3acytotoxicity 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aextracellular matrix 3alysine 3amacrophages 3ananoparticles 3apatients 3aplankton 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aBiofilm 0aCiprofloxacin 0aDNase I 0aNanoparticles1 aLevato, Riccardo1 aJulián, Esther1 aCrespo, Anna1 aAstola, José1 aGavaldà, Joan1 aEngel, Elisabeth1 aMateos-Timoneda, Miguel Angel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7657-14141 aTorrents, Eduard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3010-16090 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2015 July 10, v. 209 p.150-158dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245014800161300001600309500001900325520170700344592002802051650001602079650001502095650001602110650001002126650001202136650001602148650002202164650002902186650001902215650001602234650001302250650001302263653001702276653004702293653001502340700002002355700003002375700001702405700001902422773010202441856007102543852000902614655001202623IND60695718920221123005530.0200518e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571892DNAL7 a10.2216/17-45.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamalanathan, Manoj10aPhotosynthetic physiology of Scenedesmus sp.

When these cells had reached an apparent stationary phase and were subsequently exposed to light (mixotrophy), growth rapidly resumed and the biomass increased by 5.5-fold relative to photoautotrophically grown cultures and doubled compared with heterotrophic cultures. Although it is expected, and supported by the majority of reports in the literature, that dark acclimation of algal cultures should lead to eventual loss of photosynthetic pigments, some algae defy these expectations and synthesize and retain their photosynthetic pigments independent of light, despite the high associated maintenance costs. Here we examined the photosynthetic activity of heterotrophically grown cells in an attempt to explain this variance, using Scenedesmus sp. as a model organism. The photosynthetic capacity of heterotrophically grown cells was comparable with that of autotrophically grown cultures, associated with an interesting set of changes to the photosynthetic apparatus that includes lower nonphotochemical quenching, chlorophyll content, absorption cross-sectional area, higher connectivity between reaction centers, higher electron transport flux per reaction center, and probability at t = 0 that a trapped exciton moves an electron into the electron transport chain beyond the primary quinone electron acceptor, and performance index. As a result, when these heterotrophically grown cultures were transferred back to light, they were still able to perform photosynthesis and enhance overall growth, which was otherwise limited in complete darkness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3aabsorption 3aacclimation 3aalgae 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aelectron transfer 3aelectron transport chain 3aphotosynthesis 3aprobability 3aquinones 3avariance 0aHeterotrophy 0aLight-independent chlorophyll biosynthesis 0aMixotrophy1 aDao, Ly Hai Thi1 aChaisutyakorna, Panjaphol1 aGleadow, Ros1 aBeardall, John0 tPhycologia.g2017 Nov. 1, v. 56, no. 6 p.666-674dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/17-45.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245007100207300001800278500001900296520193900315592002802254650001102282650001502293650003802308650001802346650001202364650002402376650001902400650001602419650001302435651001002448653001602458653003502474700001402509700001302523700001702536700001702553700001402570700005502584773009902639856008602738852000902824655001202833IND60696988120221122144701.0200614e20200626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069698812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.05.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yaxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4037-546710aEvaluating the population measles susceptibility in Tianjin, China  ap. 4829-4836.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMeasles is a highly infectious illness requiring herd immunity of 95% to interrupt transmission. China has not reached elimination goals despite high vaccination coverage. We estimated the population susceptibility against measles in Tianjin, China and to tailor awareness raising activities in the measles elimination plan.Age-specific measles seroprevalence was evaluated by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) on 12,164 individual aged 0–44 years in 2009–2018. Measles IgG avidity testing was performed to confirm the relationship of the waning immunity after vaccination and secondary vaccination failures (SVF) on 324 confirmed measles cases in 2013–2018.11,108 samples (91.32%) tested positive for measles IgG, 239 (1.96%) tested as equivocal and 817 (6.72%) were negative. The age distribution of measles cases in Tianjin followed a U-shaped curve and was highest for those at <8 months and again at 20–39 years which correlated closely with the age distribution of measles susceptibility based on measles IgG antibody status (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). The seropositivity rate and antibody geometric mean concentration (GMC) for the 2018 study population were significantly lower (χ² = 7.45, P = 0.006 and t = 12.01, P < 0.001) compared to 2009. The multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that age and region were the risk factors for both measles seropositivity rate and GMC after vaccination. The proportion of high avidity cases increased with age, being significantly higher in 75.31% of cases in patients aged 30–34 years (χ² = 18.04, P = 0.003).High immunization coverage in children alone will not be adequate to realizing sufficient levels of population herd immunity, particularly given that the potential susceptibility window in adult. Implementation of supplemental immunization activity (SIA) targeted to appropriate group aged 30–34 years is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aherd immunity 3ameasles 3aregression analysis 3aseroprevalence 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aChina 0aIgG avidity 0aSecondary vaccination failures1 aChen, Wei1 aLei, Yue1 aMao, Naiying1 aGao, Zhigang1 aXu, Wenbo1 aZhang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6936-23200 tVaccine.g2020 June 26, v. 38, no. 31 p.4829-4836dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.05.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007900170300001400249520094100263592002801204650000801232650001901240650001001259650004201269650000901311650001201320650001301332650001401345650001101359650002901370650001801399653001801417653001501435653001801450653002401468700001801492700002001510773009001530856008301620852000901703655001201712IND60611819320221117232454.0180904e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061181932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwasaki, Yuka W.10aDeep sequencing and high-throughput analysis of PIWI-associated small RNAs  ap. 66-75.  aSmall RNAs are now known to be major regulatory factors of gene expression. Emerging methods based on deep-sequencing have enabled the analysis of small RNA expression in a high-throughput manner, leading to the identification of large numbers of small RNAs in various species. Moreover, profiling small RNA data together with transcriptome data enables transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mediated by small RNAs to be hypothesized. Here, we isolated PIWIL1 (MIWI)-associated small RNAs from mouse testes, and performed small RNA-seq analysis. In addition, directional RNA-seq was performed using Piwil1 mutant mouse testes. Using these data, we describe protocols for analyzing small RNA-seq reads to obtain profiles of small RNAs associated with PIWI proteins. We also present bioinformatic protocols for analyzing RNA-seq reads that aim to annotate expression of piRNA clusters and identify genes regulated by piRNAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3abioinformatics 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amice 3amutants 3aproteins 3aprotocols 3atestes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 0aRNA silencing 0aPIWI-piRNA 0aSmall RNA-seq 0aDirectional RNA-seq1 aIshino, Kyoko1 aSiomi, Haruhiko0 tMethods.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 126 p.66-75dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2017.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245014400189300001600333520135700349592002801706653001401734653001901748653001401767653001601781653001901797653002501816700001601841773011401857856011701971852000902088655001202097IND60124960720221116234249.0151101e200112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012496072DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0413:EFKSGF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohannesen, Jes10aEvidence for kin-structured group founding and limited juvenile dispersal in the sub-social spider stegodyphus lineatus (araneae, eresidae)  ap. 413-422.  aIn sub-social spiders, restricted dispersal of young (i.e., natal philopatry) and the potential for inbreeding could contribute to within-population subdivision, thus resulting in a population structure similar to that found in social congeners. In this context, we analyzed the origin and mode of individual distribution patterns and their contribution to within-population structure in juveniles of the sub-social spider Stegodyphus lineatus. We investigated the distribution of juveniles for four months after leaving the maternal nest using allozyme genetic markers. We found that isolated groups of juveniles consisted predominantly of siblings, whereas larger aggregations of individuals showed mixing of different juvenile sibling groups. However, even within such aggregations, sibling groups could be identified. Within the population at large, a heterozygote deficit and an uneven distribution of alleles were found. This was caused by limited movement of juveniles and males away from the natal site. Thus, the within-population (intrademic) structure could be partitioned into two components, resulting from kin-groups and population subdivision into demes. We compare this type of population structure with that found in non-social and social species, and discuss whether it provides conditions that could favor the evolution of sociality.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDispersal 0asibling groups 0aallozymes 0arelatedness 0agroup founding 0aintrademic structure1 aLubin, Yael0 tJournal of arachnology.g2001 Dec., v. 29, no. 3 p.413-422dAmerican Arachnological Society.x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2F0161-8202%282001%29029%5B0413%3AEFKSGF%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04043naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001700163245014100180300001600321500001500337520188200352592002802234650001302262650000902275650001602284650001702300650001402317650002602331650002102357650001802378650001902396650001602415650001402431650001202445650002802457650001702485650001002502650001502512650001202527650004002539650003302579650001102612650001302623650004102636650003302677650001302710650002302723650003202746650001402778650008202792650001002874650001202884651001202896651001302908651001102921653005402932700002102986700001703007700002103024700002303045700001803068700002403086700002103110773008903131856008003220852000903300655001203309IND4468993620221120021531.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446899362DNAL7 a228503812pmid7 a10.1016/j.fm.2012.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAslam, Mueen10aPhenotypic and genetic characterization of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella serovars isolated from retail meats in Alberta, Canada  ap. 110-117.  a2019-12-05  aThis study determined the prevalence of Salmonella serovars, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and resistance genes in Salmonella isolated from retail meats purchased in Alberta, Canada. Samples were collected during one year period (May 2007–April 2008) on weekly basis from 19 census divisions in Alberta. A total of 564 samples including chicken (n = 206), turkey (n = 91), beef (n = 134) and pork (n = 133) were purchased. Salmonella were recovered from chicken (40%), turkey (27%) and pork (2%) samples and was not found in ground beef. A total of 21, 8, and 3 different serovars were recovered from chicken, turkey and pork meats, respectively. Salmonella Hadar was most common in chicken whereas S. Heidelberg was common in turkey meat. Overall 29% (32/110) of isolates were susceptible to tested antimicrobials and resistance to ciprofloxacin, amikacin and nalidixic acid was not found in any isolate. Multiresistance (≥2 antimicrobials) was found in 56% of isolates. Resistance to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid (AMC), ceftiofur (TIO), and ceftriaxone (CRO) was found in about 21% of chicken and 25% of turkey isolates. Resistance to either of tetracycline (TET), streptomycin (STR) or ampicillin (AMP) was unconditionally associated with S. Hadar but resistance to either of TET, AMP, AMC, TIO, CRO or cefoxitin was associated with S. Heidelberg. The strA/B (42% isolates), tet(A) (28% isolates), blaCMY₋₂ (21% isolates) and blaTEM (17% isolates) were the most common resistance genes found. The blaCMY₋₂ and blaTEM genes were unconditionally associated with S. Heidelberg; tet(A) and strA/B with S. Hadar and tet(B) gene with S. Kentucky. The strA/B genes were not associated with S. Heidelberg. Our data suggests that the prevalence of Salmonella serovars varied by the meat type and that AMR and resistance genes varied by the Salmonella serovars.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3apork 3aturkey meat 3atetracycline 3aceftiofur 3aantibiotic resistance 3aSalmonella Hadar 3aciprofloxacin 3analidixic acid 3aground beef 3aserotypes 3aturkeys 3aadenosine monophosphate 3astreptomycin 3agenes 3aampicillin 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCattle 2aChickens 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aGenotype 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPhenotype 2aSalmonellaxclassificationxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSwine 2aTurkeys 3aAlberta 3aKentucky 0aCanada 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Hadar1 aCheckley, Sylvia1 aAvery, Brent1 aChalmers, Gabhan1 aBohaychuk, Valerie1 aGensler, Gary1 aReid-Smith, Richard1 aBoerlin, Patrick0 tFood microbiology.g2012 Oct., v. 32, no. 1 p.110-117dElsevier Ltdx0740-00207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2012.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005200166300001600218520106500234592002801299650001401327650001501341650002001356650001601376650002001392650001001412650002401422650001801446650002401464650002901488650002601517700002601543700002401569773010001593856008101693852000901774655001201783IND60120823820221119170645.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012082382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-013-2856-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoidot, Romain10aTranscriptional regulation of the survivin gene  ap. 233-240.  aSurvivin, a small member of the inhibitors of the apoptosis protein family, is highly deregulated in cancer. It is weakly expressed in normal tissues but very strongly expressed in malignant lesions. Survivin is involved in cell-cycle progression, especially in the G2/M transition, and has anti-apoptotic activity, which correlates with its strong expression in cases with a poor cancer treatment response and poor outcomes. Several therapies that target the survivin transcript or protein are currently being tested in clinical trials. However, focusing new therapies on the origins of survivin overexpression and targeting these upstream deregulations could be more effective. For this reason, it seems important to make an inventory of the transcriptional (de)regulation of survivin. This review will gather the important points concerning the regulation of survivin mRNA expression: structure of the survivin promoter, epigenetic modifications and genetic abnormalities, transcription factors, and signalling pathways that affect survivin mRNA expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3aclinical trials 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3amessenger RNA 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aVégran, Frédérique1 aLizard-Nacol, Sarab0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.233-240dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-013-2856-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012000172300002000292520154100312592002801853650002301881650002401904650001201928650001501940650002301955650001401978650002401992650002102016650001402037650001302051650001402064650001002078651001302088700001702101700001902118700002102137700001802158700001302176700002602189773015502215856008302370852000902453655001202462IND60765844420221121044102.0220203e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076584442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16627-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatti, Uzair Aslam10aEvaluating the impact of roads on the diversity pattern and density of trees to improve the conservation of species  ap. 14780-14790.  aRoadside trees alter biotic and abiotic factors of plants diversity in an ecosystem. Rows of plants grow along the roadside due to the interplay between the arrival of propagule and seedling establishment, which depends on the road’s specifications, land pattern, and road administration and protection practices. A field study was conducted to measure the roadside tree diversity in the city of Karachi (Pakistan). A total of 180 plots, divided into three primary road groups, were surveyed. The highest quantity of tree biomass per unit area was found on wide roads, followed by medium roads. On narrow roads, the least biomass was detected. A single species or a limited number of species dominated the tree community. Conocarpus erectus was the most dominant non-native species on all types of sidewalks or roadsides, followed by Guaiacum officinale. A total of 76 species (32 non-natives and 44 natives) that were selectively spread along the roadsides of the city were studied. There was a significant difference in phylogenetic diversity (PD), phylogenetic mean pairwise distance (MPD), and phylogenetic mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) among wide, medium, and narrow roads. Management practices have a significant positive correlation with diversity indices. Our study identified patterns of diversity in roadside trees in Karachi. It provides the basis for future planning for plant protection, such as the protection of plant species, the maintenance of plant habitats, and the coordination of plant management in Karachi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConocarpus erectus 3aGuaiacum officinale 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3aintroduced species 3aphylogeny 3aplant establishment 3aplant protection 3apollution 3aresearch 3aroadsides 3atrees 3aPakistan1 aYu, Zhaoyuan1 aHasnain, Ahmad1 aNawaz, Saqib Ali1 aYuan, Linwang1 aWen, Luo1 aBhatti, Mughair Aslam0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.14780-14790dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16627-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245007300209300001900282506007600301520105000377592002801427506003701455650002601492650002001518650001901538650001801557650002201575650001301597650002001610650002901630650002701659653002101686653002201707653001401729653002101743653003101764653000901795653003001804653000901834653000901843653001001852700002201862700001701884700002201901700002101923700002101944700002001965700002101985700002402006700002102030700002002051700002602071700002702097700002202124700001702146700002102163773010802184856008502292852000902377655001202386IND60605772420221207132109.0181002e20171207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060577242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2017.11.0072doi7 aPMC57303392pmcid7 a292206542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Bo-Jhih12aA Unique ISR Program Determines Cellular Responses to Chronic Stress  ap. 885-900.e6.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe integrated stress response (ISR) is a homeostatic mechanism induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In acute/transient ER stress, decreased global protein synthesis and increased uORF mRNA translation are followed by normalization of protein synthesis. Here, we report a dramatically different response during chronic ER stress. This chronic ISR program is characterized by persistently elevated uORF mRNA translation and concurrent gene expression reprogramming, which permits simultaneous stress sensing and proteostasis. The program includes PERK-dependent switching to an eIF3-dependent translation initiation mechanism, resulting in partial, but not complete, translational recovery, which, together with transcriptional reprogramming, selectively bolsters expression of proteins with ER functions. Coordination of transcriptional and translational reprogramming prevents ER dysfunction and inhibits “foamy cell” development, thus establishing a molecular basis for understanding human diseases associated with ER dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression 3ahuman diseases 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 0amRNA translation 0aprotein synthesis 0aER stress 0astress signaling 0aintegrated stress response 0aeIF2 0aunfolded protein response 0aPERK 0aeIF3 0aeIF2B1 avan Hoef, Vincent1 aJobava, Raul1 aElroy-Stein, Orna1 aValasek, Leos S.1 aCargnello, Marie1 aGao, Xing-Huang1 aKrokowski, Dawid1 aMerrick, William C.1 aKimball, Scot R.1 aKomar, Anton A.1 aKoromilas, Antonis E.1 aWynshaw-Boris, Anthony1 aTopisirovic, Ivan1 aLarsson, Ola1 aHatzoglou, Maria0 tMolecular cell.g2017 Dec. 07, v. 68, no. 5 p.885-900.e6dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2017.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015600154300001800310520159700328592002801925650001301953650001201966650001701978650002801995650001602023650002102039650002402060650001702084650001602101651001002117700001702127700001502144700001502159700001502174773009402189856007302283852000902356655001202365IND60390711820221118111219.0150823e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6039071182DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.104992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAquino, D.10aComplex hydraulic interactions between compartmentalized carbonate aquifers and heterogeneous siliciclastic successions: a case study in southern Italy  ap. 4252-4263.  aThe sedimentary sequences containing lithologic units with low permeability represent hydrogeologic systems, which, as of now, have been little studied despite their diffusion worldwide. A hydrogeologic study, aimed to assess the main factors controlling the groundwater flow dynamics in such systems and their hydraulic interactions with nearby carbonate aquifers, has been carried out in Longano (Isernia, Southern Italy). The analysis of the hydraulic heads, combined with the regimes of the springs and the electric conductivity of the groundwater, mainly reflect vertical and lateral heterogeneities of the media in terms of hydraulic properties. In particular, the flow system is controlled by lateral heterogeneities, which characterize a surficial horizon made up of clayey colluviums and talus deposits, separated from the deeper saturated, fissured bedrock. One‐to‐ten relationships in hydraulic heads, monitored in piezometers crossing the fissured media, further uphold the crucial role played by the lateral contrasts of permeability in controlling the flow dynamics. On the whole, significant interactions with the nearby carbonate hydrostructure take place. Nevertheless, the heterogeneities of the siliciclastic succession and surficial horizon, coupled with the compartmentalization of the carbonate system, lead to a complex hydrogeological scenario. In a wider perspective, this study gives information of utmost importance in order to improve the implementation of mathematical models and configuration of tapping works within these heterogeneous and complex settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abedrock 3acase studies 3aelectrical conductivity 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amathematical models 3apermeability 3apiezometers 3aItaly1 aPetrella, E.1 aFlorio, M.1 aCelico, P.1 aCelico, F.0 tHydrological processes.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 29, no. 19 p.4252-4263dWileyx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.104993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011500160300002000275500001500295520143900310592002801749650002201777650003701799650002201836650001601858650002101874650003301895650001501928650001401943650001101957650003701968650001102005650001102016653001402027700005502041700001402096700001802110700002002128700001602148700001702164700001502181700001802196773012402214856008202338852000902420655001202429IND60610585920221119190250.0180904e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061058592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2729-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Hang10aFacile synthesis of Fe3O4/NiFe2O4 nanosheets with enhanced Lithium-ion storage by one-step chemical dealloying  ap. 15631-15642.  a2019-12-06  aFe₃O₄/NiFe₂O₄ nanosheets as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries have been successfully prepared by a facile one-step dealloying method of Al–Fe–Ni alloy precursor. Herein, the XRD results and XPS spectra indicated that the product consists of cubic NiFe₂O₄ and Fe₃O₄. Scanning electronic microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed the homogenous distribution of Fe₃O₄/NiFe₂O₄ in the quasi-hexagonal nanosheets rather than irregular clusters. Besides nanostructures, their electrochemical performances were also enhanced due to the doping of nickel when comparing with the Fe₃O₄ obtained by dealloying Al–Fe precursor. Cycling and rate tests elicited the DAFN has the Fe₃O₄/NiFe₂O₄ product exhibit a higher initial capacity of ~ 1437 mAh g⁻¹ at 200 mA g⁻¹ and modified rate performances, especially they hold a doubled reversible capacity over 500 mAh g⁻¹ after 750 times cycling at 200 mA g⁻¹. Cyclic voltammetry, charge–discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectra measurements further demonstrated the reinforced initial capacity and cycling stability of the DAFN could be associated with the shortened diffusion pathways and synergistic effect of Fe₃O₄ and NiFe₂O₄. The facile and low-cost processing method accompanied with the well-performed product exhibit a promising prospect in the application of lithium-ion storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3alithium batteries 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3airon oxides 3aelectrochemistry 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ananosheets 3asynergism 3anickel 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aalloys 3aanodes 0aimpedance1 aWang, Xinlu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6091-07761 aLiu, Huan1 aWang, Jinxian1 aDong, Xiangting1 aLiu, Guixia1 aYu, Wensheng1 aYang, Ying1 aZhang, Hongbo0 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Nov., v. 53, no. 22 p.15631-15642dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2729-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012000163520180100283592002802084650002102112650001902133650001602152650002102168650002002189650001002209650003402219650001402253650002202267650001402289650002002303653000902323653002102332653002102353653002102374653000902395653002102404653000802425700001602433700001702449700001602466773008802482856008302570852000902653655001202662IND60793929420221120144646.0221004e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079392942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2022.1468672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dandan10aComprehensive analysis of bZIP gene family and function of RcbZIP17 on Botrytis resistance in rose (Rosa chinensis)  aRose is an important ornamental plant and a commercial source of natural fragrances and essential oils. However, gray mold is the most serious disease of rose during cultivation and post-harvest. In plants, the bZIP gene family is one of the important families of transcription factors that regulate many biological processes, including pathogen defense, light response, and stress signaling. Although there were reports that bZIPs play a key role in plant pathogen defense, there have been no comprehensive studies or functional analysis of the bZIP gene family in rose (Rosa sp.) yet. In this study, a genome-wide analysis of the bZIP family gene (RcbZIPs) in rose was carried out to investigate their phylogenetic relationships, gene structure, chromosome localizations, collinearity, and the function of RcbZIP17. In the rose genome, 48 RcbZIP genes were identified and divided into 11 subgroups by phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, gene structure analysis agreed with phylogenetic tree grouping. The RcbZIPs were unevenly distributed on all seven chromosomes. The gene duplication events indicated that segmental duplication of the entire genome may play a key role in gene duplication. A Ka/Ks analysis showed that they mainly underwent purifying selection with limited functional differentiation. Gene expression analysis showed that 16 RcbZIPs were significantly differential expressed by Botrytis cinerea infection. It is speculated that these RcbZIPs are candidate genes for regulating the response of rose to gray mold infection. According to virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and overexpression (OE) studies, RcbZIP17 was implicated in the resistance of rose to gray mold. This study provides useful information for further study on the function of the bZIP gene family in rose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aRosa chinensis 3achromosomes 3agene duplication 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agray mold 3aornamental plants 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogens 0aRose 0abZIP gene family 0aGene duplication 0aBotrytis cinerea 0aVIGS 0aBotrytis cinerea 0aHpi1 aLi, Xiaomei1 aLiu, Xintong1 aZhang, Zhao0 tGene.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 849 p.146867-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.1468673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012100166300001600287520149200303592002801795650001801823650001201841650002901853650001001882653002501892653003301917653001801950653001301968700001301981700001701994700001902011700001702030700001302047773009702060856008502157852000902242655001202251IND60719505520221118140341.0201223e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071950552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Wen-Tao10aInfluence of structural parameters on wavy-tilt-dam hydrodynamic mechanical seal performance in reactor coolant pump  ap. 210-221.  aThis work analyzes the operation conditions of the wavy-tilt-dam (WTD) mechanical seal under different structural parameters using the DNS method. The pressure difference within the liquid film is considered due to the complicated constructor of the WTD mechanical seal. The effects of the main structural parameters on the mechanical seal are studied, including the film thickness, taper, dam-width ratio, and waviness amplitude. Numerical results show that the increase of base film thickness will increase the leakage rate and decrease the opening force. The larger taper will lead to a higher leakage rate and opening force. As the taper increases, the stiffness increases first and then decreases. As the dam-width ratio increases, the leakage rate, the opening force, and the stiffness will increase correspondingly. The waviness amplitude has a small effect on these three performance parameters. Besides, the comparisons between the Reynolds approximation and the DNS technique show that the Reynolds approximation can be applied to analyze the leakage rate under different thicknesses, small tapers, and large dam-width ratios. The opening force under small thickness, different tapers, and different dam-width ratios can also be considered using the Reynolds approximation. To ensure the safe and stable operation of RCP, the optimal structural parameters can be set as taper β = 600 μrad, dam-width ratio ϖ = 0.2, waviness amplitude α = 0.8, and wavenumber k = 9.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3aliquids 3arenewable energy sources 3aseals 0aReactor coolant pump 0aHydrodynamic mechanical seal 0aWavy-tilt-dam 0aOpenFOAM1 aLi, Yang1 aWang, Ya-Hui1 aZhang, Ya-Ning1 aLi, Xiao-Bin1 aMa, You,0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Apr., v. 166 p.210-221dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100006000187245006400247300001600311520113400327592002801461596008301489596004501572650001601617650002701633650001101660650001301671650001501684650001701699650001301716650001401729650001601743650001001759650001701769651003101786653001601817653001701833653001401850653001701864653001901881653002201900700002101922700001801943773011601961856008302077852000902160655001202169IND60613340020221119080006.0190624e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061334002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2018.06.0082chorus7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2018.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJust, Michael G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2493-926910aImpervious surface thresholds for urban tree site selection  ap. 141-146.  aImpervious surfaces are a ubiquitous urban feature that increase temperature and tree drought stress and are a demonstrated indicator of Acer rubrum L. tree condition and insect pest abundance. We examined the relationship between A. rubrum condition, impervious surface cover, and Melanaspis tenebricosa (Comstock) abundance, a primary herbivore of urban A. rubrum, in eight cities across the southern distribution of A. rubrum. We predicted that the effects of warming, due to impervious surface, would be greater in warmer southern cities than in cooler northern cities. We found that impervious surface was a robust predictor of tree condition, but this effect was not significantly affected by background temperature. Melanaspis tenebricosa abundance was a function of impervious surface and background temperature, with greatest abundances occurring at mid latitudes. Based on these relationships, we developed impervious surface thresholds to inform site selection for A. rubrum throughout the southeastern USA. Planting criteria based on habitat characteristics should maximize urban tree longevity and services provided.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSGSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000203 3aAcer rubrum 3aMelanaspis tenebricosa 3acities 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3ainsect pests 3alatitude 3alongevity 3atemperature 3atrees 3awater stress 3aSoutheastern United States 0aAcer rubrum 0aGloomy scale 0aRed maple 0aStreet trees 0aTree condition 0aUrban heat island1 aFrank, Steven D.1 aDale, Adam G.0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2018 Aug., v. 34 p.141-146dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245008800179300001400267520175700281592002802038596009502066650002202161650002102183650001902204650001502223650002202238650001002260650001802270650001402288650001202302650001302314650001202327650001102339650001302350650001602363650002102379650002102400650002202421653002202443653001802465653001802483653001802501653002402519700001802543700003002561700002002591700001902611773012802630856008502758852000902843655001202852IND60630410420221122034715.0190207e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063041042DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2018.14653362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaeimirad, Mohammadreza10aMelt-spun PLA liquid-filled fibers: physical, morphological, and thermal properties  ap. 89-99.  aPLA hollow fibers with different internal diameters were produced as a media for liquid encapsulation via high-speed melt-spinning process, changing important parameters (e.g. material type, polymer throughput, extrusion temperature, quench flow rate, drawing ratio, and winding speed). Morphological analysis showed 300% increment (linear mode) for internal and outer diameters by increasing the polymer throughput from 14.6 to 87.6 ml/min while raising the winding speed from 500 to 1500 m/min resulted in decreasing 70 and 75% for internal and external diameters, respectively. Quench flow rate and extrusion temperature showed lower effect on just internal diameter. XRD patterns indicated that using higher drawing ratio led to increase in the fiber crystallinity. According to the physical studies, although the linear density was duplicated about 10 times by increasing the polymer throughput, but the winding speed reduced 300%. Adding the polymer throughput, as the main factor, caused the tensile strength, elongation at break, modulus, tenacity, and fracture toughness to be changed approximately +650%,+217%, –68%, –58%, and +1500%, respectively. Other parameters also influenced (described in text) on tensile performances. Thermal analysis showed lower thermal stability for the fibers extruded at higher temperature. DSC results also confirmed the same trend in the degree of crystallinity of the melt-spun fibers. Melt-spun fibers were filled with glycerol as a model liquid using the previously developed microfluidic approach. Biodegradable liquid-filled fibers were conducted on composting test. Successful biodegradation is a promising result for potential applications such as agriculture pesticide and medical drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data  a331088cMinistry of Science Research and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008798 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acomposting 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aextrusion 3afabrics 3aglycerol 3aliquids 3amodels 3apolymers 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3athermal analysis 3athermal stability 0aPLA hollow fibers 0amelt-spinning 0abiodegradable 0amicrofluidics 0aliquid-filled fiber1 aZadhoush, Ali1 aEsmaeely Neisiany, Rasoul1 aSalimian, Saeed1 aKotek, Richard0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 110, no. 1 p.89-99dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2018.14653363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245009200177300001600269520142700285592002801712650001101740650002101751650002001772650001501792650001101807650002201818650001501840650003201855650001201887650002401899651001001923653001501933653001101948653001001959653002401969653002701993700001302020773011102033856008502144852000902229655001202238IND60567469520221120095220.0190411e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056746952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalelign, Solomon Zena10aDynamics of rural livelihoods and environmental reliance: Empirical evidence from Nepal  ap. 199-209.  aUsing environmentally augmented panel dataset of 2009 and 2012 from four districts in Nepal, we assess environmental reliance of households in different livelihood strategies and dynamic transition groups. We employ a latent class cluster analysis to determine the optimal number of livelihood clusters and assign individual households to particular cluster; and regression models were used to examine the covariates of change in environmental income and reliance. The analysis identifies six distinct livelihood clusters in terms of asset investment in different livelihood activities. Results show that majority of households persist in the relatively lower remunerative livelihood strategies between 2009 and 2012. Environmental income is important to all livelihood strategies. However, households in the least remunerative strategy and downward transition group have higher environmental reliance. It is also found that households with upward transition are likely to have reduced environmental dependency. Hence, enhancement of poverty reduction strategies in supporting poorer household in asset accumulation and undertake alternative higher remunerative livelihood strategies will eventually reduce the pressure and dependency on environment. Furthermore, conservation policies and natural resource management are critical in the study areas to sustain the increased demands on environmental products and services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3anatural resource management 3apoverty 3aregression analysis 3aNepal 0aLivelihood 0aIncome 0aAsset 0aLatent Markov model 0aEnvironmental reliance1 aJiao, Xi0 tForest policy and economics.g2017 Oct., v. 83 p.199-209dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010100164300001800265500001900283520146700302592002801769650001601797650001701813650002401830650001901854650001701873650001701890650002401907650000701931650002301938650001501961650001601976700006401992700005802056700005802114773013202172856008202304852000902386655001202395IND60741406520221121041653.0210612e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074140652DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-020-04754-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUzay, Merve12aA study on rheological properties, sensory evaluation and shelf life of ayran–shalgam mixtures  ap. 2479-2486.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAyran, a dairy-based fermented beverage, and shalgam, a plant-based fermented beverage were mixed [25% ayran + 75% shalgam (v/v), 50% ayran + 50% shalgam (v/v) and 75% ayran + 25% shalgam (v/v)] and rheological data were obtained at different temperature levels (4–12 °C). Power law model was used to describe the data. Temperature had no effect on the flow behavior index, but it affected the consistency index of the mixtures. Ayran–shalgam mixtures had similar flow behavior index with that of shalgam irrespective of the levels of ayran or shalgam. However, consistency index increased as the amount of ayran increased in the mixtures at a constant temperature. Mixture with the higher amount of ayran [75% ayran + 25% shalgam] had the highest scores in sensory evaluation. Shelf life analyses up to 4 weeks at 4 °C indicated that serum separation increased till the second week and then stabilized for all mixtures. Slight increase (0.05–0.1 unit) in pH was observed during the first week then pH values were stabilized just like the serum separation. Microbiological analyses revealed that mixtures had a similar shelf life with that of ayran. Consequently, mixture of two different fermented beverages could be possible with similar flow behavior and shelf-life, and ayran–shalgam mixture has a huge potential for commercial production. This study may be a basis for designing new products to fulfill the healthy diet demands.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3afermentation 3afermented beverages 3afermented milk 3afood science 3ahealthy diet 3amathematical models 3apH 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3atemperature1 aÖztürk, Hale İnci1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8334-04031 aBuzrul, Sencer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2272-38271 aMaskan, Medeni1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6313-897X0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2021 July, v. 58, no. 7 p.2479-2486dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04754-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007900172300001400251520164400265592002801909650002401937650001201961650002501973650001501998650001902013650003002032650001102062650001202073650001002085650002002095650001802115651001402133653002302147653002502170653003002195653001902225653002302244653002502267700002102292700002502313773010802338856008502446852000902531655001202540IND60567469720221120095214.0181015e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056746972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRissman, Adena R.10aPublic support for carrot, stick, and no-government water quality policies  ap. 82-89.  aPublic support for environmental policy provides an important foundation for democratic governance. Numerous policy innovations may improve nonpoint source pollution, but little research has examined which types of individuals are likely to support various runoff reduction policies. We conducted a household mail survey of 1136 residents in southern Wisconsin. In general, residents were more likely to support water quality policies if they were communitarians, egalitarians, concerned about water pollution, and perceived water quality as poor. The majority of respondents somewhat to strongly supported all of the seven proposed water quality policies, but opposed relying on voluntary action without government involvement on farms. Residents had higher support for incentives and market-based approaches (carrot policies) than regulation and taxes (stick policies). A more complicated pattern emerged in within-subject comparisons of residents’ views of carrot and stick approaches. Stick approaches polarized respondents by decreasing support among people with individualistic worldviews, while slightly increasing support among people with communitarian worldviews. Residents with an agricultural occupation were more likely to support voluntary, non-governmental approaches for reducing agricultural runoff, and were also more likely to support regulation for reducing urban lawn runoff. This research highlights the dominant role of cultural worldviews and the secondary roles of water pollution concern, perceived water quality, and self-interest in explaining support for diverse policies to reduce nonpoint source pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural runoff 3acarrots 3aenvironmental policy 3agovernance 3alawns and turf 3anonpoint source pollution 3apeople 3asurveys 3ataxes 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aWisconsin 0aCultural cognition 0aEnvironmental policy 0aNonpoint source pollution 0aPolicy support 0aPublic preferences 0aWater quality policy1 aKohl, Patrice A.1 aWardropper, Chloe B.0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2017 Oct., v. 76 p.82-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01748naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002200164245003700186300001800223520071500241592002800956650001600984650002501000650001701025650002101042650001701063650002601080650001601106650001301122700001601135700002001151700002101171700003001192773009701222856004601319852000901365655001201374IND50089484920221119091404.0140509e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008948492DNAL7 a248113502pmid7 a10.1111/1750-3841.124342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudak, Nilgün H.10aFunctional Properties of Vinegar  ap.

Here, we assess the drivers of changes in greenness from 2000 to 2015 in Northwest China (NW China). We used multiple stepwise linear regression (MSLR), redundancy analysis (RDA), and 12 other models to quantify the impacts of precipitation and temperature metrics, gross domestic product (GDP), population, and grazing intensity on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at three administrative levels (county, town, and village), four temporal levels (yearly, May, July, and September), two vegetation types (woodland and grassland), and at annual precipitation gradients of <200, 200–400, and >400 mm. The results suggest that NW China underwent vegetation greening from 2000 to 2015. Precipitation and temperature were the most influential factors contributing to the NDVI change. Population was the main determinant of NDVI under the precipitation gradient of <200 mm, and the effect of GDP on NDVI was moderate. On the temporal scale, annual precipitation, precipitation before the previous year, and precipitation in the current year determined the NDVI in May, July, and September, respectively, for both woodland and grassland. At multiple scales, climate change was the primary driver of vegetation change in NW China, rather than human disturbance. These findings expand our understanding on drivers of NDVI at multiple levels over a long period. Measures to manage decreasing vegetation coverage may be more effective and could be implemented sooner based on predicted climate change in drylands worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC0505606cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarid lands 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agrasslands 3agross domestic product 3aland management 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3avillages 3awoodlands 3aChina1 aZhang, Yang1 aPeng, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2647-76271 aHuang, Yihang1 aZhu, Lu1 aWu, Zhuoyi1 aWang, Jing1 aCui, Yixin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.13782-13796dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16774-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245007700205300001600282506010400298506007600402520085800478592002801336506003701364650001201401650001501413650001901428650001701447650001901464651001901483653001901502653001201521653001301533653001301546653001901559653001601578700005901594700005601653700005801709700006101767700006801828773010801896856008102004852000902085655001202094IND60770207620221207072559.0220606e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077020762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2022.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTirados, Iñaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9771-488010aVector control and entomological capacity for onchocerciasis elimination  ap. 591-604.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin is currently the main strategy to achieve elimination of transmission (EoT) of onchocerciasis. Modelling suggests that EoT may not be reached in all endemic foci using annual MDA alone. Onchocerciasis and loiasis are coendemic in forest areas of Central Africa where ivermectin treatment can lead to severe adverse events in individuals with heavy loiasis load, rendering MDA inappropriate. Vector control has been proposed as a complementary intervention strategy. Here, we discuss (i) achievements and pitfalls of previous interventions; (ii) epidemiological impact, feasibility, and combination with MDA to accelerate and/or protect EoT; (iii) role of modelling; (iv) opportunities for innovative methods of vector monitoring and control; and (v) strengthening entomological capacity in endemic countries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aforests 3aivermectin 3aonchocerciasis 3aparasitology 3avector control 3aCentral Africa 0aonchocerciasis 0aloiasis 0aSimulium 0aChrysops 0avector control 0aelimination1 aThomsen, Edward1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1136-64301 aWorrall, Eve1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9147-33881 aKoala, Lassane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6868-95161 aMelachio, Tito T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5847-758X1 aBasáñez, Maria Gloria,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5031-33610 tTrends in parasitology.g2022 July, v. 38, no. 7 p.591-604dElsevier LtdwJournal:6336x1471-49227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2022.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300001600274520144900290592002801739650002101767650001001788650002001798650001001818650001201828650001801840650002301858650002101881650001601902650004301918650000901961650001801970700002201988700002402010700002602034700002502060700001802085700002502103773010002128856008102228852000902309655001202318IND60120824520221119172104.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012082452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-013-2862-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalejo, Ana I.10aDifferences in the expression pattern of HCN isoforms among mammalian tissues: sources and implications  ap. 297-307.  aHyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels play a critical role in a broad range of cell types, but the expression of the various HCN isoforms is still poorly understood. In the present study we have compared the expression of HCN isoforms in rat excitable and non-excitable tissues at both the mRNA and protein levels. Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of the four HCN isoforms in brain, heart, pituitary and kidney, with inconsistent mRNA-protein expression correlation. The HCN2 was the most abundant mRNA transcript (95.6, 78.0 and 59.0 % in kidney heart and pituitary, respectively) except in the brain (42.0 %) whereas HCN4 was the most abundant protein isoform. Our results suggest that HCN channels are mostly produced by the HCN4 isoform in heart, which contrasts with the sharp differences in the isoform stoichiometry in pituitary (15 HCN4:2 HCN2:1 HCN1:1 HCN3), kidney (24 HCN4:2 HCN3:1 HCN2:1 HCN1) and brain (3 HCN4:2 HCN2:1 HCN1:1 HCN3). Moreover, deviations of the electrophoretic molecular weight (MW) of the HCN isoforms relative to the theoretical MW were observed, suggesting that N-glycosylation and enzymatic proteolysis influences HCN channel surface expression. We hypothesize that selective cleavage of HCN channels by membrane bound metalloendopeptidases could account for the multiplicity of properties of native HCN channels in different tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abrain 3aelectrophoresis 3aheart 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3ametalloproteinases 3amolecular weight 3aproteolysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3astoichiometry1 aReverendo, Marisa1 aSilva, Virgília S.1 aPereira, Patrícia M.1 aSantos, Manuel A.

E849-E858.  aThe effect of concentration of carbohydrates on viscoelastic properties of corn and rice starch is discussed in this paper. The texture of starch pastes was estimated using a fractional rheological linear standard solid model. Rheological parameters of the model were identified and their changes for different values of sugar concentrations in the 2 tested starches were discussed. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The fractional rheological models can be very useful to control the biomaterial texture for the needs of final product, which is particularly significant from the point of view of materials engineering. The proposed method for interpretation of the results of rheological measurements of these pastes allows for a comprehensive estimation of the analyzed biomaterial texture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3aengineering 3amodels 3apastes 3arice starch 3astarch 3asugars 3atexture 3aviscoelasticity1 aDziubiński, Marek0 tJournal of food science.g2014 May, v. 79, no. 5 p.E849-E858dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.12445  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100003300191245010000224300001800324506007600342520146700418592002801885506003701913650001801950650001901968650001401987650002002001650002002021650001802041650002202059650001502081650001702096650001202113700002302125700002002148700002002168700002002188700001402208700002002222700002002242700001802262700002502280700002102305700001602326700001802342700001802360773011002378856008602488852000902574655001202583IND60560937320221207112438.0170118e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056093732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b038902doi7 aPMC52444342pmcid7 a279837882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontenegro Burke, J.

Even though personal computers have become more powerful, data transfer times still represent a bottleneck in data processing because of the increasingly complex data files and studies with a greater number of samples. To meet the demand of analyzing hundreds to thousands of samples within a given experiment, we have developed a data streaming platform, XCMS Stream, which capitalizes on the acquisition time to compress and stream recently acquired data files to data processing servers, mimicking just-in-time production strategies from the manufacturing industry. The utility of this XCMS Online-based technology is demonstrated here in the analysis of T cell metabolism and other large-scale metabolomic studies. A large scale example on a 1000 sample data set demonstrated a 10 000-fold time savings, reducing data analysis time from days to minutes. Further, XCMS Stream has the capability to increase the efficiency of downstream biochemical dependent data acquisition (BDDA) analysis by initiating data conversion and data processing on subsets of data acquired, expanding its application beyond data transfer to smart preliminary data decision-making prior to full acquisition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3achromatography 3acomputers 3adata collection 3adecision making 3amanufacturing 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolomics 3astreams1 aAisporna, Aries E.1 aBenton, H.

The sites cover wetland, cropland, woodland, grassland and tundra ecosystems. Up to twenty measured variables from the sites are variously correlated with NEE. A comparison of Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients reveals that the variables are behaving parametrically with respect to NEE for the wetland, woodland (two out of three sites) and tundra locations, but non-parametrically for cropland and grassland sites. Multi-linear regression (MLR) analysis also distinguishes those ecosystems. MLR predicted versus calculated NEE follow Y ≈ X relationships for the wetland and tundra sites, whereas for the other ecosystems the MLR results follow Y≠X trends. Moreover, the coefficient values of the MLR optimum solutions for each ecosystem reveal quite distinct relative influences of the measured variables on the NEE predicted values. These results imply that NEE at wetland and tundra sites can be relatively easily predicted from the FLUXNET2015 set of recorded variables. On the other hand, the other three types of ecosystem sites cannot be easily predicted from those variables, implying that other factors substantially influence NEE at those sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3agrasslands 3anet ecosystem exchange 3atundra 3awetlands 3awoodlands 0aEddy covariance 0aFLUXNET2015 monitored sites 0aCorrelations 0aRegression coefficients 0aInfluencing variables 0aAmeriFlux sites0 tEcological complexity.g2022 June, v. 50 p.100998-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.1009983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009600170500002200266520099100288592002801279650001501307650001201322650000901334650001601343653001201359653001601371653002201387653002701409653002001436653001401456700002101470700002001491700001901511700001901530773009701549856008201646852000901728655001201737IND60570522520221119024729.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057052252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuchiya, Takashi10aEndogenous peptide profile for elucidating biosynthetic processing of the ghrelin precursor  aPre-press version  aGhrelin is an orexigenic peptide primarily produced by gastric endocrine cells. The biosynthetic cleavage site of ghrelin has been well documented, but how its downstream region undergoes proteolytic processing remains poorly explored. Here, we provide the first snapshot of endogenous peptides from the ghrelin precursor by profiling the secretopeptidome of cultured mouse ghrelin-producing cells during exocytosis. Mapping of MS/MS sequenced peptides to the precursor highlighted three atypical monobasic processing sites, including the established C-terminus of ghrelin and the N-terminal cleavage site for obestatin, a putative 23-amino-acid C-terminally amidated peptide. However, we found that mouse obestatin does not occur in the form originally reported, but that a different amidation site is used to generate a shorter peptide. These data can be extended to study and characterize the precursor-derived peptides located downstream of ghrelin in different biological contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexocytosis 3aghrelin 3amice 3aproteolysis 0aGhrelin 0aPeptidomics 0aMass spectrometry 0aProteolytic processing 0aPhosphorylation 0aObestatin1 aIwakura, Hiroshi1 aMinamino, Naoto1 aKangawa, Kenji1 aSasaki, Kazuki0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007000171520109600241592002801337650001101365650002901376650001701405650002201422650001501444650001401459650000901473650001101482650001101493653001301504653002701517653001801544653001701562653001701579700005901596700006001655773010101715856008501816852000901901655001201910IND60770208020221120163305.0220606e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077020802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.1010002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFábián, Virág10aLoop analysis quantifying human impact in a river ecosystem model  aIn ecological systems, multiple interactions connect various kinds of components. Strong and weak as well as positive and negative effects cause complex dynamics and often quite unpredictable processes. Human impact is added to this complexity, with all of its diverse effects. In this paper, we present a case study on the Kelian river ecosystem (Borneo), connecting pristine habitats upstream, a gold mine close to the middle section and human settlements downstream. For six locations, separate food web models had been developed earlier. Here we first analyze the ecological system by loop analysis and compare its outcome for different sites. Second, we identify the most crucial human impacts and implement these in modified loop analysis models. We determine the sign of various effects and study the consistency of human impact on different sites and various organisms. Adding human impact to the models (1) increased the ratio of clear predictions, (2) caused the appearance of “zero” predictions in three sites and (3) reduced the variability of predictability along the river.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorneo 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3aecological models 3aecosystems 3afood webs 3agold 3ahumans 3arivers 0afood web 0asocio-ecological model 0aloop analysis 0ahuman impact 0aKelian river1 aReguly, István1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4385-42041 aJordán, Ferenc,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0224-64720 tEcological complexity.g2022 June, v. 50 p.101000-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2022.1010003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245019700172520133700369592002801706650001601734650000801750650001001758650001501768650001101783650004301794653001601837653002201853653002701875653002401902653003701926653001201963653000801975653000901983653000801992653000902000653000902009653000902018700002502027700002502052700001802077773008802095856008302183852000902266655001202275IND60793930120221123015323.0220929e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079393012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2022.1469022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd-Alameer, Manhal10aSAG-dihydrochloride enhanced the expression of germ cell markers in the human bone marrow- mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) through the activation of GLI-independent hedgehog signaling pathway  aDifferent studies indicated that the enhancing the expression of germ cell markers improved the efficiency of stem cells in the generation of germ line cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of SAG-dihydrochloride on the expression of germ cell markers in the human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). For this purpose, the human BM-MSCs were cultured in the medium containing different concentrations of SAG-dihydrochloride (10, 20 and 30 µM). After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, the expression level of PTCH1, GLI1, PLZF, DDX4 and STRA8 genes were determined by using SYBR Green Real time PCR. The analysis of the results obtained from PTCH1 and GLI1 expression indicated that SAG-dihydrochloride had the ability to enhance the expression of germ cell markers in a Gli-independent manner. Furthermore, the significant increased expression of STRA8 was observed in the BM-MSCs treated by 10 µM SAG-dihydrochloride for 4 and 6 days (p < 0.05). There was also the up-regulation of DDX4 in the BM-MSCs following treatment with 20 µM SAG-dihydrochloride for 4 and 6 days. The obtained results suggested that treatment with SAG-dihydrochloride increased the expression of germ cell markers in the human BM-MSCs through the activation of non-canonical sonic hedgehog signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErinaceidae 3aRNA 3agenes 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aInfertility 0aGerm cell markers 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aSAG-dihydrochloride 0aSonic hedgehog signaling pathway 0aBM-MSCs 0aART 0aMSCs 0aSHH 0aGSCs 0aPGCs 0aESCs1 aRajabibazl, Masoumeh1 aEsmaeilizadeh, Zahra1 aFazeli, Zahra0 tGene.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 849 p.146902-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.1469023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002000164245011700184300001800301520158600319592002801905650001601933650001201949650001401961650001001975650002901985650001102014650001902025650001602044650004402060650001502104700001402119700002102133700001802154773009702172856004602269852000902315655001202324IND50089485320221119091402.0140509e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008948532DNAL7 a247584202pmid7 a10.1111/1750-3841.124382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeo, Ji‐Young10aDetermination of Lutein from Green Tea and Green Tea By‐Products Using Accelerated Solvent Extraction and UPLC  ap. C816-C821.  aWe aimed to identify the optimum conditions for the extraction of lutein from green tea using accelerated solvent extraction, and achieve improved analytical resolution and sensitivity between lutein and zeaxanthin using an ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. The optimized method employed 80% ethanol as the extraction solvent, 160 °C as the temperature, 2 static cycles, and 5 min of static time. In the validation of the UPLC method, recovery was found to be in the range approximately 93.73 to 108.79%, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9974 and a relative standard deviation of <9.29% in inter‐ and intraday precision analyses. Finally, the lutein contents of green tea and green tea by‐products were measured as 32.67 ± 0.70 and 18.18 ± 0.68 mg/100g dw, respectively. Furthermore, we verified that green tea by‐products, which are discarded after producing green tea beverages, might be used as a great resource for massive lutein production. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: We have demonstrated that the common problem of inadequate resolution between lutein and zeaxanthin during carotenoid analyses can be overcome by optimizing the combined techniques of accelerated solvent extraction and ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). UPLC was highly effective for saving time, solvent, and labor, as well as providing better resolution. The results in this study demonstrated that green tea by‐products could be used as new sources for industrial lutein production owing to their massive production during the extraction of green tea beverages.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aethanol 3agreen tea 3alabor 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3alutein 3atea (beverage) 3atemperature 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3azeaxanthin1 aKim, Suna1 aKang, Jae‐Hyun1 aMoon, BoKyung0 tJournal of food science.g2014 May, v. 79, no. 5 p.C816-C821dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.12438  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245012900206300001800335520116200353592002801515596006301543596009801606650003101704650003201735650001801767650001401785650002401799650001101823650001601834650002401850650001401874650001001888700001301898700001601911700001401927700001401941700001801955700001901973700005601992773011602048856008102164961000902245852000902254655001202263IND60615246020221122225051.0181009e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061524602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-018-3970-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaoting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3002-932814aThe complete genomic sequence of a novel megabirnavirus from Fusarium pseudograminearum, the causal agent of wheat crown rot  ap. 3173-3175.  aA novel double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) mycovirus, named Fusarium pseudograminearum megabirnavirus 1 (FpgMBV1), was found in a hypovirulent strain FC136-2A of Fusarium pseudograminearum, the causal agent of wheat crown rot. The complete genome of FpgMBV1 comprised two dsRNA segments, L1-dsRNA (8951 bp) and L2-dsRNA (5337 bp). Both dsRNAs carry two open reading frames on the positive strand. L1-dsRNA potentially encodes a 131.3-kDa coat protein (CP) and a 126.3-kDa RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), while L2-dsRNA encodes two putative proteins of 97.2 kDa and 30.6 kDa with unknown functions. As found in members of the family Megabirnaviridae, the 5’- and 3’-terminal sequences of L1-dsRNA and L2-dsRNA of FpgMBV1 are highly conserved. The identity between L1-dsRNA (1630 nt) and L2-dsRNA (1682 nt) is 88.95%, and the first 236 nt (nt 1-236) are exactly identical. The 3’ UTRs of L1-dsRNA (155 nt) and L2-dsRNA (109 nt) are 66.67% identical, with identical terminal hexamer sequences (5’-AAAAGC-3’). Phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequences of the RdRps indicated that FpgMBV1 is a new member of the family Megabirnaviridae.  aPublisher supplied data  a182102110004cNatural Science Foundation of Henan Province  a201503112cNational Special Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest of China 3aFusarium pseudograminearum 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3acoat proteins 3acrown rot 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenome 3amycoviruses 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3awheat1 aGao, Fei1 aZhang, Fang1 aXie, Yuan1 aZhou, Lin1 aYuan, Hongxia1 aZhang, Songbai1 aLi, Honglian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9296-50740 tArchives of virology.g2018 Nov., v. 163, no. 11 p.3173-3175dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3970-z3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010200172300001400274520200900288592002802297650001702325650002502342650002302367650002302390650001502413650001502428650001002443650001502453650001202468650001702480651001002497653002202507653001202529653002702541653002702568653002502595700002202620700002502642700002302667773010802690856008502798852000902883655001202892IND60567470020221120031408.0180904e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056747002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpanò, Marinella10aAre ecosystem service hotspots located in protected areas? Results from a study in Southern Italy  ap. 52-60.  aEcosystems are essential in providing multiple services to society. However, understanding ecosystem services (ESS) in terms of spatial distribution and trade-offs still remains a challenge for landscape planners and natural resource managers. In this paper, we analyzed the supply of a set of ESS – carbon storage, soil erosion protection, biodiversity, and recreation – within the landscape surrounding the city of Bari in Southern Italy. Through an analysis of this landscape, which includes natural protected areas, such as Natura 2000 Network sites, national and regional parks and nature reserves, and in view of the recent Fitness Check of the Nature Directives, we aimed to provide answers to the following questions: (i) Where are the areas of high and low supply of individual ecosystem services located?; (ii) Where do ecosystem service trade-offs (i.e., ‘hotspots’ and ‘coldspots’) occur?; and (iii) To what extent are ecosystem service hotspots and coldspots located within or outside of natural protected areas? Results show that most of the landscape in the study area supplied at least one of the selected ESS and that ESS hotspots were mostly located within forested and/or natural areas. Hotspots occupied 8.0% of the total landscape, with 23.7% located in natural protected areas. Coldspots were scarce and equal to 2.4%; they constituted only 0.1% of natural protected areas. Almost all of the landscape (89.6%) consists of intermediate areas (i.e., between hotspots and coldspots); 76.2% of natural protected areas consists of intermediate areas. This latter finding is relevant because the high intermediate classes are potentially high-performing areas, which lie mainly on the borders of protected spaces; they can positively influence ecological processes and thus enhance a wide-ranging provision of ESS. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing landscapes to facilitate the selection of priority areas where management efforts would yield maximum benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acarbon sequestration 3aconservation areas 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3alandscapes 3aparks 3arecreation 3asociety 3asoil erosion 3aItaly 0aEcosystem service 0aHotspot 0aNatural protected area 0aSustainable management 0aSustainable planning1 aLeronni, Vincenzo1 aLafortezza, Raffaele1 aGentile, Francesco0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2017 July, v. 73 p.52-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013300172300001600305520133800321592002801659650002101687650001901708650001701727650001201744650002201756650002901778650002101807650002101828651001001849653002101859653001901880653002201899653004001921653003801961773007801999856008302077852000902160655001202169IND60564568120221117010331.0170713e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishijima, Daisuke14aThe role of technology, product lifetime, and energy efficiency in climate mitigation: A case study of air conditioners in Japan  ap. 340-347.  aThis study analyzed the impact on the life-cycle CO2 emissions derived from a specific durable good (i.e., household air conditioners in this study) of industrial technology changes, product lifetime changes, and energy efficiency improvements. I proposed a comprehensive structural decomposition analysis including two factors of average lifetime and energy efficiency trend of household air conditioners and applied the decomposition method to the Japanese environmental input-output tables of 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. The empirical results show that “Household air-conditioner sector” itself contributed to reducing life-cycle CO2 emissions derived from household air conditioners, while other sectors such as “On-site power generation sector” and “Retail trade sector” contributed to increasing life-cycle CO2 emissions derived from household air conditioners. I also conducted combined scenario analysis about reduction potential of product lifetime and energy efficiency of air conditioners and the results showed the reduction rate of energy efficiency necessary for maintain CO2 emissions in 2005 at 1990 level on each average lifetime scenario. (e.g. if average lifetime of air conditioners is shortened by 1 year, energy efficiency of air conditioners have to be further improved by 20.6% from current level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3apower generation 3aretail marketing 3aJapan 0aProduct lifetime 0aLife-cycle CO2 0aEnergy efficiency 0aEnvironmental input-output analysis 0aStructural decomposition analysis0 tEnergy Policy.g2017 May, v. 104 p.340-347dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013700163300001600300520167500316592002801991650001102019650002602030650002202056650002402078650001702102650001402119650001902133650001502152650001502167650001102182650001902193650001602212650002102228650001702249650001502266651001002281653002202291653002202313653003102335653003902366653002502405700005202430773011602482856008302598852000902681655001202690IND60613340820221119080013.0190624e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061334082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2018.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Baojie10aConstructing community gardens? Residents’ attitude and behaviour towards edible landscapes in emerging urban communities of China  ap. 154-165.  aCommunity gardens are very popular in developed countries, providing multiple benefits to inhabitants. In developing China, residents in many emerging urban communities of China have been appropriating and reclaiming public open spaces intentionally as a leisure opportunity and transforming their entertainment functions into vegetable plots, which has caused a series of conflicts and disputes. However, this issue of informal community gardening has rarely been discussed formally at community level. Therefore, this study aims to learn and better understand what factors motivate residents to reclaim existing public open spaces for gardening and cultivating plants. The approach was to select and study informal community gardens in three urbanizing communities in Hangzhou, China. These emerging communities consist, to a significant extent, of people with farming experience, who have relocated here from previously rural areas during the urban expansion from the year 2000 to the current day. The informal community gardening takes place in the context of lack of community management, neglected public infrastructure and a disregard for resident’s living needs such as their personal sentiment, social activity, food quality and saving expenses. While most people are willing to participate in community gardening and those who do not want to contribute are not substantially against the activity. In the conclusions, suggestions are made about how to fulfil resident’s requirements and are presented at both community and city levels so that they may inform to the growth of emerging communities in other cities and countries undergoing rapid urbanization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acitizen participation 3acommunity gardens 3adeveloped countries 3afood quality 3agardening 3ainfrastructure 3alandscapes 3aopen space 3apeople 3apublic opinion 3arural areas 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3avegetables 3aChina 0aCommunity gardens 0aEdible landscapes 0aEmerging urban communities 0aPerceived attitudes and behaviours 0aDeveloping countries1 aZhu, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4869-49800 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2018 Aug., v. 34 p.154-165dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245007400175300001600249520219200265592002802457650000902485650001002494650001202504650001502516650001102531650001502542650001802557650001202575650002102587650001602608650001602624650002202640650001202662650001102674650001202685651001302697651001102710653001102721653002502732653001802757653002202775700002102797700002202818700002402840773010702864856008502971852000903056655001203065IND60570522720221119024722.0190214e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057052272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaves, Willandia A.10aMarket access and wild meat consumption in the central Amazon, Brazil  ap. 240-248.  aWild meat is an important source of food and income for people across the tropics, but overhunting is driving species declines. Comprehension of the interrelated factors that influence wild meat consumption is needed to help address this important issue. A central hypothesis is that market access in the tropics drives consumption. We tested this hypothesis by comparing households with high (living in a town) and low (living in rural areas) market access in the central Amazon. When comparing households in rural communities only, we used travel frequency to town and boat traffic as proxies for market access. To determine interrelationships, we assessed other factors that may influence meat consumption, such as occupation, wealth, and number of people in households. As predicted, town residents consumed more domesticated meat and less wild meat than rural residents. Among rural communities, travel frequency was negatively, and boat traffic was positively, associated with wild meat consumption. Occupation was an important predictor of consumption, with farmers (occupation more common in rural areas) consuming more wild meat than people with other occupations. Number of people in the household was negatively associated with beef consumption. Wealth was associated with wild meat and beef consumption but its effect on consumption was negligible (effect size near zero). When comparing urban and rural residents, we detected a strong relationship between market access and wild meat consumption, but this was influenced by the diversity of livelihood options available to town versus rural residents. Among rural residents, we detected a relationship between market access and wild meat consumption, but this relationship depended on the nature of the market access (household travel frequency to town versus boat traffic at rural communities). Our findings suggest that greater access to market may lead to a decrease in wild meat consumption at the household level. Key factors we did not address, however, require further research in rural communities; namely whether reduced consumption leads to overall reduction in hunting or merely a shift from consumption to trade.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3aboats 3afarmers 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3alivelihood 3amarket access 3amarkets 3ameat consumption 3aoccupations 3arural areas 3arural communities 3atraffic 3atravel 3atropics 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aAmazon 0aBushmeat consumption 0aMarket access 0aMeat alternatives1 aWilkie, David S.1 aMonroe, Martha C.1 aSieving, Kathryn E.0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Aug., v. 212 p.240-248dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002500164245009200189300001800281520100000299592002801299650001701327650002901344650001601373650001401389650001501403650001101418650001201429650002401441650002201465650001301487650001401500700002801514773009701542856004601639852000901685655001201694IND50089485420221119091603.0140509e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008948542DNAL7 a247547832pmid7 a10.1111/1750-3841.124492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGangidi, Rahul Reddy10aConjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) Formation in Edible Oils by Photoisomerization: A Review  ap.

Fifteen horses were administered pulsed INO and 15 served as controls. After baseline data collection, pulsed INO delivery commenced. Arterial and venous blood were collected and analysed. Cardiorespiratory parameters were measured, and oxygen content and F-shunt were calculated.Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) increased from 10.9±5.7 kPa (82±43 mmHg) and 93±6% to 17.3±6.9 kPa (134±52 mmHg) (p<0.0001) and 98±2% (p<0.0001), respectively, in horses administered pulsed INO. In the control group, PaO2 and SaO2 decreased from 13.9±9.1 kPa (104±68 mmHg) and 93±7% to 12.1±8.6 kPa (91±65 mmHg) (p=0.0413) and 91±8% (p=0.0256), respectively. At the end of anaesthesia, the oxygen content was significantly higher in horses administered pulsed INO compared to controls (p=0.0126). The calculated F-shunt decreased from 39±10% to 27±6% (p<0.0001) in horses administered pulsed INO, and remained unchanged in controls, 40±12% to 44±12%. Blood lactate concentration decreased (–17±21%) in horses administered pulsed INO (p=0.0119), whereas no difference was measured in controls (2±31%).The present study showed that it is possible to effectively reduce the F-shunt and improve arterial oxygenation in horses during abdominal surgery by continuous delivery of pulsed INO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3ablood 3abutorphanol 3acolic 3adata collection 3adiazepam 3ahorses 3aisoflurane 3aketamine 3alactic acid 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen 3asurgery 3aveterinary clinics 0aanaesthesia 0acolic 0ahorse 0ahypoxaemia 0anitric oxide1 aGranswed, Izabella1 aNyman, Görel0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2017 Sept., v. 44, no. 5 p.1139-1148dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaa.2016.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011600168300001600284520138000300592002801680650001901708650001101727650001801738650001701756650002101773650001701794653003701811653001901848653003501867653002001902653001501922700001401937700001901951773009701970856008502067852000902152655001202161IND60719506420221117230844.0210201e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071950642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qiliang10aTechno-economic assessment of performance-enhanced parabolic trough receiver in concentrated solar power plants  ap. 629-643.  aSolar-to-thermal conversion efficiency of the parabolic trough collector significantly degrades at high operating temperatures, which exerts seriously negative effects on the development of parabolic trough collectors. To solve this knotty problem, based on the theory of the negative thermal-flux region, a novel parabolic trough solar receiver with a radiation shield was proposed, manufactured, and tested. In this framework, the proposed solar receiver is employed in the concentrated solar power plants using solar salt as the heat transfer fluid to analyze its feasibility in real solar power plants. In this study, the mathematical models of heat collection and economic assessment are established, and the simulation results yield a good agreement with the experimental data. The techno-economic performances of the solar power plants installing the proposed solar receivers in three typical areas under different installed capacities and thermal storage capacities are comprehensively investigated. The results demonstrate that the proposed solar receiver has a great potential for significant enhancement of the techno-economic performance of the solar power plant. The solar power plant with the proposed solar receivers located in Dunhuang can effectively improve the annual net electrical energy production by 9.77%, reduce the levelized cost of energy by 8.67%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aParabolic trough collector (PTC) 0aSolar receiver 0aConcentrated solar power (CSP) 0aTechno-economic 0aEfficiency1 aPei, Gang1 aYang, Hongxing0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Apr., v. 167 p.629-643dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245013800208300001700346506007600363520103300439592002801472506003701500650000801537650000801545650001301553650001901566650001201585650001701597650001301614650001201627650001601639650002501655653001101680653001901691653001501710653000901725653001801734653001601752653001801768653001901786700001801805700002701823700001801850700002401868700001901892700002101911700002201932700002701954700002401981773010602005856008502111852000902196655001202205IND60605773720221207131122.0200128e20180705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060577372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.0052doi7 aPMC60635222pmcid7 a299799682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, Ryan10aEnhanced Bacterial Immunity and Mammalian Genome Editing via RNA-Polymerase-Mediated Dislodging of Cas9 from Double-Strand DNA Breaks  ap. 42-55.e8.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe ability to target the Cas9 nuclease to DNA sequences via Watson-Crick base pairing with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) has provided a dynamic tool for genome editing and an essential component of adaptive immune systems in bacteria. After generating a double-stranded break (DSB), Cas9 remains stably bound to DNA. Here, we show persistent Cas9 binding blocks access to the DSB by repair enzymes, reducing genome editing efficiency. Cas9 can be dislodged by translocating RNA polymerases, but only if the polymerase approaches from one direction toward the Cas9-DSB complex. By exploiting these RNA-polymerase/Cas9 interactions, Cas9 can be conditionally converted into a multi-turnover nuclease, mediating increased mutagenesis frequencies in mammalian cells and enhancing bacterial immunity to bacteriophages. These consequences of a stable Cas9-DSB complex provide insights into the evolution of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences and a simple method of improving selection of highly active sgRNAs for genome editing.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aRNA 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3aenzymes 3agene editing 3aimmunity 3amammals 3amutagenesis 3anucleotide sequences 0aCRISPR 0agenome editing 0aDNA repair 0aCas9 0aphage biology 0astrand bias 0atranscription 0aRNA polymerase1 aHeler, Robert1 aMacDougall, Matthew S.1 aYeo, Nan Cher1 aChávez, Alejandro,1 aRegan, Maureen1 aHanakahi, Leslyn1 aChurch, George M.1 aMarraffini, Luciano A.1 aMerrill, Bradley J.0 tMolecular cell.g2018 July 05, v. 71, no. 1 p.42-55.e8dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008600163300001100249520170400260592002801964596004501992596008302037650002602120650001002146650001302156650001702169650000902186650001602195650002802211650001402239650003102253650002402284651002202308700001802330700001402348700002002362700001802382700002102400700002202421700006202443773011502505856008302620852000902703655001202712IND60741407420221120214324.0220301e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074140742DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-021-00950-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClune, Tom10aChlamydia pecorum detection in aborted and stillborn lambs from Western Australia  ap. 84.  aLamb survival is an important welfare and productivity issue for sheep industries worldwide. Lower lamb survival has been reported for primiparous ewes, but the causes of this are not well studied. The aim of this study was to determine causes of perinatal deaths for lambs born to primiparous ewes in Western Australia, and identify if infectious diseases are implicated. Lamb mortality from birth to marking were determined for 11 primiparous ewe flocks on 10 farms in Western Australia. Lamb mortality from birth to marking averaged 14% for single-born and 26% for multiple-born lambs. Lamb necropsies (n = 298) identified starvation–mismosthering–exposure (34%), dystocia (24%) and stillbirth (15%) as the most common causes of perinatal lamb death. There was no evidence of exotic abortigenic pathogens in aborted and stillborn lambs (n = 35). Chlamydia pecorum was detected by qPCR in 15/35 aborted and stillborn lambs on 5/6 farms. Preliminary molecular characterisation of C. pecorum detected in samples from aborted and stillborn lambs (n = 8) using both Multilocus Sequence Typing and ompA genotyping indicated all strains were genetically identical to previously described pathogenic livestock strains, denoted ST23, and dissimilar to gastrointestinal strains. High frequency of detection of a pathogenic C. pecorum strains ST23 associated with ovine abortion and stillbirth on multiple farms located across a wide geographic area has not been previously reported. Chlamydia pecorum may contribute to reproductive wastage for primiparous sheep in Western Australia. Further investigation to understand C. pecorum epidemiology and impact on sheep reproduction is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data  aB.AHE.0318cMeat and Livestock Australia  aDE190100238cAustralian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award 3aChlamydophila pecorum 3adeath 3adystocia 3aepidemiology 3aewes 3afetal death 3agastrointestinal system 3amortality 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aveterinary medicine 3aWestern Australia1 aBesier, Shane1 aHair, Sam1 aHancock, Serina1 aLockwood, Amy1 aThompson, Andrew1 aJelocnik, Martina1 aJacobson, Caroline1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9427-19410 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.84-84dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-021-00950-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010800163300001600271520138000287592002801667650001601695650002001711650001601731650001901747650002901766650002101795650002401816650002601840650002801866651001001894653002701904653002301931653002901954653000901983653003601992700001602028700001702044773007802061856008302139852000902222655001202231IND60564568420221117005914.0170713e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhen, Wei10aSpatio-temporal patterns of energy consumption-related GHG emissions in China's crop production systems  ap. 274-284.  aThis paper aims to reveal the spatio-temporal patterns of energy consumption-related greenhouse gas (ECR-GHG) emissions in China's crop production systems (CPSs). The relevant crop production data from 31 provinces during 1997–2014 are utilized. In order to fully reflect the energy consumption and ECR-GHG emissions in CPSs, energy balance techniques are adopted from a consumption perspective. The driving factors behind ECR-GHG emissions are identified by means of a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index analysis at both national and provincial levels. The results are as follows: (1) The yield of China's CPS is not positively correlated with energy consumption, and China's CPS has the relatively high potential to conserve energy and reduce ECR-GHG emissions; (2) Most of China's provinces have experienced enormous growth in ECR-GHG emissions; however there are relatively significant regional disparities; (3) ECR-GHG emissions from CPSs were mostly derived directly from the consumption of chemical fertilizers and diesel oil; (4) Areal productivity is the determining factor in the growth of ECR-GHG emissions, whereas the emission coefficient and energy mix are the main inhibiting factors; (5) Energy intensity has not achieved its full potential to decrease ECR-GHG emissions. This study provides insights into the potential for sustainable crop production in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3acrop production 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy balance 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amineral fertilizers 3aproduction technology 3asustainable agriculture 3aChina 0aCrop production system 0aEnergy consumption 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aLMDI 0aSpatio-temporal characteristics1 aQin, Quande1 aWei, Yiming,0 tEnergy Policy.g2017 May, v. 104 p.274-284dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.01.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010200176300001400278520125200292592002801544650001501572650001401587650001301601650001801614650002601632650001101658650001801669650001001687653002801697653002601725653002801751700002601779773012801805856008501933852000902018655001202027IND60630411320221122024007.0190207e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063041132DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2018.15095032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatumchat, Puttipong10aNew computer geometric modeling approach with filament assembly model for woven fabric structures  ap. 50-60.  aThis paper presents a new computer geometric modeling approach for three-dimensional woven fabric structures. Pierce’s geometry of the weave fabric of yarn from an arc abscissa (Peirce’s) model is presented. Then, new algorithms with a filament assembly model for a single yarn composed of many filaments by twisting along the crimp shape in the warp/weft is developed. The concept of a virtual location is used to simulate the fiber distributions in the yarn cross-section. Each cross-section is rotated along the yarn length by a pre-determined amount to allow for the yarn twist. The curve of each filament in each two successive cross-sections is approximated by NURBS and then each curve is created by sweeping a closed curve along the centerline of the yarn path. The method described is demonstrated by the CAD model of woven fabrics with plain and twill weaves. The simulated woven fabrics using this approach can demonstrate a wider variety and improved visual simulations of real woven fabric and can then be further generalized for different and more complicated fabrics. The method is necessary as an input to many computational models, such as modeling the mechanical properties or the heat transfer of fabrics or composite parts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3ageometry 3aheat transfer 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3awoven fabrics 3ayarns 0aWoven fabric structures 0acomputer-aided design 0afilament assembly model1 aSriprateep, Keartisak0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 110, no. 1 p.50-60dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2018.15095033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245011700179300001800296520173400314592002802048650002002076650001602096650001202112650001002124650001302134650001002147650001602157650001702173650001102190650002102201650002002222650001502242650000902257650001402266650002202280653000902302653000802311653000802319653000802327653001002335653001002345653000702355653000802362653000902370653000802379653001002387653001102397653000902408653000702417653001002424653000702434653000802441653000802449653000802457653000802465653001202473653000702485653000902492653003102501653002902532653002802561653002202589653002102611653002102632700003102653700003302684700002202717700003102739700001902770773012102789856008502910852000902995655001203004IND60609307820221120172050.0200419e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060930782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno Sánchez, Rafael,10aControl of the NADPH supply and GSH recycling for oxidative stress management in hepatoma and liver mitochondria  ap. 1138-1150.  aTo unveil what controls mitochondrial ROS detoxification, the NADPH supply and GSH/GSSG recycling for oxidative stress management were analyzed in cancer and non-cancer mitochondria. Therefore, proteomic and kinetomic analyses were carried out of the mitochondrial (i) NADPH producing and (ii) GSH/GSSG recycling enzymes associated to oxidative stress management. The protein contents of the eight enzymes analyzed were similar or even higher in AS-30D rat hepatoma mitochondria (HepM) than in rat liver (RLM) and rat heart (RHM) mitochondria, suggesting that the NADPH/GSH/ROS pathway was fully functional in cancer mitochondria.The Vmax values of IDH-2 were much greater than those of GDH, TH and ME, suggesting that IDH-2 is the predominant NADPH producer in the three mitochondrial types; in fact, the GDH reverse reaction was favored. The Vmax values of GR and GPx were lower in HepM than in RLM, suggesting that the oxidative stress management is compromised in cancer mitochondria. The Km values of IDH-2, GR and GPx were all similar among the different mitochondrial types.Kinetic modeling revealed that the oxidative stress management was mainly controlled by GR, GPx and IDH. Modeling and experimentation also revealed that, due to their higher IDH-2 activity and lower GPx activity presumably by acetylation, HepM (i) showed higher steady-state NADPH levels; (ii) required greater peroxide concentrations to achieve reliable steady-state fluxes and metabolite concentration; and (iii) endured higher peroxide concentrations without collapsing their GSH/GSSG ratios. Then, to specifically prompt lower GSH/GSSG ratios under oxidative stress thus compromising cancer mitochondria functioning, GPx should be re-activated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aacetylation 3aenzymes 3aheart 3ahepatoma 3aliver 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein content 3aproteomics 3arats 3arecycling 3astress management 0a2-OG 0aCHP 0aGlu 0aGDH 0aGPx-1 0aGPx-4 0aGR 0aGSH 0aGSSG 0aGST 0aGSH-T 0aGSSG-T 0aHepM 0aIC 0aIDH-2 0aME 0aMal 0aROS 0aRHM 0aRLM 0at‑BHP 0aTH 0aTrxR 0aIsocitrate dehydrogenase-2 0aGlutathione peroxidase-4 0aReactive oxygen species 0aMetabolic control 0aOxidative stress 0aKinetic modeling1 aMarín-Hernández, Álvaro1 aGallardo-Pérez, Juan Carlos1 aVázquez, Citlali1 aRodríguez-Enríquez, Sara1 aSaavedra, Emma0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Oct., v. 1859, no. 10 p.1138-1150dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2018.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245009300203300001600296520215900312592002802471650003002499650002502529650001002554650001702564650001502581650002502596650001502621650001502636650001202651650001102663650001702674650001302691650001302704650001902717650001302736650001402749651001902763653002502782653002402807653001902831653003002850653001402880700002002894700006102914773011602975856008303091852000903174655001203183IND60613341020221119080245.0190923e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061334102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2018.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErsoy, Ebru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2945-388510aIdentifying multispecies connectivity corridors and the spatial pattern of the landscape  ap. 308-322.  aThe maintenance and enhancement of connectivity for multispecies is a challenging issue for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning. It is well-known that different elements of the landscape matrix provide different levels of permeability to species moving across the landscape, but such effects may be species-specific. Whilst the spatial articulation of connectivity corridors is highly dependent on how we define them, and which species group we intended to provide connectivity for, it is also important to understand the optimal land cover mix to promote the maximum number of species. We demonstrate an approach to (1) identifying multispecies networks and examine how it compares to previous network approaches for a case study city of Sheffield, UK and (2) developing specific proposals for how green networks in Sheffield could be improved. We modelled least-cost corridors for four bird, three mammal and three reptile species. After validating the derived corridors, we created a union of least-cost corridors that identified the multispecies connectivity zones and compared the derived multispecies networks with the pre-existing networks (Sheffield City Council - the Green Network and the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust- the Living Don ecological network). We found that a particular mix of land covers (particularly, woodlands, mixed vegetation and unimproved grassland) have a high potential to provide corridors for the maximum number of species around the edges of the city centre or the suburbs. A significant proportion of the Green Network and the Living Don ecological network coincide spatially with these land covers. Based on the comparisons of the derived and existing corridors, we discuss specific proposals for how Sheffield green networks could be improved and which areas to prioritise. Utilising species relevant connectivity models which incorporate a group of species with complementary and contrasting habitat requirements will enable a much more complete picture of potential landscape connectivity across the landscape and more informed decisions for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiological corridors 3abirds 3acase studies 3agrasslands 3ahabitat connectivity 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3amammals 3amodels 3apermeability 3aplanning 3areptiles 3asuburban areas 3awildlife 3awoodlands 3aUnited Kingdom 0aMultispecies network 0aLeast-cost corridor 0aGreen networks 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aSheffield1 aJorgensen, Anna1 aWarren, Philip H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0550-08860 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 Apr., v. 40 p.308-322dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013200167300001900299520100100318592002801319650002401347650001101371650003001382650001101412650001201423650001401435650001301449650001401462650003501476700001601511700001801527700002301545700001701568700001901585700002001604700002101624700001601645700001601661773010801677856008501785852000901870655001201879IND60605773920221120090117.0200128e20180705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060577392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotler, Eran12aA Systematic p53 Mutation Library Links Differential Functional Impact to Cancer Mutation Pattern and Evolutionary Conservation  ap. 178-190.e8.  aThe TP53 gene is frequently mutated in human cancer. Research has focused predominantly on six major “hotspot” codons, which account for only ∼30% of cancer-associated p53 mutations. To comprehensively characterize the consequences of the p53 mutation spectrum, we created a synthetically designed library and measured the functional impact of ∼10,000 DNA-binding domain (DBD) p53 variants in human cells in culture and in vivo. Our results highlight the differential outcome of distinct p53 mutations in human patients and elucidate the selective pressure driving p53 conservation throughout evolution. Furthermore, while loss of anti-proliferative functionality largely correlates with the occurrence of cancer-associated p53 mutations, we observe that selective gain-of-function may further favor particular mutants in vivo. Finally, when combined with additional acquired p53 mutations, seemingly neutral TP53 SNPs may modulate phenotypic outcome and, presumably, tumor progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-binding domains 3acodons 3again-of-function mutation 3ahumans 3amutants 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aphenotype 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aShani, Odem1 aGoldfeld, Guy1 aLotan-Pompan, Maya1 aTarcic, Ohad1 aGershoni, Anat1 aHopf, Thomas A.1 aMarks, Debora S.1 aOren, Moshe1 aSegal, Eran0 tMolecular cell.g2018 July 05, v. 71, no. 1 p.178-190.e8dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245011400175300001800289520177300307592002802080650001102108650002002119650002102139650002502160650001502185650003002200650000902230650001102239650002602250650001402276650001302290650002302303653001502326653002402341653001102365653002402376653001402400653002102414700002102435700002202456700002602478700002402504700002302528700002102551773023202572856008202804852000902886655001202895IND60567470420221120031252.0190412e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056747042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaa.2017.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGozalo-Marcilla, Miguel10aSedative and antinociceptive effects of different combinations of detomidine and methadone in standing horses  ap. 1116-1127.  aTo evaluate intravenous (IV) detomidine with methadone in horses to identify a combination which provides sedation and antinociception without adverse effects.Randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, crossover.A group of eight adult healthy horses aged (mean ± standard deviation) 7 ± 2 years and 372 ± 27 kg.A total of six treatments were administered IV: saline (SAL); detomidine (5 μg kg−1; DET); methadone (0.2 mg kg−1; MET) alone or combined with detomidine [2.5 (MLD), 5 (MMD) or 10 (MHD) μg kg−1]. Thermal, mechanical and electrical nociceptive thresholds were measured, and sedation, head height above ground (HHAG), cardiopulmonary variables and intestinal motility were evaluated at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 and 180 minutes. Normal data were analyzed by mixed-model analysis of variance and non-normal by Kruskal–Wallis (p < 0.05).Nociceptive thresholds in horses administered methadone with the higher doses of detomidine (MMD, MHD) were increased above baseline to a greater degree and for longer duration (MMD: 15–30 minutes, MHD: 30–60 minutes) than in horses administered low dose with methadone or detomidine alone (MLD, DET: 5–15 minutes). No increases in nociceptive thresholds were recorded in SAL or MET. Compared with baseline, HHAG was lower for 30 minutes in MMD and DET, and for 45 minutes in MHD. No significant sedation was observed in SAL, MET or MLD. Intestinal motility was reduced for 75 minutes in MHD and for 30 minutes in all other treatments.Methadone (0.2 mg kg−1) potentiated the antinociception produced by detomidine (5 μg kg−1), with minimal sedative effects.Detomidine (5 μg kg−1) with methadone (0.2 mg kg−1) produced antinociception without the adverse effects of higher doses of detomidine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aanalgesic effect 3aanalysis of variance 3adetomidine 3agastrointestinal motility 3ahead 3ahorses 3aintravenous injection 3amethadone 3asedation 3astatistical models 0adetomidine 0aelectrical stimulus 0aequine 0amechanical stimulus 0amethadone 0athermal stimulus1 aLuna, Stelio PL.1 aCrosignani, Nadia1 aFilho, José NP Puoli1 aPossebon, Fábio S.1 aPelligand, Ludovic1 aTaylor, Polly M.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2017 Sept., v. 44, no. 5 p.1116-1127dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaa.2017.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011500166500002200281520106700303592002801370650001101398650002301409650001201432650001001444650001301454650002101467650001301488650001801501650002001519650001801539650001801557650001301575650002401588653001101612653002801623700002001651700002001671700001901691700001901710773010601729856005101835852000901886655001201895IND60793930820221123002938.0220921e20220912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079393082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2022.1075072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zheng10aFacile selective hydrogenation of bio-based furfural to furfuryl alcohol via ZIF-67-derived Co-based catalysts  aPre-press version  aA stable, low-cost, and reusable Co nanoparticles catalyst imbedded in nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Co@C-N) for selective catalytic hydrogenation (CHG) of furfural (FF) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) has been exploited. The catalyst is directly derived from 2-methylimidazole modified ZIF-67 MOFs (MOFs = metal–organic frameworks) by thermolysis. The Co@C-N catalytic system features 100% FF conversion and 85.6% FA selectivity under 2 MPa initial hydrogen pressure at 145 °C in ethanol solvent after 2 h. Co@C-N is also appropriate for scale-up catalytic hydrogenation of FF and is versatile for aromatic aldehydes as well as other aldehyde compounds, giving their corresponding alcohols in good to excellent selectivities. After the reaction, the Co@C-N could be facile recovery with an external magnetic field and reused for 6 reaction cycles without obvious deactivation of its catalytic properties.

Retained austenite (RA) is an important phase in TRIP steel. However, the physical characteristics of nanoscale RA grains cannot be systematically characterized by conventional electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses. In contrast, transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) analysis can be employed to systematically characterize the grain size, morphology, and distribution of RA grains. The TKD analysis of TRIP590 steel samples subjected to austenitizing pretreatment revealed a large proportion of lamellar RA grains with a grain size range of 80 nm to 3 μm, and a more homogeneous distribution of RA grains was obtained around the ferrite grains than samples formed by conventional heat treatments alone. In addition, the volume fraction of the RA phase and its carbon content were greater than those obtained in samples formed by conventional heat treatments alone. Moreover, the austenitizing pretreatment significantly increases the ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the TRIP steel samples, and the product of the ultimate tensile strength and elongation increased by an average of 23%. The pretreated steel samples exhibit excellent mechanical properties, where the product of the strength and elongation reached 26448 MPa%, with a yield strength of 556 MPa, tensile strength of 696 MPa, and an elongation of 38%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aheat treatment 3aplasticity 3asteel 3atensile strength 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9061-27341 aLi, Qiuhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7508-69941 aGuo, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9902-25971 aLiu, Yandong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8591-08761 aMeng, Qingge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3546-93140 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Nov., v. 53, no. 22 p.15667-15678dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2703-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016900171300001400340520084800354592002801202650002301230650001001253650003301263650003201296650002301328653001001351653001301361653001701374653001201391653001201403653000701415653000801422653000701430653001301437653000701450653000801457653000701465653000801472653000801480653000801488653003501496653004301531653004201574653005801616653007001674653007901744653003201823653003401855653004401889653003501933653003901968653004702007653003902054653003002093653003402123653001202157653002802169653002602197700002002223700005802243773009802301856008702399852000902486655001202495IND60613429320221119142143.0201230e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061342932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yan Ping10aOptimization of a headspace solid-phase micro-extraction method to quantify volatile compounds in plain sufu, and application of the method in sample discrimination  ap. 32-40.  aA rapid headspace solid-phase microextraction method was optimized to detect volatile components in three commercial plain sufu samples.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was subsequently used to group the samples. The optimized method identified 148 volatile compounds in three commercial samples, and the concentrations of 14 aroma impact compounds varied significantly among commercial and laboratory samples.

However, little is known about how miR-193a regulates osteogenic differentiation.We employed RT-qPCR to determine the level of miR-193a and mRNA level of HMGB1 and osteoblast-specific markers (Runx2, ALP, OSX, OCN). Besides, westernblot was used to probe protein level of phosphorylated MAPK family members and β-catenin. Bioinformatic analysis was used to predict the putative binding sequence of miR-193a to the 3′-UTR of HMGB1 and we confirmed this result by dual luciferase reporter assay. Alizarin red staining assay (ARS) and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) were performed to detect osteogenic differentiation.miR-193a was downregulated in OM (osteogenic medium)induced hBMSC. More interestingly, we found that miR-193a mimic attenuated matrix mineralization and alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas miR-193a inhibitor exerted the opposite phenotypes. Mechanistically, we observed that miR-193a played an inhibitory role in expression of osteoblast-specific markers and activation of MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways. Bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-193a directly targeted 3′-UTR of HMGB1. Furthermore, we overexpressed HMGB1 in miR-193a overexpressed hBMSC to establish that HMGB1 acted as downstream target of miR-193a-inhibited osteogenic differentiation.Here, we reveal miR-193a plays a suppressive role in osteogenic differentiation of hBMSC via targeting HMGB1. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying osteogenic differentiation and offer therapeutical strategy for bone formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aapoptosis 3abeta catenin 3abioinformatics 3abone formation 3acell proliferation 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3amineralization 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anucleoproteins 3aphenotype 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astaining 0aOsteogenic differentiation 0aHuman bone marrow-derived stroma cell (hBMSC) 0amiR-193a 0aHMGB1 0aMAPK 0aWnt pathway1 aZhao, Xing-Qi1 aYu, Bin1 aWang, Bo-Wei0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Sept. 05, v. 503, no. 2 p.536-543dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245008800216300001400304520181500318592002802133650001702161650002702178650002502205650002402230650001202254650001402266650001902280650001402299650001002313650001302323650001202336650001702348650000902365653002002374653002602394653002202420653002502442653002202467700002102489700002402510700002602534700002402560700003002584700002502614773011402639856008302753852000902836655001202845IND60770208820221120163254.0220531e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077020882DNAL7 a10.1053/j.jepm.2022.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYarto-Jaramillo, Enrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5085-499010aDiagnosis of cervical chordoma in domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo): 3 cases  ap. 48-53.  aChordomas on the tip of the tail are tumors commonly diagnosed in ferrets. Chordomas are known to originate from intraosseous remnants of the fetal notochord. Reportedly, they occur less frequently in the spinal column. Three cases of cervical chordoma were diagnosed using advanced diagnostic modalities including computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two cases were treated with radiotherapy. Two were diagnosed antemortem using cytology, while two were confirmed postmortemb by histopathology are described. In Case 1, a 4-year-old, castrated male ferret presented with ambulatory tetraparesis and tetra-ataxia with no obvious lateralization. In Case 2, a 4.5-year-old castrated male ferret presented with progressive ataxia, depression, and lethargy. A firm ovoid mass could be palpated extending from his left tympanic bulla to C2 vertebrae. Case 3, a 7-year- old, castrated male presented with a history of posterior paresis, ataxia, falling to the right side and central nervous system depression. On physical examination pronounced weakness and a firm non-displaceable mass on the cervical region surrounding the atlas dorsally and ventrally was noted. CT alone was utilized in one of the three cases while CT combined with MRI facilitated the diagnosis of one case, and MRI alone was also used in one case for diagnosis. Antemortem cytologic diagnosis was used in two ferrets prior to radiation therapy, as well as postmortem histologic in two of the three cases. CT and/or MRI were utilized for the diagnosis of cervical chordomas in three ferrets along with cytology and/or histopathology. Radiation therapy as used in two of these cases may be a viable option in some cases to palliate clinical signs related to chordomas in ferrets, albeit further research is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell biology 3acentral nervous system 3aclinical examination 3acomputed tomography 3aferrets 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3amagnetism 3amales 3amedicine 3aparesis 3aradiotherapy 3atail 0aDomestic ferret 0aMustela putorius furo 0acervical chordoma 0aadvanced diagnostics 0aradiation therapy1 aGraham, Jennifer1 aMcEntee, Margaret C1 aKeyerleber, Michele A1 aJennings, Samuel H.1 aRodríguez-Arroyo, Daniel1 aReyes-Matute, Alonso0 tJournal of exotic pet medicine.g2022 Apr., v. 41 p.48-53dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000103x1557-50637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2022.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010600171300001600277520108600293592002801379650002201407650002601429650001301455650001001468650001501478650001701493650001801510650001801528650001301546650001901559653001701578653001801595653001501613653002301628653001501651653001301666700001601679700001901695700001501714700005801729773011601787856008601903852000901989655001201998IND60556884520221120073012.0170713e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055688452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.09.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sandeep10aKetoconazole encapsulated in chitosan-gellan gum nanocomplexes exhibits prolonged antifungal activity  ap. 988-994.  aThe objective of the present study was to prepare ketoconazole loaded chitosan-gellan gum (CSGG) nanoparticles and to evaluate them for antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger. Ketoconazole loaded CSGG nanoparticles were prepared by electrostatic complexation technique using chitosan (CS) as cationic polymer and gellan gum (GG) as anionic polymer with ketoconazole as drug. It was observed that the effect of gellan gum on particle size was more pronounced in comparison to chitosan and increase in its concentration resulted in a significant increase in particle size but decrease in zeta potential. Whereas, increase in concentration of chitosan resulted in increase in zeta potential. The particle size and zeta potential of optimal formulation was 155.7±26.1nm and 32.1±2.8mV which obtained at concentration of chitosan (0.02% w/v) and gellan gum (0.01% w/v). On comparative evaluation, ketoconazole loaded CSGG nanoparticles showed significantly higher antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger than dummy CSGG nanoparticles (without drug) and drug individually.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aantifungal properties 3achitosan 3adrugs 3agellan gum 3aketoconazole 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3azeta potential 0aKetaconazole 0aNanoparticles 0aAntifungal 0aIonic complexation 0aGellan gum 0aChitosan1 aKaur, Pawan1 aBernela, Manju1 aRani, Ruma1 aThakur, Rajesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3409-58210 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Dec., v. 93 p.988-994dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.09.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011600168300001800284520148200302592002801784650001101812650001601823650001401839650001401853650001001867650001101877650001301888650001101901653001401912653001501926653001401941653002201955653002901977700002002006700006302026700002402089700002702113773014002140856008302280852000902363655001202372IND60542669020221122122347.0190405e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrev, Amanda M.14aThe Effect of Small Square-Bale Feeder Design on Hay Waste and Economics During Outdoor Feeding of Adult Horses  ap. 1269-1273.  aHay waste during feeding represents a costly expense for horse owners. The objectives of this study were to determine hay waste, herd body weight (BW) change, hay intake, and economics of small square-bale feeders used in outdoor feeding of horses. Feeder designs included a hayrack, slat feeder, basket feeder, and a no-feeder control. Feeders were placed in separate outdoor dirt paddocks. Twelve horses were divided into four groups and rotated through the paddocks in a Latin square design. Horses were weighed before and after each rotation. Horses were fed grass hay at 2.5% of the herd BW split evenly at 8 AM and 4 PM. Waste hay and orts were collected before each feeding. The number of months to repay the feeder cost (payback) was calculated using hay valued at $250 per ton and improved efficiency over the no-feeder control. Mean hay waste was 13%, 5%, 3%, and 1% for the no-feeder control, hayrack, basket feeder, and slat feeder, respectively (P < .001). The hayrack, basket feeder, and slat feeder paid for themselves in 12, 11, and 9 months, respectively (P = .0049). Herds gained 10 and 7 kg when feeding from the basket feeder and hayrack, and lost 3 and 11 kg when feeding from the slat feeder and no-feeder control (P ≤ .0015). Estimated hay intake was 2.4% BW for the basket feeder and hayrack and 2.2% BW for the slat feeder and no-feeder control (P < .0001). Small square-bale feeder design affected hay waste, hay intake, herd BW change, and payback.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody weight 3aeconomics 3agrass hay 3aherds 3ahorses 3apastures 3awastes 0aEconomics 0aHay intake 0aHay waste 0aHorse body weight 0aSmall square-bale feeder1 aGlunk, Emily C.1 aHathaway, Marcia R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8893-16081 aLazarus, William F.1 aMartinson, Krishona L.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 34, no. 11-12 p.1269-1273dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002700141245019500168500001400363520217900377592002802556650001102584650001102595650001402606773012102620856007502741852000902816655001202825IND60718818820221123043114.0201126e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071881882DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101120372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLearmonth, Mark  James10aHuman–Animal Interactions in Zoos: What Can Compassionate Conservation, Conservation Welfare and Duty of Care Tell Us about the Ethics of Interacting, and Avoiding Unintended Consequences?  aNAL-light  aHuman–animal interactions (HAIs) in zoos can be rewarding for both humans and animals, but can also be fraught with ethical and welfare perils. Contact with animals can be beneficial for all parties involved, and can indeed lead to pro-conservation and respect for nature behaviours being adopted by humans after so-called “profound experiences” of connecting or interacting with animals. Yet, human–animal interactions may also increase certain individuals’ desires for inappropriate wild-animal ‘pet’ ownership, and can convey a false sense of acceptability of exploiting animals for “cheap titillation”. Indeed, this has been reflected in a recent research review conducted on animal–visitor interactions in zoos from a number of different countries and global regions. These are unintended consequences that ”modern, ethical zoos” would try to minimise, or avoid completely where possible, though most zoos still offer close-contact experiences with their animals. Three ethical frameworks that may be beneficial for ethically run zoos to incorporate when considering human–animal interactions are: Compassionate Conservation, Conservation Welfare and Duty of Care. These three ethical frameworks are concerned with the welfare state and outcomes for individual animals, not just the population or species. Human–animal interactions in zoos may be acceptable in many circumstances and may be beneficial to both animal and human participants; however, they must be closely monitored through welfare tracking tools. The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) has published guidelines for human–animal interactions that are mandatory for member institutions to adhere to, although whether these guidelines are taken as mandatory or suggestions at individual institutions is unknown. Some suggestions for relevant extensions to the guidelines are suggested herein. Melding Duty of Care and the two Conservation ethical frameworks would be ideal for assessing the ethical acceptability of such interactions as they currently occur, and for considering how they should be modified to occur (or not) into the future in zoological settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethics 3ahumans 3aownership0 tAnimals.g2020 Nov. 04, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101120373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01203naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245010300192300001400295520028600309592002800595653001300623653001500636653001100651653001200662653001300674773011200687856011700799852000900916655001200925IND60124956620221116234005.0151101e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495662DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0042:DOANSI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapes, E.

The nanoparticles were crosslinked by using three different crosslinkers: glutaraldehyde, genipin and citric acid and the effect of crosslinking on different properties of the nanoparticles was evaluated. Characterisation of the nanoparticles was done with FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy) and XRD (X-Ray Diffraction). Magnetic property study using VSM (Vibrating Sample Magnetometer) showed their superparamagnetic nature. Morphology of the nanoparticles was studied by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy). Zeta potential values showed that crosslinking imparted stability to the system. Crosslinking also enhanced drug loading and encapsulation efficiency of the system. Swelling and in vitro studies of the nanoparticles showed that the release of drug was dependent on time, crosslinker nature, crosslinker concentration and pH of the medium. The aminated starch coated nanoparticles also showed good mucoadhesive character. The cell viability assessment by MTT study revealed their compatibility with human lymphocytes cells and their considerable cell growth inhibiting properties with MCF7 and HepG2 cells.

The fish bones were applied crushed in shallow furrows together with dry maize stalks, or broadcast on the soil surface at 3 application rates: 0, 40 and 80 kg/ha; subsequent reduction in termite attack on maize plants was then assessed. Burying the fish bone powder caused higher ant nesting (102–78 %) than surface broadcasting (122–39 %). Attractiveness of the fish bones and the predatory efficiency of the ants against termites in maize was also highest with a dose of 80 kg/ha (1.0 kg/plot) causing higher nesting of ants (>90 %) and 54 % lower termite damage to maize plants compared to control plots. Dose responses indicated significant relationships between amount of fish bone powder applied and termite activity and also between termite damage and maize yield. The mechanism by which the ants are able to protect maize against termite damage may be twofold: direct kill as a result of their predatory action and termite avoidance of maize plants with ant nests. Further studies are required to assess the potential benefits of an integrated use of this technique with other non-chemical options for termite control in maize, such as intercropping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aIsoptera 3aZea mays 3aagroecosystems 3aant nests 3aapplication rate 3abones 3acorn 3acorn stover 3acrop yield 3adose response 3afield experimentation 3afish 3afurrows 3aintercropping 3anesting 3apredatory insects 3asoil 3atermite control1 aKyamanywa, S.1 aWillson, H.

Another option for taking advantage of the energy content of the microalgae is to directly carry out anaerobic digestion of raw algae in order to produce methane and recycle nutrients (N, P and K). In this study, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of biogas production from the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris is performed and the results are compared to algal biodiesel and to first generation biodiesels. These results suggest that the impacts generated by the production of methane from microalgae are strongly correlated with the electric consumption. Progresses can be achieved by decreasing the mixing costs and circulation between different production steps, or by improving the efficiency of the anaerobic process under controlled conditions. This new bioenergy generating process strongly competes with others biofuel productions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodiesel 3abiogas 3aclimate change 3aenergy content 3agases 3alife cycle assessment 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicroalgae 3anutrients 2aAnaerobiosis 2aAnimals 2aBiofuels 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aChlorella vulgarisxgrowth & development 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aElectricity 2aEnergy-Generating Resources 2aEnvironment 2aEthanolxeconomics 2aFermentation 2aFoodxeconomics 2aGases 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMethanexmetabolism1 aHélias, Arnaud1 aLardon, Laurent1 aRas, Monique1 aGoy, Romy-Alice1 aSteyer, Jean-Philippe0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.207-214dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.06.1543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245009900203500002200302520129600324592002801620650001701648650001701665650001401682650001101696650001301707650000901720650002601729653000901755653002501764653004101789653003001830700005201860700001401912700001501926700005501941700005501996773020802051856008202259852000902341655001202350IND60775595020221120054421.0220614e20220412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077559502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2022.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xinkai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8791-294X10aSystematic annotation of conservation states provides insights into regulatory regions in rice  aPre-press version  aPlant genomes contain a large fraction of non-coding sequences. The discovery and annotation of conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) in plants is an ongoing challenge. Here we report the application of comparative genomics to systematically identify CNSs in 50 well-annotated Gramineae genomes using rice (Oryza sativa) as the reference. We conduct multiple-way whole-genome alignments to the rice genome. The rice genome is annotated as 20 conservation states (CSs) at single-nucleotide resolution using a multivariate hidden Markov model (ConsHMM) based on the multiple-genome alignments. Different states show distinct enrichments for various genomic features, and the conservation scores of CSs are highly correlated with the level of associated chromatin accessibility. We find that at least 33.5% of the rice genome is highly under selection, with more than 70% of the sequence lying outside of coding regions. A catalog of 855,366 regulatory CNSs is generated, and they significantly overlapped with putative active regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites. Collectively, our study provides a resource for elucidating functional non-coding regions of the rice genome and an evolutionary aspect of regulatory sequences in higher plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aOryza sativa 3achromatin 3agenome 3agenomics 3arice 3atranscription factors 0aRice 0aComparative genomics 0aConserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) 0aConservation states (CSs)1 aZhu, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9667-498X1 aFang, Wen1 aYu, Ranran1 aHe, Zhaohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8976-94941 aChen, Dijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7456-25110 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2022 Apr. 12, dElsevier LtdaInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinawJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2022.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245012700158500001400285520116600299592002801465650001701493650001601510650001401526650001401540650001701554650000801571650001001579650001101589650001301600700001501613700001501628700001801643700001701661700002001678773012101698856007501819852000901894655001201903IND60718819120221120044144.0201126e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071881912DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101120402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Hexuan 10aGreat Himalayan Leaf-Nosed Bats Produce Different Territorial Calls to Respond to Sympatric Species and Non-Living Objects  aNAL-light  aTerritorial signals are important for reducing the cost of territory defense. Normally, male animals will produce keep-out signals to repel intruders from entering their territory. However, there is currently no evidence that bats can adjust their territorial calls to respond differently to sympatric species or non-living objects. In this study, we simulated the process of territory defense in male Great Himalayan leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros armiger) toward two sympatric species (Hipposideros pratti and Rhinolophus sinicus) and four different non-living objects (a fur specimen of H. armiger, a bat model, a speaker, and a speaker with playback of H. armiger echolocation calls) to investigate their acoustic responses. There were significant differences in the territorial call complexity, syllable rate, and syllable ratio produced by H. armiger under the different experimental conditions. Our results confirmed that bats can adjust their territorial calls to respond to different sympatric species and non-living objects.

We employed solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC × GC–MS). We analyzed 30 random plasma samples from incident cases of CRC. The 30 samples were from population controls enrolled in a large population-based case-control study. The number of metabolite peaks detected in the cases was significantly lower than that detected in the controls (median 1530 vs. 1694, P = 0.02). Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed clear VOC profile differences between the CRC and the controls. After adjustment for multiple comparisons at the 5% false discovery rate level, five VOCs were differentially expressed between the cases and the controls. Among these five VOCs, 2,3,4-trimethyl-hexane (decreased) and 2,4-dimethylhept-1-ene (increased) were both lipid peroxidation products but not previously reported for CRC. In summary, this study pointed to an intriguing observation that the richness of volatile metabolites may be reduced in CRC cases and demonstrated the utility of SPME GC × GC–MS in discovery of candidate markers for further validation.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Cancer Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000054  a1P20GM113226aP50AA024337cGrant Boost Program from Wayne State University  cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  aCA022453cKarmanos Cancer Institute0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase-control studies 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agene expression regulation 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3apatients 3asolid phase microextraction 3avolatile organic compounds1 aYin, Xinmin1 aProdhan, Md Aminul Islam1 aZhang, Xiang1 aZhong, Zichun1 aKato, Ikuko0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2019 May 01, v. 57, no. 5 p.385-396dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmz0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245008200191300001400273520160700287592002801894653001401922653001701936653001801953653002701971653001601998700002302014700002002037700002802057773011202085856011702197852000902314655001202323IND60124957020221116233615.0151101e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495702DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0072:PBOTSO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmalin, Divina M.10aPredatory behavior of three species of sac spiders attacking citrus leafminer  ap. 72-81.  aThe predatory habit of three species of sac spiders, Chiracanthium inclusum, Hibana velox, and Trachelas volutus, on citrus leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella, was investigated. Observation of spider activities during the photophase and the scotophase confirmed that these three species of sac spiders are nocturnal. They detect their prey by sensing vibrations of the substrate induced by the concealed prey. Movements of P. citrella larvae and prepupae appear to create vibrations of the leaf substrate, which then serve as cues for the spiders to locate them. The searching and prey capture behaviors of these spiders are discussed. Two methods of prey attack were exhibited. In one method, the spider punctures the mine, immobilizes the larva and then bites it and sucks the larval body fluid. In the second behavioral pattern, the spider makes a slit in the mine, uses its forelegs to pull the larva or prepupa out of the mine, holds the prey securely, and finally bites it and regurgitates digestive juices into the prey and ingests the pre-digested liquid tissue.The three species of sac spiders were found to start feeding on P. citrella larvae during the 2nd instar stage. Consumption increased as they developed to later instars. Maximum consumption for all species was recorded at the 4th instar. Although C. inclusum and T. volutus can complete their life cycle with P. citrella as their only food, H. velox was not able to develop to the adult stage. Results obtained from this study provide useful data to better understand the role of sac spiders in the overall management of P. citrella.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNocturnal 0aprey capture 0afeeding stage 0aPhyllocnistis citrella 0asac spiders1 aReiskind, Jonathan1 aPeña, Jorge E.1 aMcSorley, R.q(Robert),0 tJournal of arachnology.g2001 Apr., v. 29, no. 1 p.72-81dAmerican Arachnological Society.x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2F0161-8202%282001%29029%5B0072%3APBOTSO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245012300212300001600335506007600351520156900427592002801996506003702024650001502061650001502076650002102091650002802112650001602140650001202156650001302168650002202181650002602203700002002229700001802249773008102267856008502348852000902433655001202442IND60082850520221207114953.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008285052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plasmid.2012.04.0022doi7 aPMC33891572pmcid7 a225426222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeiranian, H.A.10aInefficient replication reduces RecA-mediated repair of UV-damaged plasmids introduced into competent Escherichia coli  ap. 113-124.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTransformation of Escherichia coli with purified plasmids containing DNA damage is frequently used as a tool to characterize repair pathways that operate on chromosomes. In this study, we used an assay that allowed us to quantify plasmid survival and to compare how efficiently various repair pathways operate on plasmid DNA introduced into cells relative to their efficiency on chromosomal DNA. We observed distinct differences between the mechanisms operating on the transforming plasmid DNA and the chromosome. An average of one UV-induced lesion was sufficient to inactivate ColE1-based plasmids introduced into nucleotide excision repair mutants, suggesting an essential role for repair on newly introduced plasmid DNA. By contrast, the absence of RecA, RecF, RecBC, RecG, or RuvAB had a minimal effect on the survival of the transforming plasmid DNA containing UV-induced damage. Neither the presence of an endogenous homologous plasmid nor the induction of the SOS response enhanced the survival of transforming plasmids. Using two-dimensional agarose-gel analysis, both replication- and RecA-dependent structures that were observed on established, endogenous plasmids following UV-irradiation, failed to form on UV-irradiated plasmids introduced into E. coli. We interpret these observations to suggest that the lack of RecA-mediated survival is likely to be due to inefficient replication that occurs when plasmids are initially introduced into cells, rather than to the plasmid’s size, the absence of homologous sequences, or levels of recA expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aEscherichia coli 3aSOS response (genetics) 3achromosomes 3amutants 3aplasmids 3asequence homology 3aultraviolet radiation1 aCourcelle, C.T.1 aCourcelle, J.0 tPlasmid.g2012 Sept., v. 68, no. 2 p.113-124dElsevier Inc.x0147-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2012.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012700171300001600298520105000314592002801364650001401392650001901406650001401425650002601439653000901465653000701474653000801481653000801489653000801497653000701505653001001512653000701522653000901529653000901538653001401547653004801561653001601609653001801625653001701643653000801660773009201668856008301760852000901843655001201852IND60611816720221117232634.0180904e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061181672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPugsley, Haley R.10aQuantifying autophagy: Measuring LC3 puncta and autolysosome formation in cells using multispectral imaging flow cytometry  ap. 147-156.  aThe use of multispectral imaging flow cytometry has been gaining popularity due to its quantitative power, high throughput capabilities, multiplexing potential and its ability to acquire images of every cell. Autophagy is a process in which dysfunctional organelles and cellular components that accumulate during growth and differentiation are degraded via the lysosome and recycled. During autophagy, cytoplasmic LC3 is processed and recruited to the autophagosomal membranes; the autophagosome then fuses with the lysosome to form the autolysosome. Therefore, cells undergoing autophagy can be identified by visualizing fluorescently labeled LC3 puncta and/or the co-localization of fluorescently labeled LC3 and lysosomal markers. Multispectral imaging flow cytometry is able to collect imagery of large numbers of cells and assess autophagy in an objective, quantitative, and statistically robust manner. This review will examine the four predominant methods that have been used to measure autophagy via multispectral imaging flow cytometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3aflow cytometry 3alysosomes 3amultispectral imagery 0aMIFC 0aCQ 0aBDI 0aBDS 0aLC3 0aBF 0aAF647 0aRd 0aHBSS 0aEBSS 0aAutophagy 0aMultispectral imaging flow cytometry (MIFC) 0aImageStream 0aAutophagosome 0aAutolysosome 0aLC30 tMethods.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 112 p.147-156dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245011400162500001400276520136300290592002801653650002501681650001301706650002601719650001701745650003001762650001001792650001301802650001101815650001401826650001301840650001201853650002301865650001401888650001401902651001101916700002301927700002501950700002301975700002701998700001702025700002202042773012102064856007502185852000902260655001202269IND60718819220221120044155.0201126e20201105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071881922DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101120432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKipper, Diéssy 10aGenomic Characterization of Salmonella Minnesota Clonal Lineages Associated with Poultry Production in Brazil  aNAL-light  aSalmonella serotype Minnesota has been increasingly detected in Brazilian poultry farms and food products (chicken meat, eggs) in recent years. In addition, S. Minnesota isolates from poultry are generally resistant to several antibiotics and persistent in farm environments. The present study aimed to assess phylogenomic diversity of S. Minnesota isolates from the poultry production chain in Brazil. In total, 107 worldwide S. Minnesota whole genomes (including 12 from Brazil) were analyzed using a comparative approach. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated two clades more related to poultry production in Brazil: S. Minnesota poultry lineages I and II (SM-PLI and SM-PLII). Phylodynamic analysis demonstrated that SM-PLI had a common ancestor in 1915, while SM–PLII originated circa 1971. SM-PLII encompassed a higher number of isolates and presented a recent increase in effective population size (mainly from 2009 to 2012). Plasmids IncA/C2 and ColRNA, antimicrobial resistance genes (aph(3′)-Ia, blaCMY-2, qnrB19, sul2, and tet(A)) and mainly a virulence genetic cluster (including the yersiniabactin operon) were detected in isolates from SM-PLI and/or SM-PLII. This study demonstrates the dissemination of two distinct S.

Oxidatively modified protein and DNA have been demonstrated to increase with advancing age in rodents. Half-life of proteins is extended and DNA repair activity declines in old animals. Dietary restriction initiated late in life can shorten the half-life of proteins to levels of young animals, thus contributing to reduce level of altered proteins in old animals by the regimen. Regular exercise reduced oxidatively modified proteins in the brain with improved cognitive functions. It attenuated oxidative stress in the liver, i.e., ameliorating activation of nuclear factor κB, increasing reduced glutathione, and decreasing oxidized guanine base in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. These findings suggest that regular exercise has systemic effects in reducing oxidative stress. Thus, life-styles such as diet and exercise may extend health span, by up-regulating overall anti-oxidant capacities that include proteins involved in protein turnover and DNA repair, resulting in reduction of damaged proteins and DNA that potentially promote physiological and pathological aging.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAging 0aDietary restriction 0aDNA 0aExercise 0aOxidative stress 0aProtein1 aRadak, Zsolt0 tJournal of Sport and Health Science.g2013 June, v. 2 p.75-80dElsevier B.V.aShanghai University of SportwJournal:23381x2095-25467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2013.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013200168520182700300592002802127650002102155650002602176650001902202650001602221650001402237650001102251650001402262653001502276653002802291653002802319653002202347653003602369653002202405700001702427700001602444700002002460700001802480700001402498773009202512856008602604852000902690655001202699IND60739133920221120222829.0211219e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073913392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Fangbin10aNon-conjugated flexible network for the functional design of silica-based stationary phase for mixed-mode liquid chromatography  aThe functionalized non-conjugated organic network modified silica microspheres are proposed as the stationary phase of liquid chromatography, which can effectively avoid some defects of organic framework materials in liquid chromatography. Due to the co-existing of pyridine ring, carbonyl group, amide group and triazine ring in the non-conjugated flexible organic network on the silica surface, the developed mixed-mode stationary phase exhibits multiple interactions between the stationary phase and the analytes during the separation process. A variety of nucleoside bases, organic acids, antibiotics, pesticides, alkylbenzenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and sulfonamides achieved ideal resolution and flexible selectivity in separation. Compared with the commercial chromatographic columns under their optimized chromatographic conditions, it shows better performance for the separation of complex analytes. The influence of chromatographic conditions on retention behavior indicates that the column's multiple retention mechanisms make it suitable for mixed-mode liquid chromatography. The stationary phase prepared by the new design strategy also has excellent chromatographic reproducibility, repeatability and stability with the intraday RSD of 0.09%–0.12% (n = 10) and the interday RSD of 0.37%–1.64% (n = 5) for the retention time. The separation results of actual samples also prove its potential in the analysis of complex samples. In short, we designed and prepared the non-conjugated flexible network modified silica stationary phase material for liquid chromatography that is different from organic framework materials. Its excellent separation ability shows that we have successfully reported a new kind of liquid chromatography packing with functional design and facile preparation method.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical species 3aliquid chromatography 3amicroparticles 3anucleosides 3apyridines 3asilica 3atriazines 0aMixed-mode 0aHydrophilic interaction 0aHydrophobic interaction 0aπ-π interaction 0aNon-conjugated flexible network 0aFunctional design1 aLu, Xiaofeng1 aWang, Shuai1 aLiang, Xiaojing1 aWang, Licheng1 aGuo, Yong0 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122548-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012400168300001800292520173200310592002802042650002402070650001502094650001602109650001802125650002402143650001002167650000902177650001102186650001802197650001702215650003002232650001302262650001402275651001102289651003102300653002902331653001502360700001702375700001702392700001902409700006002428700002102488700001902509773015502528856008302683852000902766655001202775IND60542669620221122142750.0190405e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolle, Florence10aRole of Intraocular Leptospira Infections in the Pathogenesis of Equine Recurrent Uveitis in the Southern United States  ap. 1300-1306.  aEquine recurrent uveitis (ERU) has been linked to leptospirosis in Europe; however, regional differences exist in reports from the United States. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of intraocular leptospiral infections in horses with ERU in the Southern United States. Blood and ocular fluid samples were collected from horses with ERU and normal controls. Leptospira serology was performed using microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Aqueous and vitreous humor samples were obtained and submitted for aerobic and Leptospira culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and MAT. Twenty-one control horses (40 eyes) and 31 ERU horses (46 eyes) were available. Serology was available for 48 of 52 horses: 16 of 21 control and 23 of 27 affected horses were positive for at least one serovar; bratislava was the most common serovar identified. Bacillus sp. and Micrococcus sp. were cultured from one control horse's eye; Streptococcus sp. (n = 1) and Leptospira (n = 6) were cultured from the eyes of six ERU horses. Leptospira isolates belonged to serogroup pomona (n = 4) and grippotyphosa (n = 2). Polymerase chain reaction results were positive in 14 of 31 (45%) horses with ERU; no control horses were positive by PCR (P = .0001). Microscopic agglutination test was positive for 17 of 24 ERU horses (71%) and one 21 (4.7%) normal horses (P < .0001). Horses with ERU had a high prevalence of Leptospira infection based on PCR and MAT results from intraocular fluids compared with control horses. The diagnosis of intraocular infections was not aided by serology and required specific invasive sampling of ocular fluid. Leptospira infection should be considered as a cause of ERU in the Southern United States.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aLeptospira 3aMicrococcus 3aStreptococcus 3aagglutination tests 3ablood 3aeyes 3ahorses 3aleptospirosis 3apathogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aserology 3aserotypes 3aEurope 3aSoutheastern United States 0aEquine recurrent uveitis 0aLeptospira1 aStorey, Eric1 aEades, Susan1 aAlt, David D.,1 aHornsby, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8008-24261 aZuerner, Richard1 aCarter, Renée0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 34, no. 11-12 p.1300-1306dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04191naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134024003900155024004600194024001100240040001800251100002200269245015300291300001500444506017300459506007600632506003100708520177500739596007002514506003702584650002402621650001602645650001502661650002002676650001002696650000902706650000902715650001002724650001902734650001602753650001602769650001202785650001402797650003802811650002002849650001802869650002202887700001902909700001702928700001902945700002302964773011602987856011203103856008603215956027003301961000903571852000903580655001203589IND4458387820221215143115.0130305e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445838782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2011.04.0032chorus7 a10113/557692hdl7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2011.04.0032doi7 a10.1016/j.aquaeng.2011.04.0032chorusOpen8 ans1092  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGood, Christopher10aeffects of ozonation on performance, health and welfare of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in low-exchange water recirculation aquaculture systems  ap. 97-102.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aA controlled four-month trial was conducted to compare the effects of ozonation (oxidation-reduction potential setpoint = 250 mV) versus no ozonation on rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss performance, health, and welfare in replicated WRAS operated at low exchange rates (0.26% of the total recirculating flow) and high feed loadings (3.9 kg/day per cubic meter/day makeup flow). Rainbow trout at 74 +/- 2g (mean +/- standard error) in size were randomly stocked into six replicated 9.5 cubic meter WRAS (1000 fish per system). Ozonation of the three treatment WRAS began two months post-stocking following biofilter acclimation when fish were 295 +/- 1g. Fish were maintained at densities between 40 kg/cubic meter and 80 kg/cubic meter throughout the study at water temperatures of approximately 13-17 degrees C. By study's end, percentage survival for both groups was high (>98%). Fish in ozonated systems weighed significantly (p<0.05) more at study's end than fish from the non-ozonated systems (1161 +/- 6g vs. 993 +/- 12g, respectively). Histopathological evaluation revealed increased levels of gill epithelial hyperplasia and hypertrophy, as well as hepatic lipidosis, in fish from ozonated systems; however, all lesions were subclinical. Fin condition was good overall in both groups, although fish from non-ozonated WRAS had better (p<0.05) dorsal fin indices than fish in the ozonated cohort. The major blood chemistry finding was higher (p<0.05) urea nitrogen in fish from non-ozonated systems (15.33 +/- 0.90 mg/dL, vs. 6.800 +/- 0.470 mg/dL in fish from ozonated WRAS). Overall, the results of this study indicate that raising rainbow trout to market size in ozonated WRAS improves fish performance without significantly impacting their health and welfare.  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aacclimation 3abiofilters 3ablood chemistry 3afeeds 3afins 3afish 3agills 3ahistopathology 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3amarkets 3aozonation 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3aredox potential 3aurea nitrogen 3awater temperature1 aDavidson, John1 aWelsh, Carla1 aSnekvik, Kevin1 aSummerfelt, Steven0 tAquacultural engineering.g2011 May, v. 44, no. 3 p.97-102dElsevier SciencewJournal:jnl33898x0144-86097nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/557693Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2011.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/The%20effects%20of%20ozonation%20on%20performance%2C%20health%20and%20welfare%20of%20rainbow%20trout%20Oncorhynchus%20mykiss%20in%20low-exchange%20water%20recirculation%20aquaculture%20systems.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008800173300001400261520160600275592002801881650002701909650002401936650002201960650002401982650002602006650002002032650001002052650001002062650000902072650001302081650001302094650000902107650001802116653002502134653000902159653002202168653001702190653001302207700002602220700002202246700002202268700002302290700001802313773014802331856008602479852000902565655001202574IND60532243820221120105104.0190214e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053224382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichards, E. Loys10aVariation in the expression of dietary conservatism within and between fish species  ap. 49-56.  aWhen animals encounter new food, they must decide whether to eat it and risk being poisoned, or avoid it but risk losing valuable food resources. Some individuals within a foraging population are ‘adventurous consumers’ and readily accept novel food items into their diets, while others display an active and long-term avoidance of novel food, called ‘dietary conservatism’ (DC). Previous studies have shown the phenomenon of DC in many bird species and in a temperate fish, the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. However, it is unknown to what extent DC exists in other fish species, and so in the current study, we investigated the occurrence of DC in four species of tropical fish belonging to the poeciliid family (guppy, Poecilia reticulata, mollie, Poecilia sphenops, platy, Xiphophorus maculatus, and green swordtail, Xiphophorus hellerii). We detected DC strong enough to drive a novel prey morph from initial rarity to fixation in a prey population in all four poeciliid species. Despite some underlying differences in pre-existing preferences for prey colour, there was no significant difference between poeciliid species, sexes or sizes in the likelihood of the novel morph reaching fixation; neither was there an effect of the relative conspicuousness or crypsis of the novel prey. Poeciliids were, however, less likely than sticklebacks to drive the novel prey morph to fixation. These results provide strong evidence for the widespread existence of DC in fish populations from a range of habitats, but not all fish species exhibit this trait at the same frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aPoecilia sphenops 3aXiphophorus helleri 3aXiphophorus maculatus 3aanimal behavior 3abirds 3acolor 3adiet 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3arisk 3atropical fish 0adietary conservatism 0afish 0aforaging strategy 0apolymorphism 0awariness1 aAlexander, Lucille G.1 aSnellgrove, Donna1 aThomas, Robert J.1 aMarples, Nicola M.1 aCable, Joanne0 tAnimal behaviour.g2014 Feb., v. 88 p.49-56dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100004400150245010400194520166600298592002801964650001801992650001002010650001802020650001702038650002002055650001402075650002302089650001102112650001002123650002802133650002302161650001302184650001202197650001102209650001202220650001202232650003102244650001502275650001902290651001102309653001502320653001902335653002902354653004502383700003302428700001902461700002702480700003502507700003602542700003502578700003702613700002902650773009902679856008502778852000902863655001202872IND60696985720221122203002.0200830e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069698572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1052402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoltronieri, Tathianne Pastana de Sousa10aTopcross hybrids in papaya: Genes derived from backcrossing provide resistance to multiple diseases  aPapaya (Carica papaya L.) is widely cultivated and consumed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. However, a number of diseases prevent the expansion of the crop, the two most prominent of which are ‘black spot’ and ‘phoma spot’. Considering the increasing market demand for fruits free of agrochemical residues, genetic resistance emerges a promising control measure. Our study proposes to estimate the specific combining ability and its interactions with the environment to identify genotypes with genetic resistance to black spot and phoma spot in topcross hybrids. This paper describes an experimental trial implemented in a randomized-block design with six replicates, involving 10 superior lines obtained by backcrossing; four elite lines (‘SS-72/12’, ‘JS-12’, ‘Sekati’ and ‘41/7’), used as parents of already registered genotypes; 20 topcross F1 hybrids (crosses between the 10 lines and the elite hybrids); and two commercial controls. The result related to non-additive interactions resulting from genetic complementation between parents. The SS 72/12 × 4 genotype, a hybrid of the Solo group, was identified as potentially resistant to both diseases. The Sekati × 1 and JS-12 × 17 genotypes, hybrids of the Formosa group, were also promising, given their negative estimates for incidence of black spot on the leaves and fruits and incidence and severity of phoma spot on the leaves, showing less damage when affected by diseases. These results enable the registration of potentially resistant cultivars with high-quality agronomic attributes, which can broaden the range of papaya cultivars sold in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3aPhoma 3aagrochemicals 3abackcrossing 3acontrol methods 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3afruits 3agenes 3agenetic complementation 3agenetic resistance 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3apapayas 3aparents 3aspecific combining ability 3asubtropics 3asupply balance 3aBrazil 0aInbreeding 0aPlant diseases 0aStagonosporopsis caricae 0aAsperisporium caricae Genetic resistance1 aSilveira, Silvaldo Felipe da1 aVivas, Marcelo1 aSanta-Catarina, Renato1 aAzevedo, Alinne Oliveira Nunes1 aSantos, Pedro Henrique Dias dos1 aVettorazzi, Julio Cesar Fiorio1 aRamos, Helaine Christine Cancela1 aPereira, Messias Gonzaga0 tCrop protection.g2020 Nov., v. 137 p.105240-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1052403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01766naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245009400162300001600256500001900272520056400291592002800855650002200883650001700905650001200922650001600934650002000950650001800970650001600988653001901004653001801023653001501041653002601056653002101082700002101103700002101124700002901145773010101174856007201275852000901347655001201356IND60695716520221122123536.0200518e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571652DNAL7 a10.2216/17-107.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamanta, Brajogopal10aSpermatogenesis in the bipolar centric diatom Plagiogrammopsis vanheurckii (Mediophyceae)  ap. 354-359.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe examined gametogenesis and mating behaviour of the cymatosiroid diatom Plagiogrammopsis vanheurckii.

The mating behaviour observed in this species was more complex than generally reported in homothallic and self-compatible centric diatoms and suggests the existence of mechanisms facilitating out-crossing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aMediophyceae 3amitosis 3aoutcrossing 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatogonia 3aspermatozoa 0aCymatosiraceae 0aMating system 0aMerogenous 0aPolar centric diatoms 0aSexual induction1 aHeffell, Quentin1 aEhrman, James M.1 aKaczmarska, I.q(Irena),0 tPhycologia.g2018 May 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.354-359dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/17-107.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03569naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010400206300001800310520184300328592002802171650001202199650002002211650002802231650001302259650001802272650003402290650001002324650001202334650002102346650000902367650002402376650001002400653001502410653002702425653000802452653000702460653000902467653001102476653000802487653000902495653000902504653000702513653000802520653000902528653000702537653000802544653000902552653000902561653000702570653000802577700006002585700002202645700001902667700002102686700002102707773011202728856008202840852000902922655001202931IND60696985820221122203008.0200601e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069698582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2019.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamani, Behzad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1123-126110aAssociation of plant-based dietary patterns with psychological profile and obesity in Iranian women  ap. 1799-1808.  aA bidirectional association exists between psychological disorders and obesity. Also, diet could impact on both of these disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between plant-based dietary patterns and psychological profile and obesity.This cross-sectional study was performed in a sample of 435 Iranian women. A validated and reliable semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire was used to collect dietary data. Three dietary indices including an overall plant-based diet (PDI), healthful plant-based diet (hPDI), and unhealthful plant-based diet (uPDI) were determined. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were used to define general and abdominal obesity, respectively. Psychological profile status was determined from the DASS-21 questionnaire.We found that higher uPDI scores increased the odds of overall (PDI: 2.62; 95% CI 1.28–5.35, Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.01) and abdominal (PDI: 2.36; 95% CI 1.11–5.02, Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.03) obesity in comparison with lower scores. Moreover, an inverse association was observed between higher PDI and hPDI scores and depression (PDI: 0.41; 95% CI 0.23–0.71, Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.001, hPDI: 0.44; 95% CI 0.25–0.76, Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.003), anxiety (PDI: 0.56; 95% CI 0.33–0.94, Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.03, hPDI: 0.55; 95% CI 0.33–0.94, Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.03), and psychological distress (PDI: 0.44; 95% CI 0.26–0.75, Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.003, hPDI: 0.49; 95% CI 0.29–0.82, Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.009). For uPDI, higher scores were associated with depression (uPDI: 1.91; 95% CI 1.03–3.55, Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.03).A plant-based diet, particularly healthful-rich plant foods were inversely associated with psychological disorders. Furthermore, unhealthy plant foods were associated with increased risk of obesity as well as depression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adistress 3aeating habits 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afoods 3aobesity 3aplant-based diet 3arisk 3awaist circumference 3awomen 0aDepression 0aPsychological distress 0aBMI 0aCI 0aDASH 0aDASS21 0aFFQ 0ahPDI 0aMUFA 0aOR 0aPDI 0aPUFA 0aSE 0aSFA 0aTUMS 0auPDI 0aWC 0aWHO1 aDaneshzad, Elnaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1400-85321 aSiassi, Fereydoun1 aGuilani, Bijan1 aBellissimo, Nick1 aAzadbakht, Leila0 tClinical nutrition.g2020 June, v. 39, no. 6 p.1799-1808dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245015900160500001400319520145600333592002801789650002001817650001801837650001601855650001301871650001501884650002401899650001501923650002001938650001301958650002201971650002101993650001102014650001702025650001402042700002602056700002202082700002502104700002102129700002602150700001802176700002502194700002102219700002102240773012102261856007502382852000902457655001202466IND60718819620221123044201.0201126e20201105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071881962DNAL7 a10.3390/ani101120452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElwan, Hamada 10aEfficacy of Dietary Supplementation with Capsicum Annum L on Performance, Hematology, Blood Biochemistry and Hepatic Antioxidant Status of Growing Rabbits  aNAL-light  aAnimals fed with a high amount of a wide range of antioxidants in their diet are significantly protected against oxidative stress. Powerful antioxidant substances such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and carotenoids are present naturally in red-hot pepper (RHP). This study hypothesized that using RHP may provide protection against oxidative stress and enhance animal physiological responses. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of feeding New Zealand white rabbits with RHP-supplemented diets on their physiological and biochemical responses. New Zealand White rabbits (age = 6 weeks, n = 48) were split equally into three groups (n = 16 in each group). One group was fed a basal diet only (control group), with the other two groups fed a basal diet along with 1 and 2% RHP. Mass spectrometric analysis for the RHP methanolic extract showed some phenolic compounds, such as p-coumaric, sinapinic acids, vanillic, and luteolin, as well as catechin and its isomers. Hepatic antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH, GSH-Px, and CAT) were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) by feeding rabbits diets supplemented with 1 or 2% RHP. The addition of RHP significantly enhanced immune-responses; phagocytic activity, chemotaxis, TIg, IgG, IgM, and IgA increased when growing rabbits were fed RHP compared with the control group. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of 1 or 2% RHP may play a role as an enhancer of growth and immune response in growing rabbits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aascorbic acid 3acarotenoids 3acatechin 3achemotaxis 3adietary supplements 3ahematology 3aimmune response 3aluteolin 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidative stress 3apepper 3aphagocytosis 3avitamin E1 aAbdelhakeam, Mostafa 1 aEl-Shafei, Sally 1 aEl-Rahman, Atef  Abd1 aIsmail, Zienhom 1 aZanouny, Abdalrahman 1 aShaker, Emad 1 aS.

The processes in the model are the settling of larvae onto empty space, and the growth and mortality of the settled organisms. The rate of settlement per unit of unoccupied space is assumed to be determined by factors outside of the local system. The model predicts the number of animals of each age in the local system through time. The model is offered in both discrete and continuous—time versions. The principal result is that the growth of the settled organisms is destabilizing. In the model, there is always a state where recruitment balances mortality. However, growth can interfere with recruitment and can destabilize this steady state, provided also that the settlement rate is sufficiently high. The model suggests that two qualitatively distinct pictures of population structure result, depending on the settlement rate. In the high settlement limit, the intertidal landscape is a mosaic of cohorts, punctuated with occasional gaps of vacant substrate. In the low settlement limit, the intertidal landscape has vacant space and organisms of all ages mixed together and spatial variation in abundance is caused by microgeographic variation in settlement and mortality rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic invertebrates 3alandscapes 3alarvae 3alittoral zone 3amodels 3amortality 3apopulation structure1 aIwasa, Yō,1 aBaxter, Charles0 tEcology.g1985 Feb., v. 66, no. 1 p.54-67dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19413063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245010400134300001400238520089600252592002801148650004301176650002701219650001601246650001801262650002401280650002201304650001701326650001301343653001901356653002401375653002001399653002801419653003001447700002101477773014001498852000901638655001201647IND60721427920221120130010.0201224e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072142792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShekhawat, A.K.S.10aStudies on selection parameters in relation to TLCV incidence in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L)  ap. 46-54.  aSelection can’t be applied on the basis of a single character because most of the characters are polygenic in nature and are influenced by each other.

The results show significant increases during ripening in weight, calibre, soluble solids content, fructose, total phenols, total anthocyanins and total antioxidant activity; a non-significant decrease in firmness; and significant decreases in the colour parameters of both skin and flesh and in glucose. The following compounds were identified and quantified using HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS: 5 anthocyanins, of which the most abundant was cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; 3 hydroxycinnamic acids, principal of which was p-coumaroylquinic acid; a flavonol (rutin); and a flavan-3-ol (epicatechin), which was the least abundant of all the phenolic compounds.

Genotype D is the most prevalent HBV strain in the Mediterranean area. We studied the prevalence and distribution of HBV genotypes and subgenotypes in a total of 73 HBsAg-positive patients living in Albania, and reconstructed the epidemiological history of the most prevalent HBV D subgenotype using a “phylodynamic” framework. A time-scaled genealogy of the Albanian patients’ and reference P gene sequences with known sampling dates was reconstructed using an MCMC Bayesian approach that allows population growth to be estimated on the basis of coalescent theory. All of the Albanian subjects were infected with the HBV D genotype, and a percentage varying from 44.4% to 100% (depending on the ethnic or risk group) were infected with subgenotype D2, the most prevalent in the study population (72.4%). The other subgenotypes present in a minority of subjects were D1 (13.8%) and D3 (13.8%). The Bayesian skyline plot population dynamics analysis showed that genotype D2 entered the Albanian population in the late 1960s, and that the effective number of infections grew gradually until the second half of the 1980s and more rapidly until the mid-1990s, when it reached a plateau that still persists today. Our data suggest that political and socio-economic factors played an important role in determining the rapid spread of HBV infection in Albania.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3agenotype 3ahepatitis B antigens 3anucleotide sequences 3apatients 3apolitics 3apopulation growth 3arisk 3asocioeconomic factors 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aDNA, Viral 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aHepatitis Bxepidemiology 2aHepatitis B virusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhylogeny 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aYoung Adult 3aAlbania 3aMediterranean region 0aAlbaniaxepidemiology.1 aShkjezi, Renata1 aEbranati, Erika1 aGabanelli, Elena1 aAbazaj, Zhani1 aTanzi, Elisabetta1 aKraja, Dhimiter1 aBino, Silva1 aCiccozzi, Massimo1 aGalli, Massimo0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2012 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.291-298dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003200137245010300169300001600272520101500288592002801303650002201331650001601353650001601369650001301385650001601398651001501414773009601429856007101525852000901596655001201605IND60518741220221122030232.0160418e198502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051874122DNAL7 a10.2307/19413142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMackay, D.

A montane California population of butterflies was studied at two sites in adjacent habitats. In each study site, only one host plant species was used by the butterflies; in one site the host was the annual Collinsia torreyi, in the other it was the perennial Pedicularis semibarbata. In the Pedicularis study site, butterflies discriminated in favor of the host both by searching in areas where it was dense and by alighting preferentially on host plants. In the Collinsia study site, no evidence of a significant prealighting discrimination towards hosts was obtained. The reasons for this difference are discussed; it is suggested that the suitability of Collinsia as a host has increased recently, but that the butterflies have not yet evolved behavioral mechanisms of prealighting search that would enable them to locate these plants efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphydryas editha 3aPedicularis 3abutterflies 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3aCalifornia0 tEcology.g1985 Feb., v. 66, no. 1 p.142-151dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19413143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014800167300001400315520148200329592002801811650001801839650001301857650002101870650001201891650001901903650001001922650001501932650002301947650001401970650001301984650001401997653001002011653001202021653001002033653001002043653000802053653000702061653001002068653001002078653000702088653000802095653000802103653000802111653000802119653000702127653000702134653002502141653003402166653002502200700001402225700001602239700001402255700001402269700001402283773009202297856008502389852000902474655001202483IND60557016820221118002628.0170208e20161220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055701682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeixner, K.10aProcessing recommendations for using low-solids digestate as nutrient solution for poly-ß-hydroxybutyrate production with Synechocystis salina  ap. 61-67.  aWithin the last decades, environmental pollution with persistent plastics steadily increased; therefore the production of biodegradable materials like poly-ß-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is essential. Currently, PHB is produced with heterotrophic bacteria from crops. This leads to competition with food and feed production, which can be avoided by using photoautotrophic cyanobacteria, as Synechocystis salina, synthesizing PHB from CO2 at nutrient limitation. This study aims to increase the economic efficiency of PHB production with cyanobacteria by using nutrients from anaerobic digestate. First, growth and PHB production of S. salina in digestate fractions (supernatant and permeate, with/without precipitating agents) and dilutions thereof and then the scale-up (photobioreactor, 200 L working volume) were evaluated. With precipitated and centrifuged digestate diluted 1/3 the highest biomass (1.55gL-1) and PHB concentrations (95.4mgL-1), being 78% of those in mineral media, were achieved. In the photobioreactor-experiments biomass (1.63gL-1) and PHB concentrations (88.7mgL-1), being 79% and 72% of those in mineral medium, were reached, but in a cultivation time 10days longer than in mineral medium. The possibility to use digestate as sustainable and low cost nutrient solution for microalgae cultivation and photoautotrophic PHB production, instead of applying it on fields or processing it to achieve discharge limits, makes this application a highly valid option.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechocystis 3abacteria 3abiodegradability 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acrops 3amicroalgae 3anutrient solutions 3anutrients 3aplastics 3apollution 0a+p.a. 0a−p.a. 0aCaCO3 0aCCALA 0aCOD 0aDM 0aNH4-N 0aNO3-N 0aOD 0aoDM 0aPAR 0aPBR 0aTKN 0aTN 0aUF 0aDigestate processing 0apoly-ß-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) 0aSynechocystis salina1 aFritz, I.1 aDaffert, C.1 aMarkl, K.1 aFuchs, W.1 aDrosg, B.0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2016 Dec. 20, v. 240 p.61-67dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245011800188300001600306520134800322592002801670650001501698650001001713650002001723650001201743650003301755650000901788650002701797650002501824650001801849650001201867650001801879650002101897650003701918650001501955650002701970650002801997650001402025650003302039650003502072650002302107650004302130700002002173700002302193773010702216856008402323852000902407655001202416IND60099480420221118001718.0141105e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009948042DNAL7 a221553592pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2011.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDollet, Michel14aThe internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal RNA genes in plant trypanosomes (Phytomonas spp.) resolves 10 groups  ap. 299-308.  aThe distinction between plant trypanosomatids and opportunistic monoxenous insect trypanosomatids has not been demarcated clearly due to the mass placement of all trypanosomatids isolated from plants into the arbitrary genus Phytomonas spp. The advent of molecular markers has been useful in distinguishing plant trypanosomatids from the rest of the Trypanosomatidae family. Here we have examined the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) locus for classification purposes. This region contains two distinct ITSs flanked by the small subunit and large subunit of ribosomal RNA genes and separated by the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene. Sequences within the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene and in the ITS sequences can serve as specific markers for several of the Phytomonas groups. Microsatellite sequences were identified in Phytomonas spp. in both ITS regions. Several classes of microsatellites were seen, with inter-isolate variation that has potential for future use. Maximum Likelihood analysis of the ITS sequences of 20 Phytomonas isolates representing the eight defined groups and a few unclassified isolates revealed a total of 10 distinct subgroups within our collection, of which two are new. The ITS region, which includes the 5.8S sequence, is a robust marker for the subdivisions within the genus Phytomonas spp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytomonas 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ainsects 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aprobability analysis 3aribosomal RNA 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistry 2aGene Order 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 5.8Sxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aTrypanosomaxclassificationxgenetics.1 aSturm, Nancy R.1 aCampbell, David A.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2012 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.299-308dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012200170300001600292520179800308592002802106650001702134650001002151650002302161650001502184650001202199650003502211650001402246650001102260650002302271650001302294650001502307650001202322650001302334650001902347650001502366650001202381650004302393650002002436651001002456700002002466700001702486700001702503700002002520700002502540700002102565773009702586856008102683852000902764655001202773IND60123819720221121192733.0150405e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012381972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11625-014-0285-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashimoto, Shizuka10aMapping and characterizing ecosystem services of social–ecological production landscapes: case study of Noto, Japan  ap. 257-273.  aImproving our understanding about ecosystem production, function, and services is central to balancing both conservation and development goals while enhancing human well-being. This study builds a scientific basis for conservation and development planning by exploring the types, abundance, and spatial variation in ecosystem services in the Noto Peninsula of Japan, a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems. Although the Noto Peninsula is recognized as an important social–ecological production landscape, limited quantitative information about ecosystem services is available. This study evaluates and maps ecosystem services and explores their spatial variation using original data obtained through questionnaire surveys and secondary data from literature, statistics, and geographic information systems. The hilly and mountainous geography of the Noto Peninsula and its remoteness from large consumption markets work as constraints for agricultural provisioning services by limiting water resources, labor productivity, and choice of economically viable crops. However, the rich forests, and marine and coastal resources provide various economic opportunities for forest-, fishery-, and livestock-related provisioning services. Geographical conditions such as land use and cover type also play an important role in differentiating the spatial variation of regulating services, a variation that starkly differs to distribution patterns in other areas. Unlike provisioning and regulating services, natural and artificial landscape components including traditional and cultural constructions such as shrines and temples work as an anchor to help people appreciate intangible and tangible cultural services, linking different services to specific locales across the Noto Peninsula.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acrops 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ageography 3ahumans 3alabor productivity 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amarkets 3aplanning 3aquestionnaires 3astatistics 3asurveys 3asustainability science and engineering 3awater resources 3aJapan1 aNakamura, Shogo1 aSaito, Osamu1 aKohsaka, Ryo1 aKamiyama, Chiho1 aTomiyoshi, Mitsuyuki1 aKishioka, Tomoya0 tSustainability science.g2015 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.257-273dSpringer-Verlagx1862-40657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-014-0285-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015000174300001600324520140500340592002801745650002101773650002501794650001201819650001901831650002101850650001801871650001001889650001701899650001901916650002201935650003601957650002401993650001702017650002202034650002802056650001302084653000802097653001202105653001002117653000902127653000802136653000802144653001002152653000902162653000802171653000902179653002302188653001602211653001502227653000902242653001502251653004202266700002002308700002202328700001902350700002002369700002002389700001902409773011902428856008502547852000902632655001202641IND60554254120221122033039.0180904e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055425412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikolaeva, Svetlana10aGM1 and GD1a gangliosides modulate toxic and inflammatory effects of E. coli lipopolysaccharide by preventing TLR4 translocation into lipid rafts  ap. 239-247.  aExogenous gangliosides are known to inhibit the effects of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in different cells exhibiting a nti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities. The mechanisms underlying ganglioside action are not fully understood. Because LPS recognition and receptor complex formation occur in lipid rafts, and gangliosides play a key role in their maintenance, we hypothesize that protective effects of exogenous gangliosides would depend on inhibition of LPS signaling via prevention of TLR4 translocation into lipid rafts. The effect of GM1 and GD1a gangliosides on LPS-induced toxic and inflammatory reactions in PC12 cells, and in epithelial cells isolated from the frog urinary bladder, was studied. In PC12 cells, GD1a and GM1 significantly reduced the effect of LPS on the decrease of cell survival and on stimulation of reactive oxygen species production. In epithelial cells, gangliosides decreased LPS-stimulated iNOS expression, NO, and PGE2 production. Subcellular fractionation, in combination with immunoblotting, showed that pretreatment of cells with GM1, GD1a, or methyl-β-cyclodextrin, completely eliminated the effect of LPS on translocation of TLR4 into lipid rafts. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that ganglioside-induced prevention of TLR4 translocation into lipid rafts could be a mechanism of protection against LPS in various cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aToll-like receptor 4 3abladder 3acell viability 3aepithelial cells 3afractionation 3afrogs 3agangliosides 3aimmunoblotting 3aimmunosuppression 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3alipopolysaccharides 3anitric oxide 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 0aARS 0aDCDF-DA 0aFUBEC 0aiNOS 0aLPS 0aMTT 0aMβCD 0aPGE2 0aROS 0aTLR4 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aGanglioside 0aLipid raft 0aTLR4 0aPC12 cells 0aFrog urinary bladder epithelial cells1 aBayunova, Lubov1 aSokolova, Tatyana1 aVlasova, Yulia1 aBachteeva, Vera1 aAvrova, Natalia1 aParnova, Rimma0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 Mar., v. 1851, no. 3 p.239-247dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04358naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001600287520283700303592002803140650002103168650001403189650002103203650001903224650001503243650001603258650001503274650002303289650001203312650002303324650001403347650002003361650001003381650002603391650001903417650002403436650002903460653001603489653001703505653001403522653003103536653002803567700002503595700002103620773012103641856008103762852000903843655001203852IND60610663920221120061119.0180829e20170105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061066392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2016.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAka, Juliette A.10aEstradiol-independent modulation of breast cancer transcript profile by 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1  ap. 175-186.  a17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17β-HSD1) is a steroidal enzyme which, in breast cancer cells, mainly synthesizes 17-beta-estradiol (E2), an estrogenic hormone that stimulates breast cancer cell growth. We previously showed that the enzyme increased breast cancer cell proliferation via a dual effect on E2 and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels and impacted gene expression and protein profile of breast cancer cells cultured in E2-contained medium. Here, we used RNA interference technique combined with microarray analyses to investigate the effect of 17β-HSD1 expression on breast cancer cell transcript profile in steroid-deprived condition. Our data revealed that knockdown of 17β-HSD1 gene, HSD17B1, modulates the transcript profile of the hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line T47D, with 105 genes regulated 1.5 fold or higher (p < 0.05) in estradiol-independent manner. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), we additionally assessed functional enrichment analyses, including biological functions and canonical pathways, and found that, in concordance with the role of 17β-HSD1 in cancer cell growth, most regulated genes are cancer-related genes. Genes that primarily involved in the cell cycle progression, such as the cyclin A2 gene, CCNA2, are generally down-regulated whereas genes involved in apoptosis and cell death, including the pro-apoptotic gene XAF1, IFIH1 and FGF12, are on the contrary up-regulated by 17β-HSD1 knockdown, and 21% of the modulated genes belong to this latter functional category. This indicates that 17β-HSD1 may be involved in oncogenesis by favoring anti-apoptosis pathway in breast cancer cells and correborates with its previously shown role in increasing breast cancer cell proliferation. The gene regulation occurring in steroid-deprived conditions showed that 17β-HSD1 can modulate endogenous gene expression in steroid-independent manners. Besides, we tested the ability of estrogen to induce or repress endogenous genes of T47D by microarray analysis. Expression of a total of 130 genes were found to increase or decrease 1.5-fold or higher (p < 0.05) in response to E2 treatment (1 nM for 48 h), revealing a list of potential new estrogen-responsive genes and providing useful information for further studies of estrogen-dependent breast cancer mechanisms. In conclusion, in breast cancer cells, in addition to its implication in the E2-dependent gene transcription, the present study demonstrates that 17β-HSD1 also modulates gene expression via mechanisms independent of steroid actions. Those mechanisms that may include the ligand-independent gene transcription of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), whose expression is positively correlated with that of the enzyme, and that may implicate 17β-HSD1 in anti-apoptosis pathways, have been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogens 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotein composition 3atranscription (genetics) 0a17beta-HSD1 0aCancer cells 0aEstradiol 0aGene expression modulation 0aSteroid-deprived medium1 aCalvo, Ezequiel-Luis1 aLin, Sheng-Xiang0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2017 Jan. 05, v. 439 p.175-186dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245008500159300002000244520164000264592002801904650001601932650001801948650001901966650001101985650001801996650002602014650002202040650002202062650001602084650001902100650001602119653000802135653000902143653000802152653001802160653001102178700001502189700001902204700001602223700005402239700005302293700005302346700005402399773014202453856007802595852000902673655001202682IND60596038020221118072606.0180610e20180307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059603802DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b009752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cong10aSpontaneous Interfacial Dipole Orientation Effect of Acetic Acid Solubilized PFN  ap. 10270-10279.  aPoly[(9,9-dioctyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)] (PFN) is a very important interfacial modifier in organic photovoltaic and organic light-emitting diodes to improve device performance, where their molecular dipole has been regarded to play a key role. In this work, we have reported a spontaneous interfacial dipole orientation effect in acetic acid dissolved PFN, which is strongly related to the interfacial dipole and the corresponding device performance. In direct spin-coating, the interfacial dipole is 1.08 Debye with interfacial contact angle 84.8°, whereas after self-assembly of 10 min, the interfacial dipole is balanced at 4.21 Debye, with the interfacial contact angle decreasing to 76.8°. Without strong interaction with the substrate, the energy of upward amine groups is much lower than that of downward ones in theoretical simulation, which would be the driving force of this spontaneous process. The preferred conformations of PFN molecules on hydroxylated substrates have over 99% amine groups outward, and the theoretical average dipole calculated from the weight of these conformations is 4.48 Debye, which is close to the experimental result and indicates a high ratio of upward amine groups in self-assembled films. This effect obviously changes the device performance, such as an obvious positive threshold voltage shift in transistors and a distinct increase of the short-circuit current/open-circuit voltage in organic solar cells. This effect provides a deeper understanding of the PFN interlayer mechanism and has potential application in optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acontact angle 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3ahydroxylation 3alight emitting diodes 3amaterials science 3asimulation models 3asolar cells 3asolubilization 3atransistors 0aPFN 0aOTFT 0aOPV 0aself-assembly 0adipole1 aLuo, Yinqi1 aZheng, Jieming1 aLiu, Linlin1 aXie, Zengqi1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9805-81761 aHuang, Fei1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9665-66421 aYang, Bing1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4827-09261 aMa, Yuguang1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0373-58730 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Mar. 07, v. 10, no. 12 p.10270-10279dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b009753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245011600159300002000275520087600295592002801171650002401199650001201223650001101235650001201246700003301258700001201291700001501303700001401318700005801332700002001390700005401410773015001464856007601614852000901690655001201699IND60672901920191217000000.0191017e20190930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067290192DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b097802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhengtao10a[6]Cyclo-para-phenylmethine: An Analog of Benzene Showing Global Aromaticity and Open-Shell Diradical Character  ap. 16266-16270.  aWe report a [6]cyclo-para-phenylmethine ([6]CPPM) macrocycle that shows benzene-like electronic properties.

One averaged ¹H NMR peak for the protons on the backbone was observed at room temperature, but it was split into one shielded and one deshielded resonance below 198 K, consistent with its globally aromatic character with a dominant 30π conjugation pathway along the periphery. It exhibits open-shell diradical character with a moderate singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔES₋T = −6.23 kcal/mol). Its dication is antiaromatic and open-shell, showing a smaller ΔES₋T value (−4.18 kcal/mol).

Relevance of the topic is that nowadays the issues of safety and quality control are not fully resolved in the country, as well as the veterinary and sanitary assessment of the meat of snails of the genus Helix, which are used for food purposes; in particular, there is no data on the content of toxic elements in a meat of different species of snails for different processing modes. The aim of the study was to investigate the meat of snails of the genus Helix for different processing to find heavy metals in it. The meat of snails of genus Helix has been used for the study, sub-species: Helix pomatia, Helix aspersa maxima and Helix aspersa muller. 30 samples of snails of each species grown in snails farm in the Kyiv region have been selected for the study. Meat of snails has been studied after different technological processing: live, chilled, and cooked and frozen (n = 30). The research has been conducted in the winter, when the snails have been in anabiosis. Results of the study show that in accordance with the requirements of DSTU 7821:2016 “Live edible gastropod molluscs. Specifications”, the content of toxic elements in the meat of live snails corresponds to the maximum allowable level. One of the key indicators of safety of meat, in accordance with the requirements of DSTU 7821:2016, is the content of toxic elements in it: lead, cadmium, copper, zinc. It has been found that the meat of snails, in addition to the above mentioned heavy metals, contains also arsenic and iron, which relate to toxic elements as well. Therefore, when developing a complex system of veterinary and sanitary assessment of quality and safety of snails’ meat, we propose to control it on the content of such toxic elements as arsenic and iron. In addition, we recommend to improve the “The Required Minimum List…” (2004) with the studies of the meat of snails of the genus Helix for different technological processing on the content of toxic elements: lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, arsenic and iron.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHelix aspersa 3aHelix pomatia 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acopper 3afarms 3afood safety 3airon 3alead 3ameat 3apollution 3aquality control 3atoxicity 3awinter 3azinc 3aUkraine 0atoxic elements 0ahelix pomatia 0ahelix aspersa maxima 0ahelix aspersa muller 0asnails’ meat 0aheavy metals1 aJacenko, I.

Five pathogens (grapevine leafroll-associated viruses) are recognized as causal agents of this disease, of which Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) is the most common. Although there is no cure for the disease, management strategies (including vigilant removal of infected vines) can drastically limit its spread and economic impact. Comprehensive mapping (total population sampling) of disease presence on the ground is cumbersome and cost prohibitive in many situations. In addition, the practice of identifying diseased vines requires individuals to be highly trained to recognize symptoms. Compared to more traditional detection methods, airborne hyperspectral imaging offers a potentially valuable alternative for monitoring the disease that is cost effective, reliable and automatable. This study tests the use of hyperspectral imaging to aid in the management of GLD.Over the span of two years we monitored five Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards: ground surveys recorded the incidence of visual symptoms of disease in the field during the same months in which hyperspectral maps recorded disease incidence from the air. A customized Geographic Information System (GIS) methodology was developed to compare the visual symptoms to the results of the hyperspectral imaging technique. For a select number of vines, disease incidence was then confirmed by laboratory assays. On average, detection sensitivity was 94.1%, with a range of 88% to greater than 99% per vineyard. Various vineyard-specific factors appear to compromise detection sensitivity. Overall, our results show that remote hyperspectral imaging of GLRaV-3 infected Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards can be a useful and cost-effective approach to mapping diseased vines. Future studies should focus on the use of this tool for detecting GLRaV-3 in other grape varieties, as well as other grapevine pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 3aVitis 3aair 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3adisease incidence 3adisease surveillance 3aeconomic impact 3afruit quality 3ageographic information systems 3agrapes 3ahyperspectral imagery 3apathogens 3asurveys 3avigor 3avines 3avineyards 3aviruses 0aWine grape 0aGrapevine leafroll disease 0aGrapevine leafroll-associated virus 0aHyperspectral imaging 0aVirus detection1 aStaid, Matthew1 aStaid, Melissa1 aCooper, Monica L.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 130 p.109-117dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2016.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002400176245010800200300001500308520168000323592002802003650001202031650001402043650001702057650001902074650001802093650001202111650001702123650002002140650001602160700001902176700002502195773015102220856006902371856010102440990002302541852000902564655001202573IND60643529320221122031355.0190510e20140416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064352932DNAL7 a10.3791/514772doi7 aPMC41721262pmcid7 a247990022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, Richard S.10aVisualization of endosome dynamics in living nerve terminals with four-dimensional fluorescence imaging  ap. e51477.  aFour-dimensional (4D) light imaging has been used to study behavior of small structures within motor nerve terminals of the thin transversus abdominis muscle of the garter snake. Raw data comprises time-lapse sequences of 3D z-stacks. Each stack contains 4-20 images acquired with epifluorescence optics at focal planes separated by 400-1,500 nm. Steps in the acquisition of image stacks, such as adjustment of focus, switching of excitation wavelengths, and operation of the digital camera, are automated as much as possible to maximize image rate and minimize tissue damage from light exposure. After acquisition, a set of image stacks is deconvolved to improve spatial resolution, converted to the desired 3D format, and used to create a 4D "movie" that is suitable for variety of computer-based analyses, depending upon the experimental data sought. One application is study of the dynamic behavior of two classes of endosomes found in nerve terminals-macroendosomes (MEs) and acidic endosomes (AEs)-whose sizes (200-800 nm for both types) are at or near the diffraction limit. Access to 3D information at each time point provides several advantages over conventional time-lapse imaging. In particular, size and velocity of movement of structures can be quantified over time without loss of sharp focus. Examples of data from 4D imaging reveal that MEs approach the plasma membrane and disappear, suggesting that they are exocytosed rather than simply moving vertically away from a single plane of focus. Also revealed is putative fusion of MEs and AEs, by visualization of overlap between the two dye-containing structures as viewed in each three orthogonal projections.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3aendosomes 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3amotor neurons 3amuscles 3anerve tissue 3aplasma membrane 3awavelengths1 aKiss, Ilona M.1 aWilkinson, Robert S.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Apr. 16, , no. 86 p.e51477-e51477dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/514773Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51477/visualization-endosome-dynamics-living-nerve-terminals-with-four  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245006700163300001600230520097500246592002801221650001901249650001101268650001201279650002501291650001201316650001101328650001601339651001901355700002201374700001701396773007801413856008301491852000901574655001201583IND60096833520221118050735.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009683352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkea, Jim14aThe role of gas infrastructure in promoting UK energy security  ap. 202-213.  aThis paper considers whether commercially driven investment in gas infrastructure is sufficient to provide security of gas supply or whether strategic investment encouraged by government is desirable. The paper focuses on the UK in the wider EU context. A modelling analysis of the impact of disruptions, lasting from days to months, at the UK's largest piece of gas infrastructure is at the heart of the paper. The disruptions are hypothesised to take place in the mid-2020s, after the current wave of commercial investments in storage and LNG import facilities has worked its way through. The paper also analyses the current role of gas in energy markets, reviews past disruptions to gas supplies, highlights current patterns of commercial investment in gas infrastructure in the UK and assesses the implications of recent EU legislation on security of gas supply. The paper concludes with an analysis of the desirability of strategic investment in gas infrastructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aenergy 3aimports 3alaws and regulations 3amarkets 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aUnited Kingdom1 aChaudry, Modassar1 aWang, Xinxin0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Apr., v. 43 p.202-213dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245015900161300001800320520106900338592002801407650001901435650001101454650001401465650001101479650002101490650001501511650001401526650001401540650002201554650001301576650001701589653001301606653003001619653001801649653002201667653002201689700001801711700001701729700005801746700001601804773013901820856007801959852000902037655001202046IND60596038320221118072557.0180610e20180213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059603832DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b009862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhi-Mei10aSelf-Template Synthesis of Co–Se–S–O Hierarchical Nanotubes as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution under Alkaline and Neutral Conditions  ap. 8231-8237.  aWe develop a facile self-template synthetic method to construct hierarchical Co–Se–S–O (CoSeₓS₂–ₓ@Co(OH)₂) nanotubes on a carbon cloth as a self-standing electrode for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In the synthetic process, separate selenization and sulfurization on the Co(OH)F precursor in different solvents have played an important role in constructing CoSeₓS₂–ₓ (Co–Se–S) hierarchical nanotubes, which was further transformed into the nanotube-like Co–Se–S–O via an in situ electrochemical oxidation process. The Co–Se–S–O obtained by the Kirkendall effect through two stepwise anion-exchange reactions represents the first quaternary Co–Se–S–O nanotube array, which dramatically enhances its surface area and conductivity. Further, it only requires low overpotentials of 230 and 480 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm–² current density. The OER performance of Co–Se–S–O is much more efficient than that of its monochalcogenide counterparts, as well as the commercial benchmark catalyst IrO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ananotubes 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3asolvents 3asurface area 0ananotube 0aoxygen evolution reaction 0aself-template 0aKirkendall effect 0aneutral condition1 aWang, Jia-Wei1 aTan, Jing-Bo1 aZhang, Zhi-Ming1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3116-756X1 aLu, Tong-Bu0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 13, v. 10, no. 9 p.8231-8237dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b009863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245007900166300001600245520162900261592002801890650001401918650002301932650001101955650002401966650003101990650002602021650001102047650003002058650001602088651001002104700001402114773007802128856008302206852000902289655001202298IND60096833820221118050620.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009683382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Hongming10aCoupling model of energy consumption with changes in environmental utility  ap. 235-243.  aThis study explores the relationships between metropolis energy consumption and environmental utility changes by a proposed Environmental Utility of Energy Consumption (EUEC) model. Based on the dynamic equilibrium of input–output economics theory, it considers three simulation scenarios: fixed-technology, technological-innovation, and green-building effect. It is applied to analyse Hong Kong in 1980–2007. Continual increase in energy consumption with rapid economic growth degraded environmental utility. First, energy consumption at fixed-technology was determined by economic outcome. In 1990, it reached a critical balanced state when energy consumption was 22×10⁹kWh. Before 1990 (x₁<22×10⁹kWh), rise in energy consumption improved both economic development and environmental utility. After 1990 (x₁>22×10⁹kWh), expansion of energy consumption facilitated socio-economic development but suppressed environmental benefits. Second, technological-innovation strongly influenced energy demand and improved environmental benefits. The balanced state remained in 1999 when energy consumption reached 32.33×10⁹kWh. Technological-innovation dampened energy consumption by 12.99%, exceeding the fixed-technology condition. Finally, green buildings reduced energy consumption by an average of 17.5% in 1990–2007. They contributed significantly to energy saving, and buffered temperature fluctuations between external and internal environment. The case investigations verified the efficiency of the EUEC model, which can effectively evaluate the interplay of energy consumption and environmental quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aecosystem services 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental quality 3amodels 3asocioeconomic development 3atemperature 3aChina1 aJim, C.Y.0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Apr., v. 43 p.235-243dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014300167520101000310592002801320650001001348650002301358650002501381650002101406650002001427650002801447650001501475650002101490650001701511650001101528650002501539650001901564650001901583650001301602650002401615650001701639650001301656653002001669653002701689653002101716653002101737653003201758700001901790700002001809700002101829700001401850700001901864700001701883700005101900773009201951856008602043852000902129655001202138IND60770702220221121052546.0221004e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077070222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1233912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jinchun10aGinsenoside Rg3 determination using an electro-synthesized molecularly imprinted polymer on MWCNT-Ti3C2Tx nanocomposite modified electrode  aRare ginsenoside Rg3 is a main active ingredient in ginseng, which is more easily absorbed by human body and plays its role. Determination of Rg3 in edible and medicinal samples is a key factor for quality evaluation and effective monitoring of adulteration. In this study, an electrochemical sensor was developed based on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) and nanomaterial amplification. MIP was achieved by electro-polymerization with Rg3 as the template molecule and the functional monomer was o-phenylenediamine. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and titanium carbide (Ti₃C₂Tₓ) nanocomposites formed an excellent porous structure, which exhibited the advantages of increasing the specific surface area and electrical conductivity. The prepared sensor presented a great linear relation of Rg3 in the range of 10–2000 μg mL⁻¹ with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.34 μg mL⁻¹.

Growth parameters of both trees with −P and +P exhibited little change. The Pi content in leaves of both Pi-free trees decreased to about 65–70% of the control after cultivation for two to three weeks. Root Pi content of both Pi deprivation trees were by 30–45% lower than that of the Pi supply. Phosphate starvation significantly increased both intracellular and extracellular acid phosphatase activities. Intracellular and extracellular acid phosphatase activities were negatively correlated with Pi content in roots, while intracellular acid phosphatase activities were significantly positively correlated with Pi content in leaves under Pi starvation. These results indicated that excreted acid phosphatase mainly released Pi from organic phosphorus compounds, while intracellular acid phosphatase in leaves regulated the redistribution of Pi in tissues for adaptation to a calcareous soil with a low phosphate level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpinus 3aacid phosphatase 3acalcareous soils 3acorrelation 3aleaves 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aplant growth 3aroots 3astarvation 3atissues 3atrees1 aHong, K.1 aYi, Y.0 tRussian journal of plant physiology.g2015 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.57-64dSpringer-Verlagx1021-44377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10214437150101853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245012300196300002000319520163900339592002801978650001602006650002002022650001902042650002002061650001102081650001502092650002002107650001602127650001902143650001402162650002602176650003302202650001402235650001102249650001902260650001602279650001002295653002802305653003102333653002502364653001702389653001702406653002502423700006202448773014202510856007802652852000902730655001202739IND60596038620221118072617.0180610e20180425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059603862DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b009952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zheng1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9066-579110aUltrasonic Preparation of Porous Silica-Dye Microspheres: Sensors for Quantification of Urinary Trimethylamine N-Oxide  ap. 15820-15828.  aTrimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), the N-oxide metabolite of trimethylamine (TMA), is a key index in the determination of a wide variety of human cardiac or kidney diseases. A colorimetric sensor array comprising ultrasonically prepared silica-dye microspheres was developed for rapid, portable, and sensitive detection of urinary TMAO. To prepare the sensor array, 13 different organically modified silica (ormosil)-dye composites were synthesized from the hydrolysis/pyrolysis of ultrasonically sprayed organosiloxane precursors under optimized reaction conditions; the resulting products are uniformly sized nanoporous microspheres that are effective colorimetric sensors for various volatile analytes. The effective quantification of aqueous TMAO (which is not volatile) was based on sensing the volatile TMA produced from a simple catalytic reduction of TMAO in situ. RGB color-change patterns from digital images of the sensor array permit precise discrimination among a wide range of TMAO concentrations (10–750 μM) in simulated urine samples; both hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis achieve >99% accuracy in data classification. The calculated limit of detection of urinary TMAO is ∼4 μM, which is substantially below the median level of healthy subjects (∼380 μM). The array of sensors could be simplified to only a couple of strongly responsive elements for the ease of field use, and the process could be developed as a point-of-care tool in combination with digital imaging for the early diagnosis of cardiovascular or kidney diseases from the measurement of fasting urinary level of TMAO.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adigital images 3aearly diagnosis 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3akidney diseases 3ametabolites 3amicroparticles 3ananopores 3apoint-of-care systems 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyrolysis 3asilica 3atrimethylamine 3aultrasonics 3aurine 0asilica-dye microspheres 0aultrasonic spray pyrolysis 0acolorimetric sensing 0asensor array 0aurinary TMAO 0apoint-of-care device1 aSuslick, Kenneth S.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5422-07010 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Apr. 25, v. 10, no. 18 p.15820-15828dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b009953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03903naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245010900131300001500240506002800255520247100283592002802754506003702782650002502819650001402844650001102858650001202869650001702881650001402898650001002912650001302922650001302935650001502948650001302963650001802976650000902994650001003003650001203013650001503025650001303040650001403053650001203067650001503079653001403094653002603108653001503134653001303149653002403162653001003186653001503196773014103211852000903352655001203361IND60774351720221207091728.0090317e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077435172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoskoboynik, A10aChimerism a natural ability to tolerate kin, evolutionary traits connecting mammalian and protochordates  ap. S9-S20.  aResource is Open Access  aIn the middle of the 20th century, Owen (1945, 1954) and Billingham et al. (1953) immunological studies suggested that fetal exposure to foreign antigens during pregnancy induce immunologic tolerance in the fetus. Recently, Mold et al. found that a substantial number of maternal cells crosses the placenta to reside in fetal lymph nodes and induces the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress fetal anti-maternal immunity. These Tregs cells persist till, at least, early adulthood. This result demonstrates how chimerism induces fetal tolerance to maternal antigens during mammalian pregnancy. Natural chimerism is the coexistence of two or more genomic lineages within the same individual. It is a common phenomenon which can be detected in a wide variety of multi-cellular organisms. In mammals, natural chimerism can be established during pregnancy between the mother and the fetus or between fetuses in a multiple embryos pregnancy. Restriction of natural chimerism mainly to kin is also observed in colonial marine protochordates. In protochordates, like Botryllus schlosseri, natural chimerism can be established through fusion of vasculature, between a parent colony and its progeny or between siblings (adult distinct colonies).The ability to tolerate a partial allogeneic individual and to create a chimeric entity between these colonies is determined by a single, highly polymorphic, fusion/histocompatibility locus (Fu/HC). Colonies that share at least one allele in their Fu/HC locus would fuse upon contact. A pair that does not share any Fu/HC allele would not. In the chimera, cells transmigrate between partners and in some cases, replace the germline and/or the somatic tissues of the host. This genotype replacement is mediated by stem cells (termed somatic/germ cell parasitism). Botryllus colonies propagate asexually through budding, therefore somatic stem cell parasitism in host colonies can induce the development of a partial allogeneic entity (buds) within the host colony. In this way, chimerism in protochordates serves as a state that enables the development of a “virtual embryo” within the host colony. In light of Mold et al., study, which demonstrates a role to chimerism in tolerance induction during pregnancy, studying the immunological mediators for natural acceptance of partial allogeneic allograft in protochordates may reveal the evolutionary precursors to the tolerance state during mammalian pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBotryllus schlosseri 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aalleles 3aallografting 3achimerism 3afetus 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agerm cells 3aimmunity 3ainvertebrates 3aloci 3alymph 3amammals 3aparasitism 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3astem cells 0achimerism 0aimmunologic tolerance 0astem cells 0atunicate 0amammalian pregnancy 0aFu/HC 0auterine NK0 tInvertebrate survival journal.g2009 Mar., v. 6, no. 1S p.S9-S20dUniversity of Modena and Reggio EmiliawJournal:27775x1824-307X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03657naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006300149245013700212300001600349520193500365592002802300650001602328650001602344650001402360650002202374650001302396650002302409650001302432650001702445650001402462650001402476650001202490650002002502650003102522650001202553650001902565653001202584653001302596653003202609653001102641653002002652653002002672653001202692653000702704653000802711653000602719653000702725653000802732700005902740700002302799700002302822700003402845773009502879856008402974852000903058655001203067IND60525629120221118191553.0190401e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052562912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2016.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarschburger, Petra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7979-745110aEmpowering Parents of Obese Children (EPOC): A randomized controlled trial on additional long-term weight effects of parent training  ap. 148-156.  aAlthough inpatient lifestyle treatment for obese children and adolescents can be highly effective in the short term, long-term results are unconvincing. One possible explanation might be that the treatment takes place far from parents' homes, limiting the possibility to incorporate the parents, who play a major role in establishing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in childhood and adolescence. The main goal was to develop a brief behaviorally oriented parent training program that enhances ‘obesity-specific’ parenting skills in order to prevent relapse. We hypothesized that the inclusion of additional parent training would lead to an improved long-term weight course of obese children. Parents of obese children (n = 686; 7–13 years old) either participated in complementary cognitive-behavioral group sessions (n = 336) or received written information only (n = 350) during the inpatient stay. Children of both groups attended multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation. BMI-SDS as a primary outcome was evaluated at baseline, post-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat (ITT) as well as per-protocol analyses (PPA) were performed. A significant within-group decrease of 0.24 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.30) BMI-SDS points from the beginning of the inpatient stay through the first year was found, but no group difference at the one-year follow-up (mean difference 0.02; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.07). We also observed an increase in quality of life scores, intake of healthy food and exercise for both groups, without differences between groups (ITT and PPA). Thus, while the inpatient treatment proved highly effective, additional parent training did not lead to better results in long-term weight maintenance or to better psychosocial well-being compared to written psycho-educational material. Further research should focus on subgroups to answer the question of differential treatment effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aeducation programs 3aexercise 3ahealthy diet 3alifestyle 3aparenting 3aparents 3aquality of life 3arandomized clinical trials 3arelapse 3aweight control 0aObesity 0aChildren 0aRandomized controlled trial 0aWeight 0aParent training 0aQuality of life 0aBMI-SDS 0aCI 0aITT 0aM 0aMD 0aPPA1 aKroeller, Katja1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3016-74531 aHaerting, Johannes1 aUnverzagt, Susanne1 avan Egmond-Fröhlich, Andreas0 tAppetite.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 103 p.148-156dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245011000181300001400291520080900305592002801114650001901142650001501161650000901176650001101185650002501196650001501221650001401236650002601250650001201276653001301288653001101301653002701312653002501339653001201364653001301376700003301389700002001422700002001442700002801462700003801490773011001528856008501638852000901723655001201732IND60465647620221118053711.0151123e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046564762DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2015.10139632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuárez-Bonnet, Alejandro10aComparison of immunoreaction between two commercial antibodies against 14-3-3σ protein in canine tissues  ap. 83-86.  a14-3-3 σ is a cell cycle regulator that has been designed as a ‘double-edged sword’ in the context of human cancers, in which in some it appears to function as a tumour suppressor with decreased expression contributing to tumourigenesis, while in others it may be involved in tissue invasion and metastasis. A variety of studies in both human and canine species have been focused in the immunohistochemical detection of 14-3-3 σ , especially in neoplastic diseases. Different commercial available antibodies have been previously used to detect 14-3-3 σ in canine tissues. This paper shows important differences regarding the pattern of expression between monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against this protein and proposes the use of the former in future studies of 14-3-3 σ in canine species.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle 3adogs 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3apolyclonal antibodies 3atissues 0aantibody 0acanine 0aepithelial cell marker 0aimmunohistochemistry 0atissues 0a14-3-3σ1 aAguirre-Sanceledonio, María1 aAndrada, Marisa1 aHerráez, Pedro1 aQuesada-Canales, Óscar1 aEspinosa de los Monteros, Antonio0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2016 Jan. 1, v. 44, no. 1 p.83-86dTaylor & Francisx0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2015.10139633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04213naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012200171300001200293520247300305592002802778650001002806650002202816650001902838650001102857650001702868650002702885650001202912650001002924650002402934650001302958650002102971650001402992650001903006650001503025650001503040650001403055650003303069650001603102650001003118650001203128651001003140653001803150653003303168653002403201653002003225653005003245653001003295700002303305700002103328700002103349700002003370700002003390700001903410773007503429856008603504852000903590655001203599IND60539369620221116165033.0160815e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053936962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Kanako10aEffects of traditional soil management practices on the nutrient status in Sahelian sandy soils of Niger, West Africa  ap. 1-8.  aIn the Fakara region of the Sahel zone, Niger, West Africa, farmers have been implementing traditional soil management practices such as the application of dry farmyard manure (FYM) and household waste (HHW), livestock corralling, and fallows. Previous studies, however, have not accumulated enough data on the effects of these practices on the soil nitrogen (N) pool in the Sahelian sandy soils.The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of these traditional practices on each N pool and on other nutrients. As the indicator of available N, phosphate buffer extractable organic nitrogen (PEON) was employed. Total N was significantly higher in the fields adjacent to houses (H) and suburban fields where FYM had been applied for 10years (FYM10) or 5years (FYM5), compared with that in the no-treatment fields (NT) which had received no organic matter (OM) and chemical fertilizer for several decades. FYM10, H, and reserved fallows (RF) showed significantly higher levels of PEON than of NT. The amounts of total N and PEON in soils from all corralling practices, and all normal fallows were at the same level compared with NT. Similarly, the mineral N pool was higher for the soils from H, FYM10, and mixed corralling with sheep and goats.The principal component analyses (PCA) showed that all eigenvalues of soil pH, exchangeable potassium (K), available phosphorus (P), total N and carbon (C), PEON and mineral N in principal component 1 (PC1) were positive, thus relating strongly to soil management practices which can enhance the essential nutrients: the pool of N, P, and K, and C pool in soil. For PC2, the eigenvalues of mineral N, exchangeable K, and pH were positive, strongly relating to soil management practices which can enhance cations in soil. In comparison with NT the eigenvalues of PC1 of the managements with OM application were higher than in NT while those for the normal fallows without OM application were as low as those in NT. The eigenvalues of PC2 were higher for H and all corralling practices compared with the values for NT. We understood that the practices of transporting manure and corralling are important for the improvement of the fertility of Sahelian soils. Furthermore, the findings suggest that corralling is a more economical and useful practice than the others; livestock are moved around and drop manure directly on the farmland, thus the loss of OM in transportation and the labor requirement are also low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3aagricultural land 3aanimal manures 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aexchangeable potassium 3afarmers 3alabor 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3asandy soils 3asheep 3asoil pH 3aNiger 0aNitrogen pool 0aTransporting manure practice 0aCorralling practice 0aFallow practice 0aPhosphate-buffer extractable organic nitrogen 0aSahel1 aMatsunaga, Ryoichi1 aHayashi, Keiichi1 aMatsumoto, Naruo1 aTabo, Ramadjita1 aTobita, Satoshi1 aOkada, Kensuke0 tGeoderma.g2014 July, v. 223-225 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01623naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005300094040001800147100003800165245011600203300001400319520053500333592002800868653001300896653001000909653001700919653003500936653002500971653001000996700002401006700003101030773012601061856011301187852000901300655001201309IND60130084420221121010718.0151127e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013008442DNAL7 a10.2994/1808-9798(2007)2[47:ANSOCA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Carlos Alberto Gonççalves12aA new species of chiasmocleis (anura, microhylidae) from the atlantic rain forest of northeastern bahia, brazil  ap. 47-52.  aA new species of the genus Chiasmocleis is described from the Reserva Sapiranga, an Atlantic Rain Forest remnant in the Municipality of Mata de São João, northeastern State of Bahia, Brazil.

Birka had a strong defence: town rampart, hillfort and a water palisade. Studies of lithology, and microand macroremains in a sedimentary sequence accumulated offshore from Birka, outside the water palisade, revealed a stratigraphically distinct refuse stratum, referred to as the Birka Layer. We argue that the bulk material of the Birka Layer emanates from human activities in the town, e.g., latrine cleanings, cuttings of shore vegetation, cleaning of ditches and storage areas, and domestic animal dung. Organic remains from vegetation and animals, deposited during activities on the ice offshore from the town, e.g., winter markets, may also have contributed to the composition. The material constituting the Birka Layer started to accumulate after the construction of the protecting water palisade. In the Birka Layer and the underlying clay gyttja, there seems to be a succession of five activity phases recorded during the Birka period. After the initial establishment of the town, an expansion took place, followed by a retrogression. The most intense phase with culminating activities is registered prior to abandonment of the site, which approximately coincides with the onset of the extended final isolation process of Lake Mälaren (AD 1000-1300). The sailing routes to Birka from the south and east became too shallow and were finally cut off by the emerging thresholds. After the abandonment of Birka, the town area was utilized for cultivation and cattle-breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclay 3acleaning 3adomestic animals 3afeces 3aice 3alakes 3amarkets 3asediments 3asolid wastes 3avegetation 3awinter 3aBaltic Sea 3aSweden 0aOffshore sediment 0ahuman impact 0aViking Age 0asiliceous microfossils 0apollen and spores 0aplant macrofossils 0amineral magnetic properties 0aenvironmental history 0apalaeoecology 0aBirka 0aSweden 0alate Holocene1 aKarlsson, Sven1 aHansson, Ann-Marie1 aHedenström, Anna1 aHeimdahl, Jens1 aMiller, Urve1 aTingvall, Carin0 tHolocene.g2002 May, v. 12, no. 4 p.445-458dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683602hl558rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006900171300001400240500001500254520151700269592002801786650001801814650001301832650001801845650001401863650002401877650002401901651001401925653001601939700002101955700002001976773011501996856005502111852000902166655001202175IND4465650720221119234622.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446565072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01842.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, W. H.10aPrecision of two methods for estimating age from burbot otoliths  ap. 43-48.  a2019-12-06  aLower reproductive success and older age structure are associated with many burbot (Lota lota L.) populations that are declining or of conservation concern. Therefore, reliable methods for estimating the age of burbot are critical for effective assessment and management. In Lake Erie, burbot populations have declined in recent years due to the combined effects of an aging population ( = 10 years in 2007) and extremely low recruitment since 2002. We examined otoliths from burbot (N = 91) collected in Lake Erie in 2007 and compared the estimates of burbot age by two agers, each using two established methods (cracked‐and‐burned and thin‐section) of estimating ages from burbot otoliths. One ager was experienced at estimating age from otoliths, the other was a novice. Agreement (precision) between the two agers was higher for the thin‐section method, particularly at ages 6–11 years, based on linear regression analyses and 95% confidence intervals. As expected, precision between the two methods was higher for the more experienced ager. Both agers reported that the thin sections offered clearer views of the annuli, particularly near the margins on otoliths from burbot ages ≥8. Slides for the thin sections required some costly equipment and more than 2 days to prepare. In contrast, preparing the cracked‐and‐burned samples was comparatively inexpensive and quick. We suggest use of the thin‐section method for estimating the age structure of older burbot populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3aotoliths 3aage structure 3aLota lota 3aregression analysis 3aconfidence interval 3aLake Erie 0arecruitment1 aStapanian, M.

Following an extended and expanded version of UTAUT-2, this research proposes eight determinants of intentions to use: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price-saving orientation, habit, social influence, and perceived credibility. The data were collected from Spanish users of MARSR applications (n = 1200), and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings confirm the need to extend and expand UTAUT-2 by incorporating perceived credibility and the social norm approach. The results gathered from SEM indicate that the drivers of intentions to use MARSR are, in order of impact: habit, perceived credibility, hedonic motivation, price-saving orientation, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Habit, facilitating conditions, and intentions to use are significantly related to use. Additionally, the moderating effects of gender, age, and experience were tested by means of a multi-group analysis. The users&rsquo; experience was seen to exert a moderating effect in some of the relationships hypothesized in the model, while gender and age did not play a significant role. The findings have both research and practical implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3agender 3amodels 3amotivation 3arestaurants 3astructural equation modeling1 aForgas-Coll, Santiago 1 aSánchez, Javierq(Sánchez García),1 aRobres, Emilio 0 tSustainability.g2019 Feb. 25, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110412103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007600154300001600230520124500246592002801491650001301519650001501532650001801547650001601565650001101581650001801592650002301610651000901633773009501642856007401737852000901811655001201820IND60519640020221116150132.0160507e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051964002DNAL7 a10.1111/gwat.123702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarei, M.10aFactors Governing the Impact of Emerged Salt Diapirs on Water Resources  ap. 354-362.  aSalt diapirs in southern Iran are typically in contact with karstic and alluvial aquifers and consequently they are the most likely sources of groundwater salinization in this arid region. However, there are some salt diapirs that have no significant degradation effect on adjacent aquifers. Assessments of 62 of 122 Iranian‐emerged salt diapirs based on geological, geomorphological, hydrogeological, and hydrochemical investigations indicated that 45% of the studied salt diapirs did not have a negative impact on surrounding water resources, whereas 55% of the salt diapirs have degraded water quality of adjacent aquifers. The impacts ranged from low‐ to high‐grade salinization. We characterize here four major factors that control the impact of salt diapirs on surrounding water resources: (1) the evolutionary stage of the diapir, (2) the geological and (3) hydrogeological setting of the diapir, and (4) human activities. Identification of the major factors governing the influence of salt diapirs on the adjacent aquifers is necessary to understand the mechanism of salt diapir impact on adjacent aquifers, and subsequently to decide how to mitigate the deteriorating effect of the diapirs on the surrounding water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aarid zones 3ageomorphology 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3awater quality 3awater salinization 3aIran0 tGround water.g2016 May, v. 54, no. 3 p.354-362dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gwat.123703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245004500168300001600213520105700229592002801286650002001314650001901334650002201353650001601375650001401391650001201405650002001417700001901437700002401456700002601480700002501506773013201531856008201663990002301745852000901768655001201777IND60089361220221122055912.0141102e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008936122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beem.2013.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehnert, Thomas10aEconomic costs of overweight and obesity  ap. 105-115.  aObesity has substantially increased in recent decades and is now one of the major global health problems. The large obesity-related health burden negatively impacts many relevant health outcomes (e.g. quality of life, disability, mortality) and leads to increased healthcare utilization. This excess service use is the main driver behind high healthcare costs of obese individuals. Findings indicate that costs rise curvilinearly with increasing body mass index, especially among the obese. As more individuals of a country's population become obese, a larger share of total annual national healthcare expenditure is spent on obesity and obesity-related health problems. In addition to escalating healthcare costs, obesity goes along with indirect costs through decreases in workforce productivity. The empirical evidence has shown beyond doubt that obesity negatively impacts individuals, healthcare systems, employers, and the economy as a whole. This article provides a brief overview of selected economic consequences associated with excess-weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3aeconomic costs 3ahealth care costs 3alabor force 3amortality 3aobesity 3aquality of life1 aSonntag, Diana1 aKonnopka, Alexander1 aRiedel-Heller, Steffi1 aKönig, Hans-Helmut,0 tBest Practice & Research Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.g2013 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.105-115dElsevier Ltdx1521-690X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beem.2013.01.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245005300165300001600218520081700234592002801051650002601079650001201105650001101117650002001128700002001148773013201168856008201300990002301382852000901405655001201414IND60089361420221122094634.0141102e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008936142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beem.2013.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForhan, Mary10aObesity, functional mobility and quality of life  ap. 129-137.  aObesity is a health condition that, through a complex interaction of biopsychosocial and environmental factors, is associated with mobility disability.

Syngas release from gasifiers is indeed strongly affected by the quality of the feedstock and by the specific features and control strategy of the reactor.The paper considers the possibility to achieve, at the same time, high efficiency and low pollutant emissions of a syngas powered engine by acting on operating variables as the spark timing and the air-to-fuel ratio, with also the possible inclusion of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Model-based design and multi-objective optimization methods are applied as a feasible approach to address this issue, hence to improve the energetic and the environmental performances of power generation under a flexible fuel quality.A one-dimensional (1D) model of a naturally aspirated SI engine fuelled by syngas, properly developed and validated through a specific experimental campaign, is here presented to investigate the effect of the main controlling variables on power output and emissions. A proper design of experiment (DoE) space is considered. The 1D model is coupled with a genetic optimization algorithm for the search of the best compromise solution between maximum performance and minimum pollutants amount. The identified optimal solution allows a reduction up to the 50% for both nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions with a negligible worsening of the power output.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aalternative fuels 3abiomass gasification 3acarbon monoxide 3aemissions 3aenergy density 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3amodels 3anitrogen oxides 3apollutants 3apower generation 3asynthesis gas 3asystem optimization 0aBiomass 0aGasification 0aInternal combustion engine 0aOptimization 0aExhaust gas recirculation 0aSyngas1 aDi Blasio, G.1 aPrati, M.V.1 aCostagliola, M.A.1 aCirillo, D.1 aLa Villetta, M.1 aCaputo, C.1 aMartoriello, G.0 tApplied energy.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 275 p.115418-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1154183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010500163300001600268520095600284536009701240592002801337650001801365650002101383650001801404650001501422650002701437650001401464650001701478650002701495653000801522653002701530653003101557653002601588653003801614653002001652653001601672773010601688856008001794852000901874655001201883IND60614960420221120150707.0181003e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061496042DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858103794322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouto, S.

A deeper understanding of cancer biology will allow pathologists studying genetically engineered mouse models and spontaneous tumors to ask novel questions and provide useful insights into disease mechanisms. Although tumor suppressor gene loss is known to be an essential step in the pathogenesis of many tumors, the variety of mechanisms that lead to such loss are poorly understood. This article provides an overview of loss of heterozygosity as an important mechanism of tumor suppressor gene loss; it also emphasizes the importance of loss of heterozygosity detection as a tool for tumor suppressor gene discovery. Understanding the applications of the array of molecular techniques currently available in cancer research will enable pathologists to further contribute to the advancement the field.  aThe author received no financial support for the research and/or authorship of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanimal pathology 3agene deletion 3alandscapes 3aloss of heterozygosity 3aneoplasms 3apathogenesis 3atumor suppressor genes 0aLOH 0aloss of heterozygosity 0atumor suppressor gene loss 0amitotic recombination 0acomparative genomic hybridization 0amicrosatellites 0amicroarrays0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 48, no. 1 p.236-244dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858103794323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012100165300001600286520100700302592002801309650002301337650003601360650002701396650001301423650002701436650002601463650002401489650002401513650001601537650000801553650002001561650001701581650000901598651001001607700002301617700001901640700003301659700002101692700002301713700002501736700001901761700002501780700001801805773016101823856008201984852000902066655001202075IND60694376120221121174523.0200513e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069437612DNAL7 a10.1007/s42690-019-00095-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Somnath10aNonchemical based integrated management package for live-wood eating termites in tea plantations of north-east India  ap. 435-440.  aLive wood eating termites are responsible for considerable damage to young and mature teas throughout North-East India.

Two multiplication field trials consisted of twelve non-chemical treatments were conducted following randomized block design (RBD) with three replications. The trials revealed that Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana, Heterorhabditis indica and Ipomea carnea were effective in controlling the termites in tea compared to the check (thiamethoxam, a commonly used chemical pesticide against termites in conventional tea estates) as well as to control (untreated- water spray for both organic and conventional tea estates). Along with these non-chemical treatments, an integrated management package for termite control is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aCamellia sinensis var. assamica 3aHeterorhabditis indica 3aIsoptera 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3afield experimentation 3afinancial economics 3ainsect infestations 3aplantations 3atea 3atermite control 3athiamethoxam 3awood 3aIndia1 aPrasad, Anjali Km.1 aNeave, Suzanne1 aBhattacharyya, Pranaba Nanda1 aNagpal, Akanksha1 aBorah, Kailyanjeet1 aRahamāna, Ājijura,1 aSarmah, Mridul1 aSarmah, Satya Ranjan1 aPandit, Vinod0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2020 June, v. 40, no. 2 p.435-440dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-019-00095-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016800157500002000325520163500345592002801980650002802008650003202036650001702068650001702085650002002102650000902122650001302131650000902144650000902153650001902162650002402181650002402205650001102229650001802240650001402258650002302272650002502295650001502320650001102335700001402346700001602360700001702376700001702393773011502410856007402525852000902599655001202608IND60577445320221121031856.0170808e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057744532DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.130312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Dandan10aEffects of Microwave Radiation and Water Bath Heating on the Physicochemical Properties of Actomyosin from Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) during Setting  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChanges in the physical and chemical characteristics of actomyosin, isolated from silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), induced by heating in a water bath and microwave oven were investigated. Ca²⁺‐ATPase showed a heating‐time‐dependent decrease in activity, suggesting denaturation of myosin and dissociation of the actomyosin complex. The decrease in actomyosin solubility indicates the formation of protein aggregates. In addition, reactive sulfhydryl (R‐SH) groups increased and total SH (T‐SH) groups decreased with heating, indicating the formation of disulfide bonds through SH oxidation or disulfide interchanges. The differences of surface hydrophobicity (S₀) showed microwave heating has an inhibitory effect on protein conformation changes. Fourier transform infrared confirmed the conformational changes of silver carp actomyosin. This study demonstrated that microwave heating can effectively depressed actomyosin structural changes during heating and provided useful information for surimi production. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: At present, there is lot of research about heat‐induced gel from fish protein, but the way they used are traditional water bath or ohmic heating. Though reports of microwave heating on structure and the characteristics of fish protein are few, it is important for surimi gelation and microwave sterilization. We supposed microwave heating could influence the structure of fish protein and improve the quality of surimi. A preliminary study of microwave heating on actomyosin not only can enrich theory of heated induced protein gel also has important scientific value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3adenaturation 3adissociation 3adisulfide bonds 3afish 3agelation 3agels 3aheat 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3amyosin 3aohmic heating 3aoxidation 3aprotein aggregates 3aprotein conformation 3asolubility 3asurimi1 aXue, Yong1 aLi, Zhaojie1 aWang, Yuming1 aXue, Changhu0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Aug., v. 41, no. 4dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.130313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245005700166300001800223520066900241592002800910650001300938650000900951650001300960650002200973650001100995650001101006650003401017650001301051700001901064700001901083700001601102700001901118700002201137773012801159856007901287852000901366655001201375IND60312908320221117035928.0150714e20140926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031290832DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12563062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLankester, Felix10aImplementing Pasteur's vision for rabies elimination  ap. 1562-1564.  aIt has been 129 years since Louis Pasteur's experimental protocol saved the life of a child mauled by a rabid dog, despite incomplete understanding of the etiology or mechanisms by which the miracle cure worked (1).

One marker deviated significantly from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and no linkage disequilibrium among all loci pairs was observed. A mean of 6.88 alleles per locus was found (between 2 and 23 alleles) and mean expected heterozygozity was 0.49 (range 0.033–0.950). All loci were successfully amplified on E. lucius from North America and Europe and E. reichertii.

Decreasing hydraulic retention time (HRT) was applied as the selection pressure in an up-flow photobioreactor to increase the speed of granulation and nitrate removal under autotrophic condition during a 50-day operation. Formation of granules occurred at three phases including granule nucleation, growth of granule, and mature granule, with decreasing the values of ζ-potential from −19 mV to −4 mV. Enhancement of microbial attachment within granule formation could reduce the presence of total suspended solids in the effluent. Developed granules of HCD and microalgae could settle down with velocity of 40 ± 0.6 m/h when reaching the average size of 1.2 mm at day 40. Complete NO₃⁻-N removal from drinking water was achieved from the initial stage of granulation until the end of operation at all HRTs of 3 days–5 h. The clear treated water was obtained at the growth phase when the chemical oxygen demand and phosphate were undetectable. Therefore, the application of HCD-microalgae granule is a promising way for nitrate removal from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological treatment 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aenvironmental management 3ahydrogen 3amicroalgae 3amicrobial adhesion 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3aphotobioreactors 3aselection pressure 0aWater 0aAutotrophic granulation 0aDenitrification 0aAlgae 0aPhoto-bioreactor 0aSettleability1 aSarrafzadeh, Mohammad-Hossein0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 268 p.110674-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1106743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012900169300001600298520095000314592002801264650001301292650001101305650001501316650001701331650001201348650001501360650001001375650001801385650001101403650001701414650002101431650001101452650002001463651002101483653002201504653001301526653002001539653002001559653001001579653002501589653001301614653001101627700002101638700002401659700001901683700002301702773010501725856008101830852000901911655001201920IND60622222220221122041101.0181124e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062222222DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683602hl564rr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Matthew D.10aInterpreting stable-isotope records from freshwater snail-shell carbonate: a Holocene case study from Lake Gölhisar, Turkey  ap. 629-634.  aThe oxygen and carbon stable-isotope ratios from fossil snail shells within a small intramontane lake in southwest Turkey are used to highlight the potential, and problems, of using freshwater snail carbonate as a palaeoenvironmental proxy. Two species (Gyraulus piscinarum and Valvata cristata) yielded different isotope ratios at the same sampling intervals, probably due to differences in water-isotope composition between different microhabitats. Isotope ratios from a number of individual shells from the same sampling intervals (representing 7–25 years), show large ranges (up to 8‰ for 18O) for each species. Only by analysis of a significant number of species-specific shells (5) from each sampling interval can a true understanding of environmental change be obtained. Averages of the data provide an insight into longer-term climatic variation while the ranges provide an estimate of short-term (decadal) environmental variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGyraulus 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3acase studies 3afossils 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amicrohabitats 3aoxygen 3apaleoecology 3ashell (molluscs) 3asnails 3astable isotopes 3aTurkey (country) 0aFreshwater snails 0aMollusca 0aoxygen isotopes 0acarbon isotopes 0alakes 0alacustrine carbonate 0aHolocene 0aTurkey1 aLeng, Melanie J.1 aEastwood, Warren J.1 aKeen, David H.1 aTurney, Chris S.M.0 tHolocene.g2002 July, v. 12, no. 5 p.629-634dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683602hl564rr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245011300208300001600321520172500337592002802062650002002090650001802110650001802128650001202146650001602158650001402174650001602188653002302204653001902227653001902246653002102265653001602286653001202302700001802314700002802332700002202360700002302382700002102405700002002426700002602446773009502472856008402567852000902651655001202660IND60525629820221118191306.0190401e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052562982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2016.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForman, Evan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7233-138410aMindful decision making and inhibitory control training as complementary means to decrease snack consumption  ap. 176-183.  aObesity is largely attributable to excess caloric intake, in particular from “junk” foods, including salty snack foods. Evidence suggests that neurobiological preferences to consume highly hedonic foods translate (via implicit processes) into poor eating choices, unless overturned by inhibitory mechanisms or interrupted by explicit processes. The primary aim of the current study was to test the independent and combinatory effects of a computerized inhibitory control training (ICT) and a mindful decision-making training (MDT) designed to facilitate de-automatization.We randomized 119 habitual salty snack food eaters to one of four short, training conditions: MDT, ICT, both MDT and ICT, or neither (i.e., psychoeducation). For 7 days prior to the intervention and 7 days following the intervention, participants reported on their salty snack food consumption 2 times per day, on 3 portions of their days, using a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment system. Susceptibility to emotional eating cues was measured at baseline.Results indicated that the effect of MDT was consistent across levels of trait emotional eating, whereas the benefit of ICT was apparent only at lower levels of emotional eating. No synergistic effect of MDT and ICT was detected.These results provide qualified support for the efficacy of both types of training for decreasing hedonically-motivated eating. Moderation effects suggest that those who eat snack foods for reasons unconnected to affective experiences (i.e., lower in emotional eating) may derive benefit from a combination of ICT and MDT. Future research should investigate the additive benefit of de-automization training to standard weight loss interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3aobesity 3asnack foods 3asynergism 3aweight loss 0aInhibitory control 0aNeurocognition 0aHedonic eating 0aEmotional eating 0aMindfulness 0aObesity1 aShaw, Jena A.1 aGoldstein, Stephanie P.1 aButryn, Meghan L.1 aMartin, Lindsay M.1 aMeiran, Nachshon1 aCrosby, Ross D.1 aManasse, Stephanie M.0 tAppetite.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 103 p.176-183dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04395naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015800174300001600332520321800348592002803566650002003594650001303614650001203627650001103639650001003650650001403660650001103674650001603685651001003701700002603711700002703737700002203764700002003786773008603806856008503892990002303977852000904000655001204009IND60093608020221121033419.0141103e20130830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009360802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConticelli, Sandro10aShift from lamproite-like to leucititic rocks: Sr–Nd–Pb isotope data from the Monte Cimino volcanic complex vs. the Vico stratovolcano, Central Italy  ap. 246-266.  aIn the Italian peninsula leucite-free and -bearing ultrapotassic rocks occur intimately associated but well separated in time. Silica-saturated ultrapotassic and associated shoshonitic magmas erupted during the Pliocene to Lower Pleistocene. Silica under-saturated leucite-bearing ultrapotassic rocks, mainly leucitites, were emplaced sometime later, during the Middle–Upper Pleistocene. The transition from leucite-free to -bearing rocks is diachronous and in some cases is complicated by the occurrence of crustal-derived magmas coeval with early leucite-free magma. The Monte Cimino–Vico area is a key locality for studying the transition from leucite-free to -bearing ultrapotassic rocks. There a volcanic complex is overlain by some 500ka younger leucite-bearing rocks of Vico stratovolcano. Most of the potassic and ultrapotassic rocks of the Monte Cimino volcanic complex are characterised by high Mg-# (66.4–77.8), and compatible element abundances in spite of their high silica contents (52.9–58.0wt.%). Ultrapotassic leucite-free rocks transitional to lamproites are olivine-bearing orthopyroxene- and plagioclase-free latites and K-rich basaltic trachyandesite and they are confined in the final mafic activity of the Monte Cimino volcanic complex. Two-pyroxene parageneses are observed in the early Monte Cimino volcanic complex giving equilibration temperature as high as 1050°C and suggesting a sub-crustal derivation of their parental magmas. A two-pyroxene high-K calc-alkaline magma is then inferred for the genesis of the early Monte Cimino activity (e.g. dome complex and silicic lava flows and ignimbrites), which was modelled through crystal-fractionation from a high-K basaltic andesitic magma plus mixing with crustal anatectic rhyolitic magma. Final mafic lavas fill the isotopic and chemical gap between shoshonite-like and lamproite-like rocks, and each lava flow could be considered as a mantle-derived term from a heterogeneous sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Final mafic lavas are high-silica and -MgO ultrapotassic rocks due to crystallisation of primitive magmas generated by partial melting of a vein metasomatised network within a lithospheric upper mantle source, at low pressure and high PH₂O. The shift to the younger Vico volcano, in which leucite-bearing magmas prevail, is thought to be due to the arrival in the mantle source of newly formed metasomatic agent from the undergoing slab characterised by the increasing of a sedimentary carbonate recycled component. This new component appears in the Middle Pleistocene and it is responsible for the composition of the magmatism of the Roman region. The recycling of carbonate-bearing pelitic sediments within the mantle wedge produces a carbonate-rich metasomatic agent. The latter is responsible for stabilisation of phlogopite-bearing wehrlitic veins within the mantle wedge. Partial melting of this newly formed vein network under high XCO₂ generated silica under-saturated, and then leucite-bearing, ultrapotassic primary melts. A further shift is observed among the Vico post-caldera magmas, in which the appearance of a deep asthenospheric component is argued to be channelled late through slab-tears.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aisotopes 3amelting 3amixing 3arocks 3asediments 3asilica 3atemperature 3aItaly1 aAvanzinelli, Riccardo1 aPoli, G.q(Giampiero),1 aBraschi, Eleonora1 aGiordano, Guido0 tChemical geology.g2013 Aug. 30, v. 353 p.246-266dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.10.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005300094040001800147100001600165245011600181300001400297520059000311592002800901653001000929653001200939653002700951653002900978653001801007653001901025653002701044653001301071700003001084700002701114773012601141856011301267852000901380655001201389IND60130085520221121011038.0151127e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013008552DNAL7 a10.2994/1808-9798(2007)2[89:ACOFHF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, Ivan10aAdvertisement calls of four hylid frogs from the state of bahia, northeastern brazil (amphibia, anura, hylidae)  ap. 89-96.  aWe describe the advertisement calls of Dendropsophus branneri, Phyllodytes melanomystax, and Scinax agilis, and present new information on the advertisement call of Scinax auratus.

Pulp  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAcerola fruit (Malpighia emarginata D.C.) is in high demand worldwide because of its great taste, and also due to its substantial content of anthocyanins, associated with other health compounds. This paper provides experimental and simulation results of anthocyanin thermal degradation in acerola pulp during industrial processing. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were evaluated in a batch experimental system and an appropriated mathematical modeling was developed to simulate the anthocyanin losses in a tubular heat exchanger as industrial pasteurization system. Our finds indicate activation energy of degradation equals 68 kJ/mol, suggesting a strong dependency of temperature. Moreover, simulations showed that in real heating situations, the losses of anthocyanins in acerola pulp could be very small, less than 1%, at 20 s of residence time and 70C, if appropriated operational conditions were set. Therefore, this present research provides not only experimental and simulation data of anthocyanin degradation, but also a useful tool to predict the minimal losses during processing. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of this work can be used to estimate the anthocyanin losses during industrial processes. The case study of this paper concerns on tubular systems. However, the kinetic parameter estimation and the degradation rate also obtained can be used in any industrial situation by an appropriate modeling adaptation, for example, considering the common plate systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalpighia emarginata 3aacerolas 3aactivation energy 3aanthocyanins 3acase studies 3aheat exchangers 3amathematical models 3apasteurization 3apulp 3ataste 3atemperature 3athermal degradation1 aCrispim, Jacyelli M.S.1 aVieira, Roniérik P.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Aug., v. 41, no. 4dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.130533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010300153300001600256520118000272592002801452650002001480650000801500650001701508650001701525650001201542650001401554650001401568650001601582650002501598650001401623651001001637700005101647700001101698700002101709700002401730700001401754773008201768856007301850852000901923655001201932IND60519640820221116150044.0160507e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051964082DNAL7 a10.1111/cla.121292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mei10aPhylogenetic analyses elucidate the inter‐relationships of Pamphilioidea (Hymenoptera, Symphyta)  ap. 239-260.  aThe phylogeny of the superfamily Pamphilioidea is reconstructed using morphology and DNA sequence data of living and fossil taxa by employing two phylogenetic methods (maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference). Based on our results, the monophyly of Pamphilioidea and Pamphiliidae are corroborated, whereas two extinct families, Xyelydidae and Praesiricidae, are not monophyletic. Because members of Praesiricidae together with Megalodontes form a monophyletic group, we propose that the paraphyletic Praesiricidae is synonymized under Megalodontesidae (syn. nov.). The origin of Pamphilioidea is hypothesized to be as early as the Early Jurassic. To better understand morphological evolution in the early lineages of Pamphilioidea, ancestral states of the first flagellomere and the first and second abdominal terga are reconstructed on the morphology‐based tree. In addition, three new genera (Medilyda, Brevilyda, Strenolyda) with five new species (Medilyda procera, M. distorta, Brevilyda provecta, Strenolyda marginalis and S. retrorsa) are described based on well‐preserved xyelydid fossils from the Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation of north‐eastern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA 3aMegalodontes 3aPamphiliidae 3afossils 3amonophyly 3anew genus 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aparaphyly 3aChina1 aRasnit︠s︡yn, A.

The results showed that: 1) grassland desertification had a serious damage to the soil macro-arthropod community, more serious in the summer than in the spring and autumn, and resulting in obvious change on seasonal distribution pattern of the soil macro-arthropod community; 2) the effects of desertification on trophic groups differed among seasons, with greater effects on predators in spring, phytozoa in summer, and omnivores in autumn; 3) from large to small, the order of richness and density was 0–10cm soil>10–20cm soil>20–30cm soil and 10–20cm>0–10cm soil>20–30cm in non-desertified grassland, respectively, and both changed gradually to 0–10cm soil≥20–30cm soil>10–20cm soil with desertification development; 4) with desertification development, the richness and density of phytozoa, predators, and omnivores all decreased significantly in different soil layers, with the magnitude of the decrease being lower for predators in 0–10cm soil and omnivores in 10–20cm and 20–30cm soil and greatest for phytozoa in all three soil layers; 5) with desertification development, the dominant family in the community changed gradually and the dominance of the dominant family intensified significantly; and 6) changes in the soil macro-arthropod community were attributed to the degradation of vegetation and deterioration of the soil environment in the desertification process, including notable decreases in vegetation cover, litter, soil clay and silt, soil organic carbon, and soil N and P.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3aclay soils 3adesertification 3aedaphic factors 3agrasslands 3aomnivores 3apredators 3asand 3aseasonal variation 3asilt 3asoil degradation 3asoil density 3asoil organic carbon 3aspring 3asummer 3avegetation cover 3aChina 0aGrassland desertification 0aSoil macro-arthropod 0aRichness 0aDensity 0aTemporal and spatial changes1 aLi, Jin1 aLiu, Ren-Tao1 aZhou, Rui-Lian1 aQu, Hao1 aPan, Cheng-Chen0 tGeoderma.g2014 July, v. 223-225 p.62-67dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245010000163520186400263592002802127650002102155650002202176650002902198650001102227650001102238651001002249653004502259653002102304653002702325653002002352653002102372653002502393700001302418700001402431700001802445773011802463856008602581852000902667655001202676IND60694040920221119180818.0211227e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069404092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1107002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Tao14aThe impact of environmental regulation efficiency loss on inclusive growth: Evidence from China  aThis study uses panel data from 281 cities in China during the period 2004–2016 and the two-regime spatial Durbin model to investigate the strategic interactions of environmental regulation efficiency loss between cities. It adopts the spatial lag of X model and the mediating effect model to analyze the effect and mechanisms of environmental regulation efficiency loss on inclusive growth. The results show that there are asymmetric strategic interactions in the form of imitative competition and upward competition between geographically neighboring cities, which exacerbates the environmental regulation efficiency loss. The environmental regulation efficiency loss of local and neighboring cities inhibits inclusive growth at both the national and regional levels. At the regional level, the local and neighbor effects are the strongest in the central and western regions. The results also show that the inhibition of the neighbor effect is more obvious within 500 km and is relatively stable after 2007. Revenue decentralization, fiscal autonomy, and promotion pressure have a partial mediating effect, which may be important channels for the environmental regulation efficiency loss to restrain inclusive growth. However, expenditure decentralization plays a masking effect, which mitigates the inhibition of the environmental regulation efficiency loss on inclusive growth. In addition, the robustness test of the informal environmental regulation efficiency loss supports the conclusions of the formal environmental regulation efficiency loss. Moreover, the inhibitions of the two are similar at the national level but are different at the regional level. This study therefore suggests that policymakers should adopt a series of measures to improve environmental regulation efficiency, in addition to increasing environmental regulation intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecentralization 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental management 3aincome 3amodels 3aChina 0aEnvironmental regulation efficiency loss 0aInclusive growth 0aStrategic interactions 0aNeighbor effect 0aTwo-regime model 0aSpatial econometrics1 aQiu, Wei1 aLi, Jinye1 aHao, Xionglei0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 268 p.110700-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1107003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008300162300001600245520106600261592002801327650001501355650001301370650002201383650001401405650002001419650001601439650001401455700002601469773008201495856007301577852000901650655001201659IND60519640920221116150039.0160507e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051964092DNAL7 a10.1111/cla.121602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoloboff, Pablo A.10aTNT version 1.5, including a full implementation of phylogenetic morphometrics  ap. 221-238.  aVersion 1.5 of the computer program TNT completely integrates landmark data into phylogenetic analysis.

Landmark data can be analysed alone or in combination with standard characters; all the applicable commands and options in TNT can be used transparently after reading a landmark data set. The program continues implementing all the types of analyses in former versions, including discrete and continuous characters (which can now be read at any scale, and automatically rescaled by TNT). Using algorithms described in this paper, searches for landmark data can be made tens to hundreds of times faster than it was possible before (from T to 3T times faster, where T is the number of taxa), thus making phylogenetic analysis of landmarks feasible even on standard personal computers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abranches 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adata collection 3amorphometry 3aphylogeny1 aCatalano, Santiago A.0 tCladistics.g2016 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.221-238dMeckler Pub.x0748-30077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cla.121603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245010500207300001600312520096800328592002801296650001801324650001201342650001801354650001501372650001001387650001801397650000901415700002101424773013201445856008201577990002301659852000901682655001201691IND60089362220221122094724.0141102e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008936222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beem.2013.03.0022doi7 aPMC37134122pmcid7 a238562692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Chia-Ling10aRole of the calcium-sensing receptor in calcium regulation of epidermal differentiation and function  ap. 415-427.  aThe epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium composed of proliferating basal and differentiated suprabasal keratinocytes. It serves as the body's major physical and chemical barrier against infection and harsh environmental insults, as well as preventing excess water loss from the body into the atmosphere. Calcium is a key regulator of the proliferation and differentiation in keratinocytes. Elevated extracellular Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]ₒ) raises the levels of intracellular free calcium ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ), promotes cell–cell adhesion, and activates differentiation-related genes. Keratinocytes deficient in the calcium-sensing receptor fail to respond to [Ca²⁺]ₒ stimulation and to differentiate, indicating a role for the calcium-sensing receptor in transducing the [Ca²⁺]ₒ signal during differentiation. The concepts derived from in vitro gene knockdown experiments have been evaluated and confirmed in three mouse models in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acalcium 3acell adhesion 3aepithelium 3agenes 3akeratinocytes 3amice1 aBikle, Daniel D.0 tBest Practice & Research Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.g2013 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.415-427dElsevier Ltdx1521-690X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beem.2013.03.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011800157300001600275500002000291520165600311592002801967650002901995650001902024650001302043650001502056650001202071650001002083650001302093650001102106650000702117650001302124650002202137650001202159700001502171700001502186700002002201700001702221700001502238773009602253856007302349852000902422655001202431IND60523696620221120024852.0160623e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052369662DNAL7 a10.1890/14-0743.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolkkinen, M.10aMulti‐stressor impacts on fungal diversity and ecosystem functions in streams: natural vs. anthropogenic stress  ap. 672-683.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiological assemblages are often subjected to multiple stressors emerging from both anthropogenic activities and naturally stressful conditions, and species' responses to simultaneous stressors may differ from those predicted based on the individual effects of each stressor alone. We studied the influence of land‐use disturbance (forest drainage) on fungal decomposer assemblages and leaf decomposition rates in naturally harsh (low pH caused by black‐shale dominated geology) vs. circumneutral streams. We used pyrosequencing to determine fungal richness and assemblage structure. Decomposition rates did not differ between circumneutral and naturally acidic reference sites. However, the effect of forest drainage on microbial decomposition was more pronounced in the naturally acidic streams than in circumneutral streams. Single‐effect responses of fungal assemblages were mainly related to geology. Community similarity was significantly higher in the naturally acidic disturbed sites than in corresponding reference sites, suggesting that land‐use disturbance simplifies fungal assemblages in naturally stressful conditions. Naturally acidic streams supported distinct fungal assemblages with many OTUs (operational taxonomic unit) unique to these streams. Our results indicate that fungal assemblages in streams are sensitive to both structural and functional impairment in response to multiple stressors. Anthropogenic degradation of naturally acidic streams may decrease regional fungal diversity and impair ecosystem functions, and these globally occurring environments therefore deserve special attention in conservation planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodegradation 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3aforests 3afungi 3aland use 3aleaves 3apH 3aplanning 3asequence analysis 3astreams1 aMykrä, H.1 aAnnala, M.1 aMarkkola, A.

We aimed to 1) investigate the characteristics, bioactivities and rheological properties of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Lactococcus garvieae-C47 (exopolysaccharide-C47 product), a potential probiotic bacterium, on milk extracted from camels and 2) examine the rheological properties of the fermented camel milk produced by L. garvieae-C47. Exopolysaccharide-C47 product (molecular weight: 7.3 × 10⁶ Da) was composed of the following monosaccharides: glucose (82.51%), arabinose (5.32%) and xylose (12.17%). The antioxidant, antitumor and α-amylase inhibitory activities of exopolysaccharide-C47 product reached up to 67.52, 59.35 and 91.0%, respectively. The apparent viscosity of exopolysaccharide-C47 product decreased with the increase in shear rate and declined by increasing the temperature up to 50 °C. The rheological properties of exopolysaccharide-C47 product are influenced by the salt type and pH value. The exopolysaccharide product produced by L. garvieae C47 possesses valuable health benefits and has the ability to improve the weak structure of fermented camel milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aalpha-amylase 3aantioxidants 3aarabinose 3acamel milk 3aexopolysaccharides 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3agels 3aglucose 3amilk 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aprobiotics 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3axylose 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aProbiotic 0aAntidiabetic 0aFermented milk 0aAntitumor 0aAntioxidant 0aTexture profile1 aAbu-Jdayil, Basim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9467-20161 aItsaranuwat, Pariyaporn1 aAlmazrouei, Noora1 aGaliwango, Emmanuel1 aEsposito, Gennaro1 aHunashal, Yamanappa1 aHamed, Fathalla1 aNajjar, Zein0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 333 p.127418-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1274183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006000156300001600216520141700232592002801649650001601677650001201693650001401705650001401719650001001733700002901743700002001772773008201792856007301874852000901947655001201956IND60519641020221116145945.0160507e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051964102DNAL7 a10.1111/cla.121312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutton, Mark12aA phylogeny of fossil and living neocoleoid cephalopods  ap. 297-307.  aColeoid cephalopod phylogeny is well studied via both molecular and morphological data, yet although some agreement has been reached (e.g. that extant Decapodiformes and Octopoda are monophyletic) many details remain poorly resolved. Fossil coleoids, for which much data exists, have hitherto not been incorporated into analyses. Their inclusion is highly desirable for the support of neontological phylogenies, to better reconstruct character‐state histories, and to investigate the placement of the fossil groups themselves. In this study we present and analyse a morphological data matrix including both extinct and extant taxa. Homology assumptions in our data are discussed. Our results are presented both with and without the constraint of a monophyletic Decapodiformes imposed. When analysed with this constraint our results are strikingly congruent with those from molecular phylogeny, for instance placing Idiosepius in a basal position within Decapodiformes, and recovering Oegopsida and Bathyteuthoidea (although as grades). Our results support an Octopodiformes clade (“vampire squid” Vampyroteuthis as sister to Octopoda) and an octopodiform interpretation for most fossil coleoids. They suggest the fossil sister taxon to the octopods to be Plesioteuthididae. Most fossil higher taxa are supported, although many genera, especially within suborder Teudopseina, appear para‐ or polyphyletic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephalopoda 3afossils 3amonophyly 3apolyphyly 3asquid1 aPerales‐Raya, Catalina1 aGilbert, Isabel0 tCladistics.g2016 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.297-307dMeckler Pub.x0748-30077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cla.121313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03803naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012700163300001600290520212100306592002802427650002202455650001402477650001202491650001502503650001202518650001902530650001202549650001602561650001002577650001402587650001302601650001402614650001302628650002002641650001402661650001502675651001702690653002002707653001902727653001002746653001002756653001502766653001302781653001802794653001602812653001202828653001802840653002502858653003202883653001702915700001502932700002402947700002302971773010502994856008103099852000903180655001203189IND60622222820221122041059.0181124e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062222282DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683602hl571rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zicheng12aA 2100-year trace-element and stable-isotope record at decadal resolution from Rice Lake in the Northern Great Plains, USA  ap. 605-617.  aA 2100-year multiple proxy record at decadal resolution from a topographically closed (but hydrolog ically open) lake basin was used to reconstruct changes in lake salinity and evaporative intensity and to evaluate the reliability of different proxies for inferring climatic change in the glaciated Northern Great Plains (NGP). At Rice Lake, North Dakota, the ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios show good correlation with other ostracode, diatom and aeolian proxy records from other sites in the NGP. All of these records show significant century-scale periodicities, which have been related to solar variability as inferred from atmospheric radiocarbon records. This coherent and consistent pattern suggests that these sites record climatic variability at regional scales. The interval of the Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly from|900 to 550 cal. yr BP contains two pronounced dry periods. During the following ‘Little Ice Age’, a single period of frequent drought that peaked at|300 cal. yr BP was bracketed by wet periods before and after. In contrast, the ostracode-Sr/Ca ratios and ostracode- and mollusc-180 records from Rice Lake have different patterns and do not correlate well with each other or with the same proxies at other sites. This lack of consistent pattern within a site and among several regional sites suggests seasonal and/or site-specific in‘ uences on these proxies. Variable contributions of groundwater, with low 18O values because of selective recharge from snowmelt, may have played an important role in determin ing the isotopic composition of the lake. The poor correlation of Sr/Ca with other proxies is caused by mediation of inorganic carbonate mineralogy, owing to active uptake of Sr in the formation of inorganic aragonite. Thus, our sediment data along with present-day lakewater chemistry suggest that carbonate-180 records in the NGP cannot be interpreted simply in terms of climate because of significant local groundwater in‘ uences. Ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios tend to be a better indicator of past salinity because of the conservative nature of Mg in oligo-saline waters (10‰ salinity).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aaragonite 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3agroundwater 3alakes 3amagnesium 3asalinity 3asediments 3asnowmelt 3astable isotopes 3astrontium 3awatersheds 3aNorth Dakota 0aOxygen isotopes 0atrace elements 0aMg/Ca 0aSr/Ca 0aostracodes 0asalinity 0apalaeoclimate 0agroundwater 0adrought 0alate Holocene 0a‘Little Ice Age’ 0a‘Mediaeval Warm Period’ 0aNorth Dakota1 aItō, Emi,1 aEngstrom, Daniel R.1 aFritz, Sherilyn C.0 tHolocene.g2002 July, v. 12, no. 5 p.605-617dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683602hl571rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013500159300001600294520109100310592002801401650002501429650001801454650001401472650001101486650001101497650001301508650001901521650001501540650001001555653002301565653002601588653002301614653003401637653003601671653002701707653002601734700001501760700001501775773012501790856007801915852000901993655001202002IND60654220120221120073519.0190723s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065422012DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2018-04382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qiang10aModification of a photosynthetic light-response (PLR) model for modeling the vertical gradient in the response of crown PLR curves  ap. 949-959.  aThe photosynthetic light-response (PLR) curve is a mathematical description of a single biochemical process that has been widely applied in many ecophysiological models. For trees, the heterogeneity of PLR curves within the crown is significant but rarely modeled by mathematical techniques. This paper establishes a modified model for estimating crown PLR curves based on PLR functions by linking the parameters of the PLR functions to leaf nitrogen (N), specific leaf area (SLA), and relative depth into the crown (RDINC). The modified models were assessed by considering the goodness of fit (adjusted coefficient of determination, ; root mean square error, RMSE; and Akaike information criterion, AIC) and model structure. Significant correlations were observed between the parameters of PLR functions and N, SLA, and RDINC. The optimal modified PLR model, by linking RDINC into a modified Mitscherlich function, fit well due to its simple and easily understood structure. Therefore, it is feasible to simultaneously estimate the multilayered and varied PLR curves of the tree crown.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3aecophysiology 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3atree crown 3atrees 0avertical variation 0aleaf nitrogen content 0aspecific leaf area 0arelative depth into the crown 0amaximum net photosynthetic rate 0aapparent quantum yield 0adark respiration rate1 aDong, Lihu1 aLi, Fengri0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2019, v. 48, no. 8 p.949-959dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2018-04383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012100166300001600287520176900303592002802072650002302100650001102123650001702134700002102151700002202172700002202194773009402216856008502310852000902395655001202404IND50059988520221116221046.0141110e20121112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005998852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.08.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Hyunuk10aComparison between iteration schemes for three-dimensional coordinate-transformed saturated–unsaturated flow model  ap. 212-226.  aThree different iteration methods for a three-dimensional coordinate-transformed saturated–unsaturated flow model are compared in this study. The Picard and Newton iteration methods are the common approaches for solving Richards’ equation. The Picard method is simple to implement and cost-efficient (on an individual iteration basis). However it converges slower than the Newton method. On the other hand, although the Newton method converges faster, it is more complex to implement and consumes more CPU resources per iteration than the Picard method. The comparison of the two methods in finite-element model (FEM) for saturated–unsaturated flow has been well evaluated in previous studies. However, two iteration methods might exhibit different behavior in the coordinate-transformed finite-difference model (FDM). In addition, the Newton–Krylov method could be a suitable alternative for the coordinate-transformed FDM because it requires the evaluation of a 19-point stencil matrix. The formation of a 19-point stencil is quite a complex and laborious procedure. Instead, the Newton–Krylov method calculates the matrix–vector product, which can be easily approximated by calculating the differences of the original nonlinear function. In this respect, the Newton–Krylov method might be the most appropriate iteration method for coordinate-transformed FDM. However, this method involves the additional cost of taking an approximation at each Krylov iteration in the Newton–Krylov method. In this paper, we evaluated the efficiency and robustness of three iteration methods—the Picard, Newton, and Newton–Krylov methods—for simulating saturated–unsaturated flow through porous media using a three-dimensional coordinate-transformed FDM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRichards' equation 3amodels 3aporous media1 aIchikawa, Yutaka1 aTachikawa, Yasuto1 aShiiba, Michiharu0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 Nov. 12, v. 470-471 p.212-226dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.08.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006100167300001600228520084600244592002801090650002101118650001201139650001901151650001501170650002501185650001701210650002001227650001001247650002101257650001301278650001901291650001401310700002101324700001901345700001801364700002401382773013201406856008201538990002301620852000901643655001201652IND60089362520221122050904.0141102e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008936252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beem.2013.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Navneet10aRole of Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) in tumorigenesis  ap. 455-463.  aThe extracellular Ca²⁺-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a robust promoter of differentiation in colonic epithelial cells and functions as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. CaSR mediates its biologic effects through diverse mechanisms. Loss of CaSR expression activates a myriad of stem cell-like molecular features that drive and sustain the malignant and drug-resistant phenotypes of colon cancer. This CaSR-null phenotype, however, is not irreversible and induction of CaSR expression in CaSR-null cells promotes cell death mechanisms and restores drug sensitivity. The CaSR also functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and promotes cellular sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs. BRCA1 and CaSR functions intersect in breast cancer cells, and CaSR activation can rescue breast cancer cells from the deleterious effect of BRCA1 mutations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acalcium 3acarcinogenesis 3acell death 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3aepithelial cells 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenotype1 aPromkan, Moltira1 aLiu, Guangming1 aVarani, James1 aChakrabarty, Subhas0 tBest Practice & Research Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.g2013 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.455-463dElsevier Ltdx1521-690X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beem.2013.04.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01897naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100003100166245011700197300001600314520090800330592002801238653003301266653002601299653001001325653001301335700002001348773012801368856011401496852000901610655001201619IND60130086220221121000815.0151127e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013008622DNAL7 a10.2994/1808-9798(2007)2[184:ATFERA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTozetti, Alexandro Marques12aA Technique For External Radio-Transmitter Attachment And The Use Of Thread-Bobbins For Studying Snake Movements  ap. 184-190.  aRadio-tracking is a widely used method in studies of snake movement and habitat use. However, radio-tracking has some inconveniences, such as the invasiveness of surgical transmitter implantation and the high costs of receivers and transmitters. Here we describe a technique for external radio-transmitter attachment in snakes and the use of thread-bobbins (quilt-cocoons or spool-and-line device) as an alternative for tracking snakes. Both methods allow the animals to resume their natural behavior just after handling and to be monitored until the detachment of the device, usually upon shedding. These characteristics seemed to be particularly useful when the survey must be done within short periods of time with a high number of snakes. The use of thread-bobbins greatly facilitates the gathering of data on movement, habitat use, effective distance moved, and substrate use of snakes in the wild.  aPublisher supplied data 0aradio-transmitter attachment 0aspool-and-line method 0asnake 0amovement1 aMartins, Marcio0 tSouth american journal of herpetology.g2007 Dec., v. 2, no. 3 p.184-190dBrazilian Society of Herpetologyx1808-97987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2994%2F1808-9798%282007%292%5B184%3AATFERA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245013500164500001400299520104000313592002801353650002501381650001401406650003901420650001901459650001301478650001601491650001501507650000801522650001901530650001501549650001301564650003701577653002001614653001601634653001101650653003001661653002201691700001801713700001601731700001401747700001601761700001401777700005501791773010001846856008701946852000902033655001202042IND60700996520221122045113.0200824e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070099652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1274322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xia10aInfluence of tea polyphenol and bovine serum albumin on tea cream formation by multiple spectroscopy methods and molecular docking  aNAL-light  aThe sensory qualities and shelf life of tea beverage strongly affected by tea cream that forms by the interaction of polyphenols and protein. The study aimed to investigate the effects of the interactions between tea polyphenols (TPs) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) on tea cream formation at different concentrations. The tea cream formation increased with TPs and BSA concentration increased. The optimal concentration (TPs: 800 mg/L, BSA: 40 mg/L), for high clarities and contents of phytochemicals, was selected by the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (C = 0.7572). The interaction mechanism of TPs-BSA was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, UV–visible absorption spectroscopy, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular docking. TPs interacted with BSA via static quenching process, affecting tryptophan and tyrosine residue microenvironment of BSA. Ester catechins had more binding affinity than non-ester catechins. Hydrogen bonds were the main interaction forces of TPs-BSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3aflavanols 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afood chemistry 3ahydrogen 3apolyphenols 3ashelf life 3atea 3atea (beverage) 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aTea polyphenols 0aInteraction 0aTOPSIS 0aFluorescence spectroscopy 0aMolecular docking1 aCai, Xinghong1 aLuo, Liyong1 aWang, Jie1 aMa, Mengjun1 aWang, Min1 aZeng, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3860-77240 tFood chemistry.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 333 p.127432-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1274323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011400163500002000277520180900297592002802106650003402134650002202168650002402190650001202214650002102226650002502247650001302272650001702285650001502302650002902317650001202346650001402358650001202372650001502384650001302399650001002412650001702422650002202439650002302461650001402484650001002498650001302508650002402521650002502545650001802570650002002588650001602608650001102624650001002635650001102645650002302656700002602679700002702705700002002732773011502752856007402867852000902941655001202950IND60577446220221120204203.0170808e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057744622DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.130752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaohakunjit, Natta10aVolatile Flavor, Antioxidant Activity and Physicochemical Properties of Enzymatic Defatted Sesame Hydrolysate  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnzymatic bromelain sesame‐meal‐protein hydrolysate (eb‐SPH) and enzymatic Flavourzyme‐sesame‐meal‐protein hydrolysate (ef‐SPH) were produced from defatted sesame‐meal (49.39% protein and 2.27% calcium). Results showed that calcium and oxalate contents of eb‐SPH and ef‐SPH were lower than those of sesame meal and that eb‐SPH and ef‐SPH contained the highest amount of arginine. Volatile compounds of eb‐SPH and ef‐SPH were 14 and 23 components, respectively. Two major volatile compounds, benzaldehyde (chocolate flavor with sweet) and phenylethyl alcohol (almond and honey odor), were detected. Free radical‐scavenging activity either 86% DPPH or 89% hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of eb‐SPH were higher than those of ef‐SPH. Lipid peroxidation inhibition of eb‐SPH and ef‐SPH was equal to those of BHT and α‐tocopherol. Processed chocolate‐like flavor (CPF) was obtained from a mixture of 25% of 15% eb‐SPH with 1% l‐leucine and 1% l‐valine. Predominant volatile compounds of processed CPF were 3‐methyl‐1‐butanol, furfural, 2‐ethyl‐1‐hexanol, ionone, 1‐dodecanol, eugenol and vinylguaiacol. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Using agricultural waste sesame meal as raw material, we developed a new CPF based on thermally processed flavorings from enzymatic sesame meal protein hydrolysate (SPH). The CPF is generated by heating a combination of protein hydrolysate, amino acids and reducing sugars under controlled conditions through the Maillard Reaction. A CPF was achieved with good taste and aroma, high antioxidative and nutrition and low anti‐nutritive. The processed flavor derived from enzymatic SPH consisting chocolate flavor could be an alternative as chocolate flavor confectionery products with high antioxidative activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aMaillard reaction 3aagricultural wastes 3aalmonds 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aarginine 3abenzaldehyde 3abromelains 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acalcium 3achocolate 3aeugenol 3aflavorings 3afurfural 3ahoney 3ahydrolysates 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alipid peroxidation 3anutrition 3aodors 3aoxalates 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3aprotein hydrolysates 3araw materials 3areducing sugars 3asesame meal 3asweets 3ataste 3avaline 3avolatile compounds1 aKerdchoechuen, Orapin1 aKaprasob, Ratchadaporn1 aMatta, Frank B.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Aug., v. 41, no. 4dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.130753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03978naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009800169300001600267500001500283520216700298592002802465650002402493650001502517650001502532650001902547650002002566650002602586650001402612650001602626650001102642650001902653650001202672650001302684650001602697650001202713650002002725650002602745650001202771650001502783650001202798650001802810650002202828650001102850650001002861650001202871651001102883653001102894653002102905653001902926653002102945653001902966653001502985700002203000700001803022700002203040700001703062700001903079773012603098856008303224852000903307655001203316IND60573387820221119204908.0190318e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057338782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarvis, Nicholas10aLong-term effects of grass-clover leys on the structure of a silt loam soil in a cold climate  ap. 319-328.  a2019-12-06  aGrass/legume leys are commonly included in the crop rotation in mixed farming systems in cold or humid regions in order to sustain the supply of nutrients and maintain soil fertility. Leys are also known to sequester soil organic carbon and also improve the structural stability and mechanical properties of soil. However, few studies have investigated the long-term effects of ley rotations on the architectural properties of the structural pore space in soil. We investigated the effects of grass/clover leys on soil structure in the topsoil and upper subsoil of a silt loam in a long-term field trial established in 1956 at Offer in northern Sweden. This experiment includes four treatments with varying proportions of ley (1, 2, 3 or 5 years) in 6-year rotations. We used X-ray tomography to quantify topsoil structural pore space at a resolution of 65μm in the first year of arable cropping following the ley break, a few weeks after sowing in spring. Earthworm populations were quantified by both hand-sorting and chemical extraction, while near-saturated infiltration was measured as a proxy for soil structure in the upper subsoil. In the topsoil, the treatments with a greater proportion of ley had larger organic carbon contents, smaller bulk densities and larger porosities. However, effects of crop rotation on the pore space were limited to pores smaller than 65μm, as no treatment effects were found for the volume, size distribution, connectivity or complexity of the X-ray imaged pore space, even though the grass-clover leys promoted larger numbers and biomass of topsoil-dwelling earthworm species. Furthermore, no positive effects of grass/clover leys on organic carbon content and soil structure were found in the subsoil. The macropore infiltration capacity in upper subsoil was generally very small (overall median value of 3mmh−1) indicating a lack of functional macroporosity below plough depth. Consistent with these results, no individuals of deep-burrowing earthworm species were found at the site, while previous observations showed only shallow rooting, both of which are attributed to the cold climate and poor subsoil drainage.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3acold zones 3atomography 3asoil structure 3asilt loam soils 3afield experimentation 3anutrients 3aX-radiation 3asowing 3asoil fertility 3alegumes 3adrainage 3ahumid zones 3agrasses 3afarming systems 3amechanical properties 3arooting 3aearthworms 3abiomass 3acrop rotation 3along term effects 3aspring 3aplows 3atopsoil 3aSweden 0acarbon 0aX-ray tomography 0aOrganic carbon 0aGrass-clover ley 0aSoil structure 0aEarthworms1 aForkman, Johannes1 aKoestel, John1 aKätterer, Thomas1 aLarsbo, Mats1 aTaylor, Astrid0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 247 p.319-328dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245009500171300001600266520135600282592002801638650001901666650001901685650001301704650002301717650002701740650001501767650002201782650001101804650001101815650001901826650001101845650002201856650002001878651001201898653000801910653001201918653001601930653001701946653003401963700002801997700002602025700002602051700002902077773012502106856007802231852000902309655001202318IND60654220420221120100021.0190723s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065422042DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2018-04982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemerikov, Vladimir L.10aMitochondrial DNA in Siberian conifers indicates multiple postglacial colonization centers  ap. 875-883.  aThe geographic variation of the mitochondrial DNA in Siberian fir (Abies sibirica Ledeb.) was studied using the newly developed markers and compared with the phylogeographic pattern of another previously studied Siberian conifer, Siberian larch (Larix sibirica Ledeb.). Similar to Siberian larch, the distribution of mtDNA haplotypes in Siberian fir revealed clear differentiation among distinct geographic regions of southern Siberia and the Urals, likely indicating postglacial recolonization from several sources. The northern part of the range of both species was genetically homogeneous, which is probably due to its recent colonization from one of the glacial refugia. This conclusion is in agreement with published pollen and macrofossil data in Siberian fir and with the reconstruction of environmental niches indicating a dramatic reduction of the range and a likely survival of fir in certain southern areas during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), 21 thousand years ago. Although the modeling of the Siberian larch ecological niche reconstructed a shift of the range to the south at that period, the paleontological data indicated the presence of this species in most areas of the current range during LGM, which corresponds to the results of a previous historical demographic study suggesting that the population expansion preceding the LGM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies sibirica 3aLarix sibirica 3aconifers 3agenetic similarity 3ageographical variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3aniches 3aphylogeography 3apollen 3apopulation growth 3arefuge habitats 3aSiberia 0aNGS 0arefugia 0apollen data 0amacrofossils 0aenvironmental niche modelling1 aSemerikova, Svetlana A.1 aPutintseva, Yuliya A.1 aOreshkova, Natalia V.1 aKrutovsky, Konstantin V.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2019, v. 48, no. 8 p.875-883dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2018-04983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245019200163300001600355520159700371536013801968592002802106650001302134650002202147650004202169650001102211650002102222650001502243650000902258650001002267650002502277650002602302650001802328650002302346650001602369650000902385650001102394650004402405650001102449650002502460650002202485651001802507653003102525653001402556653001702570653002002587653001402607700002102621700001602642700001602658700001702674773010602691856008002797961001302877852000902890655001202899IND60614961520221120094748.0181003e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061496152DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858103812472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis , J.

Little is known regarding the early stages of infection in natural hosts. Twelve adult Holstein steers were inoculated with Vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV) on the coronary bands (CB) of the feet via scarification (SC) or by VSNJV-infected black fly (Simulium vittatum) bite (FB). Three additional animals were inoculated on the neck skin using FB. Clinical disease and lesion development were assessed daily, and animals were euthanatized from 12 hours post inoculation (HPI) through 120 HPI. The animals inoculated in the neck failed to develop any clinical signs or gross lesions, and VSNJV was detected neither by in situ hybridization (ISH) nor by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Lesions on the CB were more severe in the animals infected by FB than by SC. In both groups, peak VSNJV replication occurred between 24 and 48 HPI in keratinocytes of the CB, as evidenced by ISH and IHC. There was evidence of viral replication limited to the first 24 HPI in the local draining lymph nodes, as seen through ISH. Successful infection via FB required logarithmically less virus than with the SC technique, suggesting that components in black fly saliva may facilitate VSNJV transmission and infection in cattle. The lack of lesion development in the neck with the same method of inoculation used in the CB suggests that specific characteristics of the CB epithelium may facilitate VSNJV infection.  aThe CAPES–Fulbright Doctoral Exchange program and the USDA-ARS Plum Island Animal Disease Center provided funding for this project.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aSimulium vittatum 3aVesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus 3aadults 3aanimal pathology 3aepithelium 3afeet 3ahosts 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain situ hybridization 3akeratinocytes 3alivestock diseases 3alymph nodes 3aneck 3asaliva 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asteers 3avesicular stomatitis 3avirus replication 3aSouth America 0avesicular stomatitis virus 0alivestock 0apathogenesis 0aearly infection 0ablack fly1 aRodriguez, L.

In this study, an analytical nanohydrodynamic model for the description of flow characteristics of confined oil in nanoscale pores with diameters greater than 2 nm is proposed coupling with viscosity distribution function and slip velocity model based on the liquid–solid intermolecular force mechanisms. This analytical model has been validated by experimental results. Analysis results of this model reveal the special flow characteristics of tight oil confined in nanopores: the velocity profile curve on the cross section is coupled parabolic with exponential line, and the maximum velocity in center is related to pore size and liquid–solid interaction strength. Furthermore, the thickness of the low-velocity region near the wall, which reflects the action scope of pore surface, could be quantified by this model. The critical radius of the nanopore to distinguish the confined flow and unconfined flow is determined by this model, which would increase with a decrease in the liquid–solid interaction strength. And the non-Darcy seepage mechanisms of tight reservoirs could be revealed by this model because of the consistent characteristics of flowrate curve and non-Darcy flow curve. Besides, increasing temperature could weaken the confinement effect and changing wettability is an effective method to enhance tight oil mobility. Finally, apparent permeability is derived for tight reservoirs from this nanohydrodynamic model.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3ananopores 3aoils 3apermeability 3aporosity 3aprocess design 3aseepage 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awettability1 aLi, Zhaomin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2547-57371 aZhang, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7914-07161 aLv, Guangzhong1 aZhou, Peng0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Dec. 06, v. 60, no. 49 p.18154-18165dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c036153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04041naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245008400207300001600291520251700307592002802824650001302852650001102865650001902876650001302895650002902908650002902937650001202966650002302978650001403001650001603015650001503031653001803046653001903064653001903083653002103102653001503123653001903138700002603157700002303183700002803206700002303234700002003257700001903277700002603296773011803322856008603440852000903526655001203535IND60610661520221120092234.0190725e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061066152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTariq, Azeem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6132-239110aPaddy soil drainage influences residue carbon contribution to methane emissions  ap. 168-176.  aWater drainage is an important mitigation option for reducing CH4 (methane) emissions from residue-amended paddy soils. Several studies have indicated a long-term reduction in CH4 emissions, even after re-flooding, suggesting that the mechanism goes beyond creating temporary oxidized conditions in the soil. In this pot trial, the effects of different drainage patterns on straw-derived CH4 and CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions were compared to identify the balance between straw-carbon CH4 and CO2 emissions influenced by soil aeration over different periods, including effects of drainage on emissions during re-flooding. The water treatments included were: continuous flooding [C] as the control and five drainage patterns (pre-planting drainage [P], early-season drainage [E], midseason drainage [M], pre-planting plus midseason drainage [PM], early-season-plus-midseason drainage [EM]). An equal amount of 13C-enriched rice straw was applied to all treatments to identify straw-derived 13C-gas emissions from soil carbon derived emissions.The highest fluxes of CH4 and δ13C-CH4 were recorded from the control treatment in the first week after straw application. The CH4 flux and δ13C-CH4 were reduced the most (0.1–0.8 μg CH4 g−1 soil day−1 and -13 to −34‰) in the pre-planting and pre-planting plus midseason drainage treatments at day one after transplanting. Total and straw-derived CH4 emissions were reduced by 69% and 78% in pre-planting drainage and 77% and 87% in pre-planting plus midseason drainage respectively, compared to control. The early-season, midseason, pre-planting plus midseason and early-season-plus-midseason drainage treatments resulted in higher total and straw-derived CO2 emissions compared to the control and pre-planting drainage treatments. The pre-planting and pre-planting plus midseason drainage treatments lowered the global warming potential by 47–53%, and early-season and early-season-plus-midseason drainage treatments reduced it by 24–31% compared to control. By using labelled crop residues, this experiment demonstrates a direct link between early drainage and reduced CH4 emissions from incorporated crop residues, eventually leading to a reduction in total global warming potential. It is suggested that accelerated decomposition of the residues during early season drainage prolonged the reduction in CH4 emissions. Therefore, it is important to introduce the early drainage as an effective measure to mitigate CH4 emissions from crop residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adrainage 3aglobal warming potential 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amethane 3amethane production 3aoxidation 3apaddy soils 3arice straw 0aClimate smart 0aEarly drainage 0aResidue carbon 0aMethane emission 0aMitigation 0aStable isotope1 aJensen, Lars Stoumann1 aSander, Bjoern Ole1 ade Tourdonnet, Stephane1 aAmbus, Per Lennart1 aThanh, Phan Huu1 aTrinh, Mai Van1 ade Neergaard, Andreas0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 225 p.168-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014100164300001600305500001500321520148900336592002801825650002601853650001301879650001201892650001001904650001201914650001701926650002501943650001101968650001201979650002301991650001902014650001002033650002802043650001302071650001102084650002002095650004302115650002802158650002902186650001802215650002902233650001802262653002002280700001502300700001502315700001502330700001802345700001602363773012502379856008102504852000902585655001202594IND60119824120221119185446.0150108e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011982412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-014-1530-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cheng10aIntegrative expression vectors for overexpression of xylitol dehydrogenase (XYL2) in Osmotolerant yeast, Candida glycerinogenes WL2002-5  ap. 113-124.  a2019-12-04  aYeasts are excellent hosts for the production of recombinant proteins. Candida glycerinogenes WL2002-5, an osmotolerant yeast with extremely high glycerol productivity, provides an attractive eukaryotic expression platform. The integrative vectors PURGAP-gfp and PURGPD-gfp harbouring phleomycin-resistance coding sequence and GFP coding sequence with PCgGAP, PCgGPD promoter, respectively, were constructed. The recombinant plasmid PURPpGAP-gfp with the promoter PPpGAP based on the sequence of Pichia pastoris GAPDH gene and the plasmid PURScGAP-gfp with the promoter PScGAP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were constructed. After transformation, the copy number of gfp gene, which determined using fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (FQ-RTPCR) in genome of C. glycerinogenes is 1. Expressions of gfp at different levels were conducted using different promoters by osmotic stress containing NaCl or glucose for the recombinant strains. In this study, C. glycerinogenes WL2002-5, expressing xylitol dehydrogenase (XYL2) gene from Pichia stipitis, has the ability to produce glycerol from xylose entered into pentose phosphate pathway. Two recombinant strains of PURGAPX, PURGPDX with XYL2 overexpression were constructed to ferment a mixture of glucose and xylose simultaneously in batch fermentation. Compared to C. glycerinogenes WL2002-5 strain, glycerol production from xylose in strains PURGAPX, PURGPDX were increased by 95.9 and 121.1 %, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aplasmids 3aCandida 3agenes 3aglucose 3afluorescence 3arecombinant proteins 3axylose 3axylitol 3abatch fermentation 3aosmotic stress 3ahosts 3aindustrial microbiology 3aglycerol 3ayeasts 3asodium chloride 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3apentose phosphate cycle 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiotechnology 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3aosmotolerance 0aPichia pastoris1 aZong, Hong1 aZhuge, Bin1 aLu, Xinyao1 aFang, Huiying1 aZhuge, Jian0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2015 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.113-124dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-014-1530-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245008200160300001400242506002800256520134700284592002801631506003701659650001601696650002001712650001301732650001201745650001501757653002101772653001601793653002201809653002001831653001801851700002101869700001801890700001901908700002001927700002001947773021801967856007302185852000902258655001202267IND60774347020221207085954.0150922e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077434702DNAL7 a10.12899/asr-9002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBussotti, Filippo10aStatus and change of tree crown condition at the CONECOFOR plots, 1996 - 2005  ap. 21-28.  aResource is Open Access  a<p>Between 1996 and 2005 crown condition at Italian Level II plots was assessed annually within the CONECOFOR programme. Three different assessment forms and manuals were adopted over this period of time (the first in 1996-97, the second between 1998 and 2004, the last starting in 2005); as a result, many of the parameters investigated and the data collected are neither homogeneous nor comparable over time. Since, however, neither the definition nor the assessment criteria for transparency changed, this parameter was chosen to represent crown condition variations over time. (In this survey, transparency is used as a proxy for defoliation.) Yearly field surveys were always preceded by an inter-calibration course, and were followed up by Quality Control surveys done by one or more Reference Teams. After 10 years, the results suggest that statistically significant variations in transparency, from one year to the next, are only scattered and display no recognizable trend. Overall, there were 15 variations, of which 7 were positive (i.e. increase in transparency), and 8 negative (i.e. decrease in transparency). The majority of variations is concentrated in the 1997-98 period. Significant defoliation trends were identified in 11 out of the 27 considered plots. In 4 cases these trends were positive (increased transparency).</p>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adefoliation 3aquality control 3aresearch 3asurveys 3atree crown 0aCrown conditions 0adefoliation 0aQuality Assurance 0atemporal trends 0atransparency.1 aCalderisi, Marco1 aCenni, Enrico1 aCozzi, Alberto1 aBettini, Davide1 aFerretti, Marco0 tAnnals of Silvicultural Research.g2013 Nov., v. 34, no. 0 p.21-28dConsiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria - Research Centre for Forestry and WoodwJournal:21325x2284-354X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.12899/asr-9003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01825naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003200142245010700174300002000281520062600301592002800927650002100955650001400976650001600990650001901006700006101025700002101086700002801107700005801135700007101193773015001264856007601414852000901490655001201499IND60672899620191217000000.0191017e20190911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067289962DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b078682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez-González, Violeta10aNoncovalent Synthesis of Self-Assembled Nanotubes through Decoupled Hierarchical Cooperative Processes  ap. 16432-16438.  aBecause of their wide number of biological functions and potential applications, self-assembled nanotubes constitute highly relevant targets in noncovalent synthesis.

Twelve different treatments, including two different initial atrazine soil doses (5 and 10 mg kg−1) and two different values of the electric field applied (2 and 4 V cm−1), together with the corresponding control treatments without plants and/or without electric current, were tested. The application of an electric field during a period of 4 h a day and with periodical polarity inversion (each 2 h) did not caused significant changes in soil pH; moreover, maize plants increased the buffering capacity of the soil. The application of an electric field of 2 V cm−1 led to a slight decrease on maize biomass while the accumulation of atrazine and its main metabolites in plant tissues was significantly enhanced. On the overall, the yield of atrazine removal by electrokinetic-assisted phytoremediation with maize was increased up to 36.5% with respect to the phytoremediation process without electricity. On our knowledge, this work is the first one specifically focused on the removal of organic pollutants from soils by using the combination of phytoremediation and electrokinetic remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aatrazine 3abiomass 3abuffering capacity 3acorn 3aelectric current 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3ametabolites 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3aplant tissues 3apollutants 3asoil 0aAtrazine 0aMaize 0aElectrokinetic-assisted phytoremediation 0aPolluted soils1 aLópez-Bellido, Francisco Javier1 aCañizares, Pablo1 aRodríguez, Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6368-63080 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 225 p.280-287dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012100168300001800289520108400307592002801391650003201419650001701451650001301468650002201481650001101503650001301514650001301527650002701540650002001567650002701587650002601614650002501640650001801665650001501683650002501698653000801723653000801731653000801739653000701747653000701754653000801761653000801769653000701777653000701784653000901791653003101800653002801831653003501859653002701894700001201921700001701933700001401950700001501964773010801979856008702087852000902174655001202183IND60576044720221122150903.0190409e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057604472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuxin10aStudy on ammonium and organics removal combined with electricity generation in a continuous flow microbial fuel cell  ap. 1087-1096.  aA continuous microbial fuel cell system was constructed treating ammonium/organics rich wastewater. Operational performance of MFC system, mechanisms of ammonium removal, effect of ammonium on organics removal and energy output, C and N balance of anode chamber and microbial community analysis of anode chamber were studied. It was concluded that 0.0914kg/m3d NH4+-N and 5.739kg/m3d COD were removed from anode chamber and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) occurred in cathode chamber resulting in COD, TN removal rate of 88.53%, 71.35% respectively. Excess ammonium affected energy output and the MFC system reached maximum energy output of 816.8mV and 62.94mW/m3. In anode chamber, Spirochaetes bacterium sp., Methanobacterium formicicum sp. was predominant in bacteria, archaea communities respectively which contributed to wastewater treatment and electricity generation.

Changes in terrestrial water storage produce responses in the Earth's gravitational field and crustal deformation. Here, we use techniques from the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to reveal a normal pattern of inter-annual fluctuations in the water level in the North American Great Lakes (GL). The GRACE-estimated time series was in good agreement with in situ water level measurements from 2002 to 2018, especially in terms of phases. The amplitude of 3–4 inter-annual signals in water thickness was 4–6 cm, which is equivalent to a 50–75 km³ oscillation in surface water volume within the entire GL. The slightly larger annual and inter-annual fluctuation amplitudes estimated using GRACE data indicate that the aquifer system of the GL and its surroundings also contributes to seasonal mass changes. After 2013, water levels in the GL region rose abruptly, and the water mass increased by nearly 270 km³ until the end of 2018. We also used GPS- and GRACE-derived three-component displacements (vertical, northward, and eastward) to identify load patterns. GPS- and GRACE-estimated maximum probability source directions based on multi-channel singular spectrum analysis showed that most of the selected GPS sites point to the GL region, although the direction deviations of GPS results at a few sites are mainly caused by the combined effect of the local load and superposition of the distant GL. Our findings indicate that inter-annual displacement changes at different frequencies (1- to 8-year cycle) are primarily due to water volume fluctuations in the GL. The amplitudes estimated by GPS are greater than the GRACE-based and GL-modeled results at most stations, which reflects sensitivity differences between these geodetic solutions to the surface load, as hydrological processes in the local area around a station are difficult to identify using GRACE data with a resolution of ~300 km.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3aclimate 3adeformation 3aenvironment 3ageodesy 3aprobability 3asatellites 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3awater storage 0aSatellite geodesy 0aInter-annual water fluctuation 0aVertical and horizontal displacements 0aLoads source direction 0aGreat Lakes1 aBevis, Michael1 aPeng, Zhenran1 aKaban, Mikhail K.1 aThomas, Maik1 aChen, Chao0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2022 June 01, v. 274 p.113001-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.1130013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011300167300001400280520141700294592002801711650001401739650001201753650001901765650001101784650001801795650001701813650001501830650001501845650002101860650001801881650001301899650001601912650001901928650001701947650001101964650001501975651001001990700001902000700003102019700002202050773007602072856008302148852000902231655001202240IND60096830820221118050824.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009683082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCicia, Gianni10aFossil energy versus nuclear, wind, solar and agricultural biomass: Insights from an Italian national survey  ap. 59-66.  aIn Italy there has been considerable political debate around the new energy policy, which is speciﬁcally designed to contribute to climate change mitigation. While there is renewed interest in nuclear energy generation, there has been heated debate concerning wind farms that have rapidly expanded and are dramatically changing the landscape in many rural areas. Finally, interest has also increased in biomass as an energy source. However, in this case, a significant part of the population is worried about landscape change and primary crop reduction. In this study we report the results from a nation-wide survey (=504 households) in Italy undertaken during summer 2009. A Latent Class Choice Experiment was used to quantify household preferences over different energy sources. Our results show that Italian households can be split into three segments with homogeneous preferences. The first segment (35% of the population) shows strong preference for wind and solar energy and dislikes both biomass and nuclear. The second (33% of the population) shows moderate preference for solar and wind energy and, as with the first segment, dislikes both nuclear and biomass. The third (32% of the population) shows a strong preference for green energy (solar, wind and biomass) and is very much against nuclear energy. The three segments were also characterized in terms of household socio-economic characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3afossil fuels 3ahouseholds 3alandscapes 3anational surveys 3anuclear power 3apolitics 3arural areas 3asocioeconomics 3asolar energy 3asummer 3awind power 3aItaly1 aCembalo, Luigi1 aDel Giudice, T.q(Teresa),1 aPalladino, Andrea0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Mar., v. 42 p.59-66dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100002300193245009000216300001600306506002800322506003600350506007600386506003100462520089800493592002801391596007001419596004401489596006601533506003701599650002001636650001101656650002601667650002001693650001101713650001501724650001301739651001801752653002001770653002101790653001301811653002201824653001301846773011801859856008601977903002402063852000902087655001202096IND60610661920221207062123.0190725e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061066192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0882chorus7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.07.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGnagey, Matthew K.10aWetlands and open space: The impact of environmental regulations on land use patterns  ap. 148-159.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSection 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) has worked toward minimizing the degradation of wetlands since its inception. In 1985 the definition of the US waters regulated under Section 404 was expanded due to a Supreme Court ruling in an effort to specifically reduce environmental damage caused by new residential development. This study analyzes the resulting development permit approval process from the new regulatory environment following Section 404's expansion to examine the regulation's efficacy and illustrate potential tradeoffs between water resource protection and land fragmentation. Land use changes are identified using difference-in-difference estimators in duration analysis and a sample selection model. Results indicated that the new regulatory framework significantly slowed development of environmentally sensitive parcels but also decreased the density of new development.  aPublisher supplied data  cJames S.

The results show that UV/PS pretreatment exhibited the best performance on fouling control, followed by the UV/H2O2 pretreatment. The fouling mitigation performance improved with the increase of oxidant dose. However, UV/chlorine pretreatment aggravated membrane fouling, and the irreversible fouling resistance increased by five times compared with that of raw water. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the algae-laden solution was reduced after UV/PS pretreatment, while either UV/chlorine or UV/H2O2 pretreatment had little influence on the DOC of feed water. UV/PS and UV/H2O2 pretreatments were effective in the degradation of fluorescent compounds, thus reducing the deposition of organic matter on the membrane surface. Additionally, the decreased concentration of hydrophobic organics, algal cells, and debris in feed water after UV/PS pretreatment was also contributed to the fouling alleviation. The aggravated irreversible fouling after UV/chlorine pretreatment was probably ascribed to the increased accumulation of hydrophobic fractions in the membrane pores. Modeling result indicates that membrane fouling during the filtration of raw algae-laden water was dominated by intermediate blocking and cake filtration mechanisms. Both UV/PS and UV/H2O2 pretreatments transformed the combined fouling mechanism into standard blocking, while UV/chlorine pretreatment aggravated the pore blocking in the initial filtration period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3achlorine 3adissolved organic carbon 3afluorescent substances 3afouling 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aultrafiltration 0aUltrafiltration (UF) membrane 0aMembrane fouling 0aAlgae 0aUltraviolet/persulfate (UV/PS) 0aUltraviolet/chlorine (UV/chlorine) 0aUltraviolet/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2)1 aXie, Pengchao1 aWang, Zongping1 aDing, Jiaqi1 aWang, Jingwen1 aWang, Songlin1 aWiesner, Mark R.0 tWater research.g2019 July 01, v. 158 p.213-226dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245009200127300001600219520108200235592002801317650001601345650001801361650001401379650001401393650001801407651001001425653001401435653001901449653002001468700001501488700001901503773014201522852000901664655001201673IND60721425820221121162227.0201224e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072142582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaleb, Abu10aDistribution of different forms of potassium in lateritic soils of birbhum, West Bengal  ap. 134-137.  aDifferent forms of potassium in some lateritic (Alflsol) solis of the district Blrbhum, West Bengal were analyzed and their relationship with different soli physico-chemical properties was studied.

Among the different physico-chemical properties of solis, clay content played a significant role In Increasing the exchangeable-K as well as total-K forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aclay fraction 3alaterites 3apotassium 3asand fraction 3aIndia 0aFractions 0alateritie soil 0asoil properties1 aMondal, S.1 aSiddiqui, M.Z.0 tProgressive agriculture.g2010 Dec., v. 10, no. 3 p.134-137dSociety for Recent Development in AgriculturewJournal:2097x0976-46157nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245014800173300001400321500001500335520149000350592002801840650001401868650002201882650001101904650001301915650001101928650001801939650001401957650001501971650001901986650001202005650001602017650001002033650001102043650001302054650001302067651001402080651001102094653001002105700002602115700002102141773008302162856008802245852000902333655001202342IND60086224720221121173854.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008622472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTzortzaki, Evi10aBiomarker evidence for intermittent photic zone euxinia in the Aptian–Albian organic sedimentary record from the Ionian Zone (Epirus, Greece)  ap. 84-93.  a2019-12-06  aNew biomarker evidence is presented that constrains the conditions of deposition and preservation of sediments rich in extractable organic matter from the Aptian–Albian sedimentary record of the Ionian Zone in NW Greece. Analyses were specifically carried out on total lipid extracts from 12 organic rich samples from the Vigla Shale Member, two of which represent the regional record for the early Albian Paquier Event of OAE1b. In the aliphatic fractions, compound groups such as n-alkanes, isoprenoid alkanes, steroids, hopanoids and terpenoids were recognized, pointing to a mixed origin from algae and prokaryotes with an additional measurable contribution from terrigenous plant matter. These compounds suggest deposition of the primary organic sediments under conditions of decreased bottom water oxygen concentrations. Mass spectral evidence from the aromatic fractions of most samples reveal the variable presence of diagenetic and catagenetic derivatives of carotenoid pigments (including some with bound sulfur) that are characteristic of photoautotrophic sulfur bacteria. The presence of specific biomarkers originating from photosynthetic anaerobic microorganisms, similar to those in ancient and contemporary euxinic basins such as the Black Sea, suggest that photic zone euxinic conditions were intermittently operative in the Aptian–Albian stages of the Ionian Basin, but were not exclusively characteristic of the black shale representing the Paquier Event itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3aprokaryotic cells 3abasins 3asteroids 3asulfur 3aeuphotic zone 3ahopanoids 3abiomarkers 3aorganic matter 3aalkanes 3acarotenoids 3ashale 3aoxygen 3abacteria 3apigments 3aBlack Sea 3aGreece 0aAlgae1 aKarakitsios, Vassilis1 aTsikos, Harilaos0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 64 p.84-93dElsevier Ltdx0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2013.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03775naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002200172245007700194300001600271520206300287592002802350650001102378650001002389650001202399650001102411650001402422650002502436650001502461650002102476650001702497650002802514650002202542650001502564650001102579650001502590650001702605650001002622650003302632650002402665650002902689650002102718650002302739650003502762650002702797650002002824650004202844650002002886650003202906650001702938651001102955700002102966773010202987856008703089852000903176655001203185IND50059276920221123010133.0141112e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005927692DNAL7 a229404802pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Jonathan D.10aWastewater filtration and re-use: An alternative water source for London  ap. 173-184.  aThe rapid growth and climate of the Greater London region have contributed towards large deficits in water supply. Inexpensive, energy-efficient and sustainable water resource schemes are increasingly sought as a means to boost supply. Here, we propose a small-scale recycling scheme whereby tertiary-treated wastewater is pumped to the Cretaceous chalk of the London Basin. By taking advantage of the natural filtration properties of the underlying chalk, contaminants can be effectively attenuated over relatively short length scales to result in pure water. The problem is approached from four different scales. First, we define two localities in London where such a pumping scheme might operate; regions which combine a thick unsaturated zone and high chalk transmissivity, both essential to ensure maximum contaminant removal and minimum environmental impact. Secondly, the effects of pumping fluid into the Chalk at the two localities are quantified using a finite-difference groundwater flow model. We show that rivers impose a regular groundwater flow regime, whereas pre-existing abstraction wells will lead to less predictable results. Thirdly, we consider the effect of fractures on channelling rapid fluid flow within the rock mass. By digitising a fracture map based upon outcrop measurements from chalk exposed on the Kent coast similar to that beneath London, we quantify transport patterns of wastewater after injection. Imbibition to the chalk matrix (and therefore filtration) will occur where fluid pressure gradients are highest, for instance around disconnected fracture tips. Finally we demonstrate the efficacy of chalk in contaminant removal by injecting an analogue ‘effluent’ through a chalk core. ICP-AES analysis on the recovered solution shows the contaminants (viz. a suite of heavy metals) are arrested or removed over relatively small time- and length-scales. Numerical and analytical solutions fit the data poorly, shedding some light on the importance of hydrodynamic dispersion of aqueous contaminants within the chalk.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3achalk 3aclimate 3acoasts 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental impact 3afiltration 3agroundwater flow 3aheavy metals 3ahydrodynamic dispersion 3ahydrologic models 3aimbibition 3arivers 3awastewater 3awater supply 3awells 2aCalcium Carbonatexchemistry 2aFiltrationxmethods 2aMetals, Heavyxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aRecyclingxmethods 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWastewaterxchemistry. 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 2aWater Pollution 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aWater Supply 0aLondon1 aBlunt, Martin J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 437 p.173-184dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245009300180300001400273520143600287592002801723650001601751650001101767650001101778650001401789650002701803650001601830650001301846650000901859650002201868650001701890650002401907653003301931653000901964653001101973653001001984653002301994653002702017700002902044700003602073773011302109856008302222852000902305655001202314IND60770699620221119195920.0220420e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077069962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokawa, Paula Keiko Anadão10aAutologous conditioned serum in equine and human orthopedic therapy: A systematic review  ap. 34-52.  aThis systematic review aims to compile and present information of studies evaluating the effectiveness of autologous conditioned serum (ACS) in the healing of tendon, ligament and articular lesions in humans and horses. A systematic search of articles using Medline, PubMed, Embase, Bireme and Google Scholar was conducted up to August 2020. Studies regarding ACS' use in human orthopedic lesions were included if classified as RCTs, cohort and case-controls. All studies regarding this therapy in equine medicine were included given their scarcity. Pre-clinical experimental studies were selected if controlled. A total of 1474 results were found; 126 articles were fully accessed, and 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. In vitro studies failed to demonstrate consistent positive properties and effects, while most clinical trials and observational studies indicated a beneficial response associated with ACS administration. However, RTCs and observational studies presented together mostly an unclear to high risk of bias, with only a few being considered of low risk. In face of the observed inconsistencies, the use of ACS in the treatment of musculoskeletal lesions, although safe, promising and appealing, still cannot be recommended without due caution. Overcoming these incongruences will demand efforts to construct well-designed studies and to regard ACS as an autologous product that encompass a diverse composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aligaments 3amusculoskeletal system 3aorthopedics 3aresearch 3arisk 3asystematic review 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary medicine 0aAutologous conditioned serum 0aIRAP 0aHorses 0aHuman 0aOrthopedic lesions 0aBlood-derived products1 aBrossi, Patrícia Monaco1 aBaccarin, Raquel Yvonne Arantes0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2022 Sept., v. 146 p.34-52dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013600163300001600299520159200315592002801907650001201935650004401947650001901991650002002010650002202030650001902052650001102071650002902082650001302111650002102124650001302145650001702158650001402175650003302189650001002222650002102232650001302253650001502266653001102281653002902292653001302321653001302334653002102347700001402368700001302382700005802395700001902453700001602472700001402488700001302502773009702515856008502612852000902697655001202706IND60637901820221117155745.0190516e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063790182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.04.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Qi10aEffects of copper ions on removal of nutrients from swine wastewater and on release of dissolved organic matter in duckweed systems  ap. 171-181.  aHigh concentration of Cu2+ in swine wastewater raises concerns about its potential adverse effects on nutrient removal by aquatic plants like duckweed. In this work, the effects of copper ions on nutrient removal and release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in duckweed systems. Results showed that the removal performance of ammonia nitrogen (NH3N) and total phosphorus (TP) increased at 0.1–1.0 mg/L of Cu2+, while dropped at 2.0–5.0 mg/L of Cu2+. A novel kinetic model in which Cu2+ was taken into account was then developed which was used to optimize Cu2+ concentration at 0.96 mg/L for nutrient removal in duckweed systems. NADH, detected in DOM by the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, exhibited high capacities of binding copper ions, so it played an important role on the decrease of Cu2+ concentrations in duckweed systems. The principle component analysis (PCA) showed that the dominant DOM were lower molecular weight compounds at 1.0 mg/L of Cu2+ and higher molecular weight compounds at 2.0–5.0 mg/L of Cu2+. The bonds of CH (humic-like), NO (NO3−) and ArH (tyrosine) in DOM were responsible for not only the fastest binding with Cu2+ from the result of the two-dimensional Fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy (2D-FTIR-CoS) but also the variations of DOM conformations at a critical concentration of 0.5 mg/L Cu2+ from the perturbation correlation moving window two-dimensional (PCMW2D) analysis. These findings lead to a better understanding on the environmental behaviors and mechanisms of Cu2+ in duckweed systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraceae 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aadverse effects 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquatic plants 3acopper 3adissolved organic matter 3akinetics 3amolecular weight 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anutrients 3aprincipal component analysis 3aswine 3atotal phosphorus 3atyrosine 3awastewater 0aCopper 0aDissolved organic matter 0aDuckweed 0aNutrient 0aSwine wastewater1 aLi, Xiang1 aLin, Yan1 aYang, Chunping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3987-27221 aTang, Wenchang1 aWu, Shaohua1 aLi, Dehao1 aLou, Wei0 tWater research.g2019 July 01, v. 158 p.171-181dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.04.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007500170300001600245520109800261592002801359650001001387650001801397650001101415650001201426650002601438650001901464650001101483650002001494653002101514653001901535653002001554653002101574653001901595700001801614773011901632856008501751852000901836655001201845IND60554252320221120225632.0180904e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055425232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsujita, Kazuya10aPhosphoinositides in the regulation of actin cortex and cell migration  ap. 824-831.  aIn order for the cell to function well within a multicellular system, the mechanical properties of the plasma membrane need to meet two different requirements: cell shape maintenance and rearrangement. To achieve these goals, phosphoinositides play key roles in the regulation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. PI(4,5)P2 is the most abundant phosphoinositide species in the plasma membrane. It maintains cell shape by linking the actin cortex to the membrane via interactions with Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM) proteins and class I myosins. Although the role of D3-phosphoinositides, such as PI(3,4,5)P3, in actin-driven cell migration has been a subject of controversy, it becomes evident that the dynamic turnover of the phosphoinositide by the action of metabolizing enzymes, such as 5-phosphatases, is necessary. Recent studies have revealed an important role of PI(3,4)P2 in podosome/invadopodia formation, shedding new light on the actin-based organization of membrane structures regulated by phosphoinositide signaling.

The aim of the research was to differentiate modern maize initial breeding material by susceptibility to causative agent of head smut (Sphacelotheca reiliana) in the conditions of the northern Steppe of Ukraine. 28 maize inbreds from the collection of SE The Institute of Grain Crops of NAAS were taken for estimation of resistance to head smut in contrasting 2018 and 2019 on artificial infectious background in Dnipropetrovsk region. According to the results of the cultivation, all tested samples were divided into four classes on the level of susceptibility to disease: stable, low sensitive, middle sensitive and unstable. In 2018, 11 lines showed low sensitivity, 8 lines – middle and 9 lines – high sensitivity to head smut. In 2019 – no signs of pathogenesis were detected in 12 lines while 6 inbreds were classified as low sensitive, 7 – middle sensitive and 3 – high sensitive. The largest amount of stable or low sensitive to S. reiliana lines was among those ones originated from Lancaster germplasm. Among 9 lines of Iodent germplasm in 2018‒2019 inbred DK 742 was assigned to the 2nd class of sensitivity; DK315 and DK744 in 2018 – to 4th and 3rd classes while in 2019 – to 2nd and 1st classes, respectively. Five other Iodent lines were either unstable or had intermediate susceptibility to the pathogen. As to Reid germplasm in two research years DK239MV showed the sensitivity of 1.6‒9.0% and was classified as low sensitive; DK2323 was determined as intermediate sensitive in 2018 and high sensitive in 2019. In arid conditions of 2018 up to 20% of DK367 plants had typical signs of infection while in wet 2019 this line had no signs of infection by S. reiliana at all. Flint inbred DK4538 appeared unstable in both years. Other inbreds with flint grain type DK959 and DK276 in two years varied greatly on their resistance. DK 247MV which was related to line Co125 had low susceptibility to the pathogen at the level of 4.7‒5.6%. DK129-4, also related to Co125, demonstrated susceptibility from 0 to 18.3%. Since maize resistance to head smut is a polygenic trait, it largely depends on weather conditions, as well as the virulence of the pathogen, the ability of plants to prevent pathological processes at the level of histogenesis, fungistatic effects of soil microorganisms and maize root secretions. Taking into account the influence of the external environment, the revealed perspective lines with ability to withstand the head smut in the northern Steppe of Ukraine can be used in the selection process of maize hybrids resistant to S. reiliana  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSphacelotheca reiliana 3aclimate 3acorn 3adisease resistance 3adisease susceptibility 3agermplasm 3ainbreeding 3amorphogenesis 3apathogenesis 3aplant pathogens 3asmut diseases 3asoil 3asteppes 3avirulence 3aweather 3aUkraine 0azea mays 0ainbreds; head smut 0adisease susceptibility 0aselection 0aartificial infective bachground1 aStasiv, O.

TRI controls for gas dependency, transit route diversification, political risks of transit, pipeline rupture probability, and the balance of power between supplying and consuming countries along the transit route. Evaluating TRI for the EU-Russia gas trade, we show that the introduction of the Nord Stream pipeline would further widen already large disparities in gas risk exposure across the EU Member States. The gas risk exposure of the Member States served by Nord Stream would decline. In contrast, EU countries not connected to Nord Stream, but sharing other Russian gas transit routes with the Nord Stream countries, would face greater gas risk exposure. We discuss the implications of our analysis for the design of the common energy policy in the EU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aenergy policy 3aimports 3anatural gas 3apipelines 3apolitics 3arisk 3aRussia1 aPaltseva, Elena0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Mar., v. 42 p.642-650dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011900165300001300284520159300297592002801890650001401918650000901932650001001941650001101951650001901962650002401981650001202005650004402017650002202061650001202083650003102095650001302126650002502139650001702164650002402181653003402205653001102239653002802250653004302278653002202321653002702343700001802370700002302388700002302411700002302434700002002457773011102477856008302588852000902671655001202680IND60770699920221119194537.0220531e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077069992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNomura, Saki14aThe inhibitory effects of MIF on accumulation of canine degenerative myelopathy-associated mutant SOD1 aggregation  ap. 7-11.  aCanine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is commonly associated with c.118G > A (p. E40K) missense mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Mutant SOD1 protein (SOD1ᴱ⁴⁰ᴷ) is likely to be misfolded, acquire insolubility, aggregate in the cytoplasm of neural cells, and lead to degeneration of the nervous tissues. Along with a chaperone activity, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifunctional protein that has been shown to directly inhibit human mutant SOD1 misfolding and enhance survival of mutant SOD1-expressing motor neurons. The purpose of this study was to determine whether MIF also inhibits DM-related SOD1ᴱ⁴⁰ᴷ misfolding and accumulation of SOD1 aggregates. Human embryonic kidney 293A cells were transfected SOD1ᶜᵂᵀ or SOD1ᴱ⁴⁰ᴷ with or without MIF. The percentages of cells containing transfected SOD1 aggregates were measured by immunocytochemistry, and the amount of SOD1ᴱ⁴⁰ᴷ in the insoluble fraction was evaluated by immunoblotting. The percentage of cells with SOD1ᴱ⁴⁰ᴷ aggregates and the amount of insoluble SOD1ᴱ⁴⁰ᴷ protein decreased in the presence of MIF. Because the chaperone activity of MIF assists in SOD1ᴱ⁴⁰ᴷ folding and enhances the refolding and degradation of misfolded SOD1ᴱ⁴⁰ᴷ, the results of this study suggests that MIF regulates the accumulation of SOD1 aggregates by its chaperone activity. We propose that enhancing intracellular MIF chaperone activity could be an effective therapeutic strategy for DM.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasm 3adogs 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3aimmunocytochemistry 3akidneys 3amacrophage migration inhibitory factors 3amissense mutation 3amutants 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aresearch 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary medicine 0aAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis 0aCanine 0aDegenerative myelopathy 0aMacrophage migration inhibitory factor 0aNeurodegeneration 0aSuperoxide dismutase 11 aKobatake, Yui1 aTakashima, Satoshi1 aKamishina, Hiroaki1 aUrushitani, Makoto1 aNishii, Naohito0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2022 Oct., v. 147 p.7-11dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245014200166300001400308520114800322592002801470650001201498650002101510650001701531650001101548650001601559650001001575650001301585650001201598650001601610650002401626650004201650650001501692650001801707650001301725650001901738650001501757650001501772650002801787653003001815653000901845653002501854653001701879653002201896700001801918700001301936700002501949700001701974773010401991856008702095852000902182655001202191IND60576045320221122150947.0190409e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057604532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Jun10aSustainable pollutant removal by periphytic biofilm via microbial composition shifts induced by uneven distribution of CeO2 nanoparticles  ap. 75-81.  aThe responses of periphytic biofilm to CeO2 nanoparticle (CNP) exposure were explored by investigating community shifts and pollutant removal. Results showed that CNPs entered the sensitive microbial cells in the periphytic biofilm, leading to cytomembrane damage and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The periphytic biofilm communities were, however, able to adapt to the prolonged exposure and maintain their pollutant removal (i.e., phosphorus, nitrogen and copper, organic matter) performance. Observations under synchrotron radiation scanning transmission X-ray microscopy revealed that fewer CNPs were distributed in algal cells compared to bacterial cells, wherein the transformation between Ce(IV) and Ce(III) occurred. High-throughput sequencing further showed that the proportion of algae, such as Leptolyngbya and Nostoc, significantly increased in the periphytic biofilm exposed to CNPs while the proportion of bacteria, such as Bacilli and Gemmatimonadetes, decreased. This change in community composition might be the primary reason for the sustained pollutant removal performance of the periphytic biofilm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacilli 3aGemmatimonadetes 3aLeptolyngbya 3aNostoc 3aX-radiation 3aalgae 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aceric oxide 3acommunity structure 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicroscopy 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3areactive oxygen species 0aNanoparticle distribution 0aSTXM 0aMicrobial aggregates 0aNanotoxicity 0aPollutant removal1 aZhu, Ningyuan1 aZhu, Yan1 aZamir, Seyed Morteza1 aWu, Yonghong0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Jan., v. 248 p.75-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01561naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008200169300001600251520072100267592002800988650001301016650001601029650002901045650002001074651001901094773007801113856008301191852000901274655001201283IND60096831620221118050501.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009683162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.11.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoucher, Philip14aThe role of controversy, regulation and engineering in UK biofuel development  ap. 148-154.  aBiofuels have undergone a controversial resurgence in the UK since the turn of the century. The aim of this article is to consider this development in the context of ongoing interactions between the controversy and regulatory and engineering activities. It is found that the discursive space of the controversy has increasingly narrowed around environmental issues, particularly greenhouse gas emissions. The implications for biofuel development are considered in the context of changing regulatory and engineering visions in response to indirect land-use change. Opposition to the third generation biofuels may be softened, but it may be more difficult to justify the cost of holistic regulation of land-use change.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3aengineering 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland use change 3aUnited Kingdom0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Mar., v. 42 p.148-154dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.11.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245018100191300001400372520162800386592002802014650002102042650002602063650001102089650001302100650001102113650001102124650002602135650001402161650001302175650001202188650002802200650002502228650005302253650004202306650001802348650001302366650001102379650002602390650001402416650002502430650002702455650002702482650003802509650004302547651001302590651002802603700002102631700001902652700001802671773010502689856008402794852000902878655001202887IND60099479020221119141958.0141105e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009947902DNAL7 a220519382pmid7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2011.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParreira, Ricardo10aGB virus C (GBV-C) evolutionary patterns revealed by analyses of reference genomes, E2 and NS5B sequences amplified from viral strains circulating in the Lisbon area (Portugal)  ap. 86-93.  aGBV-C is a non-pathogenic virus that is largely dispersed in different human populations. The phylogenetic analysis of the 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR) of the GBV-C genome has led to the segregation of viral strains into six genotypes, but incongruent results are frequently obtained depending on the genome region analyzed. In this report, different phylogenetic approaches and multivariate statistics were combined to disclose evolutionary patterns that contribute to shape GBV-C evolution. The data here presented indicate: (i) that the phylogenetic noise was mostly determined by the size of the analyzed sequence, rather than by its position on the viral genome; (ii) that most genomic segments in the coding sequence seemed to evolve under a similar evolution model, which was different from that which best fits the 5′UTR, with overall large heterogeneity of rate change across the sequence; (iii) that due to saturation of transversions occurring in the 5′UTR at genetic distances <0.10, care should be taken in drawing conclusions about the tree topologies involving the deeper branches, especially when using distance-based methods; (iv) that a non-uniform distribution of InSi and dS occurs over the viral ORF highlighting regions of the viral genome with remarkably low levels of silent substitutions, and implying that the observed differences may contribute to the detected phylogenetic incongruences; and finally (v) that genetic recombination clearly impacts the GBV-C evolution extensively, this being shown for both reference genomes and NS5B GBV-C sequences amplified from Portuguese residents.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic distance 3agenetic recombination 3agenome 3agenotype 3ahumans 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3aphylogeny 3atopology 3aviruses 2a5' Untranslated Regions 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFlaviviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aGB virus Cxclassificationxgenetics. 2aGenome, Viral 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxgenetics 2aViral Nonstructural Proteinsxgenetics 3aPortugal 0aPortugalxepidemiology.1 aBranco, Cristina1 aPiedade, João1 aEsteves, Aida0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2012 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.86-93dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04479naa a2200997 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012800168300001600296520198100312592002802293650002702321650001402348650001902362650002602381650001602407650001602423650001202439650002102451650001302472650001002485650004102495650001602536650001002552650004802562650002002610650000902630650002802639650002102667650003002688653000802718653000902726653001002735653000902745653001102754653001102765653001002776653000702786653000802793653001002801653001002811653000702821653000902828653000802837653001102845653000902856653000902865653000802874653001102882653000902893653001202902653000802914653000902922653001202931653001002943653001302953653000902966653001202975653001102987653000902998653000903007653001003016653001103026653001003037653000903047653000903056653001003065653001303075653002203088653001403110653001003124700002103134700002003155700002203175700002003197700002003217700001903237773011903256856008503375852000903460655001203469IND60554252720221123003623.0180904e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055425272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaena, Miguel10aFructose supplementation impairs rat liver autophagy through mTORC activation without inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress  ap. 107-116.  aSupplementation with 10% liquid fructose to female rats for 2weeks caused hepatic steatosis through increased lipogenesis and reduced peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) α activity and fatty acid catabolism, together with increased expression of the spliced form of X-binding protein-1 (Rebollo et al., 2014). In the present study, we show that some of these effects are preserved after sub-chronic (8weeks) fructose supplementation, specifically increased hepatic expression of lipid synthesis-related genes (stearoyl-CoA desaturase, ×6.7-fold; acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ×1.6-fold; glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, ×1.65-fold), and reduced fatty acid β-oxidation (×0.77-fold), resulting in increased liver triglyceride content (×1.69-fold) and hepatic steatosis. However, hepatic expression of PPARα and its target genes was not modified and, further, livers of 8-week fructose-supplemented rats showed no sign of unfolded protein response activation, except for an increase in p-IRE1 levels. Hepatic mTOR phosphorylation was enhanced (×1.74-fold), causing an increase in the phosphorylation of UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK-1) (×2.8-fold), leading to a decrease in the ratio of LC3B-II/LC3B-I protein expression (×0.39-fold) and an increase in the amount of the autophagic substrate p62, indicative of decreased autophagy activity. A harmful cycle may be established in the liver of 8-week fructose-supplemented rats where lipid accumulation may cause defective autophagy, and reduced autophagy may result in decreased free fatty acid formation from triglyceride depots, thus reducing the substrates for β-oxidation and further increasing hepatic steatosis. In summary, the length of supplementation is a key factor in the metabolic disturbances induced by fructose: in short-term studies, PPARα inhibition and ER stress induction are critical events, whereas after sub-chronic supplementation, mTOR activation and autophagy inhibition are crucial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aautophagy 3abeta oxidation 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afatty acids 3afatty liver 3afemales 3afree fatty acids 3afructose 3agenes 3aglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3atriacylglycerols 3aunfolded protein response 0aACC 0aAMPK 0aATF-6 0aCHOP 0aDnajb9 0a4E-BP1 0aEDEM1 0aER 0aFAS 0aG6PDH 0aGAPDH 0aGK 0aGPAT 0aGRP 0aGSK3β 0aHNF4 0aIRE1 0aJNK 0aLAMP-1 0aLC3B 0aL-CPT-I 0aLDH 0aL-PK 0amTOR(C) 0aNAMPT 0ap38 MAPK 0aPERK 0aPGC-1α 0aPPARα 0aRheb 0aSCD1 0aSIRT1 0asXBP-1 0aSREBP 0aTel2 0aTsc2 0aULK-1 0aFructose 0aHepatic steatosis 0aAutophagy 0amTORC1 aSangüesa, Gemma1 aHutter, Natalia1 aSánchez, Rosa M.1 aRoglans, Núria1 aLaguna, Juan C.1 aAlegret, Marta0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 Feb., v. 1851, no. 2 p.107-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245008300196300001500279520113300294592002801427650001201455650001001467650001401477650002601491650000901517650001101526650003101537650001101568650002801579650001201607700002301619700002501642700002401667700002201691773015001713856006901863856010201932990002302034852000902057655001202066IND60643528320221122031333.0190510e20140514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064352832DNAL7 a10.3791/514662doi7 aPMC41863912pmcid7 a248942682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSillay, Karl A.10aImage-guided convection-enhanced delivery into agarose gel models of the brain  ap. e51466.  aConvection-enhanced delivery (CED) has been proposed as a treatment option for a wide range of neurological diseases. Neuroinfusion catheter CED allows for positive pressure bulk flow to deliver greater quantities of therapeutics to an intracranial target than traditional drug delivery methods. The clinical utility of real time MRI guided CED (rCED) lies in the ability to accurately target, monitor therapy, and identify complications. With training, rCED is efficient and complications may be minimized. The agarose gel model of the brain provides an accessible tool for CED testing, research, and training. Simulated brain rCED allows practice of the mock surgery while also providing visual feedback of the infusion. Analysis of infusion allows for calculation of the distribution fraction (Vd/Vi) allowing the trainee to verify the similarity of the model as compared to human brain tissue. This article describes our agarose gel brain phantom and outlines important metrics during a CED infusion and analysis protocols while addressing common pitfalls faced during CED infusion for the treatment of neurological disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3abrain 3acatheters 3adrug delivery systems 3agels 3ahumans 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amodels 3anervous system diseases 3asurgery1 aMcClatchy, S.

The present study aimed to determine the extent of poor vitamin D status in school boys and girls aged 6–18 years and to examine if there was any difference in status with age, physical activity and veiling and concomitant effects on bone.DesignCross-sectional study.SettingJeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.SubjectsA total of 150 boys (7–16 years) and 150 girls (6–18 years) from local schools were divided into age categories: 6–9 years (elementary school); 10–12 years (secondary school); 13–14 years (middle years); 15–18 years (high school).ResultsVitamin D status was significantly lower in girls than boys in all age groups (P < 0·01), with the 15–18-year-old girls having the lowest level (22·0 (sd 9·4) nmol/l) in comparison to the 15–18-year-old boys (39·3 (sd 14·0) nmol/l) and the 6–9-year-old girls (41·2 (sd 9·3) nmol/l). Parathyroid hormone status was highest in the 15–18-year-old girls in comparison to boys of the same age. A total of 64 % of 15–18-year-old girls had 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) status <25 nmol/l in comparison to 31 % in the 13–14 years age category, 26 % in the 10–12 years category and 2·5 % in the 6–9 years category. No boys had 25OHD status <25 nmol/l. Fully veiled girls had lower 25OHD status than partly veiled or unveiled girls (P < 0·05). Low 25OHD and high parathyroid hormone was associated with lower bone mass in the 6–9 years and 13–14 years age groups (P < 0·05).ConclusionsThese data suggest significant hypovitaminosis D in older adolescent females, which is a cause for concern given that there is currently no public health policy for vitamin D in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aage 3abone density 3aboys 3acalcium 3afemales 3agirls 3ahealth policy 3ametabolism 3aparathyroid hormone 3aphysical activity 3aschools 3asecondary education 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency 3avitamin status 3aSaudi Arabia 0aVitamin D 0aBone density 0aParathyroid hormone 0aMiddle East 0aVeiling 0aSunlight exposure1 aLanham-New, Susan A1 aKahn, Jalal A0 tPublic health nutrition.g2012 Oct., v. 15, no. 10 p.1845-1853dCambridge University Pressx1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800110036123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245016500170300001600335520180200351592002802153650002502181650002602206650001902232650002502251650001802276650001802294650001602312650001002328650001902338650001202357650002602369650001502395650002602410650001102436650002202447650001402469650001202483650001302495650001502508653003502523653002602558653002502584653002802609653001202637653002802649700001902677700001202696700001402708700001202722700001702734700001402751700001702765773009902782856009002881852000902971655001202980IND60637902420221120041341.0200106e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063790242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qian10aPigment profiling of ‘QN Orange'scallop and ‘Bohai Red’ scallop adductor muscles by liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry  ap. 178-185.  aTwo new scallop strains, the ‘QN Orange’ scallop and the ‘Bohai Red’ scallop, were selected from the hybrid cohort between the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians irradians) and the Peruvian scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) to improve the bay scallop stock, which has suffered from significant inbreeding depression characterized by poor growth and high mortality. Although both strains were originated from the same hybrid cohort, the ‘QN Orange’ scallops possess orange adductor muscles while the ‘Bohai Red’ scallops have white adductor muscles. To explore the pigment profiles of adductor muscle coloration in these two scallop strains, an optimized method based on liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-QqQ-MS) with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) was established to determine chlorophyll (chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b) and carotenoids (including α-carotene, β-carotene, ε-carotene, γ-carotene, ζ-carotene, lutein, fucoxanthin, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, pectenoxanthin, and pectenolone). The results showed that the total contents of carotenoids in the adductor muscle, gill, and mantle of ‘QN Orange’ scallops were 82.68, 105.49, and 100.49 μg g⁻¹, which were 49.88, 3.26, and 4.18 times higher than those in the ‘Bohai Red’ scallops, respectively. In particular, the contents of the pigments pectenolone, pectenoxanthin, fucoxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein in the ‘QN Orange’ scallops were 171.58, 61.67, 3.87, 22.16 and 23.27 μg g⁻¹, which were 6.92, 3.38, 27.64, 15.75, and 13.00 times higher than those in the ‘Bohai Red’ scallops, respectively. These results suggest that the orange coloration in the ‘QN Orange’ scallops might be caused by the accumulation of carotenoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgopecten irradians 3aArgopecten purpuratus 3aalpha-carotene 3aatmospheric pressure 3abeta-carotene 3acanthaxanthin 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3agamma-carotene 3ahybrids 3ainbreeding depression 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3alutein 3amass spectrometry 3amortality 3amuscles 3ascallops 3azeaxanthin 0aArgopecten irradians irradians 0aArgopecten purpuratus 0a‘QN Orange'scallop 0a‘Bohai Red’ scallop 0aHPLC-MS 0aCarotenoid accumulation1 aChen, Juanjuan1 aZhu, Si1 aLiu, Xiao1 aMa, Bin1 aWang, Chunde1 aXu, Jilin1 aYan, Xiaojun0 tAquaculture.g2019 June 15, v. 508 p.178-185dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007200166300001600238520183100254592002802085650001502113650001402128650001802142650002202160650001902182650002502201650002102226650002302247650001302270650001502283650001502298650001102313650002002324650002302344650001602367650002202383650001202405650001702417651001102434700001902445700002002464700002302484773009202507856008102599852000902680655001202689IND60119825420221119190755.0150205e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011982542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-014-0103-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuech, Camille10aDo farming practices affect natural enemies at the landscape scale?  ap. 125-140.  aFarming practices are rarely considered in the description of agricultural landscapes. However, the variety of cropping systems creates a particular kind of heterogeneity which can strongly affect the diversity of species living in agro-ecosystems, and consequently the ecosystem services they provide. In this study, we investigate the effects of landscape composition and configuration of organic and conventional farming practices on three groups of aphids’ natural enemies, compared to field habitat quality and land cover heterogeneity. A field survey was carried out in 2012 and 2013 in western France (Brittany). Ladybirds, carabid beetles and parasitoids were sampled in 40 pairs of organic and conventional winter wheat fields, distributed along a landscape gradient of organic farming areas. The relationships between farming practices and natural enemies were investigated with a PLS-path modeling approach, hardly ever used in ecology but presenting numerous advantages to analyze multivariate systems. Results showed that abundance and species richness of natural enemies were mainly affected by local farming practices, with a higher diversity in organic fields. To a lesser extent, landscapes also affected natural enemies, but only in relation to the length and configuration of hedgerows. Our results open up avenues for the design of agricultural landscapes since our results suggest that natural enemy diversity can be enhanced without a specific organization of organic fields. We discuss methodological issues regarding the description and the analysis of farming practices at the landscape scale. We argue that such investigations require high quality maps covering large spatial extents, and the use of statistical tools providing a good handling of complex relationships occurring in agro-ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aCarabidae 3aCoccinellidae 3aagricultural land 3aagroecosystems 3aconventional farming 3acropping systems 3aecosystem services 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anatural enemies 3aorganic production 3aparasitoids 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3awinter wheat 3aFrance1 aPoggi, Sylvain1 aBaudry, Jacques1 aAviron, Stéphanie0 tLandscape ecology.g2015 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.125-140dSpringer-Verlagx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-014-0103-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01637naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245010000130300001600230520061100246592002800857650002100885650001600906650001600922650001300938650001800951650001700969650001000986650001800996653001601014653001401030653001901044653002301063700001601086700002201102773014201124852000901266655001201275IND60721426820221122025256.0201224e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072142682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Poonam10aSelection of suitable packaging material for safe storage of radish (Raphanus sativus L.) seeds  ap. 183-186.  aRadish (Raphanus satlvus L.)

However, the biochar features, such as morphology, porosity and surface chemistry, cannot be well controlled in conventional conversion approaches, limiting the wide application of raw biochar. Aiming to meet the specific requirements, post-modification of raw biochar was frequently conducted to improve the quality. In this review, recent developments regarding post-modification methods of biochar are presented and discussed. Progresses on the applications of post modified biochar as electrode materials for supercapacitors are intensively summarized. This review aims to reveal the key factors that affecting the performance of biochar-based supercapacitors, and provide guidance for rationalizing the modification methods to expand the applications of biochar-based functional materials in supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aporosity 0aBiochar 0aPost-modification 0aPorous carbons 0aBiochar-nanostructure composites 0aSupercapacitors1 aZeng, Raymond J.1 aJiang, Hong0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Dec., v. 246 p.224-233dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011100166300001600277520124800293592002801541650002501569650001101594650002301605650002701628650001601655650001401671650002201685650001201707650001701719650001201736650001101748650001501759650001401774650001501788650000901803650001701812651001501829700001901844700002201863700002301885700002101908700001901929700002401948773007801972856008302050852000902133655001202142IND60096832020221118050518.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009683202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrury, Easan14aThe transformation of southern California's residential photovoltaics market through third-party ownership  ap. 681-690.  aThird-party photovoltaics (PV) ownership is a rapidly growing market trend, where commercial companies own and operate customer-sited PV systems and lease PV equipment or sell PV electricity to the building occupant. Third-party PV companies can reduce or eliminate up-front adoption costs, reduce technology risk and complexity by monitoring system performance, and can repackage the PV value proposition by showing cost savings in the first month of ownership rather than payback times on the order of a decade. We find that the entrance of third-party business models in southern California residential PV markets has enticed a new demographic to adopt PV systems that is more highly correlated to younger, less affluent, and less educated populations than the demographics correlated to purchasing PV systems. By enticing new demographics to adopt PV, we find that third-party PV products are likely increasing total PV demand rather than gaining market share entirely at the expense of existing customer owned PV demand. We also find that mean population demographics are good predictors of third-party and customer owned PV adoption, and mean voting trends on California carbon policy (Proposition 23) are poor predictors of PV adoption.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3ademographic statistics 3aelectricity 3aequipment 3aissues and policy 3aleasing 3amarket share 3amarkets 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aownership 3apurchasing 3arisk 3asolar energy 3aCalifornia1 aMiller, Mackay1 aMacal, Charles M.1 aGraziano, Diane J.1 aHeimiller, Donna1 aOzik, Jonathan1 aPerry IV, Thomas D.0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Mar., v. 42 p.681-690dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014800165520221700313592002802530650001802558650001302576650001302589650001202602650001502614650001402629650001502643651001002658653001802668653002102686653003102707653002302738653003002761653001402791700002602805700002702831700002002858700002902878773010402907856008503011852000903096655001203105IND60770700420221121010235.0220411e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077070042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2022.1061212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadr, Raed10aSyn-rift sedimentary response to growth folding along a rift-margin transfer zone: An example from the early Miocene of the Gulf of Suez, Egypt  aGrowth folds developed at rift margin transfer zones are mostly studied for their structural style and stratal architecture. The influence of the growth of these folds on the syn-rift sedimentary facies development, however, remains less documented. To address this, we investigated the syn-rift facies of the Lower Miocene Rudeis Formation in relation to the growth of structures within the North Baba transfer zone at the eastern margin of the Suez rift. Sedimentological analysis defined seven facies associations in three successive depositional systems: (i) gravel-rich submarine fans with up-dip thinning geometry, comprising upper, middle and lower fan facies associations, (ii) a gravitationally modified Gilbert-type fan delta, with tangential foreset and bottomset. Both fan systems pass gradationally into basinal marl-dominated facies, and (iii) shoreface-to-offshore. Paleocurrent measurements and the spatial facies variability indicate that the North Baba transfer zone was acting as the main sediment fairway conveying the sediments southwards from the adjacent rift shoulder to the Baba hangingwall syncline. Mapping of key stratal surfaces and growth structures helped in distinguishing four lower Rudeis stratal units, which provide a framework for studying the spatial and vertical relationships among the recognized facies. Deposition of these stratal units was influenced by progressive steepening and localized faulting of a fault-tip growth monocline above the North Baba transfer zone and a submerged intrabasinal high. These structures controlled the hangingwall gradient, bathymetry, flow pathways and facies relations, triggered multiple gravity flows and slumps, and created terraces on which patch reefs and localized shoreface deposits intermittently developed. This study reveals that the transfer zone was still acting as growth monocline even during the rift-climax. The coeval deposits were mainly sourced from a hinterland drainage catchment rather than local footwall scarps. They form progressively tilted clastic wedges that onlap and pinch out up-dip toward the growth monocline, unlike those observed at faulted margins where the facies commonly thicken toward the fault.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3adrainage 3ageometry 3agravity 3ahinterland 3asediments 3awatersheds 3aEgypt 0aTransfer zone 0aGrowth monocline 0aGravel-rich submarine fans 0aGilbert-type delta 0aFault-propagation folding 0aSuez rift1 aEl-Barkooky, Ahmed N.1 aEl-Araby, Abdel-Moneim1 aBernhardt, Anne1 aChristie-Blick, Nicholas0 tSedimentary geology.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 432 p.106121-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2022.1061213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011200167300001600279520179700295592002802092650002002120650000902140650001302149650002202162650001002184650001702194650002302211650001102234650001202245650001502257650001502272650001902287653001802306653002502324653001302349653000902362700002002371700001802391700001502409700001602424700001702440700001802457700005802475710002902533773009402562856008402656852000902740655001202749IND60535572220221121014115.0190318e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053557222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.06.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscobar, R.S.10aBetter quality of mother–child interaction at 4 years of age decreases emotional overeating in IUGR girls  ap. 337-342.  aBackground/Objectives: While most “fetal programming” area focused on metabolic disease, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is also associated with a preference for less healthy food. Post-natal factors such as strained maternal–child interactions are equally related to obesogenic eating behaviors. We investigated if IUGR and the quality of the mother/child relationship affect emotional overeating in children. Subjects/Methods: Participants were 196 children from a prospective birth cohort (the MAVAN project). As part of the protocol at 4 years of age, mothers completed the Children Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) and mother–child interactions were scored during a structured task. A GLM adjusted for BMI examined the interaction between the “Atmosphere” score (ATM) task, sex and IUGR on the emotional over-eating domain of the CEBQ. Results: There was a significant interaction of BWR vs. sex vs. ATM (P = .02), with no effects of IUGR, sex or ATM. The model was significant for girls with low ATM scores (B = −2.035, P = .014), but not for girls with high (P = 0.94) or boys with high (P = .27) or low (P = .19) ATM scores. Only in IUGR girls, 48 months emotional over-eating correlated with BMI at that age (r = 0.560, P = 0.013) and predicted BMI in the subsequent years (r = 0.654, P = 0.006 at 60 months and r = 0.750, P = 0.005 at 72 months). Conclusions: IUGR and exposure to a negative emotional atmosphere during maternal–child interactions predicted emotional overeating in girls but not in boys. The quality of mother–infant interaction may be an important target for interventions to prevent emotional overeating and overweight in early development, particularly in girls with a history of IUGR.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3aboys 3achildren 3aearly development 3agirls 3ahealthy diet 3ametabolic diseases 3amodels 3amothers 3aovereating 3aoverweight 3aquestionnaires 0aMaternal care 0aEmotional overeating 0aAppetite 0aIUGR1 aO'Donnell, K.A.1 aColalillo, S.1 aPawlby, S.1 aSteiner, M.1 aMeaney, M.J.1 aLevitan, R.D.1 aSilveira, P.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8626-25192 aMAVAN Study Teameauthor0 tAppetite.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 81 p.337-342dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.06.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003600150245011500186520128800301592002801589650001401617650001201631650001101643650001201654650000701666650001301673650001601686650001101702653001801713653001801731653002101749653001801770653002501788700002701813700002501840700001901865773010501884856008501989852000902074655001202083IND60686382720221119140144.0200405e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068638272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2020.1079642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade la Concepción, Juan García10aMutarotation of aldoses: Getting a deeper knowledge of a classic equilibrium enabled by computational analyses  aThe mutarotation equilibrium, by which reducing carbohydrates exist in solution as the α and β anomers of cyclic (furanoid and pyranoid) structures, along with open-chain (aldehyde and hydrate) forms, and whose ratios are depending on factors such as temperature, pH and solvent, portraits a phenomenon involved in numerous processes of chemical and biological importance. Herein, we have developed a DFT-based rationale that provides a broader landscape for anomerizations and ring-open chain interconversions, together with the pivotal role exerted not only by the aldehyde intermediate (essentially the only acyclic structure taken into account so far), but also the hydrate form (often more abundant at the equilibrium). These calculations reveal a more complex and richer scenario than was thought, and identify different mutarotation mechanisms that hinge on every monosaccharide. It is noteworthy that pyranose-furanose interconversion may actually occur without the intermediacy of open-chain forms. For the aldoses evaluated, namely d-glucose, d-ribose, and d-xylose, all structures involved in mutarotation undergo interconversion pathways, whose energy barriers calculated at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level, are in good agreement with previous experimental measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3aaldoses 3aenergy 3aglucose 3apH 3asolvents 3atemperature 3axylose 0aMutarrotation 0aCarbohydrates 0aDFT calculations 0aIsomerization 0aRing interconversion1 aMartínez, R.

Consequently, it is difficult to obtain a pure population of CTCs. Contamination of CTCs with different types of cells normally found in the circulation is inevitable using present enrichment or depletion techniques. In the present report, we describe a unique method to fluorescently label circulating prostate cancer cells and study their interactions with ECs in a self-assembled flow chamber system. This technique can be further applied to observe interactions between prostate CTCs and any protein of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood cells 3acell lines 3aendothelial cells 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3alymphatic system 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aprostatic neoplasms 3ashear stress1 aBander, Neil H.1 aNanus, David M.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 May 15, , no. 87 p.e51468-e51468dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/514683Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51468/in-vitro-method-to-observe-e-selectin-mediated-interactions-between  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003400137245010900171300001600280520125700296592002801553650001401581650001601595650001301611650001501624650001501639650002401654650001201678650001001690651001801700773009601718856007101814852000901885655001201894IND60518740320221122005227.0160418e198502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051874032DNAL7 a10.2307/19413222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, S.

To test several aspects of this hypothesis, field observations of foraging behavior and laboratory measurements of locomotion costs were made for several species of heteromyids. Neither the field observations nor the laboratory measurements supported predictions generated by the seed—dispersion hypothesis. Locomotion costs of the bipedal—hopping Dipodomys deserti and D. merriami were similar to those predicted for quadrupeds of equal mass. At low speeds, the cost of quadrupedal locomotion was not greater for a small, hopping biped than would be expected for a similar—sized quadruped. Free—living Dipodomys deserti, D. merriami, and Perognathus longimembris spent most of their foraging time either stopped or moving at slow speeds. High—speed locomotion, at which energetic "savings" by bipeds should be greatest, was rare. These results led to the conclusion that the energetic costs of different locomotory modes do not play a major role in resource allocation for Mojave Desert heteromyids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipodomys 3aPerognathus 3aforaging 3alocomotion 3aprediction 3aresource allocation 3arodents 3aseeds 3aMojave Desert0 tEcology.g1985 Feb., v. 66, no. 1 p.220-229dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19413223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245013300131300001200264506002800276520091600304592002801220506003701248650001801285650000901303650002301312650001801335650001101353650001101364650001801375651001401393653002601407653001701433653002001450653001501470700002501485700002001510773009701530852000901627655001201636IND60774349220221207093120.0120126e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077434922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPUJIYANTO, SRI10aIsolation and selection of local isolates of chitinolitic bacteria that potent to biocontrol of larva stadia of Aedes aegypti L.  ap. 5-8.  aResource is Open Access  aThe dengue fever was the most dangerously epidemic in Indonesia, so it is important to prevent the population of Aedes aegypti L.

This research was got many of the local chitinolitic bacteria that had been potential as a biocontrol for Ae. aegypti larva stages. The chitinolitic bacteria were isolated with selective agar medium. The sources of isolates were collected from Central Java and West Java water resources. Selected isolates was done to get the higher chitinolitic activity in mineral water medium. The isolate LMB1-5 was potential as a bioinsecticide for Ae. aegypti larva stages. This isolate decreased 86.7% of the larva population in 7 days.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aagar 3abiological control 3abiopesticides 3achitin 3adengue 3amineral water 3aIndonesia 0achitinolitic bacteria 0adengue fever 0aAedes aegypti L 0abiocontrol1 aKUSDIYANTINI, ENDANG1 aHADI, MOCHAMMAD0 tBiodiversitas.g2008 Jan., v. 9, no. 1 p.5-8dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008800165300001600253520137800269592002801647650003301675650001901708650001901727650001301746650001701759650002201776650001101798650001601809650002001825650001601845650001801861650002301879650001501902650001801917650001401935653000901949653001301958653000801971653000901979653000701988653000901995653000702004653000702011653001202018653000802030653000902038653000902047653000802056653001002064653001002074653000802084653000902092653001202101653000802113653000802121653000802129653000702137653002302144653001302167653002102180653003402201653001902235653002202254700002102276773011902297856008502416852000902501655001202510IND60554253120221122222636.0180904e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055425312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ying10aIntrinsic and extrinsic regulation of cardiac lipoprotein lipase following diabetes  ap. 163-171.  aCardiac lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a pivotal enzyme controlling heart metabolism by providing the majority of fatty acids required by this organ. From activation in cardiomyocytes to secretion to the vascular lumen, cardiac LPL is regulated by multiple pathways, which are altered during diabetes. Hence, dimerization/activation of LPL is modified following diabetes, a process controlled by lipase maturation factor 1. The role of AMP-activated protein kinase, protein kinase D, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, intrinsic factors that regulate the intracellular transport of LPL is also shifted, and is discussed. More recent studies have identified several exogenous factors released from endothelial cells (EC) and adipose tissue that are required for proper functioning of LPL. In response to hyperglycemia, both active and latent heparanase are released from EC to facilitate LPL secretion. Diabetes also increased the expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) in EC, which mediates the transport of LPL across EC. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 secreted from the adipose tissue has the potential to reduce coronary LPL activity. Knowledge of these intrinsic and extrinsic factors could be used develop therapeutic targets to normalize LPL function, and maintain cardiac energy homeostasis after diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aadipose tissue 3acardiomyocytes 3adiabetes 3adimerization 3aendothelial cells 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3aheparan sulfate 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperglycemia 3alipoprotein lipase 3ametabolism 3aproteoglycans 3asecretion 0aAMPK 0aAngptl-4 0aD55 0aD100 0aEC 0aECCM 0aER 0aFA 0aGPIHBP1 0aHAT 0aHSPG 0aLMF1 0aLPL 0aMMP-9 0aPHPLA 0aPKD 0aPPAR 0aSREBP-1 0aSTZ 0aT1D 0aT2D 0aTG 0aLipoprotein lipase 0aDiabetes 0aHeart metabolism 0aPost-translational regulation 0aCardiomyocytes 0aEndothelial cells1 aRodrigues, Brian0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 Feb., v. 1851, no. 2 p.163-171dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245006900160300002000229520137200249592002801621650001601649650001601665650001001681650002001691650001201711650001101723653003701734653001701771653002301788653001801811653001601829700005301845700001301898700001701911700001601928700001601944700001801960700001501978700001801993773014202011856007802153852000902231655001202240IND60746151820221119143402.0210729e20210719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074615182DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c085252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Dezhao10aMagnetoactive Soft Drivers with Radial-Chain Iron Microparticles  ap. 34935-34941.  aMagnetoactive elastomers (MAEs), one kind of typical novel magnetoactive driver applied in the soft robotic area, have become one of the research hotspots as they can provide biologically friendly driving methods with safe, preprogrammed, and easy-to-implement properties. In this study, novel MAEs embedding soft magnetic iron microparticles with radial chains, which can be molded in one piece, achieve 3D deformation, and co-work between multiple MAEs under single homogeneous stimuli, are proposed. Then, two kinds of novel magnetoactive drivers are established based on the proposed MAEs, which can achieve the synchronous pumping behavior of heart and the extension behavior of muscle under applied homogeneous magnetic fields. The experimental data show that (1) for the pumping behavior, the maximum instantaneous flow rate and total pumping volume can reach 200.1 and 52.3 mL/min, respectively, under 120 BPM applied harmonic magnetic field with 0–300 mT amplitude; (2) the muscle extension behavior can achieve a strain of 0.925 without a loading mass and carry a load of 40 times its own weight with a pronounced dynamic movement. It should be emphasized that the behavior of the proposed magnetoactive drivers can be excited by remote homogeneous magnetic fields, and it has great application potential in biomimetic or bioinspired soft driving systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3adeformation 3aheart 3amagnetic fields 3amuscles 3arobots 0amagneticactive elastomers (MAEs) 0asoft drivers 0aradial iron chains 0aheart pumping 0aanisotropic1 aYang, Fan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7362-68621 aGong, Di1 aLin, Zhihong1 aLi, Ruihong1 aQian, Wenbo1 aLi, Chenghong1 aJia, Sheng1 aChen, Hongwei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 19, v. 13, no. 29 p.34935-34941dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c085253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245008200197500002000279520121200299592002801511650002201539650001301561650001501574650001301589700002501602700002401627773012701651856007501778961001301853852000901866655001201875IND60790634020221119182439.0220826s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079063402DNAL7 a10.1002/ael2.200432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenn, Chad J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2644-609710aIntroduction to P‐TRAP software for designing phosphorus removal structures  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhosphorus (P) removal structures are a new best management practice for filtering dissolved P in non‐point drainage from legacy P soils through use of P sorption materials (PSMs). Structures must be designed according to characteristics of the site (hydrology and constraints) and PSMs to be utilized, as well as user‐defined goals (P removal, lifetime, and flow rate), making it a cumbersome process. A freely available P Transport Reduction App (P‐TRAP) allows users to quickly produce a custom design or evaluate a hypothetical or existing structure. The software includes a library of P removal flow‐through curves for many different PSMs conducted under various conditions of inflow P concentration and retention time. Design output includes the necessary PSM mass and orientation, pipe requirement, and a table of annual P removal. The software enables conservationists and engineers to quickly compare cost and efficiency among possible designs. Phosphorus Transport Reduction App (P‐Trap) software is used to evaluate and design site‐specific P removal structures based on (a) user inputs regarding site and P sorption material (PSM) characteristics and (b) P removal performance goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adrainage 3aphosphorus 3asorption1 aFrankenberger, James1 aLivingston, Stanley0 tAgricultural & environmental letters.g2021, v. 6, no. 1 p.e20043-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:26726x2471-96257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ael2.200433Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012900165300001800294500000900312520198800321592002802309650003702337650002202374650002602396650002202422650002302444650001602467650002302483650002002506650001102526650003002537650001802567650001102585650001902596650002802615650004502643650002402688650001702712700001902729700002502748773012302773856008502896852000902981655001202990IND60665278820221118084801.0191228e200107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066527882DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2001.4141268x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Sixin10aIdentification of Molecular Markers Associated with Adult Plant Resistance to Powdery Mildew in Common Wheat Cultivar Massey  ap. 1268-1275.  aepub  aPowdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal (syn. Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici), is one of the major diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Race-specific resistance has been extensively used in wheat breeding programs, even though it is ephemeral. Adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew is more durable than race-specific resistance. The APR to powdery mildew in winter wheat cultivar Massey has remained effective since its release in 1981. A cross was made between Massey and a powdery mildew susceptible cultivar Becker. Powdery mildew severity on F-2 leaves (the second leaf below the flag leaf) of 180 F₂:₃ lines was rated under natural disease pressure in the field. Among 213 RFLP and 139 microsatellite markers surveyed, 88 (41%) and 90 (65%) markers, respectively, detected polymorphism between Becker and Massey. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was used to facilitate the identification of molecular markers associated with APR to powdery mildew. Three quantitative trait loci (QTLs), designated as QPm.vt-1B, QPm.vt-2A, and QPm.vt-2B, were identified with interval mapping. They are located on wheat chromosomes 1B, 2A, and 2B, and, respectively, explained 17, 29, and 11% of the total variation of F₂:₃ lines for powdery mildew resistance. The three QTLs associated with APR to powdery mildew were derived from Massey, and displayed additive gene action. QPm.vt-2B also fits a recessive model for APR to powdery mildew. In a multi-QTL model, the three QTLs explained 50% of the total variation of F₂:₃ lines for APR to powdery mildew. The presence of the three QTLs was confirmed with 97 recombinant inbred (RI) lines, tested for APR to powdery mildew under natural powdery mildew pressure over 3 yr (F₅:₆–F₇:₈ generation). The molecular markers identified in this study have potential for use in marker-assisted selection and pyramiding of genes for resistance to powdery mildew.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3aTriticum aestivum 3aadditive gene effects 3abreeding programs 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3adisease resistance 3agenetic markers 3aleaves 3amarker-assisted selection 3amature plants 3amodels 3apowdery mildew 3aquantitative trait loci 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3avertical resistance 3awinter wheat1 aGriffey, C.

Indeed, concluding an observed change at group level is statistically significant does not necessarily equate this change is meaningful from the perspective of the patient. To help interpret within and/or between group changes in the measure over time, the estimation of the Minimal Important Difference (MID) of the instrument – the smallest value that patients consider as a perceived change – is useful. In the last 30 years, a plethora of methods and estimators have been proposed to derive this MID value using clinical data from sample of patients. MIDs for hundreds of PROs have been estimated, with frequently a substantial variability in the results depending on the method used. Nonetheless, a rigorous assessment of the statistical performances of numerous proposed methods for estimating MIDs by experimental design such as Monte-Carlo study has never been performed. The purpose of this paper is to thoroughly depict a protocol for a large-scale simulation study designed to investigate the statistical performances, especially bias against a true populational value, of the common proposed estimators for MID. This paper depicts how investigated methods and estimators were retained after the conduct of a systematic review, the design of a conceptual model that formally defines what is the true populational MID value and the translation of the conceptual model into a model allowing the simulation of responses of items to a hypothetical PRO at two times of measurement along with the response to a Patient Global Rating of Change at the second time under the constraint of a known true MID value. A statistical analysis plan is depicted in order to conclude if working hypotheses on what could be appropriate MID estimators will be verified. Strengths, assumptions, and limits of the simulation model are exposed. Finally, we show how this protocol could be the basis for fostering future methodological research on the issue of interpreting changes in PRO measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aexperimental design 3apatients 3asimulation models 3asystematic review 0aPatient-Reported Outcomes 0aMinimal Important Difference 0aMinimal Clinically Important Difference 0aPsychometrics 0aSimulation study 0aMonte-Carlo study1 aLeroy, Maxime1 aHardouin, Jean-Benoit0 tMethods.g2022 Aug., v. 204 p.396-409dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2022.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007000175300001200245500001400257520150000271536011201771592002801883650001101911650001101922650001001933650001401943650001101957651001201968651001101980651001201991651001302003700002002016700002102036700001602057700001702073700002502090773009902115856008502214852000902299655001202308IND60704984720221119225123.0200729e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070498472DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2020.17334882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSummers, R.q(Ron),10aScottish-breeding Greenshanks Tringa nebularia do not migrate far  ap. 1-7.  aNAL-light  aCapsule: Scottish-breeding Greenshanks Tringa nebularia migrate largely to Ireland. Aims: To describe the migration timings and determine the non-breeding areas (staging and wintering areas) of Scottish-breeding Greenshanks. Methods: Breeding adult Greenshanks were marked with geolocators and/or unique permutations of colour-rings in Sutherland, northern Scotland. Sightings of the colour-ringed birds and data from geolocators on recaptured birds provided information on the migrations and locations of the non-breeding areas. Results: Scottish-breeding Greenshanks spent the winter mainly in Ireland, with the range also including Wales, southern England and western France. Departure from the breeding grounds, as determined by the geolocators, took place in June and July; the median date for the last day in the breeding area was 16 July. Arrival on the breeding grounds took place in March and April; the median date for the first day back in the breeding area was 7 April. Some birds fed at an estuary close to their territories prior to breeding. There was fidelity to wintering areas, both within and between years. Short-term staging took place during both the southward and northward migrations for some birds, and one bird used the same staging area in different autumns. Members of one pair had separate wintering areas. Conclusions: Scottish-breeding Greenshanks have a short migration, largely to the coasts of Ireland. The migrations involved short-term staging for some birds.  aThe study was supported by the Highland Ringing Group and the Scottish Ornithologists' Club Endowment Fund.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTringa 3aadults 3abirds 3aestuaries 3awinter 3aEngland 3aFrance 3aIreland 3aScotland1 aChristian, Nick1 aEtheridge, Brian1 aRae, Stuart1 aCleasby, Ian1 aPálsson, Snæbjörn0 tBird study.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 67, no. 1 p.1-7dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11668x1944-67057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2020.17334883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245008500169300001600254520193600270592002802206650001102234650002502245650000902270650001402279650001102293650001302304650001602317650002202333650001402355651001502369651001102384651002202395700001402417700002102431700001902452700002002471700001802491700001602509773009602525856008702621852000902708655001202717IND60084101720221120035305.0141101e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008410172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNomikou, P.10aSubmarine volcanoes of the Kolumbo volcanic zone NE of Santorini Caldera, Greece  ap. 135-151.  aThe seafloor northeast of Santorini volcano in Greece consists of a small, elongated rifted basin that has been the site of recent submarine volcanism. This area lies within the Cyclades back-arc region of the present Hellenic subduction zone where the seafloor of the eastern Mediterranean Sea is descending beneath the Aegean microplate. The Cycladic region and the Aegean Sea as a whole are known to be regions of north–south back-arc extension and thinning of continental crust. Nineteen submarine volcanic cones occur within this small rift zone, the largest of these being Kolumbo which last erupted explosively in 1650AD, causing significant damage and fatalities on the nearby island of Santorini. Previous SEABEAM mapping and seismic studies from HCMR indicate that many of the smaller v'olcanic cones have been built above the present seafloor, while others are partly buried, indicating a range of ages for the activity along this volcanic line. None of the cones to the northeast of Kolumbo had been explored in detail prior to a cruise of the E/V Nautilus (NA007) in August 2010. The ROV Hercules was used to explore the slopes, summits and craters of 17 of the 19 centers identified on multibeam maps of the area. Water depths of the submarine volcano's summits ranged from 18 to 450m. In general, the domes/craters northeast of Kolumbo were sediment covered and showed little evidence of recent volcanic activity. Outcrops of volcanic rock were found in the crater walls and slopes of some of the cones but they typically consisted of volcanic fragments of pumice and lava that have been cemented together by biological activity, indicative of the lack of recent eruptions. Geochemical analysis of samples collected on the northeast cones showed evidence of low temperature hydrothermal circulation on the summit and upper flanks in the form of stream-like manganese precipitates emanating from pits and fractures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abioactive properties 3alava 3amanganese 3apumice 3asampling 3atemperature 3avolcanic activity 3avolcanoes 3aAegean Sea 3aGreece 3aMediterranean Sea1 aCarey, S.1 aPapanikolaou, D.1 aCroff Bell, K.1 aSakellariou, D.1 aAlexandri, M.1 aBejelou, K.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2012 June, v. 90-91 p.135-151dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011700171300001600288520117500304592002801479650001901507650001901526650001301545650001201558650001301570650001101583650001901594650000901613650001401622650001401636650001801650650001401668650001401682650002501696650002301721650001401744650000901758651001501767651003101782653002101813653001901834653001901853653001801872653002201890653002501912653001801937653001901955700002101974700002101995700002302016773010902039856008402148852000902232655001202241IND60123584820221121073238.0150325e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012358482DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2014.9019202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Roger F.10aMineral Nutrition in Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer: Wildfire Effects, Species Distinctions, and Temporal Variation  ap. 482-541.  aAn investigation of wildfire effects on mineral nutrition of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.) along with species comparisons of the nutrition of unburned specimens of this pine to those of unburned California white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana [Gord.] Lemm.) were conducted in an eastern Sierran mixed conifer stand.

To address these aims we analyzed trace metals and metalloids (Pb, Cu, Ni, As, Sb, Cr, Co, V, Cd and Zn), as well as Pb isotopes, using XRF, Q-ICP-MS and MC-ICP-MS, respectively in two 40-cm peat sections, spanning the last 600 yr. The temporal increase of metal fluxes from the inception of the Industrial Revolution to the present varies by a factor of 5–50, with peak values found between AD 1930 and 1990. A cluster analysis combined with Pb isotopic composition allows the identification of the main sources of Pb and by inference of the other metals, which indicates that coal consumption and metallurgical activities were the predominant sources of pollution during the last 600 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric deposition 3acadmium 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acoal 3acobalt 3acopper 3aemissions 3aisotopes 3alead 3anickel 3apeat 3apollution 3azinc 2aAtmospherexchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxhistoryxstatistics & numerical data. 2aHistory, 15th Century 2aHistory, 16th Century 2aHistory, 17th Century 2aHistory, 18th Century 2aHistory, 19th Century 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHistory, 21st Century 2aMetalloidsxanalysis 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 3aBelgium 0aBelgium 0aAtmospheric pollution 0aIndustrial Revolution 0aTrace metals 0aLead isotopes 0aMisten bog1 aLe Roux, Gaël,1 aDe Vleeschouwer, François1 aBindler, Richard1 aBlaauw, Maarten1 aPiotrowska, Natalia1 aSikorski, Jaroslaw1 aFagel, Nathalie0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 July, v. 178 p.381-394dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245006900168300001600237520085600253592002801109650001601137650002001153650000901173650001701182650001201199650001501211650001701226650002001243650001301263650002001276653002201296653001801318653000801336653002501344773011801369856008801487852000901575655001201584IND60552635120221119135013.0180830e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055263512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Kui-Yu10aApplication of CdSe quantum dots for the direct detection of TNT  ap. 101-105.  aCdSe quantum dots were synthesized through a simple, green organic-phase method.

Based on the phenomenon of TNT quenched oil-soluble CdSe quantum dot fluorescence, a simple, fast, and direct method of TNT detection was established. Under optimum conditions, the degree of fluorescence quenching of oil-soluble CdSe quantum dots had a good linear correlation with TNT concentration in the 1.0×10⁻⁷–5.0×10⁻⁵mol/L range, and the correlation coefficient was 0.9990.

Aromatic hydroxylation metabolites of pharmaceuticals may be obtained through various synthetic and enzymatic methods Electrochemical oxidation is an alternative with advantages in terms of mild reaction conditions and less hazardous chemicals. In the present study, we report that aromatic hydroxylation metabolites of lidocaine can be readily obtained electrochemically under aqueous acidic conditions at platinum electrodes. Our results show that the dominant N-dealkylation reaction can be suppressed by decreasing the solution pH below 0.5 resulting in selective 3-hydroxylidocaine, which is an in vivo metabolite of lidocaine. Experiments in ¹⁸O labelled water indicated that water is the primary source of oxygen, while dissolved molecular oxygen contributes to a minor extent to the hydroxylation reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDrug metabolism 0aAromatic hydroxylation 0aPt-oxide layer 0aElectrochemical synthesis 0a18O labeled water1 aBischoff, Rainer1 aPermentier, Hjalmar P.0 tElectrochimica acta.g2017 Jan. 10, v. 224 p.636-641dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01627naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005200167300001400219520064500233592002800878650001300906650001500919650002900934650002300963650001400986650001501000650001701015650002201032651000901054700002501063773011001088856008201198852000901280655001201289IND60624229420221123042719.0181202e198209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062422942DNAL7 a10.1177/0145721782008002072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssig, Mary J.12aA Study of Diabetes Educators in OHIO Hospitals  ap. 33-35.  aOver a period of eleven months in 1980, 97% (or 204) of the acute care hospitals in Ohio were visited to assess specific characteristics of diabetes education programs and the educators offering them.

The present research evaluated the compatibility of seed treatments with two other potential management tactics—plant resistance and shallow flooding–by conducting two split‐plot experiments in 2009 and 2011. In both experiments, no substantial antagonism was found among the 3 different tactics. Statistical interactions in these experiments arose from the strong and persistent effects of chlorantraniliprole on larval densities rather than incompatibility of tactics. In 2009, weevil densities differed among varieties and were significantly lower on the cultivar “Jefferson.” In 2011, weevil densities were reduced significantly in shallow‐flooded plots compared to deep‐flooded plots. Significant reductions in weevil numbers by chlorantraniliprole seed treatments, even at application rates 5 fold lower than commercially recommended rates, demonstrated the potential to reduce application rates of this highly potent larvicide. These latter results suggest that future studies on the relationship between chlorantraniliprole seed treatment rate and weevil fitness are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLissorhoptrus oryzophilus 3aapplication rate 3acultivars 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3alarvae 3apopulation 3arice 3aseed treatment 3aUnited States1 aBlouin, David C.1 aStout, Michael J.0 tInsect science.g2015 Oct., v. 22, no. 5 p.679-687dBlackwell Pub.x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.121673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002400163245013000187300001600317500000900333520177000342592002802112650001402140650001302154650001102167650001402178650001802192650002302210650002102233650002302254650002202277650002602299650001402325650001302339651001102352651001902363651001902382700001802401700001502419700001902434773012102453856009702574852000902671655001202680IND60665401720221117011040.0190912e199903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066540172DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183X003900020003x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Esbroeck, G.

Pedigree analysis for cotton (L.) indicates a wide genetic base, which conflicts with other types of distance estimates indicating a narrow genetic base. The objectives of this study were to determine genetic similarity indices from agronomic and morphological traits for ancestral cotton cultivars and to determine their impact on the coefficient of parentage (CP) of recent cultivars. Twelve ancestral and two recent cultivars were grown at three locations (Clayton, NC; Florence, SC; and Stoneville, MS) during 1995 and evaluated for agronomic and fiber properties. Multivariate analysis of agronomic and fiber properties was used to create genetic similarity indices (). There was little agreement between CP and . Several ancestral cultivars developed from the earliest (pre-1800) introductions into the USA were very similar to the most recent (post-1900) introductions from Mexico. This suggested that all the original Mexican introductions were genetically very similar. Changing the assumptions in pedigree analysis to assume the original introductions were related by the average among the ancestral cultivars (= 0.38) decreased the level of diversity in frequently grown modern cultivars from CP = 0.16 to CP = 0.46 but had little effect on the relative ranking of cultivars. This occurred because effects of possible erroneous pedigree assumptions in distant generations became diluted. The high degree of similarity among ancestral cultivars suggests that pedigree-derived genetic distance estimates have overestimated the genetic diversity among today's cultivars but not relative relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium 3abreeding 3acotton 3acultivars 3afiber quality 3agenetic background 3agenetic distance 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic variation 3amultivariate analysis 3aparentage 3apedigree 3aMexico 3aNorth Carolina 3aSouth Carolina1 aBowman, D.

Invasive plants have the potential to disrupt denitrification by altering the environmental conditions that facilitate this process. Great Lakes coastal wetlands are experiencing widespread invasion by highly productive hybrid cattail with largely uncertain biogeochemical effects. Through field and controlled mesocosm studies, we sought to determine the effects of cattail invasion through time on denitrification rates and associated environmental factors in a Great Lakes coastal wetland. In the field, we found that cattail density correlated with increased denitrification and a suite of environmental and plant community characteristics and denitrification rates were positively correlated with NH₄ ⁺, sediment organic matter, reduced water levels, and cattail stand age. Through our controlled mesocosm study, we documented conditions 1- and 5-year following invasion and found that denitrification rates and soil organic matter increased in year 5, and cattail and year-since-invasion altered plant communities and soil NH₄ ⁺. Only a weak correlation between denitrification rates and cattail treatments was noted, however, owing to high replicate variability. Our results indicate that with increasing cattail residence time, one ecosystem service, biodiversity, was negatively impacted, while two other services, denitrification and sediment carbon accumulation, were enhanced. Thus, this highly invaded wetland still provides valuable services to aquatic ecosystems and to society. A holistic perspective is therefore critical when evaluating invasive species impacts in which negative impacts are weighed against other ecosystem services, which may be stimulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3awetlands 3acorrelation 3ahybrids 3awater quality 3aplant communities 3aecosystem services 3asoil organic matter 3aTypha 3aenvironmental factors 3acarbon 3apollution 3ainvasive species 3abiodiversity 3adenitrification 3aaquatic ecosystems 3asociety 3aGreat Lakes 0aorganic matter1 aJankowski, KathiJo1 aGeddes, Pamela1 aLarkin, Daniel J.1 aMonks, Andrew M.1 aTuchman, Nancy C.0 tAquatic sciences.g2014 Oct., v. 76, no. 4 p.483-495dSpringer-Verlagx1015-16217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-014-0348-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05409naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245011900204520358800323592002803911596007903939596005604018650004704074650000804121650002504129650001604154650002304170650000904193650001904202650002204221650001904243650001304262650001004275650001104285650001304296650001604309650001104325650001304336650001804349650001804367650002404385650001404409650001304423650001404436651001104450653001404461653001604475653003204491653002104523700001604544700001604560700001904576773013104595856008404726852000904810655001204819IND60754866220221118021246.0211026e20210719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075486622DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-20-1721-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElliott, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5754-888110aFirst Report of Leaf Blight Caused by Phytophthora ramorum on Periwinkle (Vinca minor) in Washington State, U.S.A.  aPhytophthora ramorum (Werres, De Cock & Man in’t Veld) was recovered from symptomatic foliage of periwinkle at a botanical garden in Washington (WA) in March 2015. Symptoms were tan-colored lesions with a dark brown margin visible on both surfaces of the leaf and were found on wounds or around leaf margins. Periwinkle is native to Europe and is commonly used for ground cover in ornamental landscapes. It is known to be invasive in U.S. forests near the urban/wildland interface. Potential spread of P. ramorum into WA forests is of regulatory concern, as well as long-distance spread to other states via nursery stock (Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 301.92-2). P. ramorum was isolated from symptomatic foliage by excising leaf pieces 4 to 6 mm in diameter and surface sterilizing in 0.6% sodium hypochlorite followed by two rinses in sterile water. Leaf pieces were plated on PARP medium (Ferguson and Jeffers 1999), and after 2 to 3 days at 20°C, slow-growing dense colonies with coralloid hyphae were isolated onto V8 agar. Colony morphology and chlamydospore production were consistent with descriptions of P. ramorum (Werres et al. 2001), except that the isolate was slower growing and had irregular, non-wild-type morphology (Elliott et al. 2018) compared with other isolates of P. ramorum. ITS and COX1 regions of mycelial DNA were amplified and sequenced to confirm the identity of P. ramorum using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and COX1F1/COX1R1 (Van Poucke et al. 2012). Sequences were submitted to GenBank (accession nos.: ITS, MT031975; COX1, MT031974). BLAST results showed at least 98% similarity with sequences of P. ramorum (ITS, MN540640 [98%]; COX1, EU124920 [100%]) and belonged to the NA1 clonal lineage. Pathogenicity of P. ramorum to periwinkle was confirmed by completing Koch’s postulates. Inoculum was grown on V8 agar plates at 20°C for 2 weeks until sporangia were abundant. A zoospore suspension was produced by flooding plates with 7 ml of sterile water and incubating for 2 h at 5°C followed by an additional hour at 24°C. Zoospores were observed under the microscope, quantified with a hemocytometer, and then diluted to 2 × 10⁵ zoospores/ml. A 10-µl droplet of inoculum was placed at one wounded and one unwounded site on six leaves on each of four plants. In addition, a set of four plants was inoculated by dipping foliage on one branch per plant into the zoospore suspension for 30 s. A set of four control plants were mock inoculated in the same manner using sterile water. The trial was repeated once. Inoculated plant materials were incubated in a moist chamber for 3 to 5 days, and free moisture was present on foliage upon removal. Plants were held in a biocontainment chamber (USDA-APHIS permit no. 65857) at 20°C and symptom development assessed after 7 days. Symptoms developed on foliage inoculated using both methods in both trials. P. ramorum was isolated once from droplet-inoculated foliage at a wounded site on one plant. Reisolation onto PARP and then V8 agar was conducted from surface-sterilized symptomatic tissue and the presence of P. ramorum confirmed by observation of colony morphology and chlamydospore production. The presence of P. ramorum was also confirmed with DNA extraction from symptomatic foliage from plants from each of the two trials followed by PCR and sequencing of the COX1 gene (EU124920, 100%). None of the water-inoculated controls were positive for P. ramorum. Low isolation success could be attributed to reduced pathogenicity due to being a non-wild-type isolate.  aPublisher supplied data  a1019284cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, McIntire-Stennis  aAP17PPQSaT00C070cUSDA APHIS Cooperative Agreement 3aAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service 3aDNA 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3aVinca minor 3aWashington (state) 3aagar 3abiocontainment 3abotanical gardens 3achlamydospores 3adroplets 3agenes 3ahyphae 3ainoculum 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3amycelium 3anursery stock 3apathogenicity 3asodium hypochlorite 3asporangia 3awildland 3azoospores 3aEurope 0aoomycetes 0aornamentals 0aherbaceous/flowering plants 0ainvasive species1 aRollins, L.1 aBourret, T.1 aChastagner, G.0 tPlant disease.g2021 July 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2023-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-08-20-1721-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011900207520102600326592002801352650000801380650000801388650002901396650001401425650001901439650003301458650001201491650002501503650001601528650002601544650001101570653001101581653002401592653002201616653002801638653001201666653002001678700002001698700002001718773011701738856008201855852000901937655001201946IND60736480320221119151738.0211219e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073648032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mec.2021.e001722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKealey, James T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1227-262310aIdentification of a lichen depside polyketide synthase gene by heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  aLichen-forming fungi produce a variety of secondary metabolites including bioactive polyketides. Advances in DNA and RNA sequencing have led to a growing database of new lichen gene clusters encoding polyketide synthases (PKS) and associated ancillary activities. Definitive assignment of a PKS gene to a metabolic product has been challenging in the lichen field due to a lack of established gene knockout or heterologous gene expression systems. Here, we report the reconstitution of a non-reducing PKS gene from the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea and successful heterologous expression of the synthetic lichen PKS gene in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that P. furfuracea PFUR17_02294 produces lecanoric acid, the depside dimer of orsellinic acid, at 360 mg/L in small-scale yeast cultures. Our results unequivocally identify PFUR17_02294 as a lecanoric acid synthase and establish that a single lichen PKS synthesizes two phenolic rings and joins them by an ester linkage to form the depside product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3adatabases 3agene targeting 3aheterologous gene expression 3alichens 3apolyketide synthases 3apolyketides 3asecondary metabolites 3ayeasts 0aLichen 0aPolyketide synthase 0aSynthetic biology 0aHeterologous expression 0aDepside 0aNatural product1 aCraig, James P.1 aBarr, Philip J.0 tMetabolic Engineering Communications.g2021 Dec., v. 13 p.e00172-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23270x2214-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mec.2021.e001723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002300186245010800209300001600317500001500333506007600348520113800424592002801562506003701590650001501627650001901642650001001661650001201671650001401683650001501697650002001712650001601732650001701748650001101765650001701776650002001793650002101813650001501834650001301849650001101862650001401873650001801887650002301905650003201928650002001960650002201980653001602002700001502018773011502033856004802148852000902196655001202205IND4474150620221207120022.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447415062DNAL7 a215378932pmid7 aPMC31736312pmcid7 a10.1007/s12010-011-9249-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Terrence R.10aTurnover of Carbohydrate-Rich Vegetal Matter During Microaerobic Composting and After Amendment in Soil  ap. 270-278.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe propose that microaerobic composting (MC) can be used to decompose vegetal matter with a short turnover time and large carbon (C) recycling potential. We used a novel method for measuring the degree of fragmentation of water-insoluble acid-soluble (WIAS) polysaccharides as a proxy in tracking their relative degree of degradation (i.e., fragmentation endpoint index). Oak leaves and food scrap processed by MC reached a fragmentation end point within 2 weeks. After amending the MC products into soil, the half-life of the polysaccharide residues was ~6–7 times longer (~100–110 days) than that measured during MC. The main products given up during MC were volatile organic acids (VOAs), alcohols and soluble carbohydrates in the compost tea, and CO2. These products accounted for about 2% of the initial carbon in the feedstock. Very small amounts of VOAs, particularly butyric acid, were formed in the amended soil. Based on a residence time of materials in fermentors of 2 weeks, a ~100-m3 capacity MC facility could process 2,000–4,000 metric tons of vegetable matter amended in ten hectares of arable land per year.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3avegetables 3acarbon dioxide 3afoods 3aQuercus 3arecycling 3afermenters 3asoil amendments 3amethodology 3aarable soils 3acarbon 3abutyric acid 3apolysaccharides 3acompost extracts 3acomposting 3aalcohols 3aleaves 3ahalf life 2aCarbohydrates 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 0anew methods1 aPopa, Radu0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2011 Sept., v. 165, no. 1 p.270-278dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-011-9249-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012100163300001800284500001900302520159900321592002801920650004401948650003701992650001802029650002202047650001902069650002402088650002402112650001702136650003902153650002802192650001802220650001502238650001502253650001302268650002102281700002602302700002102328700001702349773014102366856007402507852000902581655001202590IND60701246520221121064930.0200710e20200708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070124652DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00881h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabbarwal, Shivesh10aSynthesis of biocompatible, BSA capped fluorescent CaCO₃ pre-nucleation nanoclusters for cell imaging applications  ap. 5729-5744.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNovel, photostable, multicolour fluorescent, highly biocompatible, water soluble, BSA capped pre-nucleation CaCO₃ nanoclusters (FCPN) (∼1.3 nm) are developed using a facile biomineralization process. M. oleifera leaf extract and BSA protein are used as sources of ascorbic acid and capping agent, respectively. The developed FCPN shows fluorescence in the blue, green, and yellow/red region with an average life time of 1.05, 6.23 and 30.60 ns, respectively. The MALDI-MS measurements reveal that these nanoclusters are 16, 50, 73, 222 and 936 molecules big. These FCPN, when incubated (up to 7 days) with MG-63 cells, demonstrate an increase in cell viability percentage with time period as compared to their control samples. Furthermore, these incubated cells were investigated using confocal microscopy to estimate the FCPN diffusion penetration depth using CTCF analysis. It has been observed that blue and green emitting FCPN penetrated 6 μm, whereas red emitting FCPN traversed only 4 μm. The relative quantum yield (Rhodamine 6G = 0.92) of FCPN for green emission was found to be 0.0175 in water. The prepared nanoclusters displayed four months shelf-life. These FCPN were prepared using an environmentally benign, inexpensive, green synthetic route without using toxic reducing agents. Furthermore, the current report discusses the detailed results, obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, MALDI-MS, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-visible, fluorescence spectroscopy, lifetime measurements, electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aascorbic acid 3abiomineralization 3acell viability 3aconfocal microscopy 3aelectron microscopy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescence microscopy 3aleaf extracts 3arhodamines 3ashelf life 3atoxicity 3awater solubility1 aDubey, Ashutosh Kumar1 aPandey, Maneesha1 aKumar, Manoj0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 July 8, v. 8, no. 26 p.5729-5744dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00881h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245015300214300001600367520101600383592002801399650001801427650001801445650001801463650001901481650001801500650001901518650001901537650001901556650002001575650001701595650002201612650003101634650001701665650001601682650000901698650001101707650001901718650001601737700002901753700002401782700002401806700002201830700002701852700003301879773008801912856008502000990002302085852000902108655001202117IND60092911620221123044201.0141103s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009291162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.05.0042doi7 aPMC31568452pmcid7 a216211982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwen, Jennifer L.10aExpression of the inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL2 and the receptors CCR1–3 and CXCR2 in T lymphocytes from mammary tumor-bearing mice  ap. 172-182.  aChemokines and their receptors have been studied in several solid tumor models as mediators of inflammation. In turn, inflammation has been implicated in the promotion and progression of tumors, and as such, chemokines have been proposed as novel molecular targets for chemotherapy. While the expression of these molecules has been described in tumor cells, endothelial cells, macrophages and neutrophils, less attention has been paid to the expression profile of these molecules by T lymphocytes in the periphery or infiltrating the tumor. Using the D1-DMBA-3 murine mammary adenocarcinoma model, we aimed to better characterize the differential expression of chemokines and/or their receptors in the host and in the tumor microenvironment, and specifically, in the T cells of tumor-bearing mice compared to normal control animals. We found that T lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice express the pro-inflammatory chemokines, CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL2, as well as the chemokine receptors, CCR1, CCR2, CCR3 and CXCR2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCCR1 receptor 3aCCR2 receptor 3aCCR3 receptor 3aCXCR2 receptor 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadenocarcinoma 3achemokine CCL2 3achemokine CCL5 3achemokine CXCL2 3adrug therapy 3aendothelial cells 3agene expression regulation 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneutrophils1 aCriscitiello, Michael F.1 aLibreros, Stephania1 aGarcia-Areas, Ramon1 aGuthrie, Kathleen1 aTorroella-Kouri, Marta1 aIragavarapu-Charyulu, Vijaya0 tCellular immunology.g2011, v. 270, no. 2 p.172-182dElsevier Inc.x0008-87497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2011.05.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245008800177520178500265592002802050650002002078650002502098650002402123650002802147650001602175650001802191650001902209650002002228650001002248650001202258650001502270650001002285650001002295650002302305650001502328650001302343650002702356651001102383653002202394653002402416653002702440653001402467653002002481700002902501700003902530700003302569773010902602856008302711852000902794655001202803IND60736480420221119151400.0211114e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073648042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2021.1006732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNogueira, Thayane Sabino10aDifferent types of packaging influence sensory profile of Canastra artisanal cheese  aArtisanal cheeses have been highly appreciated by consumers, and have an important social, economic and cultural significance in Brazil. However, problems related to the chemical and sensory changes resulted from the microorganisms metabolism during the storage have been pointed. Product shelf-life and quality can be influenced by the product packaging. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the influence of different types of packaging on the sensory profile of Canastra artisanal minas cheese; and associate its sensory profile to the main bacterial groups present in the cheeses under each type of packaging. Cheeses from a same batch with 14 days of maturation were packed in VACUUM, NYLON MESH, BUTTER PAPER, PVC FILM and without packaging until 22 days of maturation. Cheese`s Sensory profile and Microbial diversity were evaluated. Packaging used in Minas artisanal Canastra cheese maturation promoted different sensory attributes. PREMAT and BUTTER PAPER were the preferred samples, followed by the cheeses submitted to VACUUM PACKAGING, NYLON MESH, and PVC FILM. POSTMAT was less preferred. However, all samples had good acceptances. attributes such as sour flavor, mild flavor, butter flavor, farm flavor, salty, cured, compacted and soft drove the PREMAT acceptance. Moreover, this sample presented Lactococcus sp (OTU24), Corynebacterium sp (OTU25), Lactobacillus plantarum (OTU26), Streptococcus sp (OTU27), Lactobacillus plantarum (OTU28), Lactobacillus brevis (OTU22) and Lactobacillus casei (OTU13). Although the different sensory profile provided by the different packages, everyone showed to have market potential. The results of this study provide important information for the artisanal cheese producers focusing on product quality improvement and conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactococcus 3aStreptococcus 3aartisan cheese 3acheese ripening 3afarms 3amarkets 3ametabolism 3anylon 3apaper 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3asourness 3atraditional technology 3aBrazil 0aCheese maturation 0aMicrobial diversity 0aMinas artisanal cheese 0aPackaging 0aSensory aspects1 aLacorte, Gustavo Augusto1 aPaciulli, Sônia Duque de Oliveira1 aRodrigues, Jéssica Ferreira0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2021 June, v. 28 p.100673-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2021.1006733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010500163300001200268520152600280592002801806596005901834596005901893650002401952650000801976650002201984650001302006650001702019650001802036650001902054650001602073650002302089650002602112650001302138650003102151650002102182650002402203650001202227650002302239650002102262650002502283650005202308650001802360650002202378650001702400651001002417700001602427700001502443700005502458773011702513856008302630852000902713655001202722IND60694136220221120192535.0200612e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069413622DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-020-02228-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ruiyun14aThe complete genome sequence of Bacillus velezensis LPL061, an exopolysaccharide-producing bacterium  ap. 243.  aBacillus velezensis LPL061, which shows strong exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing capacity, was isolated from carnations in Beijing, China. The complete genome of LPL061 comprised a single circular chromosome (3,907,268 bp; G+C content of 46.7%) with 3,737 coding DNA sequences, 26 rRNA, and 89 tRNA. According to genome analysis, 12 protein-coding genes which related to polysaccharide biosynthesis in LPL061 were identified. Comparative genome analysis revealed that the EPS biosynthetic gene cluster was relatively conserved among Bacillus species. EPS showed approximately 60% inhibitory activity on the α-glucosidase at 100 μg/mL. The results of quantitative reverse transcription PCR further demonstrated that compared to insulin-resistant model with insulin (500 μg/mL) (without EPS treatment), the insulin-resistant HepG2 cells treated with EPS decreased the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) from 4.425 to 0.1587, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) decreased from 4.272 to 0.1929, and glycogen synthase kinase3β (GSK(3)β) decreased from 2.451 to 0.993, respectively. Meanwhile, EPS treatment increased GS expression and resulted in intracellular glycogen concentration increased from 28.30% to 86.48%, which further supported that EPS form LPL061 could reduce the concentration of blood glucose effectively. These results could be beneficial for better understanding of the hypoglycemic mechanism of B. velezensis LPL061 EPS and developing an EPS-based anti-diabetic agent in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a31671831cNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province  a31271827cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aBacillus velezensis 3aDNA 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3ablood glucose 3acarboxy-lyases 3achromosomes 3aexopolysaccharides 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3aglycogen 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3ahuman cell lines 3ahypoglycemic agents 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amultigene family 3anucleotide sequences 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3atransfer RNA 3aChina1 aQin, Yuxuan1 aShen, Qian1 aLi, Pinglan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0130-10700 t3 Biotech.g2020 June, v. 10, no. 6 p.243-243dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02228-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011900158300001800277500001900295520131900314592002801633650001401661650001501675650002101690650002301711650001901734650001901753650002101772650001801793650001201811650001801823650002601841650001401867650002701881650003201908650001301940700001701953700001801970700001701988700001502005700001902020700001802039700001402057700001702071700001402088700002202102700001702124700001702141700001902158773014102177856007402318852000902392655001202401IND60701246620221121065119.0200710e20200708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070124662DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00892c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Jong-Woo10aCo-delivery of antigens and immunostimulants via a polymersome for improvement of antigen-specific immune response  ap. 5620-5626.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCellular uptake of antigens (Ags) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is vital for effective functioning of the immune system. Intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of vaccine Ags alone is not sufficient to elicit optimal immune responses. Thus, adjuvants are required to induce strong immunogenicity. Here, we developed nanoparticulate adjuvants that assemble into a bilayer spherical polymersome (PSome) to promote the cellular uptake of Ags by APCs. PSomes were synthesized by using a biodegradable and biocompatible block copolymer methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(d,l-lactide) to encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic biomacromolecules, such as ovalbumin (OVA) as a model Ag and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as an immunostimulant. After co-encapsulation of OVA and MPLA, the PSome synthetic vehicle exhibited the sustained release of OVA in cell environments and allowed efficient delivery of cargos into APCs. The administration of PSomes loaded with OVA and MPLA induced the production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha cytokines by macrophage activation in vitro and elicited effective Ag-specific antibody responses in vivo. These findings indicate that the nano-sized PSome may serve as a potent adjuvant for vaccine delivery systems to modulate enhanced immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3abiodegradability 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrophilicity 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunostimulants 3ainterleukin-6 3alipid A 3alipophilicity 3amacrophage activation 3aovalbumin 3asubcutaneous injection 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccines1 aNa, Woonsung1 aKim, Hyun-Ouk1 aYeom, Minjoo1 aKang, Aram1 aPark, Geunseon1 aPark, Chaewon1 aKi, Jisun1 aLee, Sojeong1 aJung, Bud1 aJeong, Hyoung Hwa1 aPark, Daewon1 aSong, Daesub1 aHaam, Seungjoo0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 July 8, v. 8, no. 26 p.5620-5626dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00892c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011000163300001600273520196200289592002802251650001702279650001302296650001802309650001702327650001102344650001002355700001902365700001402384700002002398773009102418856008102509852000902590655001202599IND60081720220221120144748.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008172022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-014-0351-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibi, J.-M.10aAttractiveness of a lateral shelter in a channel as a refuge for juvenile brown trout during hydropeaking  ap. 527-541.  aPeak power production in hydroelectric storage power plants results in frequent and intense flow variations in the rivers downstream of the plants. Fish populations can be negatively impacted when subjected to these so-called hydropeaking phenomena. In researching mitigation solutions, shelters in the riverbanks of channelized rivers have been identified as a means of protecting fish from excessive flow velocities. These shelters were studied systematically using juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) in an experimental configuration in which a straight channel was equipped with a lateral embayment. The purpose of the experiments was to generate hydrodynamic hydropeaking conditions in the channel that are undesirable for juvenile trout, thereby causing them to enter the shelter. The flow velocity distribution in the intersection plane between the main channel and the lateral shelter was found to be a significant parameter for attracting fish to the shelter. The utilization rate of trout in the shelter was used as a performance indicator. Using a basic rectangular shelter configuration without forced water exchange between the shelter and the channel, the utilization rate was only 35 %. This rate was more than doubled by introducing a deviation groyne to force water exchange between the channel and the shelter. The position and orientation angle of this groyne were systematically varied to maximize the utilization rate. Maximum utilization rates approaching 90 % were obtained for an optimum configuration in which an island-type groyne was placed in the shelter. The results of the systematic channel tests showed the potential of the shelter to attract fish. Such a shelter could be used in channelized rivers both for morphological revitalization and to improve fish habitats. As a next step in this research, prototype shelters will be built on a natural river and monitored for 2–3 years under a hydropeaking flow regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 3apower plants 3arivers 3atrout1 aBoillat, J.-L.1 aPeter, A.1 aSchleiss, A.

Determining how to allocate resources for food is a decision making process influenced by executive functions. Attention to appetitive cues, as well as working memory capacity, or the ability to flexibly control attention while mentally retaining information, may be important executive functions involved in food purchasing decisions. In two studies, we examined how attention bias to food and working memory capacity are related to reinforcing efficacy of both high energy-dense and low energy-dense foods. The first study examined 48 women of varying body mass index (BMI) and found that the relationship between attentional processes and reinforcing efficacy was moderated by working memory capacity. Those who avoid food cues and had high working memory capacity had the lowest reinforcing efficacy, as compared to those with low working memory capacity. Study 2 systematically replicated the methods of study 1 with assessment of maintained attention in a sample of 48 overweight/obese adults. Results showed the relationship between maintained attention to food cues and reinforcing efficacy was moderated by working memory capacity. Those with a maintained attention to food and high working memory capacity had higher reinforcing efficacy than low working memory capacity individuals. These studies suggest working memory capacity moderated the relationship between different aspects of attention and food reinforcement. Understanding how decision making process are involved in reinforcing efficacy may help to identify future intervention targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody mass index 3adecision making 3aenergy intake 3afood prices 3afood purchasing 3afood reinforcement 3afoods 3amemory 3aobesity 3apurchasing 3awomen 0aFood reinforcement 0aWorking memory 0aAttentional bias1 aEpstein, Leonard H.0 tAppetite.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 116 p.268-276dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245008400185300001400269520167900283592002801962650001501990650002902005650001002034650001502044650002002059650001602079650000902095650002702104650001402131650002102145650001502166650001202181650001302193650001602206650002802222650002202250650001902272650001202291650000902303650001502312650001002327650007202337650002502409650005402434650002402488650001102512650002902523650002002552650002602572650001102598650002602609650001102635650002902646650002002675650005302695650001402748650005702762650003602819650005302855650001502908650001602923700001902939700002402958700002302982773008003005856008103085852000903166655001203175IND4446557220221120051027.0141112e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444655722DNAL7 a203813132pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2009.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBánhidy, Ferenc10aIron deficiency anemia: Pregnancy outcomes with or without iron supplementation  ap. 65-72.  aOBJECTIVE: To estimate the efficacy of iron supplementation in anemic pregnant women on the basis of occurrence of pregnancy complications and birth outcomes. METHODS: Comparison of the occurrence of medically recorded pregnancy complications and birth outcomes in pregnant women affected with medically recorded iron deficiency anemia and iron supplementation who had malformed fetuses/newborns (cases) and who delivered healthy babies (controls) in the population-based Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance System of Congenital Abnormalities. RESULTS: Of 22 843 cases with congenital abnormalities, 3242 (14.2%), while of 38 151 controls, 6358 (16.7%) had mothers with anemia. There was no higher rate of preterm births and low birth weight in the newborns of anemic pregnant women supplemented by iron. However, anemic pregnant women without iron treatment had a significantly shorter gestational age at delivery with a somewhat higher rate of preterm births but these adverse birth outcomes were prevented with iron supplementation. The rate of total and some congenital abnormalities was lower than expected and explained mainly by the healthier lifestyle and folic acid supplements. The secondary findings of the study showed a higher risk of constipation-related hemorrhoids and hypotension in anemic pregnant women with iron supplementation. CONCLUSION: A higher rate of preterm birth was found in anemic pregnant women without iron treatment but this adverse birth outcome was prevented with iron supplementation. There was no higher rate of congenital abnormalities in the offspring of anemic pregnant women supplemented with iron and/or folic acid supplements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth rate 3acongenital abnormalities 3afetus 3afolic acid 3agestational age 3ahypotension 3airon 3airon deficiency anemia 3alifestyle 3alow birth weight 3amonitoring 3amothers 3aneonates 3aparturition 3apregnancy complications 3apregnancy outcome 3apregnant women 3aprogeny 3arisk 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxcomplicationsxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCongenital Abnormalitiesxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxpharmacology 2aGestational Age 2aHemorrhoidsxetiology 2aHumans 2aHypotensionxetiology 2aInfant 2aInfant, Low Birth Weight 2aInfant, Newborn 2aIron, Dietaryxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complicationsxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aPregnancy Outcomexepidemiology 2aPremature Birthxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aPrevalence 2aYoung Adult1 aÁcs, Nándor,1 aPuhó, Erzsébet H.1 aCzeizel, Andrew E.0 tNutrition.g2011 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.65-72dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2009.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245009600199300001600295500002000311520120000331592002801531596005901559596005901618650001601677650002001693650001601713650001401729650001801743650001301761650001101774650001501785650001001800650001201810650001301822650001101835700002201846700002001868700002101888700002001909773011601929856007302045852000902118655001202127IND60631681920221119045425.0190312e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063168192DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.156102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Yan‐Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4512-059410aBICELLULAR POLLEN 1 is a modulator of DNA replication and pollen development in Arabidopsis  ap. 588-603.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDuring male gametogenesis in Arabidopsis, the haploid microspore undergoes an asymmetric division to produce a vegetative and a generative cell, the latter of which continues to divide symmetrically to form two sperms. This simple system couples cell cycle with cell fate specification. Here we addressed the role of DNA replication in male gametogenesis using a mutant bicellular pollen 1 (bice1), which produces bicellular, rather than tricellular, pollen grains as in the wild‐type plant at anthesis. The mutation prolonged DNA synthesis of the generative cell, which resulted in c. 40% of pollen grains arrested at the two‐nucleate stage. The extended S phase did not impact the cell fate of the generative cell as shown by cell‐specific markers. BICE1 encodes a plant homolog of human D123 protein that is required for G1 progression, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we showed that BICE1 interacts with MCM4 and MCM7 of the pre‐replication complex. Consistently, double mutations in BICE1 and MCM4, or MCM7, also led to bicellular pollen and condensed chromosomes. These suggest that BICE1 plays a role in modulating DNA replication via interaction with MCM4 and MCM7.  aPublisher supplied data  a31330053cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31570320cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA replication 3achromosomes 3aflowering 3agametogenesis 3ahaploidy 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3amales 3amutants 3amutation 3apollen1 aXie, Dong‐Jiang1 aZhao, Yan‐Yan1 aShi, Dong‐Qiao1 aYang, Wei‐Cai0 tnew phytologist.g2019 Apr., v. 222, no. 1 p.588-603dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.156103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01369naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008400165300001400249520043500263592002800698650003200726650001300758650001400771650002100785650002700806650001500833650001800848773010900866856008300975852000901058655001201067IND60624229920221123031753.0190614e198301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062422992DNAL7 a10.1177/0145721783008004082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzo, Nancy10aPhysical Therapy Management of Diabetics Undergoing Lower Extremity Amputations  ap. 24-29.  aThe Rehabilitation Team at New Eng land Deaconess Hospital includes the surgical and medical attendees, the dressing nurse, physical therapist, and prosthetist.

PANI:PSS with Triton X–100, a nonionic surfactant, showed enhanced hole transport capability due to improved wetting on the substrate and a surface compositional change. The surfactant lowered the surface tension of a PANI:PSS aqueous solution, which enabled uniform casting of PANI:PSS films onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate without any surface treatment. Additionally, self-organization of PSS nanogranules, induced by the surfactant, provided PANI-rich surfaces that were favorable for hole extraction. When surfactant-modified PANI:PSS (1.0wt% Triton X–100) was used as an HTM in a PSC, the average short-circuit current density increased by 23% compared with pristine PANI:PSS (i.e., from 15.02 to 18.43mA/cm²) and the fill factor also improved, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency enhancement from 6.59 to 10.90%.  aPublisher supplied data 0aperovskite solar cells 0aconducting polymers 0ahole transport materials 0apolyaniline 0asurfactants1 aCho, Kyung Hee1 aRyu, Jaehoon1 aYun, Juyoung1 aYu, Haejun1 aLee, Jungsup1 aNa, Wonjoo1 aJang, Jyongsik0 tElectrochimica acta.g2017 Jan. 10, v. 224 p.600-607dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245013400186300001600320520101600336592002801352650002001380650002401400650002001424650001201444650001501456650001001471650000901481650001601490650002901506650004701535650002901582650002001611650002901631653001601660653002601676653001001702653001601712653003101728653002101759653001201780700002101792700001901813700002101832773008901853856008401942852000902026655001202035IND60086740820221121062359.0160903e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008674082DNAL7 a236243392pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoseph, John10aApplication of validation data for assessing spatial interpolation methods for 8-h ozone or other sparsely monitored constituents  ap. 411-418.  aThe adverse health effects of high concentrations of ground-level ozone are well-known, but estimating exposure is difficult due to the sparseness of urban monitoring networks. This sparseness discourages the reservation of a portion of the monitoring stations for validation of interpolation techniques precisely when the risk of overfitting is greatest. In this study, we test a variety of simple spatial interpolation techniques for 8-h ozone with thousands of randomly selected subsets of data from two urban areas with monitoring stations sufficiently numerous to allow for true validation. Results indicate that ordinary kriging with only the range parameter calibrated in an exponential variogram is the generally superior method, and yields reliable confidence intervals. Sparse data sets may contain sufficient information for calibration of the range parameter even if the Moran I p-value is close to unity. R script is made available to apply the methodology to other sparsely monitored constituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3akriging 3amonitoring 3aozone 3arisk 3aurban areas 2aAir Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aAir Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aOzonextoxicity 2aSpatio-Temporal Analysis 0aAir quality 0aSpatial interpolation 0aOzone 0aOverfitting 0aInverse distance weighting 0aNearest neighbor 0aKriging1 aSharif, Hatim O.1 aSunil, Thankam1 aAlamgir, Hasanat0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 July, v. 178 p.411-418dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015600172300001400328520148600342592002801828650002701856650002601883650001601909650001001925650001601935650001901951650001401970650002501984650001802009653000802027653000702035653000702042653000902049653000802058653000702066653000802073653001602081653001402097653001402111653001302125653000902138700002502147700002002172700001902192700002002211700002102231700003402252700002202286700002502308773012402333856008402457852000902541655001202550IND60542610620221121161817.0190405e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054261062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2013.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlauzet, Corentine10aMultilocus analysis reveals diversity in the genus Tissierella: Description of Tissierella carlieri sp. nov. in the new class Tissierellia classis nov.  ap. 23-34.  aThe genus Tissierella and its relatives Tepidimicrobium, Soehngenia and Sporanaerobacter comprise anaerobic Gram-positive bacilli classified along with Gram-positive cocci in a family with controversial placement designated as incertae sedis XI, in the phylum Firmicutes. We performed a top-down reappraisal of the taxonomy from the phylum to the species level within the genus Tissierella. Reconstruction of high-rank 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenies and their interpretation in a taxonomic purpose allowed defining Tissierellia classis nov. within the phylum Firmicutes while the frames of Tissierellales ord. nov. and Tissierellaceae fam. nov. have to be further strengthened. For species delineation in the genus Tissierella, we studied a population of clinical strains. Beside Tissierella praeacuta, a sub-population of five strains formed a clade in multilocus phylogenies (16S rRNA, cpn60, tpi, recA and spo0A genes). Data such as 16S rRNA gene similarity level, population structure, chromosome organization and murein type indicated that this clade corresponded to a novel species for which the name Tissierella carlieri sp. nov. is proposed, with type strain LBN 295T=AIP 268.01T=DSM 23816T=CCUG 60010T. Such an approach, associating a phylogenetic reappraisal of high-level taxonomic ranks with weak taxonomic structure and a population study for genus and species delineation is needed to strengthen the taxonomic frame of incertae sedis groups in the phylum Firmicutes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aTissierella praeacuta 3achromosomes 3agenes 3anew species 3apeptidoglycans 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3aribosomal RNA 0aBBA 0aCC 0aML 0aMLSA 0aOTU 0aST 0aTGY 0aTissierella 0aDiversity 0aPhylogeny 0aTaxonomy 0aMLSA1 aMarchandin, Hélène1 aCourtin, Pascal1 aMory, Francine1 aLemée, Ludovic1 aPons, Jean-Louis1 aChapot-Chartier, Marie-Pierre1 aLozniewski, Alain1 aJumas-Bilak, Estelle0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2014 Feb., v. 37, no. 1 p.23-34dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2013.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013300167300001800300520180200318592002802120650002302148650001402171650001102185650002502196650001402221650002502235650001402260650002002274650001102294650001202305650001902317650002402336650002502360651001102385651001502396651002302411700002602434700002102460773012002481856008102601852000902682655001202691IND60627256620221120142005.0190128e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062725662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0395-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarko, Peter B.10aMtDNA population structure and gene flow in lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus): limited connectivity despite long-lived pelagic larvae  ap. 1301-1311.  aLingcod, Ophiodon elongatus Girard, have a 3-month pelagic larval stage and are an important recreational and commercial species on the west coast of North America. Cytochrome-c oxidase I sequences from tissue samples were used to characterize population structure and infer patterns of gene flow from California to Alaska. No significant genetic structure was found when estimates of Wright’s FST (i.e., ΦST) were generated among all populations sampled. Nesting populations within regions, however, indicated that the inner coast of Washington State is distinct, a result corroborating previous allozyme work. Coalescent-based estimates of gene flow indicate that although migration can be high from an evolutionary perspective, nearly half of all comparisons among populations showed no gene flow in at least one direction. From an ecological perspective, moderate migration rates (Nm < 10) among most populations provide surprisingly limited connectivity at large (∼ 1,000 km) and small (∼100 km) spatial scales. Coalescent-based estimates also show that gene flow between the inner and the outer coasts is asymmetric, a result consistent with prevailing surface currents. Because the expected inter-locus variances for coalescent-based estimates of gene flow are likely large, future work will benefit from analyses of nuclear DNA markers. However, limited demographic connectivity on large spatial scales may help explain why stock recovery has been uneven, with greater recovery in the northern (87% rebuilt) than in the southern (24% rebuilt) fishery region, supporting a regional management strategy. These results suggest that despite a 3-month pelagic larval stage, some areas may be effectively closed with respect to both population dynamics and fishery management issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOphiodon elongatus 3aallozymes 3acoasts 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3alarvae 3anesting 3anuclear genome 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation structure 3aAlaska 3aCalifornia 3aWashington (state)1 aRogers-Bennett, Laura1 aDennis, Alice B.0 tMarine biology.g2007 Mar., v. 150, no. 6 p.1301-1311dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-006-0395-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245008000167300001800247500000900265520161500274592002801889650002001917650001201937650002801949650001401977650001101991650001002002650001202012650001902024650002002043650002202063650000902085650001902094650001402113650000902127650001202136650004702148700002002195700002202215700003102237700001902268700002402287773012302311856008102434852000902515655001202524IND60665279820221118084813.0191228e200111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066527982DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2001.16822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForapani, Silvia10aComparison of Hemp Varieties Using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Markers  ap. 1682-1689.  aepub  aThe objective was to study the genetic structure and degree of variability of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) varieties. Six varieties of hemp were analyzed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, using 10 plants per variety. The varieties were a dioecious landrace, a dioecious selection from it, a cross-bred cultivar, a monoecious variety, a drug strain, and an inbred female line. The genetic complexity of each cultivar was investigated by determining the number of bands produced by the primers used, the number of fixed and polymorphic loci, the average allele frequency, and the heterozygosity. A good correlation was found between these parameters and the genetic origin and breeding strategy of each variety. The average polymorphism over all varieties and loci was 97.1%; the single cultivar polymorphism ranged from 31.1 to 85.5%. Heterozygosity ranged from 0.05 (inbred female line) to 0.26 (cross-bred Fibranova). The average heterozygosity calculated over all 102 loci and all plants studied was 0.29. The Fst (Wright's fixation index) value calculated for all loci was 0.48, and only 33.3% of the scored loci had higher values and can be considered informative for cultivar identification. A Fisher's test based on allele frequencies suggested complete differentiation among all varieties, with the exception of the Italian dioecious varieties Carmagnola and CS, for which no discriminating alleles were found. The correlations among the molecular data and the genetic structure of the different cultivars and the consequences in relation to variety discrimination in hemp are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3aalleles 3acultivar identification 3acultivars 3adioecy 3adrugs 3afemales 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3agenetic structure 3ahemp 3aheterozygosity 3alandraces 3aloci 3amonoecy 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique1 aCarboni, Andrea1 aPaoletti, Claudia1 aMoliterni, V.

However, little is known about the involvement of miR-150 in human sepsis. In this study, plasma miR-150 level had a diagnostic and independent prognostic value in patients with sepsis, and negatively correlated with renal dysfunction and 28-day survival as well as plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). MiR-150 expression was also significantly decreased in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and C57BL/6 mice with sepsis after lipopolysaccharides (LPS) treatment. In-vitro, miR-150 over-expression protected HUVECs from LPS-induced apoptosis and the expressions of nuclear factor-κB1 (NF-κB1), IL-6, TNF-α, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin. Furthermore, NF-κB1 was identified as a direct target of miR-150. Restored NF-κB1 expression antagonized the protective effects of miR-150, while suppression of NF-κB1 enhanced these protective effects. Our findings indicate miR-150 predicts survival in patients with sepsis and inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory factors and apoptosis by targeting NF-κB1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Thus, miR-150 may be a useful biomarker or target in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of patients with sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautoimmune diseases 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenesis 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amice 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aprotective effect 3asepsis (infection) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avascular cell adhesion molecules 0aMiR-150 0aNF-κB1 0aSepsis 0aHUVECs1 aLiu, Yanni1 aHou, Huihui1 aYao, Yanfen1 aMeng, Hua0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 June 07, v. 500, no. 3 p.828-837dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245007900173300001600252520173400268592002802002650001102030650001802041650001202059650002902071650001802100650001802118650002902136650001302165650001802178650002302196650001702219650001302236650001002249650002102259650001802280653001002298653001802308653001802326653002002344653002202364700002202386700002302408700002402431773012502455856008302580852000902663655001202672IND60532405320221116174044.0190318e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053240532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2014.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaral, Khagendra Raj10aControls of nitrous oxide emission after simulated cattle urine deposition  ap. 103-110.  aUrine deposited during grazing is a significant source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O). The potential for N2O emissions from urine patches is high, and a better understanding of controls is needed. This study investigated soil nitrogen (N) dynamics and N2O emissions from cattle urine, and effects of increasing urinary N to 1000kgNha−1 or delaying nitrification by amendment of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD). Soil N2O concentration profiles and mineral N dynamics were monitored. The study was a randomized block experiment initiated in May 2012, in which urine deposition was simulated in paired field plots to accommodate all measurements. One plot had a pre-installed chamber support for N2O flux measurements. Volumetric water content (VWC) was determined in the same position in both sub-plots, i.e., with and without chamber supports. Plant growth was monitored using ratio vegetation index (RVI). Compared to unamended urine, emissions of N2O were significantly higher with urea-amendment, and lower with DCD amendment, also when expressed as proportions of N applied. Soil mineral N dynamics showed that N2O emissions were closely linked to nitrification activity. There was no close relationship between N2O emissions and concentration profiles of N2O in the soil; instead, emissions were significantly (p<0.05) related to N2O concentrations at 5cm depth. Chamber supports increased water retention in urine-amended soil, but not in reference soil. Based on patterns of mineral N and VWC it is proposed that nutrient retention and higher salinity in the presence of chamber supports increased water retention. This may have implications for the quantification of N2O emissions from urine patches.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3adicyandiamide 3agrazing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amineral soils 3anitrification 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3anutrient retention 3aplant growth 3asalinity 3aurine 3avegetation index 3awater content 0aUrine 0aNitrous oxide 0aDicyandiamide 0aChamber support 0aSoil gas sampling1 aThomsen, Anton G.1 aOlesen, Jørgen E.1 aPetersen, Søren O.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 188 p.103-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013100165300001800296520155000314592002801864650001801892650001101910650001201921650002201933650002601955650001401981650000901995650001902004650002002023650001502043650001402058650001202072650001102084650002702095650002702122650001402149650001202163650001202175650001302187650001502200650001202215650002502227650001302252651001102265651002202276700001502298700002002313700001502333700001702348700001702365773012002382856008102502961000902583852000902592655001202601IND60627256720221120142022.0190128e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062725672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0441-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedgecock, D.10aSmall effective number of parents (Nb) inferred for a naturally spawned cohort of juvenile European flat oysters Ostrea edulis  ap. 1173-1182.  aThe great fecundity and very high larval mortality of most marine invertebrates and fish make possible substantial variance in the number of offspring contributed by adults to subsequent generations. The reproductive success of such organisms may thus resemble a sweepstakes lottery, in which a minority of progenitors succeeds in replacing an entire population, while the majority fails to procreate. One specific prediction of this hypothesis, that genetic diversity of newly settled cohorts should be less than that of the adult population, is tested in the present study. Microsatellite DNA markers were examined in naturally spawned juvenile European flat oysters Ostrea edulis (L.), collected over a 12-day period in 1993 from the western Mediterranean Sea, near Sète, France (43°32′N, 3°56′E) and grown out for a period of up to 10 months. Variation in these juveniles was compared to that in a pooled sample of adults collected in 1994 from two locations (Thau Lagoon and Port St. Louis) that had statistically homogeneous allelic frequencies. Though nearly twice as large as the pooled adult sample, the juvenile sample had only 60% of the adult allelic diversity. Analyses of linkage disequilibrium and kinship, as well as estimation of the effective number of parents, suggested that 10–20 adults produced this juvenile cohort. This observation supports the hypothesis of sweepstakes reproductive success and suggests that partial inbreeding may occur even in species with large populations and dispersing planktonic larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstrea edulis 3aadults 3aalleles 3aallelic variation 3aaquatic invertebrates 3afecundity 3afish 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3ainbreeding 3ajuveniles 3akinship 3alarvae 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amortality 3aoysters 3aparents 3aplankton 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3avariance 3aFrance 3aMediterranean Sea1 aLauney, S.1 aPudovkin, A.

The heritability of leaf cineole concentration at Brookton was ĥ² = 0.50 ± 0.08 and whole-tree cineole yield, ĥ² = 0.11 ± 0.04. The cross-site genetic correlation between Brookton and Monarto was rg = 0.55 ± 0.20, suggesting the presence of some genotype × environment interaction. Removing the six most unstable families resulted in a cross-site genetic correlation of rg = 0.97 ± 0.25. Estimated mean gains from selection scenarios treating Brookton and Monarto as representing two separate environments or as a single environment differed by about 5.0%. The exclusion of six unstable families reduced that difference to 1.4%. Selection on biomass alone may result in a slight increase in total cineole yield per tree but, in this experiment, it resulted in a reduction in mean leaf cineole concentration. Leaf cineole concentration used in conjunction with biomass may be a useful selection criterion in the absence of data for total mass of cineole produced per tree.  aThe project was funded by the Future Farm Industries CRC LTD.

Aims: To test whether two song types could be defined in audio recordings and whether use differed in relation to the paired status of males. Methods: Unattended acoustic recording devices were placed at a Nightjar study site in Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom, and recordings of churring vocalizations were made during two periods of the breeding season. These recordings were then analyzed to identify the presence/absence of the song terminal phrase and associated audible features. Results: Two distinct song types were identified in the recorded audio data that differed in their terminal phrasing and overall song duration. The number of Nightjar songs with a terminal phrase increased significantly between the two sampling periods, from lower levels during the site arrival period, to higher levels during the first clutch initiation period. Conclusion: This study showed that the use of Nightjar song types appears to vary through the breeding season, with males being more likely to produce song with a terminal phrase during the first clutch initiation period, when they are more likely to be paired or in the presence of a female. The unattended acoustic recording method may provide a minimally intrusive means of assessing the number of Nightjar breeding pairs and not just singing males.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaprimulgus europaeus 3aacoustics 3abirds 3afemales 3amales 3aUnited Kingdom1 aLowe, Andrew1 aAbrahams, Carlos0 tBird study.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 67, no. 1 p.119-127dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11668x1944-67057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2020.17804143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245011000162300001600272520116400288592002801452650001601480650001201496650001901508650003001527650001601557650002001573650001101593650001201604650001601616650001801632650001601650650001901666650000901685653001701694653002201711653000901733653001601742653001801758700001501776700001401791700001601805700001701821700001501838700001701853700001701870700001701887700001801904700001401922700002801936700001901964773016101983856008102144852000902225655001202234IND60736480920221119150302.0220228e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073648092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2021.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Haoyu10aAcclimation of CH4 emissions from paddy soil to atmospheric CO2 enrichment in a growth chamber experiment  ap. 140-146.  aElevated levels of atmospheric CO₂ (eCO₂) promote rice growth and increase methane (CH₄) emissions from rice paddies, because increased input of plant photosynthate to soil stimulates methanogenic archae. However, temporal trends in the effects of eCO₂ on rice growth and CH₄ emissions are still unclear. To investigate changes in the effects of eCO₂ over time, we conducted a two-season pot experiment in a walk-in growth chamber. Positive effects of eCO₂ on rice leaf photosynthetic rate, biomass, and grain yield were similar between growing seasons. However, the effects of eCO₂ on CH₄ emissions decreased over time. Elevated CO₂ increased CH₄ emissions by 48%–101% in the first growing season, but only by 28%–30% in the second growing season. We also identified the microbial process underlying the acclimation of CH₄ emissions to atmospheric CO₂ enrichment: eCO₂ stimulated the abundance of methanotrophs more strongly in soils that had been previously exposed to eCO₂ than in soils that had not been. These results emphasize the need for long-term eCO₂ experiments for accurate predictions of terrestrial feedbacks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3agrain yield 3agrowth chambers 3aleaves 3amethane 3amethanogens 3amethanotrophs 3apaddy soils 3aphotosynthesis 3arice 0aElevated CO2 0aMethane emissions 0aRice 0aMethanogens 0aMethanotrophs1 aJin, Yaguo1 aChen, Jin1 aHuang, Shan1 aLiu, Yunlong1 aZhang, Jun1 aDeng, Aixing1 aZou, Jianwen1 aPan, Genxing1 aDing, Yanfeng1 aJiang, Yu1 avan Groenigen, Kees Jan1 aZhang, Weijian0 tcrop journal.g2022 Feb., v. 10, no. 1 p.140-146dElsevier B.V.aCrop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop SciencewJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2021.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01401naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012300162300001800285520031200303592002800615650001100643650001100654650002200665650002700687650002300714650002200737650001100759650001700770650000800787700001700795700002200812773013300834856007500967852000901042655001201051IND60658936420221119213649.0190826e20110516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065893642DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10781j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotobuki, Masashi10aDesign of a micro-pattern structure for a three dimensionally macroporous Sn–Ni alloy anode with high areal capacity  ap. 6144-6146.  aA highly patterned porous Sn–Ni anode with various patterns was investigated as an anode for a lithium battery and showed much higher areal capacity than a conventional graphite electrode.

Host resistance has been an integral part of black shank management but after the loss of Php single-gene resistance following its widespread deployment in the 1990s, growers have relied on varieties with varying levels of partial resistance. Partial resistance is effective in suppressing disease, but continued exposure can result in an increase in pathogen aggressiveness that threatens durability of the resistance to P. nicotianae. Aggressiveness components in P. nicotianae were characterized following adaptation on two sources of partial resistance, Fla 301 and the Wz genomic region from Nicotiana rustica. An aggressive isolate of the two major races of P. nicotianae, race 0 and race 1, was adapted for either one/two or five/six generations on the two resistance sources, giving four sets of isolates based on race, number of generations of adaptation, and source of resistance. Across the four sets of isolates, adapted isolates infected higher proportions of tobacco root tips, produced more sporangia per infected root tip, and caused larger lesions than their respective nonadapted isolates of the same race and from the same resistance source. Adapted isolates also produced more aggressive zoospore progeny than the nonadapted isolates. Adaptation to partial resistance involves multiple aggressiveness components and results in the increased aggressiveness observed for P. nicotianae. These results improve our knowledge on the nature of P. nicotianae adaptation to partial resistance in tobacco and indicate that different resistance sources are likely to select for similar aggressiveness components in the pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana rustica 3aPhytophthora nicotianae 3adurability 3agenomics 3apathogens 3aprogeny 3aroot tips 3asporangia 3atobacco 3azoospores 0aadaptation 0aaggressiveness 0aoomycetes 0apartial resistance1 aShew, H.

As a result, the extravasation of convection-dependent agents including NPs is severely limited. Therefore, we have demonstrated the feasibility of targeting an enhancement of docetaxel-loaded Pluronic nanoparticles (NPs) using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) as an external stimulus-induced clinical system in tumor tissue. The efficient extravasation of NPs into the interior cells in tumor tissue was induced by relatively low HIFU exposure without apparent acute tissue damage. The enhanced targeting of NPs with near-infrared fluorescence dye was observed in tumor-bearing mice with various HIFU exposures. As a result, the greatest accumulation of NPs at the tumor tissue was observed at an HIFU exposure of 20W/cm2. However, the tumor tissue above at 20W/cm2 appeared to be destroyed and the tumor targetability of NPs was significantly decreased owing to thermal ablation with necrosis, resulting in the destruction of the tumor tissue and the blood vessels. In particular, a cross-sectional view of the tumor tissue verified that the NPs migrated into the middle of the tumor tissue upon HIFU exposure. The preliminary results here demonstrate that HIFU exposure through non-thermal mechanisms can aid with the extravasation of NPs into the interior cells of tumors and increase the therapeutic effect in enhanced and targeted cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3ablood vessels 3acolloids 3afluorescent dyes 3amice 3ananoparticles 3anecrosis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3atherapeutics 0aTargeting enhancement 0aUltrasound-induced 0aExtravasation 0aPluronic nanoparticles 0aEffective cancer therapy1 aHan, Hyounkoo1 aYoon, Byeong Deok1 aLee, Minae1 aKim, Hyuncheol1 aSŏ, Tong-wan,d1970-1 aSeo, Jae Hong1 aKim, Kwangmeyung1 aKwon, Ick Chan1 aYuk, Soon Hong0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 July 01, v. 119 p.137-144dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01382naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245012600166300001800292520032600310592002800636650001400664650002300678650002700701650002300728650001200751650001200763650003000775650001100805700002300816773013300839856007500972852000901047655001201056IND60658936520221119213520.0190826e20110531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065893652DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10782h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThakur, Krishna Gopal10ad-Glucose as green ligand for selective copper-catalyzed phenol synthesis from aryl halides with an easy catalyst removal  ap. 6692-6694.  aWith the growing demand of environmentally friendly reagents for organic reactions, for the first time the utility of d-glucose as a ligand in its direct form has been described using a typical example of copper-catalyzed coupling reaction for phenol synthesis with a high degree of selectivity and easy catalyst removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aglucose 3aligands 3aorganic halogen compounds 3aphenol1 aSekar, Govindasamy0 tChemical communications.g2011 May 31, v. 47, no. 23 p.6692-6694dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc10782h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009600169300001600265520133800281592002801619650002001647650001401667650001401681650001201695650001001707650002301717650002301740650002201763650002501785650004301810650001801853650000901871653001201880653000901892653001601901653001301917653002101930653001701951653001001968700002101978700001801999773012502017856008402142852000902226655001202235IND60542610920221121141145.0190405e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054261092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2013.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamant, Suvidha10aEvaluation of the 23S rRNA gene as target for qPCR based quantification of Frankia in soils  ap. 229-234.  aThe 23S rRNA gene was evaluated as target for the development of Sybr Green-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the analysis of nitrogen-fixing members of the genus Frankia or subgroups of these in soil.

Method verification on indigenous Frankia populations in soils, i.e. in depth profiles from four sites at an Alnus glutinosa stand, revealed declining numbers in the depth profiles, with similar abundance of all nitrogen-fixing frankiae independent of 23S rRNA or nifH gene targets, and corresponding numbers of one group of frankiae of the Alnus host infection only, with no detections of frankiae representing the Elaeagnus, Casuarina, or a second subgroup of the Alnus host infection groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aCasuarina 3aElaeagnus 3aFrankia 3agenes 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3anitrogen fixation 3anucleotide sequences 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 0aFrankia 0anifH 0aNitrogenase 0a23S rRNA 0aQuantitative PCR 0aRoot nodules 0aAlnus1 aAmann, Rudolf I.1 aHahn, Dittmar0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2014 May, v. 37, no. 3 p.229-234dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2013.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245014800209300001600357506010400373506007600477520112100553592002801674506003701702650001601739650002101755650002001776650001801796650001701814650001101831650001901842650002501861650001701886650002801903650001001931650001301941650001501954653001601969653002501985653002002010653001702030653002002047700006102067700006202128773009302190856008502283852000902368655001202377IND60736481120221207100039.0220426s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073648112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Arnab1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8727-022710aWorldwide flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate combined with high lipid diet provokes metabolic alterations and systemic anomalies: An overview  ap. 938-961.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this fast-food era, people depend on ready-made foods and engage in minimal physical activities that ultimately change their food habits. Majorities of such foods have harmful effects on human health due to higher percentages of saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, and hydrogenated fats in the form of high lipid diet (HLD). Moreover, food manufacturers add monosodium glutamate (MSG) to enhance the taste and palatability of the HLD. Both MSG and HLD induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby alter the redox-homeostasis to cause systemic damage. However, MSG mixed HLD (MH) consumption leads to dyslipidemia, silently develops non-alcoholic fatty liver disease followed by metabolic alterations and systemic anomalies, even malignancies, via modulating different signaling pathways. This comprehensive review formulates health care strategies to create global awareness about the harmful impact of MH on the human body and recommends the daily consumption of more natural foods rich in antioxidants instead of toxic ingredients to counterbalance the MH-induced systemic anomalies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afatty liver 3aflavor enhancers 3ahealth services 3ahigh fat diet 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ahyperlipidemia 3amonosodium glutamate 3apalatability 3areactive oxygen species 3ataste 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aFood habits 0aMonosodium glutamate 0aHigh lipid diet 0aHuman health 0aHarmful effects1 aMukherjee, Sandip1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4176-34961 aMaji, Bithin Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7017-13990 tToxicology reports.g2021, v. 8 p.938-961dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013200161300001600293520128200309592002801591650001001619650001001629650001101639650001301650650001701663650001001680650002301690650001601713650001101729650001101740650001201751650003501763650003401798650001201832650001001844650001001854650001301864651001001877653000901887653001201896653000901908653002001917653001901937653001901956700005501975700001802030700005702048700001702105773012302122856008202245852000902327655001202336IND60768926320221120173135.0220412e202303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076892632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2022.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Ying10aBurden levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and polychlorinated biphenyls in typical edible meat animals  ap. 742-749.  aThe concentrations and distributions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the whole blood and meat of eight typical edible animals (chicken, donkey, horse, cattle, rabbit, sheep, duck, and pig) were illustrated. Total concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and PCBs (on a basis of liquid volume) in animal bloods were 142-484 pg/L and 46-62 ng/L, respectively. Total concentrations of PCDD/Fs and PCBs (on a basis of dry weight (dw) and lipid weight (lw)) in animal meat samples were 0.47-1090 pg/g dw (0.47-4513 pg/g lw) and 7.2-23 ng/g dw (10-776 ng/g lw), respectively. TEQs for both PCDD/Fs and PCBs in animal blood and meat samples were (67 ± 27) pg/L and (5.3 ± 14) pg/g dw (24 ± 56 pg/g lw), respectively. Besides, the dietary intakes of PCDD/Fs and PCBs were also estimated. Chicken and pig contributed more TEQs than other animals. Chicken contributed the most (95%) with high toxicity, followed by pig (3.4%) with high consumption. The dietary intake of chicken might pose risks to consumers who prefer to eat chicken products, who should comprehensively consider the essential nutrients and contaminants in food during dietary intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasses 3ablood 3acattle 3achickens 3adibenzofuran 3aducks 3afood contamination 3afood intake 3ahorses 3alipids 3aliquids 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3arabbits 3asheep 3aswine 3atoxicity 3aChina 0aFood 0aPCDD/Fs 0aPCBs 0aBioaccumulation 0aDietary intake 0aHuman exposure1 aLiu, Wenbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6233-87661 aLei, Rongrong1 aWang, Mingxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8367-79701 aXue, Yingang0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2023 Mar., v. 125 p.742-749dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2022.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014600168300001600314520160100330592002801931650002301959650001001982650001201992650001202004650001702016650001602033650004302049650001902092650001502111650002102126700002002147700001502167700002102182700002002203773012502223856007402348852000902422655001202431IND60656716220221120071647.0190814e20140117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065671622DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41629a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunoz, Leonardo Pantoja10aEnhanced determination of As–phytochelatin complexes in Chlorella vulgaris using focused sonication for extraction of water-soluble species  ap. 791-797.  aThe most challenging areas in the analysis of As–GS/PC complexes are their extraction from small amounts of biological material and the maintenance of their stability during HPLC separation. Focused sonication was used to extract these complexes from Chlorella vulgaris and the integrity of such complexes was determined by HPLC online with simultaneous HR-ICP-MS and ES-MS/MS detection. Water soluble arsenic species were extracted with an improved 71.1% (SE 0.78) efficiency and much reduced extraction times (30 s) allowing the determination of unstable arsenic phytochelatin (PC) and glutathione (GS) species in small biomass making the method particularly well-suited for cell cultures. Here, it was found that C. vulgaris produces the following intact phytochelatins and homo-phytochelatins (with Ala and desGly instead of Gly) complexes when cells are exposed to As(iii): As(iii)–PC₂, GS–As(iii)–PC₂, As(iii)–(PC₂)₂, MMA(iii)–PC₂, As(iii)–PC₃, As(iii)–PC₄, As(iii)–γ-(Glu–Cys)₃–Ala, GS–As(iii)–γ-(Glu–Cys)₂–Ala, As(iii)–γ-((Glu–Cys)₂)₂–Ala, MMA(iii)–γ-(Glu–Cys)₂–Ala, As(iii)–γ-(Glu–Cys)₂, GS–As(iii)–γ-(Glu–Cys)₂. When the alga was exposed to DMA, only DMASⱽ–GS was found. In contrast, cells did not produce any complex when exposed to As(v). It is the first time that, as a result of the newly developed extraction method using sonication, such complexes have been identified in Chlorella vulgaris exposed to arsenic and their intact arsenic homo-phytochelatins have been reported in any organism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aalgae 3aarsenic 3abiomass 3acell culture 3aglutathione 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aphytochelatins 3asonication 3awater solubility1 aPurchase, Diane1 aJones, Huw1 aFeldmann, Jörg,1 aGarelick, Hemda0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 Jan. 17, v. 6, no. 3 p.791-797dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41629a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016900164300001600333500001900349520116300368592002801531650002001559650002601579650002701605650001501632650000901647650002101656650003001677650001401707700001501721700001201736700002101748700002401769700001501793773013901808856008101947852000902028655001202037IND60704980820221122224439.0200728e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070498082DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-020-0084-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Guoyang10aSimultaneous detection of Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in environmental water using PMA combined with mPCR  ap. 668-674.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) with propidium monoazide (PMA) and internal amplification control (IAC) for the simultaneous detection of waterborne pathogens Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli O157:H7, was developed. This PMA-IAC-mPCR assay used four new specific primers based on the genes for invA, ecfX, cesB, and fliC, respectively. A 16S rRNA primer was chosen for IAC to eliminate false negative results. The photosensitive dye, propidium monoazide (PMA) was used to exclude signals from dead bacteria that could lead to false positive results. In pure culture, the limits of detection (LOD) were 10¹ CFU/ml for P. aeruginosa, 10² CFU/ml for both Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7, and 10³ CFU/ml for B. cereus, respectively. In addition, with a 6–8 h enrichment of all four bacteria that were combined in a mixture that was spiked in water sample matrix, the LOD was 3 CFU/ml for Salmonella spp., 7 CFU/ml for E. coli O157:H7, 10 CFU/ml for B. cereus and 2 CFU/ml for P. aeruginosa. This PMA-IAC-mPCR assay holds potential for application in the multiplex assay of waterborne pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella 3adyes 3aphotosensitivity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apropidium1 aYu, Shuang1 aLi, Wen1 aZha, Liangzheng,1 aAguilar, Zoraida P.1 aXu, Hengyi0 tjournal of microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 58, no. 8 p.668-674dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-020-0084-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01907naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245009900179300001400278520101900292592002801311650001601339650001501355650001201370650001101382650002201393651001201415773009401427856008701521852000901608655001201617IND60084099720221119081642.0141101e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008409972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKravchinsky, Vadim A.10aPaleozoic large igneous provinces of Northern Eurasia: Correlation with mass extinction events  ap. 31-36.  aThis paper assesses data from recently described major Paleozoic large igneous provinces (LIPs), mostly in Northern Eurasia. The 10 LIPs reviewed form a unimodal distribution in terms of volume. Eight LIPs have an initial modal volume greater than 0.1×10⁶km³. The rift associated basalts of 2 LIPs from the end of the Late Cambrian Period and the end of the Late Ordovician Period do not occupy a large volume. Some of the provinces were discovered or rediscovered relatively recently and dating is still approximate, but most provinces fit a simple model in which volcanism persisted on the order of 10–20Myr, often resulting in continental break-up. Correlation between LIP ages and the ages of geological events in the Paleozoic Era that reflect mass extinctions and oceanic anoxia agrees with correlations suggested by Courtillot (1994) and Courtillot and Renne (2003) for the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras, considering that the absolute dating of some Paleozoic LIPs needs to be strengthened in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aextinction 3ahypoxia 3amodels 3avolcanic activity 3aEurasia0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2012 Apr., v. 86-87 p.31-36dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245011600159300001800275520122500293592002801518650001301546650002101559650001101580650002001591650002301611650001401634650002501648650002001673650001201693650001901705650002001724650001001744650001101754650001201765650002301777650001001800650002301810650001401833650002601847650001001873650002501883653002301908653003001931653001301961700001701974700001601991700001702007773009902024856007102123852000902194655001202203IND60081712920221119043951.0141010s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008171292DNAL7 a10.1071/AN143662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatterjee, P.

In the present study after extensive screening, three tropical tree leaves (Bahunia variegata, Psidium guajava and Cannabis indica) and three herbs (Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Trachyspermum ammi and Cinnamomum tamala) were selected to evaluate their effect on buffalo rumen fermentation. Total gas production, substrate degradability, volatile fatty acid pattern and enzyme activities were not affected by any of the plants tested in this study. However, methane production was lowered (P ≤ 0.05) due to inclusion of P. guajava leaves. Anti-methanogenic/anti-protozoal metabolites present in tropical plants seem to be better extracted by ethanol solvent and accordingly the best performing plant i.e. different levels of P. guajava extract was used for further evaluation. Both the methane inhibition and defaunating action of ethanol extract of P. guajava were found to be dose dependent.

Resorcinarene‐based cavitands are cavity‐shaped cyclic oligomers that can create host–guest interactions. We have investigated the chromatographic behavior of two types of cyclic tetramers as analytes in high‐performance liquid chromatography. The experiments were performed at four different temperatures (15, 25, 35, 45°C) on two types of reversed stationary phases (C₈ and C₁₈) from two different manufacturers. We have found a huge difference between the retention of resorcinarenes and cavitands. In some cases, the retention factor of cavitands was even a hundred times larger than the retention factor of resorcinarenes. The retention of methylated derivates was two to four times larger compared to that of demethylated compounds on every column. The opposite retention behavior of the resorcinarenes and cavitands on the two types of stationary phases showed well the difference of the selectivity of the XTerra and BDS Hypersil columns. The retention mechanism was studied by the thermodynamic parameters calculated from the van't Hoff equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aPrauda, Ibolya1 aKilár, Ferenc1 aKiss, Ibolya1 aFelinger, Attila0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 Sept., v. 38, no. 17 p.2975-2982dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015001533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011600171300001400287520108100301592002801382650002401410650002301434650001101457650002501468650001201493650001301505650001101518650001501529650002101544650001101565650002501576650001001601651001001611653002001621653002001641653002501661653001101686653001001697700002001707773010701727856008401834852000901918655001201927IND60123582820221122180539.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012358282DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2013.8169682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAggarwal, Ashish10aCarbon Sequestration and Economic Potential of the Selected Medicinal Tree Species: Evidence From Sikkim, India  ap. 59-72.  aMedicinal plants are widely used in India for various livelihood and health benefits. However, there is a lack of awareness and research on their carbon sequestration and economical potential, which constrains their use in various ongoing carbon forestry schemes precluding farmers from potential carbon revenue opportunities. The present study seeks to fill this knowledge gap by assessing the carbon sequestration and economic potential of three extensively used medicinal tree species of Emblica officinalis (Amla), Terminalia belerica (Bahera), and Terminalia chebula (Harar) in the state of Sikkim with the help of the project-based comprehensive mitigation assessment process (PROCOMAP) model. The findings of this research suggest that the selected species of Amla, Bahera, and Harar have significant carbon sequestration rates of 1, 2.64, and 1.42 tC ha ⁻¹ yr ⁻¹, which could generate Indian National Rupees (INR) 844, 1,198, and 2,228 ha ⁻¹ yr ⁻¹, respectively from carbon revenues in a $5/tCO ₂ scenario through various ongoing carbon forestry schemes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllanthus emblica 3aTerminalia chebula 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3afarmers 3aforestry 3aincome 3alivelihood 3amedicinal plants 3amodels 3asustainable forestry 3atrees 3aIndia 0amedicinal trees 0acarbon forestry 0acarbon sequestration 0aSikkim 0aIndia1 aChauhan, Suresh0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 33, no. 1 p.59-72dTaylor & Francisx1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2013.8169683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015800172300001600330520141500346592002801761650001401789650001101803650002001814650001501834650002001849650003501869650001601904650001501920650001001935650001101945650001401956650001401970650001901984650001702003650002202020650001602042650001502058650001102073651001802084653002202102653000802124653001902132653002002151653002602171653002102197700002502218773011102243856009002354852000902444655001202453IND60568580820221120031442.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056858082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Mithun10aGrowing fresh fruits and vegetables in an urban landscape: A geospatial assessment of ground level and rooftop urban agriculture potential in Boston, USA  ap. 130-141.  aUrban parcels can potentially be leveraged for developing a local urban food system by growing high yield food crops. Here, a remote sensing and GIS-based modeling framework was developed to locate and quantify available area for urban farming, including both rooftop and ground level areas in the city of Boston, MA, USA. Geoprocessing and spatial analysis tools were used to process geographic data layers for zoning, ownership, slope, soil quality, and adequate light availability. Surface slope (roof pitch) was determined for all buildings in the city through the creation of a digital surface map from remotely sensed LiDAR data. Potential parcels from ground level public and private vacant lots and underutilized residential and commercial areas were mapped using publicly available datasets. Approximately 922ha of rooftop and 1,250ha of ground level parcels have been identified, representing 7.4% and 10% of the total land area in Boston, respectively. Finally, food yield values for common urban agricultural crops were used to estimate the city’s food production potential from the identified parcels. Despite Boston’s density, the mapped areas have potential to produce enough fresh fruits and vegetables for Boston’s population, while providing both environmental and economic co-benefits. The study outcome was compared with mapping and inventory results from other North American cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acities 3adata collection 3afood crops 3afood production 3ageographic information systems 3ainventories 3alandscapes 3alidar 3amodels 3aownership 3araw fruit 3aremote sensing 3asoil quality 3aurban agriculture 3aurban areas 3avegetables 3azoning 3aMassachusetts 0aUrban agriculture 0aGIS 0aRemote sensing 0aFood resilience 0aDigital surface model 0aUrban metabolism1 aEckelman, Matthew J.0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2017 Sept., v. 165 p.130-141dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245007200198500002000270520103600290592002801326596001701354596004201371650002201413650001301435650001401448650002901462650001601491650001301507650001601520650002101536650000901557650002201566650001701588700002001605700002501625700006301650700005801713700002201771700002101793700006001814773012701874856007502001852000902076655001202085IND60790632320221119182525.0220826s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079063232DNAL7 a10.1002/ael2.200362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFordyce, Simon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2615-349X12aA simple cultivar suitability index for low‐pH agricultural soils  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlanting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars that carry the aluminum (Al) resistance gene TaAlmt1 is a potentially lower cost alternative to lime applications in acidic agricultural soils. However, the relative importance of TaAlmt1 expression and adaptedness (to regional environmental conditions) for preserving grain yield in acidic soils is not well understood. Adaptation trials were established in low‐pH soils to compare lime‐amended (YL) and unamended grain yield (YU) among regionally adapted spring wheat cultivars with and without TaAlmt1. Averaged across YL and YU (YAVG), yield of adapted TaAlmt1 carriers was similar to adapted noncarriers (p = .939) but greater than nonadapted noncarriers (p = .024). Soil pH‐driven spatial heterogeneity appears to inflate yield coefficients of variation and the probability of committing type II errors in cultivar yield comparisons. Our results support the use of YAVG as a suitability index and decision support tool for cultivar selection in acid‐affected soils.  aPublisher supplied data  cWestern SARE  cMontana Fertilizer Advisory Committee 3aTriticum aestivum 3aaluminum 3acultivars 3adecision support systems 3agrain yield 3aplanting 3aprobability 3aresistance genes 3asoil 3aspatial variation 3aspring wheat1 aJones, Clain A.1 aDahlhausen, Sally J.1 aLachowiec, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2962-64481 aEberly, Jed O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3963-53671 aSherman, Jamie D.1 aMcPhee, Kevin E.1 aCarr, Patrick M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7243-26600 tAgricultural & environmental letters.g2020, v. 5, no. 1 p.e20036-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:26726x2471-96257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ael2.200363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245019700168300001400365520097200379592002801351650001401379650002101393650001701414650002701431650002201458650001401480650001201494650001001506650001401516650001401530650002501544650002101569650001401590653001401604653002301618653002701641653001501668700002001683700002201703700002001725700003101745773010701776856008401883852000901967655001201976IND60123582920221122144403.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012358292DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2013.8169692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapna Bai, N.10aPathogenicity of Metarhizium anisopliae (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes) Isolates to the Ailanthus Webworm, Atteva fabriciella (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) Under Laboratory and Field Conditions  ap. 73-86.  aThe virulence of 25 Metarhizium anisopliae isolates was tested under laboratory conditions and the two most effective isolates were evaluated in the field for control of the Ailanthus defoliator, Atteva fabriciella .

Carbonyl compounds can cause the formation of ozone (O₃) and secondary organic aerosols, which can cause photochemical smog to form. In this study, 20 agricultural machines were tested using portable emission measurement system (PEMS) under real-world tillage processes. The exhaust gases were sampled using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine cartridges, and 15 carbonyl compounds were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Carbonyl compound emission factors for agricultural machines were 51.14–3315.62 mg/(kg-fuel), and were 2.58 ± 2.05, 0.86 ± 1.07 and 0.29 ± 0.20 g/(kg-fuel) for China 0, China II and China III emission standards, respectively. Carbonyl compound emission factor for sowing seeds of China 0 agricultural machines was 3.32 ± 1.73 g/(kg-fuel). Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein were the dominant carbonyl compounds emitted. Differences in emission standards and tillage processes impact ozone formation potential (OFP). The mean OFP was 20.15 ± 16.15 g O₃/(kg-fuel) for the China 0 emission standard. The OFP values decreased by 66.9% from China 0 to China II, and 67.4% from China II to China III. The mean OFP for sowing seeds of China 0 agricultural machines was 25.92 ± 13.84 g O₃/(kg-fuel). Between 1.75 and 24.22 times more ozone was found to be formed during sowing seeds than during other processes for China 0 and China II agricultural machines. Total carbonyl compound emissions from agricultural machines in China was 19.23 Gg in 2019. The results improve our understanding of carbonyl compound emissions from agricultural machines in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aacrolein 3aemissions factor 3aformaldehyde 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asmog pollution 3atillage 3aChina 0aAgricultural machines 0aCarbonyl compounds 0aEmission characteristics 0aTillage process 0aPEMS1 aShen, Xianbao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7850-58671 aWu, Bobo1 aKong, Lei1 aXuan, Kaijie1 aZhao, Cheng1 aCao, Xinyue1 aHao, Xuewei1 aLi, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2202-68291 aZhang, Hanyu1 aYao, Zhiliang0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2023 Feb., v. 124 p.846-859dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2022.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003400144245012700178300001800305520143500323592002801758650001501786650001101801650001501812650001101827650001601838650001001854650004101864650000901905650001101914650001301925650002001938650001601958650002101974650002301995650001602018700003402034700002002068700002902088700002202117700002902139700002902168700003602197773010202233856007802335852000902413655001202422IND60408525720221119083153.0150905e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040852572DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015003112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrasco‐Correa, Enrique J.10aThermal desorption gas chromatography with mass spectrometry study of outgassing from polymethacrylimide foam (Rohacell®)  ap. 3028-3037.  aPolymethacrylimide foams are used as light structural materials in outer‐space devices; however, the foam closed cells contain volatile compounds that are outgassed even at low temperatures. These compounds ignite as plasmas under outer‐space radiation and the intense radio‐frequency fields used in communications. Since plasmas may cause spacecraft fatal events, the conditions in which they are ignited should be investigated. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative knowledge about polymethacrylimide foam outgassing should be established. Using thermogravimetric analysis, weight losses reached 3% at ca. 200°C. Thermal desorption gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection was used to study the offgassed compounds. Using successive 4 min heating cycles at 125°C, each one corresponding to an injection, significant amounts of nitrogen (25.3%), water (2.6%), isobutylene (11.3%), tert‐butanol (2.9%), 1‐propanol (11.9%), hexane (25.3%), propyl methacrylate (1.4%), higher hydrocarbons (11.3%), fatty acids (2.2%) and their esters (1.3%), and other compounds were outgassed. Other compounds were observed during the main stage of thermal destruction (220–280°C). A similar study at 175°C revealed the extreme difficulty in fully outgassing polar compounds from polymethacrylimide foams by baking and showed the different compositions of the offgassed atmosphere that can be expected in the long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3abaking 3adesorption 3aesters 3afatty acids 3afoams 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheat 3ahexane 3anitrogen 3apolar compounds 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3avolatile compounds 3aweight loss1 aHerrero‐Martínez, José M.1 aConsuegra, Lina1 aRamis‐Ramos, Guillermo1 aSanz, Rafael Mata1 aMartínez, Benito Gimeno1 aEsbert, Vicente E.

The morphology, crystalline phases, and compositions are characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrocatalytic behaviors of this NiCu/Al₂O₃/NCN composite material for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution are studied by cathodic polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry. The results show that nickel–copper particles are briefly deposited and uniformly distributed over the carbon layer of the conductive ceramics between alumina grains, in the form of a NiCu solid solution with face-centered cubic structure. The NiCu/Al₂O₃/NCN composite displays a high electrochemical stability in alkaline solution and relatively high electrocatalytic activity for HER due to its relatively high real surface area and high intrinsic electrocatalytic effect of NiCu alloy particles. The associated kinetic parameters of HER are systematically investigated using EIS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalloys 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3aceramics 3acomposite materials 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asurface area1 aFuji, Masayoshi1 aShirai, Takashi1 aWatanabe, Hideo1 aTakahashi, Minoru1 aZuo, Yu0 tJournal of materials science.g2011 July, v. 46, no. 13 p.4630-4637dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-011-5365-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024001900128040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100001400201245011500215300001600330500002400346500001500370520186200385650001602247650002202263650002102285650001402306650001402320650002502334650001402359650002202373650002302395650002102418650002402439650001402463650002902477653002402506700001602530700001702546773011902563852000902682856011002691856008602801930003302887945002502920946001302945961001502958655001202973IND4375476420221119130058.0051024e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437547642DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-34.3.5482doi7 a10113/8402hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL001 0aL3001 aGould, J.10aEffect of temperature on development and population parameters of Copitarsia decolora (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 548-556.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of temperature on survival, development, and reproduction of Copitarsia decolora. Both linear and nonlinear models were used to model temperature-dependent development and population growth for C. decolora reared on asparagus and artificial diet. We used @Risk Software to bootstrap model parameters so that variability in observations could be incorporated into model predictions. C. decolora eggs required approximately equal to 69 DD to complete development with a base temperature of 7.8 degrees C. C. decolora developed through four to six instars depending on temperature and food source. Development of larvae from neonate through prepupa required 341.4 DD above a base of 7.3 degrees C on asparagus, whereas 254.5 DD were needed on artificial diet, where the base temperature was 7.7 degrees C. Pupae required approximately equal to 236 DD (base temperature 8.2-8.4 degrees C) to develop when reared on asparagus or artificial diet. Female moths laid significantly more eggs at 14.6 and 20.1 degrees C than at higher or lower temperatures. Survival of individuals to the adult stage increased from 71% at 9.7 degrees C to 93% at 24.9 degrees C. Survival fell off rapidly to 25% at 29.5 degrees C. The generation time was the shortest at 29.5 degrees C; however, only 25% of females survived to the adult stage, fecundity was low, and only 53% of the eggs hatched. The capacity for increase, r(c), was low at 9.7 degrees C, peaked at 25.7 degrees C, and declined as temperature increased. We estimated that populations on asparagus would not develop at temperatures >31.3 degrees C or <6.9 degrees C. We show the importance of estimating a range of values for base temperature and degree-days by conducting a preliminary pathway analysis that incorporates the effect of temperature on egg hatch. 3atemperature 3asimulation models 3aartificial diets 3aNoctuidae 3afecundity 3adevelopmental stages 3amortality 3apopulation growth 3ainsect development 3aegg hatchability 3ainsect reproduction 3aheat sums 3aAsparagus (Asparagaceae) 0amathematical models1 aVenette, R.1 aWinograd, D.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2005 June, v.  34, no.  3 p.548-556dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/8403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-34.3.5483Available from publisher's Web site  a20070705b20070802c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/11/08  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle01852naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012600165500002000291520082200311592002801133650002201161650002301183650001801206650000901224650001701233650001001250700002001260700002201280773012701302856007501429961001301504852000901517655001201526IND60790632620221119182541.0220826s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079063262DNAL7 a10.1002/ael2.200002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapiernik, Sharon K.10aEmergence of common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) is influenced by the landscape position in which seeds developed  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn a 2‐yr field study, we evaluated the emergence and early growth of Chenopodium album L.

Results indicated that a higher proportion of seeds originating from lower slope positions emerged compared with seeds originating from the backslope or upper slope. The timing of emergence was the same for all seed source locations. There was no influence of overwintering location on weed emergence. Regardless of the seed source, we observed faster emergence and growth of C. album planted in the lower slope, where soil conditions were more conducive to growth. These experiments will support the development of new strategies and decision aids to improve weed management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium album 3alandscape position 3aoverwintering 3asoil 3aweed control 3aweeds1 aForcella, Frank1 aAmundson, Gary B.0 tAgricultural & environmental letters.g2020, v. 5, no. 1 p.e20000-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:26726x2471-96257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ael2.200003Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245009100187300001600278500001500294520086700309592002801176650002201204650001901226650001001245650002501255650001401280650001501294650001101309650002001320650001301340650001001353650002501363650001701388650001601405650003101421650001401452650004401466650002001510650001201530650003801542650001501580650001101595650005301606653001601659653001401675653001901689653001401708653002401722700002801746700002201774700002701796773013201823852000901955856008301964655001202047IND4434800520221119175734.0181016e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443480052DNAL7 a200937082pmid7 a10.1177/1040638710022001342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Johanna L.10aUndifferentiated Carcinoma of the Salivary Gland in a Chinchilla (Chinchilla Lanigera)  ap. 152-155.  a2019-12-04  aA 12-year-old chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) developed a slow-growing, soft, fluctuating, nonpainful mass on the ventral neck with focally extensive alopecia over a period of approximately 8 months. On postmortem examination, an extensive, multilobulated, cystic, neoplastic mass extended subcutaneously over the ventral and lateral neck with metastatic spread to submandibular lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and lungs. Neoplastic cells were strongly positive for vimentin and pan-cytokeratin but were negative for alpha–smooth muscle actin, S100, and myosin; no intracytoplasmic myofibrils were detected on phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin staining. Histologic and immunohistochemical examination of the mass led to a diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma of the salivary gland and contributes to the paucity of knowledge concerning neoplasia in chinchillas.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease diagnosis 3ahistopathology 3aliver 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acarcinoma 3ametastasis 3aspleen 3asalivary glands 3anecropsy 3alungs 3acell differentiation 3acase studies 3alymph nodes 3aChinchilla (Chinchillidae) 3amortality 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aCarcinomaxpathologyxveterinary. 2aChinchilla 2aFemale 2aSalivary Gland Neoplasmsxpathologyxveterinary. 0achinchillas 0aneoplasia 0asalivary gland 0aCarcinoma 0aChinchilla lanigera1 aCampbell-Ward, Michelle1 aElse, Roderick W.1 aPamela, E.

With the synergistic effects of the SnS₂ nanoflower and IL, a couple of well-defined redox peaks of Hb appeared in the cyclic voltammogram of Nafion/Hb–SnS₂–IL/CILE, which indicated that direct electron transfer between Hb and the underlying electrode was realized. The electrochemical behavior of Hb on the modified electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry with the electrochemical parameters such as electron transfer coefficient (α), electron transfer number (n) and heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (kₛ) calculated. The fabricated electrode showed good electrocatalytic ability for the reduction of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) with a wider linear range from 0.8 to 21.0 mM and a lower detection limit of 0.27 mM (S/N = 3), indicating its potential application for the construction of a novel third-generation electrochemical biosensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiocompatible materials 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3ahemoglobin 3aionic liquids 3ananoflowers 3ananoparticles 3asulfides 3asynergism 3atrichloroacetic acid 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aLi, Wei1 aZhang, Huanhuan1 aWu, Xu1 aSun, Wei1 aZhu, Zhihong1 aYu, Ying0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Dec. 19, v. 6, no. 2 p.404-409dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41644e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06145naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245009300209520401400302592002804316596012404344650002304468650001804491650000904509650001104518650001204529650002204541650002104563650001204584650002404596650002504620650002004645650001304665650003304678650001404711650001104725650001504736650001304751650002804764650002204792650002104814650001804835650001804853650000904871650001504880650001104895650001604906650001504922651001904937651001304956651001304969651001804982651001605000651001905016651001405035653002105049653002805070653001205098700001305110700005505123700001705178700001605195773013105211856008405342852000905426655001205435IND60754864820221118021528.0211026e20210719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075486482DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-01-21-0109-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaysal-Gurel, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9920-988010aOccurrence of Volutella Blight Caused by Pseudonectria foliicola on Boxwood in Tennessee  aBoxwood (Buxus sp. L.) is a popular evergreen shrub in the United States widely used as a landscape plant and fresh greenery. Boxwood ‘Green Velvet’ (B. sinica var. insularis × B. sempervirens) plants grown in field conditions exhibiting Volutella blight (VB) symptoms were found in a commercial nursery in Warren Co., Tennessee, in May 2019. Leaves appeared red, brown, or tan on affected plants. Waxy, salmon pink fruiting bodies (sporodochia) were observed underneath affected leaves using a hand lens. Leaf drop was also observed. Black lesions under the bark were observed in some plants. Disease severity (percentage leaf area diseased) was nearly 40%, and disease incidence was nearly 30% of 1,000 plants. Infected leaf and stem tissues collected from four symptomatic plants were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol and washed with sterile distilled water. Culturing the infected leaf and stem pieces (5 mm) on PDA consistently yielded white fluffy aerial mycelium growth with scattered salmon-color slimy masses of conidia forming from sporodochia after 10 days of incubation at 25°C in a 12-h fluorescent light/dark cycle. A total of two isolates (FBG2020_396, FBG2020_405) were hyphal-tip purified on PDA. Conidia (n = 50) were hyaline, aseptate, fusiform to ellipsoidal, measuring an average of 7.8 × 3.3 μm (range: 4.84 to 13.2 × 2.2 to 4.64 μm). To confirm pathogen identity, total DNA was extracted using an UltraClean Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories) directly from a 5-day-old culture of isolates (FBG2020_396, FBG2020_405) on PDA. The ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), β-tubulin (tub2), and part of 28S large ribosomal subunit (LSU) regions were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs ITS 5/ITS 4, T1/BTb2, and LR0R/LR5, respectively (Glass and Donaldson 1995; O’Donnell and Cigelnik 1997; Rehner and Samuels 1994; Vilgalys and Hester 1990; White et al. 1990). Newly generated sequences—GenBank/NCBI numbers MW459251, MW465902 (ITS), MW464656, MW464657 (tub2), and MW459255, MW465903 (LSU)—were 100% identical to Pseudonectria foliicola L. Lombard & Crous ex-type (CBS 123190) sequences KM231776, KM232035, and NG_058095, respectively. To complete Koch’s postulates, six Green Velvet plants grown in 10-cm square pots (containing 40% coarse sand and 60% ground pine bark) were inoculated by spraying conidial suspension (FBG2020_396 [1 × 10⁵ conidia/ml]) obtained from 2-week-old PDA cultures. Plants were covered with clear plastic humidity domes for 3 days, and then they were maintained in a growth chamber at 25°C and 60% RH in a 12-h fluorescent light/dark cycle. Six control plants were maintained in the same environment without pathogen introduction. The pathogenicity test was conducted twice. After 10 days, typical symptoms of VB developed on inoculated plants, and microscopic examination revealed the same pathogen morphology as the original isolate. P. foliicola was consistently reisolated from leaves and stems. All control plants remained symptom-free, and P. foliicola was not reisolated. P. foliicola causing VB has been reported on B. sempervirens in Czech Republic (Spetik et al. 2020) and New Zealand (Lombard et al. 2015) and on Buxus sp. in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Washington (Salgado-Salazar et al. 2019). This is the first report of VB of boxwood caused by P. foliicola in Tennessee. P. foliicola is an opportunistic pathogen and infects weak, stressed, and injured boxwood plants/cuttings (Rivera et al. 2018). This pathogen could cause a serious economic loss to boxwood nursery growers, because it can significantly affect the ornamental value of boxwood plants and fresh greenery. Integration of sanitation practices with other disease management strategies such as biorational products and reduced-risk fungicides will be necessary for limiting the spread of pathogen and successful management of P. foliicola on boxwood in both field and postharvest conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aEvans-Allen/TENX-S-1083aEvans-Allen/TENX-1926-CCOCPaSCRI/2020-51181-32135cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aBuxus sempervirens 3aPseudonectria 3abark 3ablight 3aconidia 3adisease incidence 3adisease severity 3aethanol 3afinancial economics 3afluorescent lighting 3agrowth chambers 3ahumidity 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amicroscopy 3amycelium 3aopportunistic pathogens 3aornamental plants 3aornamental value 3apathogenicity 3aribosomal DNA 3asand 3asanitation 3ashrubs 3asporodochia 3avegetation 3aCzech Republic 3aIllinois 3aMaryland 3aMassachusetts 3aNew Zealand 3aNorth Carolina 3aTennessee 0aVolutella blight 0aPseudonectria foliicola 0aboxwood1 aBika, R.1 aAvin, F.

We compared biomass estimates and their associated variances derived based on five different post-stratification approaches in a swept area method, and then observed that these approaches have little effect on biomass estimates and their precision, owing to well-organized survey designs and homogeneously allocated sampling stations. We were able to utilize decreasing biomass estimates for 15 years as an essential abundance index in the ongoing stock assessment. Notably, examination based on stratification along with longitudinal survey lines indicated that the estimated biomass had decreased in the western survey area, resulting in an eastward shift in the gravity center of Pacific saury distribution after 2010. We recommend biomass estimation in an east–west direction based on longitudinal stratification as an effective measure to develop population dynamics models which reflect westward migration into the fishing grounds around Japanese coastal waters, and to forecast the expected catch during the subsequent fishing period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCololabis saira 3abiomass 3acoastal water 3adynamic models 3afishery resources 3agravity 3alongitudinal studies 3apopulation dynamics 3asurveys 3atrawl nets 3aJapan1 aKidokoro, Hideaki1 aSuyama, Satoshi1 aFuji, Taiki1 aMiyamoto, Hiroomi1 aNaya, Miyako1 aVijai, Dharmamony1 aUeno, Yasuhiro1 aKitakado, Toshihide0 tFisheries science.g2020 May, v. 86, no. 3 p.445-456dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3867080x0919-92687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-020-01407-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245008300201500002000284520111400304592002801418650001901446650001101465650001101476650002401487650000901511650003301520650002401553650001201577651000901589700002301598773012701621856007501748961001301823852000901836655001201845IND60790632920221119182314.0220826s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079063292DNAL7 a10.1002/ael2.200022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Brien, Peter L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6530-541710aExtreme soil surface temperatures reflect need to rethink agronomic management  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe soil surface exists at the soil–atmosphere interface and is critical in regulating transfers of water, energy, and nutrients in agroecosystems. Soil surface temperature plays an important role in the rate and quantity at which these resources cross the interface, as temperature regulates numerous physical, chemical, and biological processes. Many current management practices manipulate soil surface temperatures, especially through tillage or residue management, to create conditions suitable for early‐season crop growth. However, these conditions persist beyond plant establishment and have the potential to develop extremely high temperatures, even in historically mild climates. We show the potential for extreme maximum soil surface temperatures in Iowa after crop establishment but before canopy closure and discuss possible consequences of those temperatures. Given the conditions required to develop extreme maximum temperatures, we contend that soil surface temperatures may be an indicator of conditions that are inconsistent with highly productive, sustainable, efficient agroecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3acanopy 3aenergy 3aplant establishment 3asoil 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3asurface temperature 3atillage 3aIowa1 aHatfield, Jerry L.0 tAgricultural & environmental letters.g2020, v. 5, no. 1 p.e20002-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:26726x2471-96257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ael2.200023Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01600naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006200171300001600233520054900249592002800798650001400826650001500840650001100855650002500866653001300891653001600904653003100920653003100951653001900982700002201001700002401023773011001047856008401157852000901241655001201250IND60123583520221122221201.0150325e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012358352DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2013.8473782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, Philip14aThe Relevance of Species Concepts in Sustainable Forestry  ap. 195-210.  aSpecies concepts and the definition of a species are discussed in the context of sustainable forest management and the sustainability of biological systems in general.

In co-feed trials, the species A. taxiformis and A. armata inhibited enteric-generated methane (CH₄ – a greenhouse gas) emissions in ruminants, owing to their bromoform content. Estimations suggest that global anthropogenic CH₄ emissions could be reduced by up to 44%, which would significantly mitigate the greenhouse effect of CH₄. Research showed that A. armata typically has an 8.5-fold higher bromoform content (average 1.45% of dry weight biomass (DWbᵢₒₘₐₛₛ)) compared to A. taxiformis (0.17% DWbᵢₒₘₐₛₛ). To date, however, only A. taxiformis can be cultivated in aquaculture indoor-controlled conditions (e.g. in southern Portugal and Hawaii, USA). Despite intensive studies, the synthesis pathway of bromoform in Asparagopsis has not yet been fully elucidated. Optimization of bromoform contents and biomass productivities for sustainable use in feed applications will require tank cultivation for A. armata under optimal environmental conditions and further studies are needed to fully understand the metabolic pathway of bromoform production. To lay the required foundation, this review briefly summarises the biological characteristics of Asparagopsis spp., putative halocarbon biosynthesis pathways and enzymes involved, the status of commercial cultivation, and the mechanism of inhibition of methane (CH₄) formation in ruminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsparagopsis 3aHawaii 3aaquaculture 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3agreenhouse effect 3agreenhouse gases 3aindustrial applications 3amacroalgae 3amethane 3aresearch 3aPortugal 0aHalocarbon biosynthesis pathway 0aCommercial cultivation 0aIntensive ruminants husbandry1 aLi, Dapeng1 aYang, Qi1 aSu, Peng1 aWang, Hui1 aHeimann, Kirsten1 aZhang, Wei0 tAlgal research.g2021 June, v. 56 p.102319-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2021.1023193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245012700174300001600301520134400317592002801661653002401689653001801713653002101731653002501752653003201777700002101809700001601830700002001846700002501866700002101891700001801912700001801930773010301948856008702051852000902138655001202147IND60594115920221123012816.0180510e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059411592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaruta, Masakazu10aTemperature effects on SEI formation and cyclability of Si nanoflake powder anode in the presence of SEI-forming additives  ap. 186-193.  aSilicon nanoflake powder (Si LeafPowder®, Si-LP) used as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries has demonstrated superior cycle performance at 30°C in an ethylene-carbonate-based electrolyte solution because its characteristic thin-film-based structure resists pulverization. However, capacity fading was accelerated at 60°C owing to enhanced decomposition of the electrolyte solution and growth of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which leads to loss of the electronic contact between Si-LP particles. The SEI-forming additives vinylene carbonate (VC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), and difluoroethylene carbonate improved the capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency at 30°C. Although VC is the most effective additive at 60°C, the discharge capacity was decreased dramatically at −5°C owing to poor ionic and electronic conductivity of the SEI layer formed from the VC-added electrolyte solution. The added FEC produced better performance in a wide temperature range of −5 to 60°C because the SEI layer formed in the FEC-added electrolyte solution had higher ionic and electronic conductivity than that formed from VC, even at −5°C. To obtain Si anodes with high discharge capacity and long cycle life, an appropriate choice of SEI-forming additive taking into account the operating temperature is important.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLithium-ion battery 0aSilicon anode 0aNanoflake powder 0aElectrolyte additive 0aSolid electrolyte interface1 aŌkubo, Takashi,1 aMasuo, Yuta1 aYoshida, Shuhei1 aTomita, A.q(Akira),1 aTakenaka, Toshio1 aDoi, Takayuki1 aInaba, Minoru0 tElectrochimica acta.g2017 Jan. 10, v. 224 p.186-193dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.12.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245016200173520122200335592002801557650002101585650001501606650001501621650001501636650001701651650001601668650001601684650001301700650001101713650001701724650001901741650002201760650002801782650001901810653003901829653003001868653002501898653001901923653002001942653001601962653001801978653001601996653002402012653001202036653005002048700001602098700001702114700001602131700001802147700001702165700001702182773012302199856008902322852000902411655001202420IND60768927020221120172326.0220328e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076892702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2022.1124142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiburcio, M.A.10aIn vitro evaluation of the cis-[Ru(phen)2(pPDIp)]2+⁎⁎ complex for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy against Sporothrix brasiliensis and Candida albicans  aPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) activates a photosensitizer by visible light to generate cytotoxic oxygen species that lead to cell death. With proper illumination, PDT is often used in applications on superficial and sub-surface lesions. Sporotrichosis infection occurs by Sporothrix fungi which causes a skin wound, worsened by Candida albicans infections. This study investigated the photosensitizing efficiency of the Ru(phen)₂(pPDIp)(PF₆)₂ complex, RupPDIp, against S. brasiliensis and C. albicans. RupPDIp efficiency against these fungi was tested using 450 nm (blue light and 36 J/cm²) and 525 nm (green light, 25.2 J/cm²) at 0.05–20 μM concentrations. To ensure PDT effectiveness, control groups were tested in the absence and in the presence of RupPDIp under light irradiation and in the dark. RupPDIp eliminated both fungi at ≤5.0 μM. Green light showed the best results, eliminating S. brasiliensis and C. albicans colonies at RupPDIp 0.5 μM and 0.05 μM, respectively. RupPDIp is a promising photosensitizer in aPDT, eliminating 10⁶ CFU/mL of both fungi at 450 nm and 525 nm, with lower light doses and concentrations when treated with the green light compared to the blue light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aSporothrix 3ablue light 3acell death 3acytotoxicity 3agreen light 3airradiation 3alighting 3aoxygen 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3asporotrichosis 0aAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy 0aPhotodynamic inactivation 0aPhotodynamic therapy 0aRu(II) complex 0aS. brasiliensis 0aC. albicans 0aAbbreviations 0a[**] (phen) 0a1,10-phenanthroline 0a(pPDIp) 0abis-phenanthroline-perylenediimide derivative1 aRocha, A.R.1 aRomano, R.A.1 aInada, N.M.1 aBagnato, V.S.1 aCarlos, R.M.1 aBuzzá, H.H.0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2022 Apr., v. 229 p.112414-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2022.1124143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04082naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245014800210300001400358520258200372592002802954650001602982650001102998650001603009650001603025650001503041650002903056650001603085650001803101650001503119650001903134650001103153650001403164650001703178651001303195653002903208653003503237653002403272653001503296653001303311653001803324700002203342700002503364700002203389773008203411856008603493852000903579655001203588IND60568581820221120151431.0170708e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056858182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMackens, Sonja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0699-100710aQuaternary sediment architecture in the Orkhon Valley (central Mongolia) inferred from capacitive coupled resistivity and Georadar measurements  ap. 72-84.  aDetailed information on shallow sediment distribution in basins is required to achieve solutions for problems in Quaternary geology, geomorphology, neotectonics, (geo)archaeology, and climatology. Usually, detailed information is obtained by studying outcrops and shallow drillings. Unfortunately, such data are often sparsely distributed and thus cannot characterise entire basins in detail. Therefore, they are frequently combined with remote sensing methods to overcome this limitation. Remote sensing can cover entire basins but provides information of the land surface only. Geophysical methods can close the gap between detailed sequences of the shallow sediment inventory from drillings at a few spots and continuous surface information from remote sensing. However, their interpretation in terms of sediment types is often challenging, especially if permafrost conditions complicate their interpretation. Here we present an approach for the joint interpretation of the geophysical methods ground penetrating radar (GPR) and capacitive coupled resistivity (CCR), drill core, and remote sensing data. The methods GPR and CCR were chosen because they allow relatively fast surveying and provide complementary information. We apply the approach to the middle Orkhon Valley in central Mongolia where fluvial, alluvial, and aeolian processes led to complex sediment architecture.The GPR and CCR data, measured on profiles with a total length of about 60km, indicate the presence of two distinct layers over the complete surveying area: (i) a thawed layer at the surface, and (ii) a frozen layer below. In a first interpretation step, we establish a geophysical classification by considering the geophysical signatures of both layers. We use sedimentological information from core logs to relate the geophysical classes to sediment types. This analysis reveals internal structures of Orkhon River sediments, such as channels and floodplain sediments. We also distinguish alluvial fan deposits and aeolian sediments by their distinct geophysical signature. With this procedure we map aeolian sediments, debris flow sediments, floodplains, and channel sediments along the measured profiles in the entire basin.We show that the joint interpretation of drillings and geophysical profile measurements matches the information from remote sensing data, i.e., the sediment architecture of vast areas can be characterised by combining these techniques. The method presented here proves powerful for characterising large areas with minimal effort and can be applied to similar settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3abasins 3aclimatology 3afloodplains 3ageophysics 3aground-penetrating radar 3ainventories 3amass movement 3apermafrost 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asediments 3aspatial data 3aMongolia 0aGround penetrating radar 0aCapacitive coupled resistivity 0aLandscape evolution 0aPermafrost 0aMongolia 0aOrkhon Valley1 aKlitzsch, Norbert1 aGrützner, Christoph1 aKlinger, Riccardo0 tGeomorphology.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 292 p.72-84dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245007800164300001800242520124400260592002801504650001201532650002601544650002301570650002001593650002601613650001401639650001301653650003901666650001601705700002301721700002001744700002501764773010201789856007801891852000901969655001201978IND60408526520221119083102.0150905e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040852652DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015001302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Meire R.10aUnified chromatography: Fundamentals, instrumentation and applications†  ap. 3071-3083.  aThe concept of unified chromatography has been in existence for 50 years after the work of Giddings proposing that all modes of chromatography (gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, supercritical fluid chromatography and so on) may be treated together under a single unified theory. His idea was partially fulfilled 23 years later by Ishii, Takeuchi and colleagues, who demonstrated for the first time the possibility to analyze a complex sample containing substances with a wide range of boiling points and polarities in the same instrument and column, just by varying the mobile phase pressure and temperature to change from one chromatographic mode to another. This approach has been demonstrated through application to the separation of complex mixtures in several areas including crude oil, edible oils and polymers. Still, unified chromatography has not yet been fully developed. In the present work, we will review the fundamentals, instrumentation and several applications of the technique. Also discussed are the drawbacks that still hinder development, as well as the recent developments and trends in instrumentation and columns that suggest the most feasible ways forward to the full development of unified chromatography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling 3acooking fats and oils 3agas chromatography 3ainstrumentation 3aliquid chromatography 3apetroleum 3apolymers 3asupercritical fluid chromatography 3atemperature1 aAndrade, Felipe N.1 aFumes, Bruno H.1 aLanças, Fernando M.0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 Sept., v. 38, no. 17 p.3071-3083dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015001303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01842naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245012800159300001800287520083200305592002801137650001101165650001001176650001101186650001001197650002001207650000901227653001201236653001101248653001801259700001601277700002001293773009901313856007101412852000901483655001201492IND60081714020221119052127.0141010s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008171402DNAL7 a10.1071/AN144222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreston, J.

Results demonstrate that there were significant differences across nine sites on the fleece. The inclusion of the covariates fibre diameter, fibre diameter co-efficient of variation, staple length, dust penetration, staple structure, greasy wool colour and resistance to compression, helped to explain some of the variation in textural greasy wool handle between sites such that site of assessment was no longer a significant factor (P = 0.065). However, in practice, those involved with clip preparation or sheep selection based on textural greasy wool handle assessment are unlikely to have these measurements available. The results highlight the importance of nominating a site of assessment when recording textural greasy wool handle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3acolor 3afleece 3asheep 3astaple (fibers) 3awool 0agrading 0aMerino 0awool classing1 aHatcher, S.1 aMcGregor, B.

Analyses of concatenated housekeeping genes (atpD, recA and glnII) further revealed that they were distinct lineages in the genus Ensifer, and group I was most similar to Ensifer terangae and Ensifer garamanticus (both with 94.2% similarity), while group II was most similar to Ensifer adhaerens (94.0%). These groups could be distinguished from closely related species by DNA–DNA relatedness, MALID-TOF MS, cellular fatty acid profiles and a series of phenotypic characters. Therefore, two novel groups were proposed: Ensifer psoraleae sp. nov. (seven strains, type strain CCBAU 65732T=LMG 26835T=HAMBI 3286T) and Ensifer sesbaniae sp. nov. (nine strains, type strain CCBAU 65729T=LMG 26833T=HAMBI 3287T). They had a DNA G+C mol% (Tm) of 58.9 and 60.4, respectively.

This study responds to this knowledge gap by examines the determinants of adoption of adaptive and mitigatory CSAPs in isolation and when combined, and their impacts on rice yield and rice net income in Hubei, China. Using three-year household-level pooled cross-sectional data and addressing selection biases from both observable and unobservable heterogeneity were managed by applying a multinomial endogenous switching regression framework. Our findings indicate that adopting both adaptive and mitigatory CSAPs increases rice yield and rice net income by 15.879% and 19.288%, respectively. Besides, the strong complementarities exist between adaptive and mitigatory CSAPs to address climate change in improving productivity and income when experiencing extreme weather events (e.g., EI Niño event). These findings highlight the positive role of integrating adaptive and mitigatory CSAPs in coping with climate change challenges, and increasing household farmers’ economic welfare in China, and potentially elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3arice 3arisk management 3aweather 3aChina 0aClimate-smart agriculture 0aMitigation 0aAdaptation1 aZhang, Lu1 aLi, Wenjing1 aZhang, Junbiao1 aFrewer, Lynn J.0 tClimate risk management.g2021, v. 32 p.100314-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2021.1003143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01444naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245010100204300001800305506007600323520018000399592002800579506003700607650001300644650001800657650002700675650002300702650001800725700001700743700001600760700002000776700002100796700002300817773013400840856007500974852000901049655001201058IND60658934820221207093538.0190826e20110426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065893482DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10745c2doi7 aPMC32528162pmcid7 a214683992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠardzík, Róbert10aChemoenzymatic synthesis of sialooligosaccharides on arrays for studies of cell surface adhesion  ap. 5425-5427.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSialooligosaccharides were generated by direct enzymatic glycosylation on arrays and the resulting surfaces were suitable for the study of carbohydrate-specific cell adhesion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3acell adhesion 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3aglycosylation1 aSharma, Ritu1 aKaloo, Sara1 aVoglmeir, Josef1 aCrocker, Paul R.1 aFlitsch, Sabine L.0 tChemical communications.g2011 Apr. 26, v. 47, no. 19 p.5425-5427dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc10745c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245006500157300001800222520137800240592002801618650002501646650001901671650001501690650001001705650001101715650001401726650002101740650001301761650001901774650001901793650001301812650002101825650001701846650002001863650001201883653001901895653002201914653001401936653001301950700001601963700001601979773009901995856007102094852000902165655001202174IND60081714320221119051924.0141010s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008171432DNAL7 a10.1071/AN144412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Cheol-Heui10aStress, acute phase proteins and immune modulation in calves  ap. 1561-1568.  aAcute phase and inflammatory responses are triggered by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic stressors that come at a cost through suppressing the normal function of tissues and organs of domestic animals. Recently, with growing attention placed on global warming and animal welfare, there has been an increased interest in improving our understanding of the relationships between different classes of stress, the expression of acute phase proteins (APPs), the stress-related endocrine system and immunomodulation. Immune function is compromised by all forms of stress including poor nutrition, weaning, extreme thermal conditions, injury and infection in calves. Proinflammatory cytokines, APPs and hormones of the hypothalamic–pituitary adrenal axis as well as the composition of immune cells can all be characterised in culture supernatants and peripheral blood. APPs have been used as biomarkers for the stress status of ruminants both experimentally and in field studies. Therefore detailed studies of the mechanisms of action of these APPs and their interactions in ameliorating different stress responses are warranted. The focus of this review is on the aetiology of the responses in calves under severe stress and its impact on growth and immune status. Possible strategies to alleviate this condition including the role of specific feed additives are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute phase proteins 3aanimal welfare 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3acalves 3acytokines 3aendocrine system 3aetiology 3afeed additives 3aglobal warming 3ahormones 3aimmunomodulation 3ainflammation 3astress response 3aweaning 0aanimal welfare 0acellular immunity 0acytokines 0ahormones1 aWynn, Peter1 aHa, Jong K.0 tAnimal production science.g2014, v. 54, no. 10 p.1561-1568dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN144413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008700169300001600256520070700272592002800979650001401007650001901021650001801040650002301058650001901081650001101100650002401111650001801135650001701153650002501170651001401195653001501209653001301224653001401237653001801251653001601269700002101285700002001306700002001326700002501346700002001371773010901391856008401500852000901584655001201593IND60123584120221121060550.0150325e20140519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012358412DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2014.8883552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurnomo, Herry10aCommunicative Action to Level the Playing Field in Forest Plantations in Indonesia  ap. 337-357.  aThe government of Indonesia allocated state land to private companies to establish forest plantations. However, ownership of this land was contested by some Sumatran communities. The plantation company, endorsed by the government, quickly developed a partnership to resolve the conflict, but this was unclear and inequitable. Action research was carried out to facilitate communication among stakeholders. This communicative action changed some perceptions and shared values began to emerge. A forum was established, which contributed to equitability producing a better partnership. This research is a model for empowering local communities in climate change, bioenergy, and food security negotiations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3aclimate change 3afood security 3aforest plantations 3aland ownership 3amodels 3aprivate enterprises 3aprivate lands 3astakeholders 3asustainable forestry 3aIndonesia 0aplantation 0aconflict 0acommunity 0aparticipatory 0adevelopment1 aGuizol, Philippe1 aAwang, San Afri1 aWardhana, Wahyu1 aIrawati, Rika Harini1 aRennaldi, Daren0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2014 May 19, v. 33, no. 4 p.337-357dTaylor & Francisx1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2014.8883553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245011500176300001600291500001500307520165700322592002801979650004102007650004002048650001602088650001902104650001202123650002602135650002502161650001002186650000902196650001702205650001402222650001902236650001202255650003502267650002102302650005602323650006402379650001102443650000902454650000902463650001702472650003002489650001502519653001802534653001002552653002202562653001702584653001502601653002302616700001302639700002902652700002202681700001802703700001602721700002202737773010602759852000902865856007602874655001202950IND4385166420221116192202.0181004e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438516642DNAL7 a170991472pmid7 a10.1354/vp.43-6-9042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteele, K.

The effect of tunicamycin on the course of the disease in mice with VEE was investigated, and the combined effects of these agents was characterized. CD-1 mice given 2.5 μg of tunicamycin had > 1,000-fold more virus in the brain 48 hours after infection with the virulent VEE strain V3000 and >100-fold of the attenuated strain V3034 at all tested times than did untreated mice, indicating enhanced neuroinvasion. Tunicamycin did not alter the viremia profiles of these viruses nor the replication of V3000 in the brain itself. Tunicamycin alone caused ultrastructural blood-brain barrier damage, yet neuroinvasion by V3000 in treated mice appeared to occur via the olfactory system rather than the blood-brain barrier. Tunicamycin-treated, V3000-infected mice also exhibited earlier and more severe weight loss, neurological signs, neuronal infection, neuronal necrosis and apoptosis, and inflammation than untreated, V3000-infected mice. The mean survival time of tunicamycin-treated, V3000-infected mice was 7.3 days versus 9.9 days for untreated, V3000-infected mice. These studies imply that animals that ingest toxins similar to tunicamycin, including the agent of annual ryegrass toxicity in livestock, are conceivably at greater risk from infections by encephalitis viruses and that humans and horses exposed to agents acting similar to tunicamycin may be more susceptible to encephalitis caused by VEE viruses. The exact mechanism of tunicamycin-enhanced neuroinvasion by VEE viruses requires further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus 3aVenezuelan equine encephalomyelitis 3atunicamycin 3ahistopathology 3aneurons 3aanimal disease models 3aimmunohistochemistry 3abrain 3amice 3apathogenesis 3amortality 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aAntiviral Agentsxpharmacology 2aBrainxpathology 2aEncephalitis Virus, Venezuelan Equinexdrug effects 2aEncephalomyelitis, Venezuelan Equinexmortalityxpathology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMice 2aTime Factors 2aTunicamycinxpharmacology 2aViral Load 0acell invasion 0aBrain 0aencephalomyelitis 0aplaque assay 0aVenezuelan 0aviral encephalitis1 aSeth, P.1 aCatlin-Lebaron, K.

Enhanced male mating competitiveness can significantly increase the effectiveness of the sterile insect technique (SIT). ME application to mass reared sterile flies by feeding is infeasible. ME application by aromatherapy however, would be a very practical way of ME application in fly emergence and release facilities. This approach was shown to enhance mating competitiveness of B. carambolae 3 d posttreatment (DPT). Despite this added benefit, every additional day of delaying release will reduce sterile fly quality and will add cost to SIT application. The present study was planned to assess the effects of ME‐aromatherapy on male B. carambolae mating competitiveness 1DPT and 2DPT. ME aromatherapy 1DPT or 2DPT did enhance mating competitiveness of B. carambolae males whereas ME feeding 1DPT and 2DPT did not. Male mating competitiveness was enhanced by the ME aromatherapy irrespective if they received 1DPT, 2DPT or 3DPT.

In the paper, previous palynological and diatom assessments were supplemented by further pollen, Cladocera and macrofossil analysis. This enabled detailed reconstruction of a palaeolake functioning under changes of climate and other environmental conditions during MIS 5e. All identified alterations of trophy, depth and aquatic vegetation within the reservoir point to dynamic changes in early stages of lake functioning, relatively stable conditions in mid-Eemian and gradual lake shallowing starting from Caprinus phase. Thus, Kozlów palaeolake joins the noble group of sites with exceptionally well-recognized multi-proxy records of the Eemian Interglacial environment, and has the potential to become a benchmark for this part of Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCladocera 3aaquatic plants 3aclimate 3ahydrology 3alakes 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3apalynology 3apollen 3aPoland 0aPollen analysis 0aPlant macrofossils 0aCladocera 0aEemian interglacial 0aClimate change 0aCentral Poland1 aKultys, Kamil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2412-08461 aStachowicz-Rybka, Renata1 aPidek, Irena A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1979-48971 aHrynowiecka, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6878-90071 aTerpiłowski, Sławomir1 aŁabęcka, Karolina1 aŻarski, Marcin0 tQuaternary international.g2022 Sept. 20, v. 632 p.36-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245010000160300001600260520222100276592002802497653001402525653000902539653000802548653001002556653001002566700002402576700001902600700002402619700001802643700002102661773009402682856003802776852000902814655001202823IND50067427720221121221657.0130628s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006742772DNAL7 a10.1071/EN130392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParikh, Harshal M.10aEvaluation of aromatic oxidation reactions in seven chemical mechanisms with an outdoor chamber  ap. 245-259.  aEnvironmental context.  Regulatory air quality models used to develop strategies to reduce ozone and other pollutants must be able to accurately predict ozone produced from aromatic hydrocarbons. In urban areas, major sources of aromatic hydrocarbons are gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles. Our findings show that the representation of aromatic hydrocarbon chemistry in air quality models is an area of high uncertainty Abstract Simulations using seven chemical mechanisms are intercompared against O3, NOx and hydrocarbon data from photooxidation experiments conducted at the University of North Carolina outdoor smog chamber. The mechanisms include CB4–2002, CB05, CB05-TU, a CB05 variant with semi-explicit aromatic chemistry (CB05RMK), SAPRC07, CS07 and MCMv3.1. The experiments include aromatics, unsaturated dicarbonyls and volatile organic compound (VOC) mixtures representing a wide range of urban environments with relevant hydrocarbon species. In chamber simulations the sunlight is characterised using new solar radiation modelling software. A new heterogeneous chamber wall mechanism is also presented with revised chamber wall chemical processes. Simulations from all mechanisms, except MCMv3.1, show median peak O3 concentration relative errors of less than 25% for both aromatic and VOC mixture experiments. Although MCMv3.1 largely overpredicts peak O3 levels, it performs relatively better in predicting the peak NO2 concentration. For aromatic experiments, all mechanisms except CB4–2002, largely underpredict the NO–NO2 crossover time and over-predict both the absolute NO degradation slope and the slope of NO2 concentration rise. This suggests a major problem of a faster and earlier NO to NO2 oxidation rate across all the newer mechanisms. Results from individual aromatic and unsaturated dicarbonyl experiments illustrate the unique photooxidation chemistry and O3 production of several aromatic ring-opening products. The representation of these products as a single mechanism species in CB4–2002, CB05 and CB05-TU is not adequate to capture the O3 temporal profile. In summary, future updates to chemical mechanisms should focus on the chemistry of aromatic ring-opening products.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaromatics 0aCB05 0aMCM 0aozone 0aSAPRC1 aJeffries, Harvey E.1 aSexton, Ken G.1 aLuecken, Deborah J.1 aKamens, R.

However, the mechanism of starch synthesis is not fully elucidated, especially with regard to the expression and regulation of starch synthetic genes. The APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) family plays a crucial role in various biological processes via regulating gene expression. In this study, the ZmEREB94 gene was identified through co-expression analysis. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed that ZmEREB94 belongs to the AP2/ERF family. Expression pattern analysis showed that this protein is strongly expressed in the maize endosperm. A ZmEREB94-GFP fusion protein was localized in the nuclei of onion epidermal cells, and ZmEREB94 showed strong transcriptional activation activity, which indicated that this protein is a transcription factor. In addition, yeast-one hybrid assays and transient expression in maize endosperm showed that ZmEREB94 could directly bind to the ZmSSI promoter and indirectly regulate ZmSh2 and ZmGBSSI expression. Our results revealed that ZmEREB94 might act as a key regulator of starch synthesis in maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3acorn 3aendosperm 3afood crops 3agene expression 3ahybrids 3aonions 3astarch 3asynthetic genes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 0aABA 0aAGPase 0aADP-Glc 0aDBE 0aDAP 0aGBSS 0aISA 0aGUS 0aLUC 0aPCR 0aSS 0aSBE 0aAP2 0aEndosperm 0aStarch synthesis 0aTranscription factor1 aXiao, Qianlin1 aZhang, Chunxia1 aDu, Jia1 aLi, Xiao1 aHuang, Huanhuan1 aWei, Bin1 aLi, Yangping1 aYu, Guowu1 aLiu, Hanmei1 aHu, Yufeng1 aLiu, Yinghong1 aZhang, Junjie1 aHuang, Yubi0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2017 Sept., v. 216 p.11-16dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2017.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245038400177300001600561520200800577592002802585650001102613650001302624650002802637650001902665650002002684650001402704650001502718650002002733650001402753650001702767650002002784650001402804650002302818650001302841650002402854700001902878700002502897700002202922700002002944700001502964700002202979700001803001700002003019700002103039700002003060773017903080856008303259852000903342655001203351IND60736479720221119150102.0220214e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073647972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2021.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez, Elizabeth Yakes10aAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics Nutrition Research Network: Rationale and Protocol for a Study to Validate the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Consensus-Derived Diagnostic Indicators For Adult And Pediatric Malnutrition and to Determine Optimal Registered Dietitian Nutritionist Staffing in Acute Care Hospital Settings  ap. 630-639.  aNo systematic, universally accepted method of diagnosing malnutrition in hospitalized patients exists, which may contribute to underdiagnosis, undertreatment, and poorer patient outcomes. To address this issue, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is conducting a cohort study to: assess the predictive validity of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition indicators for the diagnosis of adult and pediatric malnutrition in hospital settings; assess the interrater reliability of the indicators for the diagnosis of adult and pediatric malnutrition; and quantify the level of registered dietitian nutritionist care needed to improve patient outcomes. Up to 60 adult and 60 pediatric hospital sites will collect data to estimate level of registered dietitian nutritionist care, along with patient medical history and Malnutrition Screening Tool (adult) or STRONGkids (pediatric) results. A subset of 600 adult and 600 pediatric patients (∼1:1 screened as high- or low-risk for malnutrition) will be randomly selected for the indicators for the diagnosis of adult and pediatric malnutrition and Nutrition Focused Physical Exam data collection; 100 adult and 100 pediatric patients in this group will also undergo a bioelectrical impedance analysis measurement. Additional nutrition care and medical outcomes (eg, mortality and length of stay) will be collected for a 3-month period after the initial nutrition encounter. Multilevel linear, logistic, Poisson, or Cox regression models will be used to assess indicators for the diagnosis of adult and pediatric malnutrition validity and registered dietitian nutritionist staffing levels as appropriate for each medical outcome. Validation results will allow US clinicians to standardize the way they diagnose malnutrition in hospitalized patients, and the staffing data will support advocacy for available registered dietitian nutritionist-delivered malnutrition treatment to improve patient outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aadvocacy 3abioelectrical impedance 3acohort studies 3adata collection 3adietetics 3adietitians 3aenteral feeding 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3amedical history 3amortality 3anutrition research 3apatients 3aregression analysis1 aLong, Julie M.1 aLamers-Johnson, Erin1 aWoodcock, Lindsay1 aBliss, Courtney1 aLee, James1 aScott Parrott, J.1 aHand, Rosa K.1 aKelley, Kathryn1 aAbram, Jenica K.1 aSteiber, Alison0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2022 Mar., v. 122, no. 3 p.630-639dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2021.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008200164300001600246520172300262592002801985650002302013650001602036650001302052650001502065650002002080650001102100650002702111650003002138650001502168700001802183700001602201700001802217700001902235700001902254773009102273856004802364852000902412655001202421IND50061443720221117155624.0130319e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006144372DNAL7 a10.1007/s13258-012-0032-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jungeun10aRISA: a new web-tool for Rapid Identification of SSRs and Analysis of primers  ap. 583-590.  aThe simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are short tandem arrayed sequence motifs consisting of 2–6 bp, which are not only involved in causing human fatal diseases but also have various applications in plant genetic studies. Thanks to the advancements made in sequencing technology, now we can easily generate genomic/transcriptomic sequences in a shorter period of time. Therefore, trend to identify SSR markers needs up gradation to handle these high-throughput data. Unfortunately, existing web programs for identifying SSR markers are useful but they are unable to process high-throughput data. To overcome this disadvantage, we have constructed a web-based tool, RISA ( http://sol.kribb.re.kr/RISA/ ), with a goal of one-click service to identify SSR markers from high-throughput data (up to 200 Mbp). RISA controls automatic input and output pipeline by demon which combines the SSR classification and investigation by Robert Kofler (SciRoKo) to search SSRs and Primer3 to identify primers specific to SSRs simultaneously. In our test, 45,495 qualified primer sets specific to 47,070 SSRs were identified by RISA from whole Arabidopsis lyrata genome (about 207 Mbp) in 15 minutes. In results, it includes SSR statistics generated from user’s queries and SSR markers information along with primers suitable for their amplification. To support handling of large amount of results, RISA provides various filtering options such as motif length, repeat units, total length and PCR product size. Therefore, we propose that RISA minimizes labour-intensive works or any other considerations which can be required during the development of SSR markers without having deep understanding of computer system and/or algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis lyrata 3aDNA primers 3aInternet 3aalgorithms 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astatistics1 aChoi, Jae-Pil1 aAhmad, Raza1 aOh, Sang-Keun1 aKwon, Suk-Yoon1 aHur, Cheol-Goo0 tGenes & genomics.g2012 Dec., v. 34, no. 6 p.583-590dSpringer-Verlagx1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-012-0032-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009700170300001600267520078600283592002801069650002801097650002201125650001401147650001901161650001501180650001801195650001101213650001301224653000801237653000901245653000901254653000801263653000801271653001701279653001301296653001801309653003501327653001401362700001701376700001901393773009401412856008501506852000901591655001201600IND60552129320221122165411.0161020e20151010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055212932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOverwin, Heike10aBiotransformation of phloretin by amylosucrase yields three novel dihydrochalcone glucosides  ap. 103-106.  aGlycosylation is one of the most important tailoring reactions for natural products. It typically exerts profound direct or indirect effects on their biological activity. The dihydrochalcone phloretin and its known sugar derivatives, particularly phlori(d)zin, have been shown to influence various cellular processes. We found that a non-Leloir glycosyltransferase, amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea, is an excellent catalyst for the stereospecific glucosylation of phloretin at the 4’ position. Three novel phloretin derivatives were obtained, the first ones in which the sugar-aglycone bond possesses the configuration. A first biological characterization in a cell viability assay showed that each sugar attachment reduced the compound toxicity approximately two-fold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeisseria polysaccharea 3abiotransformation 3acatalysts 3acell viability 3aglucosides 3aglycosylation 3asugars 3atoxicity 0aAms 0aHPLC 0aHRMS 0aNMR 0aTLC 0aAmylosucrase 0aChalcone 0aGlycosylation 0aNon-Leloir glycosyltransferase 0aPhloretin1 aWray, Victor1 aHöfer, Bernd,0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 Oct. 10, v. 211 p.103-106dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003200153245007700185300001400262520101800276592002801294650001501322650001001337650001101347650001201358650002201370650004301392650001001435650001101445650001401456650004201470650001301512651001001525653002601535653001901561653001301580653001701593653002801610700002501638700003201663700001801695773011601713856008801829852000901917655001201926IND60552631820221119135100.0180830e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055263182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez Martínez, Cristina,10aUsefulness of protein analysis for detecting pathologies in bone remains  ap. 68-73.  aForensic pathology often uses osteobiography, which involves biological profiles based on a determination of the age, sex, constitution, pathological states and other anomalies (paleopathology) of subjects for identification purposes. In this paper, proteins were analysed in bone remains. A total of 45 long bones from 45 different cadavers (29 males, 16 females) with a mean age of 66.31 years (S.D.=19.48, range 20–97) were used to search for pathological biomarkers which are closely related to several diseases. The bones were removed from the cement niches of a cemetery in Murcia (south-eastern Spain), where they had lain for between 18 and 45 years (mean time 25.84 years, S.D.=8.91). After a specific extraction using Tris-Urea buffer, were measured using HPLC/MS/MS. Our results show that proteins resulting from tumoral diseases and bacterial and viral pathogens can be detected and identified in the skeletal remains, making them useful pathological biomarkers for constructing biological profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abones 3acement 3afemales 3aforensic sciences 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amales 3aniches 3apathogens 3apathological processes and conditions 3aproteins 3aSpain 0aForensic anthropology 0aIdentification 0aProteins 0aBone remains 0aPathological biomarkers1 aPrieto-Bonete, Gemma1 aPérez-Cárceles, María D.1 aLuna, Aurelio0 tForensic science international.g2016 Jan., v. 258 p.68-73dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013100161300001600292520110800308592002801416650002701444650001101471650001401482650002201496650002101518650001701539650002701556650001401583650001801597650001501615650001901630650001501649650001901664650001701683650001601700650001301716700001701729700001701746700002701763700001801790700002401808700002101832700002201853773014001875856008202015852000902097655001202106IND60627253820221119135342.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062725382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-018-3167-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Na10aPreparation of casein non-phosphopeptide–soybean polypeptide complex, its structure and emulsifying properties’ evaluation  ap. 355-363.  aThe objective of the present work was to improve emulsifying properties and methionine content of soybean protein. Chymotrypsin was used as a reaction catalyst to form a new protein complex from soybean polypeptide and casein non-phosphopeptide. The degrees of hydrolysis and hydrophobicity were measured and their relationship with physicochemical properties such as emulsifiability was studied. Instrumental or chemical analyses were also performed to determine the amino acid content and tissue changes of casein non-phosphopeptide–soybean polypeptide complex (CNPSPC).The results show that casein non-phosphopeptides and soybean polypeptides can aggregate together to generate new chemical bonds. The emulsifying activity and emulsion stability of CNPSPC were higher than those of soybean polypeptides. Microstructure analysis showed many network pores distributed in casein non-phosphopeptide–soybean polypeptide complex sample. In addition, analysis of amino acid content in CPSPC showed that methionine accounted for 1.8% of all amino acids (w:w), and it is 216.1% more than soy polypeptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3acasein 3acatalysts 3achemical analysis 3achemical bonding 3achymotrypsin 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3afood research 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amethionine 3amicrostructure 3apolypeptides 3asoy protein 3asoybeans1 aGuo, Qing-qi1 aShi, Yan-guo1 aPiekoszewski, Wojciech1 aGuan, Hua-nan1 aKalenik, Tatiana K.1 aMadej, Katarzyna1 aMotkina, Elena V.0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2019 Feb., v. 245, no. 2 p.355-363dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-018-3167-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245007300208300001600281500001400297500001100311520135800322592002801680650002001708650001601728650001401744650001901758650001401777650001001791650001301801650001601814650001601830650002001846650001001866650000901876650001601885650001301901650001501914650001101929650001901940650001701959650001501976650002001991700001702011700001802028773011302046856008202159852000902241655001202250IND60720797920221120134917.0201220e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072079792DNAL7 a10.1007/s40502-020-00557-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanker, Arun K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5635-878X10aEpigenetics and transgenerational memory in plants under heat stress  ap. 583-593.  aNAL-light  aReview  aThe concept that plants are cognitive and intelligent organisms capable of learning and retaining memory may sound alien to most plant scientists mainly because of the paucity of literature in the subject and also due to the complexity of the subject. Plants are sessile organisms and so have intricate physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which they react to abiotic stress and it is possible that epigenetics has an important role in response to stress stimuli in plants. Heat stress is a consequence of the changing climate now and can affect plant growth and productivity in agriculture crops. Heat stress induced epigenetic modifications caused by DNA methylation, histone restructuring, chromatin remodeling is known to induct memory in plants that can be retained in future generations to counter heat stress effectively. Expression of genes to a large extant are influenced by the chromatin environment and there are states of chromatin dynamics that can dictate the specific genes that are stress responsive for resultant adaptation to heat stress. In this minireview we will discuss on transgenerational memory and the regulation of responses to heat by epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, modifications and variations in histones and histone chaperones, chromatin remodeling, small RNA and long noncoding RNAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aagriculture 3achromatin 3aclimate change 3acognition 3acrops 3adynamics 3aenvironment 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ahistones 3aliterature 3amemory 3anon-coding RNA 3aplant growth 3ascientists 3astress response1 aBhanu, Divya1 aMaheswari, M.0 tPlant Physiology Reports.g2020 Dec., v. 25, no. 4 p.583-593dSpringer IndiawJournal:27098x2662-253X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40502-020-00557-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003000112245009900142300001600241520121100257592002801468650002001496650001001516650002001526650002501546650001501571650001201586650001001598650001401608650001801622650001601640650001401656650002201670650002001692653001801712653002001730653001601750653002501766653001901791653001401810700002801824700002501852700002801877773012001905852000902025655001202034IND60597732920221119014544.0180625e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059773292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 ado Amaral, Silvana Vargas10aBody doubles: an integrative taxonomic approach reveals new sibling species of land planarians  ap. 533-550.  aRecords of cryptic species have continued to emerge in the scientific literature, often revealed by the use of molecular phylogenetic analyses in an integrative taxonomic approach. This study addresses a group of four striped flatworms from the genus Pasipha Ogren & Kawakatsu, showing a pale median stripe on a dark dorsal surface. Based on morphological and molecular analyses from the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI), we establish that we are dealing with sibling species that are closely related to P. brevilineata Leal-Zanchet, Rossi & Alvarenga, 2012, a recently described species with a similar colour pattern. Thus, we describe three of the studied flatworms as new species and propose one new unconfirmed candidate species based on molecular data. In addition, sequence analysis revealed 40 nucleotide autapomorphies supporting the species studied herein. Considering anatomical and histological features, the three new species are differentiated from their congeners mainly by details of the copulatory apparatus, such as the occurrence of an epithelium of pseudostratified appearance lining the female atrium and the shape and position of the proximal portion of the prostatic vesicle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatyhelminthes 3acolor 3acryptic species 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aepithelium 3afemales 3agenes 3ahistology 3ainvertebrates 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3asibling species 0aDNA barcoding 0acryptic species 0aGeoplaninae 0aintegrative taxonomy 0aland flatworms 0aphylogeny1 aRibeiro, Giovana Gamino1 aValiati, Victor Hugo1 aLeal-Zanchet, Ana Maria0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2018 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.533-550dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957319x1447-26007nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012800176300001400304520117300318592002801491650002201519650002501541650001401566650001201580650001001592650001301602650001601615650001601631650001201647700001801659700002601677773008701703856008601790852000901876655001201885IND50067573120221118011731.0141111e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006757312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaiswal, Amit Kumar10aKinetic evaluation of colour, texture, polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of Irish York cabbage after blanching treatment  ap. 63-72.  aYork cabbage was blanched between 80 and 100°C with an increment of 5°C for up to 14min and kinetics of the different physicochemical properties were studied. Significant reductions in the texture, colour, polyphenols (PPs) and antioxidant (AO) capacity were observed due to blanching. Total phenolic and flavonoid content retained ranged from 19.6–24.5% to 22.0–25.7%, respectively. Heavy losses in the AO capacity of 74.0–82.0% also occurred as a result of blanching. Blanching caused a significant reduction in firmness of 24.0–73.2% and a similar trend was also observed for colour. Kinetic evaluation of degradation was carried out for all the studied quality parameters. The fractional conversion first-order reaction model showed a good fit for the different studied parameters, with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.892 to 0.992, except for texture and colour, which followed first order and zero order kinetics, respectively. The temperature effect followed the Arrhenius law, with activation energies for polyphenolic content, AO capacity, colour and texture calculated as 9.22–11.5, 9.05–35.05, 15.73 and 33.8kJ/molK, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aantioxidant activity 3ablanching 3acabbage 3acolor 3afirmness 3apolyphenols 3atemperature 3atexture1 aGupta, Shilpi1 aAbu-Ghannam, Nissreen0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 131, no. 1 p.63-72dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03773naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245006700162300001600229500002000245500000900265520169000274592002801964596006501992596008402057596005002141596009402191596009002285596005602375650002002431650001202451650001302463650001402476650001102490650001702501650001702518650002102535650002402556650002202580650003702602650001402639650001202653650002902665650001702694650001502711650002402726650002002750650001302770651001002783700002202793700001502815700001502830700001202845700002002857700001602877700001802893773013102911856008403042852000903126655001203135IND60665398620221122114044.0220805e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066539862DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2017.08.04952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Kai10aGenetic Improvement of Key Agronomic Traits in Melilotus albus  ap. 285-294.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aMelilotus albus Medik. is a legume species with potential to be used as a forage or conserved fodder in Northwest China. Breeding M. albus as a forage crop is focused on simultaneously improving forage yield and reducing coumarin (Cou) content. The goal of the present study was to estimate genotypic variation for several key agronomic traits and to evaluate the impact of single‐trait selection and Smith–Hazel‐index‐based multitrait selection for herbage dry weight (DW), plant height (PH), stem number (SN), and leaf area (LA). A quantitative genetic analysis was conducted on trait measurements from 25 half‐sib (HS) families evaluated at Yuzhong and Linze, in China. Significant (P < 0.05) genotypic variation among the HS families for all traits was observed. There was also significant (P < 0.05) genotype × environment interaction for all traits except for LA. The predicted genetic gain, based on estimated genotypic variance, for single‐trait selection varied from 2.3 to 30.3% per selection cycle. Pattern analysis of the HS family × multitrait best linear unbiased prediction matrix provided a graphical summary of the association among the traits, as well as the four HS family groups generated from clustering. Some members within Group 1 could be crossed to generate a breeding population to be used in recurrent selection for M. albus cultivar development in Northwest China. The applicability of a Smith–Hazel selection index to increase expression of the traits DW, PH, and SN and reduce LA, indirectly reducing Cou content, was confirmed. This index enabled identification of families for increasing key biomass traits and decreasing Cou production.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014CB138704cNational Basic Research Program (973) of China  a20120304205cSpecial Fund for Agro‐scientific Research in the Public Interest  a31572453cNatural Science Foundation of China  aSKLGAE201702cOpen Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro‐ecosystems  aIRT_17R50cProgram for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University  aIAM201703cOpen Project Program of Arid Meteorology 3aMelilotus albus 3abiomass 3acoumarin 3acultivars 3aforage 3aforage crops 3aforage yield 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aleaf area 3alegumes 3amultiple trait selection 3aplant height 3aprediction 3arecurrent selection 3aselection index 3avariance 3aChina1 aJahufer, M.

This study aims to acquire insight into the degree to which nutritional counselling and Iron and Folic Acid supplementation (IFAs) policy guidelines during pregnancy have been implemented as intended and the challenges to implementation fidelity. METHODS: Data were collected in rural Uasin Gishu County in the western part of Kenya through document analysis, questionnaires among intervention recipients (n = 188) and semi-structured interviews with programme implementers (n = 6). Data collection and analysis were guided by an implementation fidelity framework. We specifically evaluated adherence to intervention design (content, frequency, duration and coverage), exposure or dosage, quality of delivery and participant responsiveness. RESULTS: Coverage of nutritional counselling and IFAs policy is widespread. However, partial provision was reported in all the intervention components. Only 10% accessed intervention within the first trimester as recommended by policy guidelines, only 28% reported receiving nutritional counselling, only 18 and 15% of the respondents received 90 or more iron and folic acid pills respectively during their entire pregnancy period, and 66% completed taking the IFAs pills that were issued to them. Late initial bookings to antenatal care, drug stock shortage, staff shortage and long queues, confusing dosage instructions, side effects of the pills and issuing of many pills at one go, were established to be the main challenges to effective implementation fidelity. Anticipated health consequences and emphasis by the health officer to comply with instructions were established to be motivations for adherence to nutritional counselling and IFAs guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation fidelity of nutritional counselling and IFAs policy in Kenya is generally weak. There is need for approaches to enhance early access to interventions, enhance stock availability, provide mitigation measures for the side effects, as well as intensify nutritional counselling to promote the consumption of micronutrient-rich food sources available in the local environment to substitute for the shortage of nutritional supplements and low compliance to IFAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3adata collection 3adrugs 3afolic acid 3airon 3aissues and policy 3apregnancy 3aprenatal care 3aKenya1 aNangulu, Anne Kisaka1 aBroerse, Jacqueline E.

QMPSB was identified in Queensland, Australia on plant material packaged as herbal incense. The identification of QMPSB was initially hampered due to trans-esterification occurring in the extraction solvent. An investigation of the trans-esterification of QMPSB in methanol and ethanol was conducted and analytical data for the respective methyl and ethyl esters are reported. Analytical data is presented for two other compounds detected on seized plant material packaged as herbal incense: the synthetic cannabimimetic 1-[(N-methylpiperidin-2-yl)methyl]-3-(4-methyl-1-naphthoyl)indole (MAM-1220) and the JWH-081 analogue 1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-3-(4-methoxy-1-naphthoyl)indole (CHM-081).  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aesters 3aethanol 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents 3aQueensland 0a8-Quinolinyl 4-methyl-3-(1-piperidinylsulfonyl)benzoate (QMPSB) 0aMethyl AM-1220 0aSynthetic cannabinoid 0aHerbal Incense 0aArylsulfonamides1 aBoyd, Sue1 aAtkinson, Sarah1 aWolf, Jenna1 aSlottje, Pim M.1 aGoodchild, Katrina1 aMcGowan, Jenny0 tForensic science international.g2016 Mar., v. 260 p.40-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011200176300001400288520100800302592002801310650001801338650001901356650001101375650002401386650001301410650000901423650001801432650001101450650002601461650002901487650001901516650001601535650001001551650001501561650001501576653001701591653003101608653003701639700002801676700001901704700002601723773012301749856008301872852000901955655001201964IND60532403120221116173858.0190318e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053240312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2014.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreiro-Domínguez, N.10aEffect of lime and sewage sludge fertilisation on tree and understory interaction in a silvopastoral system  ap. 72-79.  aThe productivity of the components of a silvopastoral system could be limited by the low soil fertility and the presence of shrubs in the land before planting. However, the understory vegetation can be modified by improving soil chemical properties when lime and organic fertilizers such as sewage sludge are applied. This study evaluated the effect of liming and the application of two doses of sewage sludge (50kgtotalNha−1 or 100kgtotalNha−1) on changes in soil chemical properties, tree growth and understory production as compared to the no fertilisation treatment in a silvopastoral system established in a reforested area with Pinus radiata D. Don. The results of this experiment show that the improved soil fertility caused by liming and fertilisation with sewage sludge modifies the proportion of the herbaceous/shrubs component in the understory, and promotes facilitation mechanisms which have a positive impact on the understory forage quality, tree growth as well as reducing fire risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus radiata 3aforage quality 3aliming 3aorganic fertilizers 3aplanting 3arisk 3asewage sludge 3ashrubs 3asilvopastoral systems 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil fertility 3atree growth 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avegetation 0aSoil changes 0aTrees pasture productivity 0aUnderstory quality and fire risk1 aRigueiro-Rodríguez, A.1 aBianchetto, E.1 aMosquera-Losada, M.R.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 188 p.72-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2014.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245008200165300001300247520176400260592002802024650001302052650001402065650001302079650001202092650001102104650001902115650003102134650001402165650001302179653002102192653002602213653002202239653001802261773010002279856007802379852000902457655001202466IND60481786820221120042054.0160210e20150128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048178682DNAL7 a10.1515/johh-2015-00052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiedema, Sape A.12aA head loss model for homogeneous slurry transport for medium sized particles  ap. 1-12.  aSlurry transport in horizontal and vertical pipelines is one of the major means of transport of sands and gravels in the dredging industry. There exist 4 main flow regimes, the fixed or stationary bed regime, the sliding bed regime, the heterogeneous flow regime and the homogeneous flow regime. Of course the transitions between the regimes are not very sharp, depending on parameters like the particle size distribution. The focus in this paper is on the homogeneous regime. Often the so called equivalent liquid model (ELM) is applied, however many researchers found hydraulic gradients smaller than predicted with the ELM, but larger that the hydraulic gradient of liquid. Talmon (2011, 2013) derived a fundamental equation (method) proving that the hydraulic gradient can be smaller than predicted by the ELM, based on the assumption of a particle free viscous sub-layer. He used a 2D velocity distribution without a concentration distribution. In this paper 5 methods are described (and derived) to determine the hydraulic gradient in homogeneous flow, of which the last method is based on pipe flow with a concentration distribution. It appears that the use of von Driest (Schlichting, 1968) damping, if present, dominates the results, however applying a concentration distribution may neutralise this. The final equation contains both the damping and a concentration distribution giving the possibility to calibrate the constant in the equation with experimental data. The final equation is flexible and gives a good match with experimental results in vertical and horizontal pipelines for a value of ACᵥ = 1.3. Data of horizontal experiments Dₚ = 0.05-0.30 m, d = 0.04 mm, vertical experiments Dp = 0.026 m, d = 0.125, 0.345, 0.560, and 0.750 mm.  aPublisher supplied data 3adredging 3aequations 3aindustry 3aliquids 3amodels 3aneutralization 3aparticle size distribution 3apipelines 3aslurries 0aSlurry transport 0aHomogeneous transport 0aViscous sub layer 0aMixing length0 tVodohospodársky časopis.g2015 Jan. 28, v. 63, no. 1 p.1-12dDe Gruyter Openx0042-790X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/johh-2015-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013600170300001600306520129200322592002801614650001601642650001901658650003101677650001701708650002901725650001201754650001801766650002901784651001101813651001101824653002101835653002901856653002201885773007801907856008301985852000902068655001202077IND60546202920221123003836.0160903e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054620292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2014.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlindheim, Bernt12aA missing link? The case of Norway and Sweden: Does increased renewable energy production impact domestic greenhouse gas emissions?  ap. 207-215.  aThis article examines how the EU׳s RES directive11The directive for the promotion of renewable energy sources; – the “RES directive”. will impact domestic greenhouse gas emissions in Norway and Sweden by 2020. The directive aims for a higher RES share in the energy consumption mix, and Norway and Sweden have established a common electricity certificate scheme to help achieve these RES goals. In terms of how these two national RES plans will impact domestic emissions by 2020, factors such as nuclear power, consumption changes and the energy balance must be considered. The most practical approach to evaluate the plans’ impact on emissions is to focus on changes in carbon-based consumption within the three directive sectors.The Norwegian RES action plan will not affect domestic emissions unless the electricity surplus generated by the certificate market is used to phase out fossil fuels in domestic sectors beyond the scope of the RES directive. The use of electricity to phase out fossil fuel consumption in the offshore sector would substantially reduce Norwegian emissions figures. The Swedish plan would positively impact Swedish greenhouse gas emissions; however, this impact is limited, primarily because a substantial increase in energy consumption is expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy balance 3aenergy use and consumption 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amarkets 3anuclear power 3arenewable energy sources 3aNorway 3aSweden 0aRenewable energy 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aNorway and Sweden0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 Feb., v. 77 p.207-215dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001300181245009700194300001800291500002000309506007600329520179200405592002802197506003702225650002602262650002702288650002802315650001202343650001902355650002102374650002002395650001702415650001102432650000902443650001802452650001202470650001302482650001502495650001102510650002302521700002702544700002302571700001702594700002002611700003102631773011802662856007402780852000902854655001202863IND60588236820221207053616.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058823682DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.140962doi7 aPMC54906602pmcid7 a284676842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aCardiac contractility, motor function, and cross‐bridge kinetics in N47K‐RLC mutant mice  ap. 1897-1913.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have investigated the physiology and mechanical profiles of skinned papillary muscle fibers from transgenic mice expressing the N47K mutation in the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), shown to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in humans. The results were compared with wild‐type (WT) mice, both expressing the human ventricular RLC. Rate constants of a cross‐bridge (XB) cycle were deduced from tension transients induced by sinusoidal length changes during maximal Ca²⁺ activation, and were studied as a function of MgATP, MgADP, and Pi concentrations. N47K mutant showed slower XB cycles but higher actin‐activated ATPase activity compared with WT. Consequently, N47K exhibited larger tension than WT. K₀ (ADP association constant) and K₄ (equilibrium constant of force generation) were larger in N47K, and K₁ (ATP association constant) was slightly larger in N47K vs. WT, demonstrating stronger nucleotide binding and force generation abilities of the mutant, but no changes in rigor acto‐myosin binding were observed. Tension per XB was similar among groups, but N47K exhibited more XB distribution in the attached state. Larger values of tension and higher ATPase in N47K suggested that more cross‐bridges participated in tension production in the mutant myocardium compared with WT. In vivo analysis of heart function, performed in ~ 12.5‐month‐old mice by echocardiography and invasive hemodynamics, demonstrated a significant decrease in dP/dtₘₐₓ–end‐diastolic volume relationship, indicating a depression of ventricular contractility in N47K mice. Our findings suggest that the N47K mutation exerts its action through direct alterations of myosin motor function that ultimately result in pathological hypertrophic remodeling in N47K hearts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acalcium 3acardiomyopathy 3aechocardiography 3aenzyme activity 3ahemodynamics 3ahumans 3amice 3amuscle fibers 3amutants 3amutation 3amyocardium 3amyosin 3atransgenic animals1 aKazmierczak, Katarzyna1 aYuan, Chen‐Ching1 aYadav, Sunil1 aKawai, Masataka1 aSzczesna‐Cordary, Danuta0 tFEBS journal.g2017 June, v. 284, no. 12 p.1897-1913dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.140963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04269naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001700170245006300187300001400250500001500264520150800279592002801787650000901815650001301824650003001837650001401867650001101881650001001892650001101902650001801913650001701931650000801948650001101956650001701967650002601984650001602010650001202026650001302038650001602051650001302067650003202080650002802112650001202140650003402152650002802186650002202214650004902236650002302285650004002308650002602348650005202374650004502426650003302471650005402504650002602558650003602584650002502620650004802645650002302693650005802716650001402774653001002788653003002798653000902828653001002837653001102847653001502858653001402873653003002887700002002917700001702937700001602954700002402970700002002994700001903014700002003033700001903053700001803072700001803090700002003108773010803128856008603236852000903322655001203331IND50066214720221120232926.0190318e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006621472DNAL7 a235876682pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Kun-Hee10aCyp1a reporter zebrafish reveals target tissues for dioxin  ap. 57-65.  a2019-12-06  a2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the unintentional byproduct of various industrial processes, is classified as human carcinogen and could disrupt reproductive, developmental and endocrine systems. Induction of cyp1a1 is used as an indicator of TCDD exposure. We sought to determine tissues that are vulnerable to TCDD toxicity using a transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. We inserted a nuclear enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (EGFP) into the start codon of a zebrafish cyp1a gene in a fosmid clone using DNA recombineering. The resulting recombineered fosmid was then used to generate cyp1a reporter zebrafish, embryos of which were exposed to TCDD. Expression pattern of EGFP in the reporter zebrafish mirrored that of endogenous cyp1a mRNA. In addition, exposure of the embryos to TCDD at as low as 10pM for 72h, which does not elicit morphological abnormalities of embryos, markedly increased GFP expression. Furthermore, the reporter embryos responded to other AhR ligands as well. Exposure of the embryos to TCDD revealed previously reported (the cardiovascular system, liver, pancreas, kidney, swim bladder and skin) and unreported target tissues (retinal bipolar cells, otic vesicle, lateral line, cloaca and pectoral fin bud) for TCDD. Transgenic cyp1a reporter zebrafish we have developed can further understanding of ecotoxicological relevance and human health risks by TCDD. In addition, they could be used to identify agonists of AhR and antidotes to TCDD toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3apancreas 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aantidotes 3acloaca 3aliver 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3aswim bladder 3aDNA 3amodels 3ahuman health 3acardiovascular system 3astart codon 3akidneys 3atoxicity 3aDanio rerio 3aagonists 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 2aAnimal Finsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterialxgenetics 2aCloacaxmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xmetabolism 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aLateral Line Systemxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRetinaxmetabolism 2aPolychlorinated Dibenzodioxinsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aZebrafish 0agenes 0aGreen fluorescent protein 0aTCDD 0aCyp1a 0aDioxin 0aTransgenic 0aZebrafish 0aAryl hydrocarbon receptor1 aPark, Hye-Jeong1 aKim, Jin Hee1 aKim, Suhyun1 aWilliams, Darren R.1 aKim, Myeong-Kyu1 aJung, Young Do1 aTeraoka, Hiroki1 aPark, Hae-Chul1 aChoy, Hyon E.1 aShin, Boo Ahn1 aChoi, Seok-Yong0 tAquatic toxicology.g2013 June 15, v. 134-135 p.57-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008000169300001600249520102300265592002801288650001901316650001101335650001501346650003401361650002201395650001701417650001201434650001501446650001501461650002001476650002001496650001501516653003001531653001901561653002701580653001501607700005901622700001901681700001501700700001401715700001401729700001801743700001801761773009701779856008701876852000901963655001201972IND60634627820221117233922.0190328e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063462782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Pucheng12aA high-energy-density and long-stable-performance zinc-air fuel cell system  ap. 124-129.  aMetal-air fuel cells are regarded as potential alternatives of power supply due to their high specific energy. However, the excessive accumulation of reaction products leads to performance degradation, low energy density, and short service life, hampering more widespread application. This study focuses on enormously increasing the fuel cell system energy density by electrolyte isolation and management. Filters are used to isolate metal oxide (including ZnO, MgO, and Al2O3) from supersaturated electrolyte solutions in fuel cells. The filtration efficiency is close to 100%. The flow field is optimized to suppress the anode passivation. In zinc-air fuel cells (ZAFCs), the ratio of discharge capacity to electrolyte volume (electrolyte capacity) is up to 1025 Ah L−1, and the discharging voltage still remains stable. The zinc-air fuel cell system (ZAFCS) exhibits high energy density, high stability, and low cost, rendering this type of metal-air fuel cell a promising energy storage in electric vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aanodes 3adurability 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectrolytes 3afilters 3afiltration 3afuel cells 3amagnesium oxide 3aspecific energy 3azinc oxide 0aZinc-air fuel cell system 0aEnergy density 0aElectrolyte management 0aFlow field1 aHuang, Shangwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8262-45001 aChen, Dongfang1 aLi, Yuehua1 aWu, Ziyao1 aRen, Peng1 aWang, Keliang1 aJia, Xiaoning0 tApplied energy.g2019 May 01, v. 241 p.124-129dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012000163300001600283520145500299592002801754650001001782650002301792650001101815650002201826650001801848650001201866650001901878650001701897650001001914650001101924650001101935650001701946650001101963650002101974650001001995650000902005651002002014653002802034653001802062653001802080653001102098653001702109653003102126700001902157700002102176700001502197700001802212700001802230773011202248856008202360852000902442655001202451IND60544130520221120224524.0190415e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054413052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2015.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Dong10aHydrogen sulphide (H2S) releasing capacity of essential oils isolated from organosulphur rich fruits and vegetables  ap. 634-640.  aHydrogen sulphide (H2S) is a gaseous signalling molecule with multiple biological functions in the human body. Previous research demonstrates that diallyl trisulphide (DATS) and diallyl disulphide (the two major compounds of garlic oil) can be metabolized to generate H2S in biological conditions and modulate cell signalling. In this paper, a fluorescent method for quantification of H2S releasing capacity in cell lines was developed. MCF-7 cells in 96 well plate were incubated with a H2S probe BCu for 3 h, then treated with H2S donors for 2 h, which would be metabolized by the cells and produce H2S. The resulting H2S was captured by the probe and turn on its fluorescence, which was measured with a microplate reader. Linear dose response could be established between organosulphur concentration and fluorescence intensity, and the H2S releasing capacity of a sample was determined by comparing the slope of the regression curve with that of a DATS standard obtained in parallel. With this method, the H2S releasing capacity of ten organosulphur rich fruits and vegetables (garlic, red onion, yellow onion, scallion, shallot, leek, spring onion, Chinese chives, durian, and stinky beans) were evaluated and ranked. Stinky beans (a vegetable from Southeast Asia) topped the ranking with very high H2S releasing capacity, followed by garlic and yellow onion. Our work provides new thinking on the health benefits of organosulphur-rich foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeans 3acell communication 3achives 3adiallyl disulfide 3adose response 3adurians 3aessential oils 3afluorescence 3afoods 3afruits 3agarlic 3agreen onions 3ahumans 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aleeks 3aoils 3aSouth East Asia 0aHydrogen sulphide (H2S) 0aOrganosulphur 0aPolysulphides 0aGarlic 0aStinky beans 0aDiallyl trisulphide (DATS)1 aWang, Xiaorou,1 aTocmo, Restituto1 aWu, Haixia1 aDeng, Lih-Wen1 aHuang, Dejian0 tJournal of functional foods.g2015 Apr., v. 14 p.634-640dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2015.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03732naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011900160300001800279520203900297592002802336596009302364596008302457596008302540596005902623650000802682650001902690650001802709650002602727650002302753650001002776650001702786650001702803650001602820650001102836651001002847700001302857700001702870700001702887700001602904700001502920700001802935700001602953700001302969700001202982773014002994856008303134852000903217655001203226IND60754018320221121125212.0211021e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075401832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-021-00931-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xin10aEffects of air pollutant emission on the prevalence of respiratory and circulatory system diseases in Linyi, China  ap. 4475-4491.  aAs a typical industrial city, Linyi has suffered severe atmospheric pollution in recent years. Meanwhile, a high incidence of respiratory and circulatory diseases has been observed in Linyi. The relationship between air pollutants and the prevalence of respiratory and circulatory system diseases in Linyi is still unclear, and therefore, there is an urgent need to assess the human health risks associated with air pollutants. In this study, the number of outpatient visits and spatial distribution of respiratory and circulatory diseases were first investigated. To clarify the correlation between diseases and air pollutant emissions, the residential intake fraction (IF) of air pollutants was calculated. The results showed that circulatory and respiratory diseases accounted for 62.32% of the total causes of death in 2015. The incidence of respiratory diseases was high in the winter, and outpatient visits were observed for more males (60.9%) than females (39.1%). The spatial distribution suggested that outpatient visits for respiratory and circulatory diseases were concentrated in the main urban area of Linyi, including the Hedong District, Lanshan District, and Luozhuang District, and especially at the junction of these three areas. After calculating the IF combined with the characteristics of pollution sources, meteorological conditions, and population data, a high IF value was concentrated in urban and suburban areas, which was consistent with the high incidence of diseases. Moreover, high R values and a significant correlation (R > 0.6, p < 0.05) between outpatient visits and residential IF of air pollutants imply similar spatial distributions of outpatient visits and IF value of residents. The spatial similarity of air pollution and outpatient visits suggested that future air pollution control policies should better reflect the health risks of spatial hotspots. This study can provide a potentially important reference for environmental management and air pollution-related health interventions.  aPublisher supplied data  a16K01ESPCTcState Key Joint Laboratory of Environmental Simulation and Pollution Control  aDQGG0209-07cNational Research Program for Key Issues in Air Pollution Control  aDQGG0304-07cNational Research Program for Key Issues in Air Pollution Control  a42075183cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair pollution control 3acirculatory system 3adeath 3ageochemistry 3ahuman health 3aurban areas 3awinter 3aChina1 aLi, Dong1 aFeng, Meihui1 aLiu, Houfeng1 aLi, Hongmei1 aYang, Jing1 aWu, Pengcheng1 aLei, Xunjie1 aWei, Min1 aBo, Xin0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2021 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.4475-4491dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870049x0269-40427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-021-00931-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03980naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245015000162500001400312520243600326592002802762650002102790650001802811650001402829650001402843650001702857650001402874650001202888650001002900650002002910650001902930650001502949650002102964650001602985650002503001650001703026650002903043650000903072650001403081700003103095700002703126700002403153700003303177700002603210700003303236773012203269856007403391852000903465655001203474IND60729398420221117204906.0210228e20210122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072939842DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130203212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopiasz, Łukasz 10aEffects of Dietary Oat Beta-Glucans on Colon Apoptosis and Autophagy through TLRs and Dectin-1 Signaling Pathways—Crohn’s Disease Model Study  aNAL-light  aBackground: Crohn’s disease (CD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract with alternating periods of exacerbation and remission. The aim of this study was to determine the time-dependent effects of dietary oat beta-glucans on colon apoptosis and autophagy in the CD rat model. Methods: A total of 150 Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into two main groups: healthy control (H) and a TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzosulfonic acid)-induced colitis (C) group, both including subgroups fed with feed without beta-glucans (βG−) or feed supplemented with low- (βGl) or high-molar-mass oat beta-glucans (βGh) for 3, 7, or 21 days. The expression of autophagy (LC3B) and apoptosis (Caspase-3) markers, as well as Toll-like (TLRs) and Dectin-1 receptors, in the colon epithelial cells, was determined using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Results: The results showed that in rats with colitis, after 3 days of induction of inflammation, the expression of Caspase-3 and LC3B in intestinal epithelial cells did not change, while that of TLR 4 and Dectin-1 decreased. Beta-glucan supplementation caused an increase in the expression of TLR 5 and Dectin-1 with no changes in the expression of Caspase-3 and LC3B. After 7 days, a high expression of Caspase-3 was observed in the colitis-induced animals without any changes in the expression of LC3B and TLRs, and simultaneously, a decrease in Dectin-1 expression was observed. The consumption of feed with βGl or βGh resulted in a decrease in Caspase-3 expression and an increase in TLR 5 expression in the CβGl group, with no change in the expression of LC3B and TLR 4. After 21 days, the expression of Caspase-3 and TLRs was not changed by colitis, while that of LC3B and Dectin-1 was decreased. Feed supplementation with βGh resulted in an increase in the expression of both Caspase-3 and LC3B, while the consumption of feed with βGh and βGl increased Dectin-1 expression. However, regardless of the type of nutritional intervention, the expression of TLRs did not change after 21 days. Conclusions: Dietary intake of βGl and βGh significantly reduced colitis by time-dependent modification of autophagy and apoptosis, with βGI exhibiting a stronger effect on apoptosis and βGh on autophagy. The mechanism of this action may be based on the activation of TLRs and Dectin-1 receptor and depends on the period of exacerbation or remission of CD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abeta-glucans 3acaspase-3 3acolitis 3acolon 3adigestive tract 3adisease models 3aepithelium 3afeed supplements 3afood intake 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3anutritional intervention 3aoats 3aremission1 aDziendzikowska, Katarzyna 1 aGajewska, Małgorzata 1 aOczkowski, Michał 1 aMajchrzak-Kuligowska, Kinga 1 aKrólikowski, Tomasz 1 aGromadzka-Ostrowska, Joanna 0 tNutrients.g2021 Jan. 22, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130203213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011200154300002000266520123300286592002801519650002201547650001301569650001301582650002101595650002901616650001301645650001801658650001401676650001101690650000701701650001301708650001601721700001701737700001701754773012401771856007401895852000901969655001201978IND60642099920221119042102.0190506e20170811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064209992DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07518a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Min10aStudy on the kinetics of S(iv) oxidation in the basic aluminum sulfate wet flue gas desulfurization process  ap. 39341-39348.  aThrough a laboratory-scale bubbling apparatus, the kinetics of S(iv) oxidation related to the basic aluminum sulfate (BAS) wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process were investigated by varying the components of the BAS solution, concentration of S(iv), temperature, air flow and oxygen partial pressure. The experimental findings showed that the oxidation rate of S(iv) slightly increased with pH as the basicity increased, while increasing the amount of aluminum could weaken the oxidation rate of sulfite. Moreover, the general reaction rate was found to be 0.21 order in S(iv) and first-order in oxygen, respectively. The apparent activation energy was calculated to be 24.5 kJ mol⁻¹. Combined with the kinetic model of S(iv) oxidation proposed, we found that the general oxidation rate of S(iv) in BAS rich solution was controlled by the mass transfer of oxygen accompanied with a rapid chemical reaction, which was verified by the Hatta number (around 1.4). As a result, the intrinsic kinetics were investigated, indicating the reaction orders with respect to S(iv) and oxygen to be 0.42 and 1.0, respectively. The results would be valuable for process optimization or industrial design during the BAS wet FGD process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aair flow 3aaluminum 3aaluminum sulfate 3aflue gas desulfurization 3akinetics 3amass transfer 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3asulfites 3atemperature1 aDeng, Xianhe1 aHe, Feiqiang0 tRSC advances.g2017 Aug. 11, v. 7, no. 62 p.39341-39348dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07518a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009900157300001800256500001400274520134300288592002801631650001501659650001501674650002001689650001501709650001401724650002101738650001201759650001201771650001301783650002601796700001901822700001701841700001901858700001401877773011801891856007402009852000902083655001202092IND60588237020221120195455.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058823702DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.140882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhat, Audesh10aRev7, the regulatory subunit of Polζ, undergoes UV‐induced and Cul4‐dependent degradation  ap. 1790-1803.  aEDITORIAL  aIn eukaryotic cells, Rev7 interacts with Rev3 and functions as a regulatory subunit of Polζ, a translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerase. In addition to its role in TLS, mammalian Rev7, also known as Mad2B/Mad2L2, participates in multiple cellular activities including cell cycle progression and double‐strand break repair through its interaction with several proteins. Here we show that in mammalian cells, Rev7 undergoes ubiquitin/proteasome‐mediated degradation upon UV irradiation in a time‐dependent manner. We identified the Rev7 N‐terminal destruction box as the degron and Cul4A/B as putative E3 ligases in this process. We also show that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway protein HR23B physically interacts and colocalizes with Rev7 in the nuclear foci after UV irradiation and protects Rev7 from accelerated degradation. Furthermore, a similar Rev7 degradation profile was observed in cells treated with the UV‐mimetic agent 4‐nitroquinoline 1‐oxide but not with cisplatin or camptothecin, suggesting a role of the NER pathway protein(s) in UV‐induced Rev7 degradation. These data and the observation that cells deficient in Rev7 are sensitized to UV irradiation while excessive Rev7 protects cells from UV‐induced DNA damage provide a new insight into the potential interplay between TLS and NER.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3acell cycle 3acisplatin 3aeukaryotic cells 3aligases 3amammals 3aproteins 3aultraviolet radiation1 aQin, Zhoushuai1 aWang, Guifen1 aChen, Wangyang1 aXiao, Wei0 tFEBS journal.g2017 June, v. 284, no. 12 p.1790-1803dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.140883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03889naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100001800178245010600196300001600302520177500318592002802093650002002121650002402141650002402165650002802189650001002217650001902227650001102246650002602257650001302283650001402296650000902310650002402319650001602343650000902359650004502368650002402413650001802437650001102455650002202466650001102488650002402499650000902523650001602532650002602548650004202574650002602616650001602642650001402658650003202672650003102704650001702735650001702752650005802769700002002827700002202847700002602869700002102895700002102916700002102937773009602958856009303054990002303147852000903170655001203179IND60088957920221116210002.0141102e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008895792DNAL7 a233756832pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcampa, Wanda10aIncremental prognostic value of stress myocardial perfusion imaging in asymptomatic diabetic patients  ap. 307-312.  aOBJECTIVE: Stress myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (MPS) variables are robust estimators of prognosis. No data are available on the comparative ability of stress MPS risk markers using varied iterative and risk classification approaches in asymptomatic diabetic patients. We compared analytical approaches to estimate the added value of MPS variables in estimating coronary artery disease (CAD) outcomes in asymptomatic diabetic patients. We also evaluated the temporal characteristics of cardiac risk according to MPS findings. METHODS: A total of 436 consecutive asymptomatic diabetic patients who underwent stress-rest gated MPS were prospectively enrolled. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was employed to estimate cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). Risk reclassification was calculated and parametric survival analysis was used to predict time to events. RESULTS: At multivariable analysis, post-stress left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and stress MPS ischemia were independent predictors of CAD death or MI (both p < 0.01). The net reclassification improvement by adding MPS results to a model including pre-test CAD likelihood was 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.06–0.44; p < 0.01). Parametric survival analysis showed the highest probability of CAD death or MI and the major risk acceleration in time in patients with stress MPS ischemia and post-stress LVEF ≤45%. CONCLUSION: In asymptomatic diabetic patients, analytical approaches that establish the reclassification of events may serve for estimation of improved outcomes for stress MPS. Post-stress LVEF and stress-induced ischemia by gated MPS influence the temporal characteristic of the patient's risk at long-term follow-up.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3acomputed tomography 3aconfidence interval 3acoronary artery disease 3adeath 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amyocardial infarction 3apatients 3aprognosis 3arisk 3ataxonomic revisions 3avalue added 2aAged 2aDiabetes Mellitusxdiagnosisxpathology. 2aElectrocardiography 2aExercise Test 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aIschemiaxpathology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aMyocardial Perfusion Imagingxmethods 2aMyocardiumxpathology 2aProbability 2aPrognosis 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aReproducibility of Results 2aRisk Factors 2aTime Factors 2aTomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photonxmethods1 aPetretta, Mario1 aDaniele, Stefania1 aDel Prete, Giuseppina1 aAssante, Roberta1 aZampella, Emilia1 aCuocolo, Alberto0 tAtherosclerosis.g2013 Apr., v. 227, no. 2 p.307-312dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.01.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010000155300002000255520134300275592002801618650002201646650002101668650001501689650003901704650001601743650001901759650002001778650002101798650003301819650001801852650002401870700001201894700001801906700001501924773012401939856007402063852000902137655001202146IND60642100020221118173236.0190506e20170829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064210002DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07520k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhou10aEndocytosis mechanism of a novel proteoglycan, extracted from Ganoderma lucidum, in HepG2 cells  ap. 41779-41786.  aA novel protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitor, FYGL, extracted from Ganoderma lucidum, was first reported to have an efficient hypoglycemic effect and high safety in vivo in our previous study. However, the underlying mechanism of the anti-diabetes activity was still unclear. The dominant effective component of FYGL was demonstrated to be a neutral hyperbranched proteoglycan macromolecule. Therefore, it is necessary to first elucidate how the biomacromolecule works at the cellular level, in order to understand its possible functional mechanism in vivo. Herein, we focused on demonstrating the cell internalization and endocytosis mechanism of FYGL in HepG2 cells. A series of cellular uptake pathways was explored, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae/lipid-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry were used to demonstrate the absorption of FYGL by HepG2 cells. Furthermore, pharmacologically selective inhibitors and Western blot methods were used to demonstrate that macropinocytosis mediated by c-Src/PI3K cascades was the preferred route for the uptake of FYGL in cells. Our study provided the basis of uptake of FYGL for an efficient hypoglycemic effect. The functional mechanism of the signaling pathway in vivo will be reported in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aWestern blotting 3aabsorption 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aendocytosis 3aflow cytometry 3aglycemic effect 3ahuman cell lines 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3aproteoglycans 3asignal transduction1 aWu, Fan1 aYang, Hongjie1 aZhou, Ping0 tRSC advances.g2017 Aug. 29, v. 7, no. 66 p.41779-41786dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07520k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245005700160500001400217520125900231592002801490650001901518650002401537650001401561650001401575650001501589650002301604650002401627650001401651650001001665651001101675651001101686700001901697700002001716700003201736773012201768856007401890852000901964655001201973IND60729398620221117204328.0210228e20210221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072939862DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130206922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJouanne, Marie 10aNutrient Requirements during Pregnancy and Lactation  aNAL-light  aA woman’s nutritional status during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not only critical for her health, but also for that of future generations. Nutritional requirements during pregnancy differ considerably from those of non-pregnant women. Thus, a personalized approach to nutritional advice is recommended. Currently, some countries recommend routine supplementation for all pregnant women, while others recommend supplements only when necessary. Maternal physiological adaptations, as well as nutritional requirements during pregnancy and lactation, will be reviewed in the literature examining the impacts of dietary changes. All of these data have been studied deeply to facilitate a discussion on dietary supplement use and the recommended doses of nutrients during pregnancy and lactation. The aim of this review is to evaluate the knowledge in the scientific literature on the current recommendations for the intake of the most common micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Taking into account these considerations, we examine minerals, vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acid requirements. Finally, we conclude by discussing the potential benefits of each form of supplementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3adietary supplements 3aknowledge 3alactation 3aliterature 3anutritional status 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apregnancy 3awomen 3aCanada 3aEurope1 aOddoux, Sarah 1 aNoël, Antoine 1 aVoisin-Chiret, Anne  Sophie0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 21, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130206923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245015300166300001600319520104400335592002801379650001301407650001601420650001801436650001701454650001301471650001601484650001101500650001901511650001601530650001701546650001701563650001801580650001501598653002501613653002701638653002301665653001501688653001601703700001901719700001801738773010801756856008601864852000901950655001201959IND60553069520221118054752.0161021e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055306952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Rong10aInfluence of surfaces modified with biomimetic extracellular matrices on adhesion and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells and osteosarcoma cells  ap. 381-386.  aPreparation of surfaces modified with biomimetic extracellular matrices (ECMs) is important for investigation of the interaction between ECMs and cells. In the present study, surfaces modified with ECMs from normal somatic cells, stem cells and tumor cells were prepared by cell culture method. The ECMs derived from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), dermal fibroblasts (FBs), osteoblasts (OBs) and MG63 osteosarcoma cells were deposited on the surfaces of cell-culture polystyrene plates (TCPS). The ECMs from different cell types had different compositions. The effects of the ECM-deposited surfaces on the adhesion, spreading and proliferation of MSCs and MG63 human osteosarcoma cells were dependent on the type of both ECMs and cells. The surfaces deposited with ECMs from MSCs, FBs and OBs promoted cell adhesion more strongly than surfaces deposited with ECMs from MG63 cells and TCPS. Compared to TCPS, the ECM-deposited surfaces promoted proliferation of MSCs while they inhibited the proliferation of MG63 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiomimetics 3acell adhesion 3acell culture 3acolloids 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3aosteoblasts 3aosteosarcoma 3apolystyrenes 3asomatic cells 3astem cells 0aSurface modification 0aExtracellular matrices 0aBiomimetic surface 0aStem cells 0aTumor cells1 aKawazoe, Naoki1 aChen, Guoping0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 126 p.381-386dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245011600167300001600283520099400299592002801293650002301321650002501344650001101369650001601380650001601396650001701412651001001429653001501439653001301454653001401467653003301481653001001514653001001524700002601534773010201560856007801662852000901740655001201749IND60481787420221117180300.0160210e20150407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048178742DNAL7 a10.1515/johh-2015-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamichi, Takeshi10aApplicability of three complementary relationship models for estimating actual evapotranspiration in urban area  ap. 117-123.  aThe characteristics of evapotranspiration estimated by the complementary relationship actual evapotranspiration (CRAE), the advection-aridity (AA), and the modified advection-aridity (MAA) models were investigated in six pairs of rural and urban areas of Japan in order to evaluate the applicability of the three models the urban area.

This study explores the role of values in citizen perceptions. The case study is Canada׳s proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline (NGP), which would transport bitumen from Alberta׳s oil sands to British Columbia׳s (BC) northern coast for export. Data were collected in 2013 from a sample of Canadian citizens (n=2628). The survey instrument elicited citizen perceptions of the NGP, as well as values and attitudes. Respondents in the Alberta subsample are the most likely to support the NGP and to perceive economic benefits. Respondents in the BC subsample are the most likely to oppose the NGP and to perceive environmental risks. To explore heterogeneity in motivations among both subsamples, respondent clusters are constructed based on values. In both regions, opposition is highest in clusters with strong biospheric–altruistic values, while acceptance is highest in clusters with strong traditional values. Regional effects are also substantial; NGP acceptance is higher in each of Alberta׳s clusters relative to equivalent clusters in BC. Regional context seems to shape how values correspond with perceptions. Insights are drawn for energy project development, public consultation and energy planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abitumen 3acase studies 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adevelopment projects 3aenergy 3aexports 3ainfrastructure 3amotivation 3aoil sands 3aplanning 3apolitics 3arisk 3asurveys 3aAlberta 0aCitizen acceptance 0aValues 0aClimate change 0aSurvey 0aCluster analysis0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 Dec., v. 75 p.255-265dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245006600162300001600228520143700244592002801681650002501709650002801734650002901762650001201791650001901803650001401822650002601836650001701862650001601879650002501895650002101920650000701941650001501948700001901963700002201982700002302004773009502027856008102122852000902203655001202212IND4527515020221119155251.0150212e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452751502DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-012-0142-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVlková, Eva10aGrowth and survival of lactic acid bacteria in lucerne silage  ap. 359-362.  aA rifampicin-resistant variant of two strains of Lactobacillus plantarum, one strain of Pediococcus acidilactici, and one strain of Enterococcus faecium were used for the experimental production of lucerne silage. Laboratory silage without inoculants served as a control. Counts of total anaerobes, total lactic acid bacteria (LAB), lactobacilli, pediococci, and enterococci were determined on days 14, 21, 30, 49, and 60 of lucerne fermentation. LAB dominated in silage microflora, reaching a percentage between 59 and 95 % of total anaerobes. Lactobacilli were found as a predominant group of LAB during the whole study. Lactobacilli reached numbers 8.74 log CFU/g in treated silage and 8.89 log CFU/g in the control at the first observation. Their counts decreased to 4.23 and 4.92 log CFU/g in treated silage and the control, respectively, on day 63 of fermentation. Similar decreases were observed in all bacterial groups. The treated silage samples possessed lower pH (4.2 vs. 4.5 in control samples) and contained more lactic acid compared to control silage. The identity of re-isolated rifampicin-resistant bacteria with those inoculated to the lucerne was evaluated by fingerprinting techniques. The fingerprint profiles of re-isolated bacteria corresponded to the profiles of strains used for the treatment. It could be concluded that supplemented LAB dominated in laboratory silage and overgrew naturally occurring LAB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3aalfalfa 3aalfalfa silage 3aanaerobes 3aantibiotic resistance 3afermentation 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3arifampicin1 aRada, Vojtěch1 aBunešová, Věra1 aRočková, Šárka0 tFolia microbiologica.g2012 July, v. 57, no. 4 p.359-362dSpringer-Verlagx0015-56327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-012-0142-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245013900207300001800346520090200364592002801266650002001294650002301314650001101337650001701348650002001365650002001385700002301405700002301428700002301451700002901474773014501503856008201648852000901730655001201739IND60438671720221122210436.0181017e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043867172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6876-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSforza, Eleonora1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3930-294110aEffect of specific light supply rate on photosynthetic efficiency of Nannochloropsis salina in a continuous flat plate photobioreactor  ap. 8309-8318.  aIn this work, Nannochloropsis salina was cultivated in a continuous-flow flat-plate photobioreactor, working at different residence times and irradiations to study the effect of the specific light supply rate on biomass productivity and photosynthetic efficiency. Changes in residence times lead to different steady-state cell concentrations and specific growth rates. We observed that cultures at steady concentration were exposed to different values of light intensity per cell. This specific light supply rate was shown to affect the photosynthetic status of the cells, monitored by fluorescence measurements. High specific light supply rate can lead to saturation and photoinhibition phenomena if the biomass concentration is not optimized for the selected operating conditions. Energy balances were applied to quantify the biomass growth yield and maintenance requirements in N. salina cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3abiomass production 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3alight intensity 3aphotoinhibition1 aCalvaruso, Claudio1 aMeneghesso, Andrea1 aMorosinotto, Tomas1 aBertucco, A.q(Alberto),0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 99, no. 19 p.8309-8318dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6876-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165520139600278592002801674650002001702650003101722650002801753650001101781650001201792650001201804650001401816650001601830650002401846650001401870650000901884650002001893650002801913651001201941653002401953653002201977653001101999653002502010653002502035653001202060700001902072700001902091700002502110700002002135700002002155773012002175856008202295852000902377655001202386IND60788945420221116155802.0220824e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078894542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2022.1008142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahiri, Amine10aInfluence of climate variability on water resource availability in the upper basin of Oum-Er-Rabiaa, Morocco  aThis study aims to analyze rainfall data series of four hydrometric stations in a mountainous context in Morocco, over the period 1970–2017. Periods of disruption were identified through statistical approaches based on rupture detection: the Pettitt test, the Bayesian procedure of Lee and Heghinian, and the Buishand test. The results show that the studied series are characterized by several breaks which indicate a variation in the overall trend of the rainfall regime during 1980, 1995, 2000, and around 2010. In addition, a diagnostic of dry and wet years is carried out by applying the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI); a prolonged period of drought was observed from 1980 to 2010, with the exception of several short-term rainy events, such as in 1994–1996 and the early 2000s. The variability of spring discharge indicates an evolution consistent with that of rainfall; the largest decrease in flow rates was recorded during the period from 1980 to 1993. In addition, periods of abrupt increases were identified, with a maximum recorded in 1994–1996. The phase opposition showed a marked consistency between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the SPI, and the variability of spring discharge, which provides an overview of the influence of atmospheric circulation on the evolution of precipitation and, consequently, on the availability of water resources in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aatmospheric circulation 3abasins 3aclimate 3adrought 3aevolution 3agroundwater 3ameteorological data 3amountains 3arain 3asprings (water) 3asustainable development 3aMorocco 0aClimate variability 0aRainfall dynamics 0aSpring 0aWater flows dynamics 0aStatistical analysis 0aDrought1 aAmraoui, Fouad1 aSinan, Mohamed1 aBouchaou, Lhoussaine1 aBerrada, Faouzi1 aBenjmel, Khalid0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2022 Nov., v. 19 p.100814-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2022.1008143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01681naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008200166300001800248500001100266520064100277592002800918650001800946650001200964650001800976650001600994650001901010700001801029700002401047700002001071700001601091773014501107856008201252852000901334655001201343IND60438671820221122210542.0181017e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043867182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6874-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaddadi, Noura10aBiotechnological applications of extremophiles, extremozymes and extremolytes  ap. 7907-7913.  aReview  aIn the last decade, attention to extreme environments has increased because of interests to isolate previously unknown extremophilic microorganisms in pure culture and to profile their metabolites.

This work reports the removal of benzothiophene from the model liquid fuel using a novel adsorbent prepared by nanopoly (4,4′-methylenedianiline)-graphene oxide (NPMDA/GO) composite. The adsorbent was successfully synthesized with the in situ electrochemical method and characterized using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), field-scattering scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transient electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The results showed that the presence of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets in NPMDA/GO composite adsorbent due to its high tendency to sulfur would increase the adsorption of benzothiophene compared to unmodified nanopoly (4,4′-methylenedianiline) (NPMDA). The π_complexation, oxygenated organic functional groups, and layered sheets of graphene oxide improve adsorption capacity for desulfurization. The NPMDA/GO composite presented maximum efficiency (63.33%) at 30 mg/L initial concentration, 120 mg adsorbent dose, and 120 min contact time at 25 °C. Furthermore, the adsorbent shows an almost good reusability after four cycles (67.12 mg/g sulfur absorption capacity). Pseudo-second-order model (R² = 0.9975) and the Freundlich isotherm (R² = 0.8813) were used to describe the adsorption process. Findings confirm that NPMDA/GO composite can be applicable for removal of benzothiophene from liquid fuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adesulfurization 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene oxide 3aliquids 3amodels 3ananosheets 3apolymer nanocomposites 3asorption isotherms 3asulfur 3athermogravimetry1 aRahmani, Abdolrasoul1 aHamdi, Zahra0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Nov., v. 193, no. 11 p.737-737dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09507-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245012700133300001600260520104900276592002801325650001801353650002401371650001501395650002001410650001301430650001101443650001601454650001001470650002501480650001201505653000801517653000901525653000801534653001301542700001901555773015001574852000901724655001201733IND60706523120221117234609.0210117e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070652312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwami, Rakesh M.10aStudy of Antioxidant Enzymes Activity in Wilt Resistant and Susceptible Pigeonpea Genotypes during Fusarium udum Infection  ap. 575-582.  aThe present investigation was carried out in wilt (Fusarium udum) resistant (ICPL 87119, ICP 8863 & Vaishali) and susceptible (ICP 2376 & T₁5-₁₅) genotypes of pigeonpea at 0 day after infection (DAI), 5 DAI and 10 DAI in infected and non-infected tissues to identify some biochemical markers for wilt resistance. The enhancement in SOD and GPOX was more in infected resistant genotypes than the infected susceptible genotypes at 5 DAI but later it declined in all the genotypes. On the other hand, the SOD activity was enhanced in the infected roots of all the genotypes at 10 DAI but the fold enhancement was more in the resistant genotypes (about 2 fold) than the susceptible genotypes. The APOX and GR activity was increased significantly in both leaf and root tissues of all genotypes but enhancement was more in infected resistant genotypes than the susceptible ones at post infection stages (5 DAI & 10 DAI). These results reveal that higher SOD, APOX and GR activity in resistant genotypes may restrict the disease after infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium udum 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomarkers 3aenzyme activity 3agenotype 3aleaves 3apigeon peas 3aroots 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 0aSOD 0aGPOX 0aCAT 0afusarium1 aMahatma, M.

There are different validation guidelines; showing that analytical calibration process variety prevails in terms of nomenclature, methodology employed and acceptance criteria. Very common mistakes in the analytical calibration process are the use of correlation and/or determination coefficients as a test for linearity, the negligence in the heteroscedasticity of the experimental data and selection of appropriate weighting factor, misunderstanding about the regression through the origin and using zero-point calibration. Once the calibration function is established, their linearity can be confirmed by using different procedures such as graphical plots, statistical significance tests and numerical parameters. In particular, deviation from back-calculated concentrations expressed in the form of percentage of relative error (%RE) can be considered very useful for unambiguous linearity evaluation. Some case studies were included to explain the linearity assessment from a practical viewpoint.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aheteroskedasticity 3aleast squares 0aAIC 0aADL 0aAOAC 0aANOVA 0aAUT 0aBC 0aCal-VG 0aC.I 0aCS 0aCVDL 0aDOF 0aDEV 0aEMA 0aESTD 0aGOF 0aGRA 0aHA 0aH0 0aICH 0aICP 0aINAB 0aISTD 0aIUPAC 0aj 0aJRC-FCM 0ak 0aLIN 0aLLQ 0aLOF 0aN 0aMAN 0aNATA 0aOLS 0aPAR 0aPE 0aQC 0ar 0aR2 0aRE 0aREG 0aRES 0aRR 0aRSE 0aRTO 0aSE 0aSSDL 0aSLO 0aSQT 0aSTA 0aSWGTOX 0aTOST 0aUS FDA 0aUSP 0aVFAs 0aWF 0aWLS 0aZPC 0aAnalytical calibration 0aCalibration error 0aCorrelation coefficient 0aDetermination coefficient 0aLeast-squares method 0aLinear regression 0aLinearity assessment0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016 Mar., v. 77 p.167-185dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2015.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245010600175520149500281592002801776650001601804650002101820650002301841650001501864650002801879650001201907651001401919653002801933653002701961653001801988653001302006700005402019773012002073856004802193852000902241655001202250IND60788945520221116155858.0220816e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078894552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2022.1008222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Djono, Trimo Pamudji14aThe effect of community contribution on the functionality of rural water supply programs in Indonesia  aThe influence of the community contributions, such as in-kind, i.e., related to physical contribution in various activities, and in-cash, i.e., cash contribution, on the functionality of the rural water supply program in developing countries is rarely discussed. This study aims to fill that gap by using the 10,789 community-based rural water supply and sanitation programs (PAMSIMAS) data in Indonesia. The in-kind contribution was measured by variables related to some activities conducted before the system was built, while the in-cash contribution was measured by the information related to tariff status, i.e., the monthly water fee. We found that health promotion activity was significantly associated with functionality (OR: 1.03; CI: 1.01–1.05; p ≤ 0.01). The influence of women's participation on functionality is much lower than other types of community contributions. Water supply systems that do not collect water fees from beneficiaries were more likely to be not functioning compared to systems with a tariff system. Moreover, the effect of monthly or regular in-cash or financial contributions on the functionality is significantly larger than all variables related to the in-kind contributions at the beginning of the project, e.g., planning or pipe system construction, with OR values ranging from 1.85 to 3.87 (p ≤ 0.001). This study concludes that a regular financial contribution is necessary to sustain the rural water supply program in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater 3ahealth promotion 3arural water supply 3asanitation 3asustainable development 3atariffs 3aIndonesia 0aCommunity participation 0aFinancial contribution 0aFunctionality 0aPAMSIMAS1 aDaniel, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2664-25170 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2022 Nov., v. 19 p.100822-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2022.100822  aDNAL 7aarticle01456naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016400159300002000323520025200343592002800595650001100623650001400634650002300648650001100671650002100682650001800703650002200721700001700743700001300760700001500773700001600788700001500804700001700819700001600836773013500852856007400987852000901061655001201070IND60660704220221122075037.0190827e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066070422DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc05953k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Qingqing12aA high-performance electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions based on electrochemical post-treatment of ultrathin carbon layer coated cobalt nanoparticles  ap. 13019-13022.  aElectrochemical post-treatment of ultrathin carbon layer coated cobalt nanoparticles generates a novel electrocatalyst, affording a small overpotential of 333 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² and a small Tafel slope of ∼58 mV per decade.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen production1 aZhang, Yuxia1 aGuo, Xin1 aLin, Jing,1 aYang, Zhiyu1 aXue, Yifei1 aYan, Yi-Ming1 aSun, Kening0 tChemical communications.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 50, no. 86 p.13019-13022dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc05953k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009900161300001600260520096900276592002801245650001601273650001101289650001701300650001901317650001901336650001601355653002901371653002901400653003101429653002101460653002901481700001801510773015401528856008001682852000901762655001201771IND60522798020221118163251.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052279802DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1989-11-12152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilger, W.10aModulation of Millisecond Chlorophyll Luminescence by Non-Photochemical Fluorescence Quenching  ap. 966-970.  aBy combining a high frequency modulation system for measurement of fluorescence with a phosphoroscope type apparatus for measurement of luminescence, recordings of fluorescence and luminescence induction kinetics under identical conditions were obtained. Both measuring sys­tems tolerated the application of saturating pulses of white light for rapid, transient elimination of photochemical quenching at photosystem II reaction centers, thus allowing determination of the non-photochemical quenching component. The saturation pulse induction curves of luminescence are well correlated with the corresponding curves of fluorescence, suggesting that luminescence yield is lowered by the same type of non-photochemical quenching (mostly “energy dependent quenching”) as fluorescence. Hence, in order to evaluate luminescence signals in terms of the rate of charge recombination at photosystem II reaction centers, knowledge of fluorescence quenching is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3awhite light 0aChlorophyll Luminescence 0aChlorophyll Fluorescence 0aEnergy Dependent Quenching 0aPhoto­system II 0aPhotosynthesis Induction1 aSchreiber, U.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 44, no. 11-12 p.966-970dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1989-11-12153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245017700170500001400347520153900361592002801900650000901928650001501937650001701952650002801969650001601997650002702013650000902040650001602049700002702065700002002092700002102112700002402133700002802157773012202185856007402307852000902381655001202390IND60729399020221117204319.0210228e20210222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072939902DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130206952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdullah, Mohammad  M. H.10aCommon Genetic Variations Involved in the Inter-Individual Variability of Circulating Cholesterol Concentrations in Response to Diets: A Narrative Review of Recent Evidence  aNAL-light  aThe number of nutrigenetic studies dedicated to the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) modulating blood lipid profiles in response to dietary interventions has increased considerably over the last decade. However, the robustness of the evidence-based science supporting the area remains to be evaluated. The objective of this review was to present recent findings concerning the effects of interactions between SNPs in genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and transport, and dietary intakes or interventions on circulating cholesterol concentrations, which are causally involved in cardiovascular diseases and established biomarkers of cardiovascular health. We identified recent studies (2014–2020) that reported significant SNP–diet interactions in 14 cholesterol-related genes (NPC1L1, ABCA1, ABCG5, ABCG8, APOA1, APOA2, APOA5, APOB, APOE, CETP, CYP7A1, DHCR7, LPL, and LIPC), and which replicated associations observed in previous studies. Some studies have also shown that combinations of SNPs could explain a higher proportion of variability in response to dietary interventions. Although some findings still need replication, including in larger and more diverse study populations, there is good evidence that some SNPs are consistently associated with differing circulating cholesterol concentrations in response to dietary interventions. These results could help clinicians provide patients with more personalized dietary recommendations, in order to lower their risk for cardiovascular disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3abiomarkers 3ablood lipids 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3arisk 3avariability1 aVázquez Vidal, Itzel,1 aBaer, David  J.1 aHouse, James  D.1 aJones, Peter  J.

Previously, we have investigated the length requirement for antimicrobial activity of peptides consisting of repeated arginine (R) and tryptophan (W) side chains and found that even short linear RW repeats are active, providing a starting point for a de novo design of multivalent structures. In this study, we synthesized and tested a new synthetic dendrimer, 2D-24, for its antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including the wild-type PAO1 and its mucoid mutant PDO300. This synthetic AMDP was found to kill planktonic cells of both PAO1 and PDO300 in a dose-dependent manner, with nearly complete killing of both strains observed when treated with 50 μM of this agent. In addition to planktonic cells, 2D-24 was also found to kill biofilm cells of both strains in a dose-dependent manner. For example, treatment with 30 μM 2D-24 led to 94.4 ± 1.4 and 93.9 ± 4.2 % killing of PAO1 and PDO300 biofilm cells, respectively. Furthermore, 2D-24 was effective in killing multidrug-tolerant persister cells of PAO1 and PDO300. While higher concentrations of 2D-24 were required to kill persister cells, combinations of 2D-24 with ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, or carbenicillin showed synergistic effects on killing persister cells of both strains. Based on hemolysis assays using sheep erythrocytes and a coculture model of PAO1 and human epithelial cells, 2D-24 was found to kill P. aeruginosa cells at concentrations that are not toxic to mammalian cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aanti-infective properties 3aarginine 3abiofilm 3acarbenicillin 3aciprofloxacin 3acoculture 3adose response 3aepithelial cells 3aerythrocytes 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3amodels 3amutants 3apeptides 3asheep 3asynergism 3atobramycin 3atoxicity 3atryptophan1 aLiu, Zhigang1 aTotsingan, Filbert1 aBuitrago, Carlos1 aKallenbach, Neville1 aRen, Dacheng0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 99, no. 19 p.8125-8135dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6645-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01336naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010800157300002000265520040400285592002800689650002600717650002100743650002300764650001300787700001600800700001200816773013500828856007400963852000901037655001201046IND60660704520221122074958.0190827e20141104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066070452DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc05964f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yiqing14aThe synthesis of diarylsulfones with simple arenes and K₂S₂O₈ through double C–S bond formation  ap. 15037-15040.  aAn unprecedented double C–S bond formation method has been developed to prepare both symmetric and unsymmetric diarylsulfones with simple arenes in a single step.

The carrying-current wear behavior of the RECMs was tested on a durability test bed of a HMC-2500 type electric power tool, and microstructural characterization of the RECMs surface was carried out using AFM, SEM, TEM and XPS. The results show that the carrying-current wear rate of the RECMs impregnated with sulfonated graphene was approximately 56% of that of the RECMs not impregnated with sulfonated graphene, and it was also lower than that of the original carbon brush (widely used in the market). Moreover, AFM analysis indicated that the introduction of sulfonated graphene can significantly improve the surface hardness and toughness of RECMs. It was also found that sulfonated graphene could restrain the stress growth in situ in the micro-crack region, which contributes to the formation of a slight “fish scale” friction film on the wear surface during the wear process. Furthermore, it can effectively improve the integrity of the contact surface between the friction pairs and reduce any abnormal wear and resist arc erosion wear. The research results provide guidance and a theoretical basis for the research and design of high performance electrical contact materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3adurability 3aelectric power 3aepoxides 3afriction 3agraphene 3ahardness 3amarkets 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aTu, Chuanjun1 aFeng, Pengyang1 aWu, Mingzai1 aChen, Gang1 aWang, Weidong0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 07, v. 7, no. 69 p.43390-43395dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07535a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245013900201300001800340500002000358520151800378592002801896596004701924650001701971650000901988650001901997650001802016650001702034650001402051651001602065651002302081700001302104700002702117700001902144773012502163856007302288852000902361655001202370IND60663198020221119220843.0190909e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066319802DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.129412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrexler, Judith Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0127-386610aCarbon accumulation and vertical accretion in a restored versus historic salt marsh in southern Puget Sound, Washington, United States  ap. 1117-1127.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFew comparisons exist between vertical accretion (VA) and carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in restored versus historic (i.e. reference) marshes. Here, we compare these processes in a formerly diked, sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh (Six Gill Slough, SG), whose surface is subsided relative to the tidal frame, to an adjacent, relatively pristine, historic salt marsh (Animal Slough, AS). Six sediment cores were collected at both AS and SG approximately 6 years after restoration. Cores were analyzed for bulk density (BD), % loss of ignition, % organic carbon, and ²¹⁰Pb. We found that sharp changes in BD in surface layers of SG cores were highly reliable markers for the onset of restoration. The mean VA since restoration at SG (0.79 [SD = 0.29] cm/year) was approximately twice that of AS (0.41 [SD = 0.16] cm/year). In comparison, the VA at AS over 50 years was 0.30 (SD = 0.09) cm/year. VA consisted almost entirely of inorganic sediment at SG whereas at AS it was approximately 55%. Mean CARs at SG were somewhat greater than at AS, but the difference was not significant due to high variability (SG: 81–210 g C m⁻² year⁻¹; AS: 115–168 g C m⁻² year⁻¹). The mean CAR at AS over the past 50 years was 118 (SD = 23) g C m⁻² year⁻¹. This study demonstrates that a sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh can quickly begin to accumulate carbon and that historic and restored marshes can have similar CARs despite highly divergent formation processes.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Geological Survey Land Carbon Program 3abulk density 3alead 3aorganic carbon 3aradionuclides 3asalt marshes 3asediments 3aPuget Sound 3aWashington (state)1 aWoo, Isa1 aFuller, Christopher C.1 aNakai, Glynnis0 tRestoration ecology.g2019 Sept., v. 27, no. 5 p.1117-1127dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.129413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011500172300001400287520118800301592002801489650001801517650002301535650001901558650002501577650001501602650002701617650000901644650002501653650001901678650001601697650002001713650002101733650001701754650001601771650001201787650001401799650001701813650000901830650001101839650001701850653001701867653001201884653001601896653002201912653001601934653001901950700002501969700001501994700001502009700001702024700005202041773010902093856008202202852000902284655001202293IND60544131520221123012553.0190415e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054413152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2015.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Micaelo, N.10aProcyanidins and docosahexaenoic acid suppress inflammation and boost immune system in cafeteria diet-fed rats  ap. 61-71.  aNutrition can be considered as a two-side coin: although an imbalance in the energy content is associated with obesity, a healthier state can be promoted through the intake of immunologically active compounds. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the immunomodulatory properties of grape seed procyanidin extract (GSPE) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in cafeteria (CAF) diet-fed rats. Rats were fed either a standard diet (STD) or a CAF diet for 13 weeks. During the last 3 weeks the group fed with CAF diet was divided depending on CAF diet supplementation with GSPE and/or DHA. The healthy properties of GSPE and DHA diet supplementation include the suppression of diet-induced inflammation by promoting a phenotypic switch in the molecular and cell profile of mesenteric adipose tissue, the boost of immune system through the modulation of cell-mediated immunity, involving macrophages and T lymphocyte subsets, and the stimulation of the thymus and spleen functionality to counteract the obesity-induced weakened immune response. Moreover, the combination of GSPE and DHA bioactivities potentiate the immunomodulatory properties of each compound administered individually.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aactive ingredients 3aadipose tissue 3abioactive properties 3acafeterias 3acell-mediated immunity 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aenergy content 3agrape seeds 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulators 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3aobesity 3aphenotype 3aprocyanidins 3arats 3aspleen 3athymus gland 0aInflammation 0aObesity 0aDHA omega-3 0aGSPE procyanidins 0aLymphocytes 0aCafeteria diet1 aGonzález-Abuín, N.1 aMulero, M.1 aPinent, M.1 aArdévol, A.1 aBlay, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6256-98470 tJournal of functional foods.g2015 May, v. 15 p.61-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2015.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245014700173300001800320500002000338520153500358592002801893650002501921650001401946650001701960650001401977650002301991650002102014650001202035650002302047650001102070650002002081650003002101650001902131650002002150650002202170700001702192700002002209700002202229700002502251700002002276700002702296773011802323856007402441852000902515655001202524IND60588237820221120195612.0180103e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058823782DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.141012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinares‐Pastén, Javier A.10aThree‐dimensional structures and functional studies of two GH43 arabinofuranosidases from Weissella sp. strain 142 and Lactobacillus brevis  ap. 2019-2036.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aArabinofuranosidases degrade arabinose‐containing oligo and polysaccharides, releasing l‐arabinose, which is a potentially useful sugar, shown to reduce glycemic response under certain conditions. Arabinofuranosidases (Arafs) are frequently found in GH43, one of the most common GH‐families encoded in genomes in gut microbiota, and hence it is of interest to increase understanding of the function of these enzymes in species occurring in the gut. Here we have produced, characterized and solved the three‐dimensional structures, at 1.9 and 2.0 Å resolution respectively, of two homologous GH43 enzymes, classified under subfamily 26, from Lactobacillus brevis DSM1269 (LbAraf43) and Weissella strain 142 (WAraf43), respectively. The enzymes, with 74% sequence identity to each other, are composed of a single catalytic module with a β‐propeller structure typical of GH43, and an active‐site pocket with three identifiable subsites (−1, +1, and +2). According to size exclusion chromatography, native WAraf43 is a dimer, while LbAraf43 is a tetramer in solution. Both of them show activity with similar catalytic efficiency on 1,5‐α‐l‐arabinooligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 2–3. Activity is restricted to substrates of low DP, and the reason for this is believed to be an extended loop at the entrance to the active site, creating interactions in the +2 subsite.

The main objective of this research was to quantitatively assess bacterial transport and deposition under saturated conditions in calcareous soil. A series of leaching experiments was conducted on two undisturbed soil columns. Breakthrough curves of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Cl were measured. After the leaching experiment, spatial distribution of bacteria retention in the soil columns was determined. The HYDRUS-1D one- and two-site kinetic models were used to predict the transport and deposition of bacteria in soil. The results indicated that the two-site model fits the observed data better than one-site kinetic model. Bacteria interaction with the soil of kinetic site 1 revealed relatively fast attachment and slow detachment, whereas attachment to and detachment of bacteria from kinetic site 2 was fast. Fast attachment and slow detachment of site 1 can be attributed to soil calcium carbonate that has favorable attachment sites for bacteria. The detachment rate was less than 0.02 of the attachment rate, indicating irreversible attachment of bacteria. High reduction rate of bacteria was also attributed to soil calcium carbonate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3acalcareous soils 3acalcium carbonate 3agroundwater contamination 3akinetics 3aleaching 3amodels 3asaturated conditions 3asaturated flow 0aBacteria transport 0aCalcareous soil 0aPseudomonas fluorescens 0aSaturated flow1 aHomaee, Mehdi1 aKlumpp, Erwin1 aKasteel, Roy1 aTappe, Wolfgang0 tVodohospodársky časopis.g2015 Apr. 7, v. 63, no. 2 p.102-109dDe Gruyter Openx0042-790X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/johh-2015-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245013800132300001600270520140700286592002801693650002501721650002101746650002101767650002601788650001501814650001601829650001001845650001301855650001701868650001801885650001401903650001201917650001901929650002501948650001301973650002201986650002302008651001002031653001402041653002102055653001002076653001802086653001602104700002202120773015002142852000902292655001202301IND60706523820221117234531.0210117e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070652382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParveen, Shazia10aIn vitro Efficacy of Some Fungicides and Plant Extracts on Mucor piriformis Fisher Causing Postharvest Rot of Peach in Kashmir Valley  ap. 620-627.  aPeach fruits undergo decay due to postharvest infestation by various pathogens especially fungal pathogens. In this study the fungus associated with the spoilage of peach fruits under storage conditions in Kashmir Valley were isolated and identified on the basis of symptomological, cultural and morphological characteristics. Pathogenicity tests were also carried out on healthy peach fruits. The fungal pathogen isolated were identified as Mucorpiriformis Fisher. Study was also undertaken to observe the antifungal activity of some fungicides and plant extracts against Mucorpyriformis causing Mucor rot of peaches. It was revealed from the study that different concentration of fungicides as well as plant extracts brought about significant reduction in the mycelial growth and spore germination of Mucor piriformis under in vitro conditions. Amongst the tested fungicides, hexaconozole proved highly effective in inhibiting the mycelial growth and spore germination followed by carbendazim, myclobutanil and bitertanol respectively. Amongst the plant extracts, Artemisia absinthium at highest concentration was found most effective followed by P. lanceolata, T. officinale, R. obtusifolius and M. sylvestris at the same concentration. Other concentrations of plant extracts also bought about significant reduction in mycelial growth and spore germination of the test fungus but to a lesser extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia absinthium 3aMalus sylvestris 3aMucor piriformis 3aantifungal properties 3abitertanol 3acarbendazim 3afungi 3amycelium 3amyclobutanil 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeaches 3aplant extracts 3apostharvest diseases 3aspoilage 3aspore germination 3astorage conditions 3aIndia 0aFungicide 0aMucor piriformis 0aPeach 0aPlant extract 0aPostharvest1 aWani, Abdul Hamid0 tTrends in Biosciences.g2015 Feb., v. 8, no. 3 p.620-627dSociety for Advancement of Science and Rural DevelopmentwJournal:2106x0976-24857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015800157300002000315520133600335592002801671650001201699650001301711650002101724650002101745650001901766650001001785700002201795700001801817700001701835700001601852773012401868856007401992852000902066655001202075IND60642100920221118173036.0190506e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064210092DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07549a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Jianbin10aDynamic/quasi-static stab-resistance and mechanical properties of soft body armour composites constructed from Kevlar fabrics and shear thickening fluids  ap. 39803-39813.  aSoft body armour composites were constructed by combining Kevlar fabrics with different quantities of shear thickening fluid (STF). In particular, the quantity of the added STF and the mechanical properties of these composites were systemically explored. The dynamic and quasi-static knife-stabbing resistance and the quasi-static mechanical properties of these composites were both significantly enhanced in comparison to those of neat Kevlar fabric. The composites were much lighter, thinner and more flexible than the neat Kevlar fabric and, with an optimal quantity of added STF, could not even be penetrated. However, the dynamic knife-stabbing resistance of the fabric became poor when the amount of added STF was higher than 100 wt%. The tensile strength of the composites could be increased from 40% to 80% and the tearing strength could be increased by nearly eight times that of the neat Kevlar fabric by increasing the concentration of added STF. Yarn pull-out testing suggested that the triggered shear thickening contributed to the increase of the friction between yarns or filaments, resulting in improvements in the dynamic and quasi-static properties of these composites. Moreover, these composites are suitable for use as soft body armour materials due to their good adaptability to high and low speeds conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3afriction 3asynthetic fibers 3atensile strength 3athermodynamics 3ayarns1 aChang, Donald K.,1 aZhou, Lisheng1 aLi, Jiantong1 aShi, Xuetao0 tRSC advances.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 7, no. 63 p.39803-39813dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07549a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012700172300001400299520126400313592002801577650002101605650002701626650001301653650001701666650002601683650001001709650001801719650002201737650001101759650002101770650001501791650002001806650001701826650001601843650001901859653001701878653001801895653001901913653002201932653001801954700001801972700001801990700002002008773010602028856008602134852000902220655001202229IND60553070220221119094454.0161021e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055307022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Chia-Hua10aCharacterization and in vitro biocompatibility of catanionic assemblies formed with oppositely charged dicetyl amphiphiles  ap. 10-17.  aIn this study, cationic dicetyldimethylammonium bromide (DCB) and anionic dicetyl phosphate (DCP) were mixed to form catanionic assemblies in water, and their colloidal morphology, size, charge characteristics, phase behavior, membrane fluidity, and in vitro biocompatibility are comprehensively investigated for the first time. Our results show that the catanionic DCB and DCP mixtures in water are capable of forming circular vesicles and this binary mixed system expresses the miscibility with deviation from the ideal mixing. Compared to the nanoscale DCB-rich vesicles, the DCP-rich vesicles have smaller size, higher negative zeta potential, higher main transition temperature, and better storage stability. The temperature and molecular cooperativity of the main transition phase for the DCP vesicles can be reduced by an addition of DCB. This work demonstrates that the head groups and the relative composition of the two considered dicetyl amphiphiles remarkably affect the phase behavior, membrane rigidity, encapsulation ability and in vitro biocompatibility of DCB/DCP vesicles. The iso-stoichiometric mixed DCB/DCP vesicle, showing low cytotoxicity, long storage time, and high drug loading, is a potential candidate for the drug delivery system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acharge characteristics 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3amembrane fluidity 3amixing 3aphase transition 3aphosphates 3astorage quality 3astorage time 3atemperature 3azeta potential 0aCytotoxicity 0aSelf-assembly 0aPhase behavior 0aMembrane fluidity 0aDrug delivery1 aYeh, Li-Hsien1 aLiao, Pei-Wen1 aChou, Tzung-Han0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 126 p.10-17dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245012200175300001600297520160600313592002801919650000801947650002001955650001601975650001101991650002002002650001702022650001502039653002602054653003602080653003202116653001802148653002602166653003402192700001902226773008902245856008402334852000902418655001202427IND60760321820221116203820.0220621e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076032182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2021.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe, Nguyen Quoc Khanh10aDeep transformers and convolutional neural network in identifying DNA N6-methyladenine sites in cross-species genomes  ap. 199-206.  aAs one of the most common post-transcriptional epigenetic modifications, N6-methyladenine (6 mA), plays an essential role in various cellular processes and disease pathogenesis. Therefore, accurately identifying 6 mA modifications is necessary for a deep understanding of cellular processes and other possible functional mechanisms. Although a few computational methods have been proposed, their respective models were developed with small training datasets. Hence, their practical application is quite limited in genome-wide detection. To overcome the existing limitations, we present a novel model based on transformer architecture and deep learning to identify DNA 6 mA sites from the cross-species genome. The model is constructed on a benchmark dataset and explored a feature derived from pre-trained transformer word embedding approaches. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network was employed to learn the generated features and generate the prediction outcomes. As a result, our predictor achieved excellent performance during independent test with the accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 79.3% and 0.58, respectively. Overall, its performance achieved better accuracy than the baseline models and significantly outperformed the existing predictors, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid framework. Furthermore, our model is expected to assist biologists in accurately identifying 6mAs and formulate the novel testable biological hypothesis.

The objective of this study is to design and model a Savonius-style vertical axis wind turbine with direct discharge flow capability in order to ventilate buildings. For this purpose, a modeling procedure is defined and validated using available experimental results in literature. In addition, two design modifications, variations in cross-section with respect to the height of rotor and conical shaft in the middle of wind rotor are proposed. The variable cut plane changes the pressure in inner region of rotor and enhances the discharge flow rate. However, this increases the negative torque acting on returning blade thus reducing the power coefficient. The inlet flow to Savonius wind rotor goes along the surface of conical shaft and is diverted to lower pressure in order to improve the discharge flow rate. Results indicate that the twist on Savonius wind rotor reduces the negative torque and improves its performance. According to the results, a twisted Savonius wind turbine with conical shaft is associated with 18% increase in power coefficient and 31% increase in discharge flowrate compared to simple Savonius wind turbine. Also, wind turbine with variable cut plane has a 12% decrease in power coefficient and 5% increase in discharge flow rate compared to simple Savonius wind turbine. Therefore, it can be inferred that twisted wind turbine with conical shaft indicated a proper aerodynamic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3amodels 3atorque 3awind 3awind turbines 0aSavonius turbine 0aDischarge flow 0aConical shaft 0aTwist 0aPower coefficient1 aRabbānī, ʻAlī,1 aKasaeian, Alibakhsh1 aMehrpooya, Mehdi1 aMirhosseini, Mojtaba0 tEnergy.g2017 July 01, v. 130 p.327-338dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008800169300001500257520141800272592002801690650001201718650002001730650002401750650001501774650002501789650001301814651001101827651001201838651001901850651001801869700002001887700001801907700001801925773009401943856008502037852000902122655001202131IND60084342120221119105949.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008434212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2010.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnowles, Paul10aClogging in subsurface-flow treatment wetlands: Occurrence and contributing factors  ap. 99-112.  aClogging is a major operational and maintenance issue associated with the use of subsurface flow wetlands for wastewater treatment, and can ultimately limit the lifetime of the system. This review considers over two decades of accumulated knowledge regarding clogging in both vertical and horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands. The various physical, chemical and biological factors responsible for clogging are identified and discussed. The occurrence of clogging is placed into the context of various design and operational parameters such as wastewater characteristics, upstream treatment processes, intermittent or continuous operation, influent distribution, and media type. This information is then used to describe how clogging develops within, and subsequently impacts, common variants of subsurface flow treatment wetland typically used in the U.S., U.K., France and Germany. Comparison of these systems emphasized that both hydraulic loading rate and solids loading rate need to be considered when designing systems to operate robustly, i.e. hydraulic overloading makes horizontal-flow tertiary treatment systems in the U.K. more susceptible to clogging problems than vertical-flow primary treatment systems in France. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of clogging as they relate to the design, operation, and maintenance of subsurface flow treatment wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3afouling 3asubsurface flow 3asystems engineering 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awetlands 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aUnited Kingdom 3aUnited States1 aDotro, Gabriela1 aNivala, Jaime1 aGarcía, Joan0 tEcological engineering.g2011 Feb., v. 37, no. 2 p.99-112dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2010.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04285naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013900171300001800310520265700328592002802985650001503013650001303028650002203041650001303063650001103076650001203087650001503099650001603114650001203130650001103142650001203153650000903165650001503174650001103189650001103200650001603211650001103227650002403238650001103262650000903273650001503282650001103297653002403308653004003332653001703372653002203389653002903411653000903440653000803449653003103457700002103488773009203509856008503601852000903686655001203695IND60568635820221121031619.0180830e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056863582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKılkış, Birol10aNew exergy metrics for energy, environment, and economy nexus and optimum design model for nearly-zero exergy airport (nZEXAP) systems  ap. 1329-1349.  aThis paper introduces the Nearly-Zero Exergy Airport (nZEXAP) concept that brings an energy, environment, and economy nexus to a common basis using the Second-Law of Thermodynamics. An nZEXAP airport has a district energy plant of its own, which receives at least 70% of the total exergy input at winter design conditions and 60% at summer design conditions, from onsite renewable energy resources and sustainable systems. These numerical criteria are consistent with the fact that especially ground heat, and solar heat have low exergy, compared to fossil fuels, and solar and wind energy applications in airports are limited. This definition is the basis of the new optimum plant design model for satisfying these new conditions with the least cost that is attributed to the cogeneration (aka CHP) system using an optimum mix of fossil and alternative fuels, such as on site-produced biogas. The main renewable exergy inputs are biogas, ground heat, building integrated or attached PV, and waste heat. Extensive use of on-site wind and roof-top or on-land type of solar applications are limited in compliance to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations against glint and glare to pilots and air traffic controllers besides potential electromagnetic hazards on avionics. The exergetic performance of the airport district plant is defined and analyzed with the use of the Rational Exergy Management Model (REMM). New exergy metrics for the performance analysis and rating of nZEXAP airports, based energy, economy, and environment nexus were also developed. The optimization problem has three primary design variables, namely the ratio of the optimum cogeneration engine capacity to the peak power load, the split of the generated power supply between the airport and the groundsource heat pumps, and the natural gas to biogas mixing ratio. The objective function solves the primary design variables by a simple search method. The new tool was applied to a conceptual study for the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in order to compare the impact of an nZEXAP design with the ongoing deep retrofit work. Amsterdam Schiphol Airport aims to make its own activities climate neutral and to generate 10% of its own energy sustainably by 2020. In this comparison, the relative impact of the biogas share, solar input, size and performance of the ground-source heat pumps, and the power-to-heat ratio of cogeneration and absorption cooling were investigated. The results indicate that with the new optimization model, nZEXAP objectives may be satisfied, if techno-economic constraints are also satisfied. Further refinements in the definition may be needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aairports 3aalternative fuels 3aaviation 3abiogas 3aclimate 3acompliance 3acontrollers 3acooling 3aexergy 3afossils 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3amixing 3amodels 3anatural gas 3asummer 3asystem optimization 3awastes 3awind 3awind power 3awinter 0aSustainable airport 0aNearly-zero exergy airport (nZEXAP) 0aCogeneration 0aBiogas generation 0aGround-source heat pumps 0aBIPV 0aORC 0aAmsterdam Schiphol Airport1 aKılkış, Şiir0 tEnergy.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 140 p.1329-1349dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245012800176300001600304520193000320592002802250650002002278650001502298650001502313650001602328650001602344650001402360650001402374650004302388650001202431650001602443650001602459650001602475650001702491650001602508650000902524650001402533700002202547700003102569700002202600700001702622700001802639700002202657700001602679773009002695856008402785852000902869655001202878IND60083906220221120101437.0141101e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008390622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeidlova-Wuttke, Dana10aOsteoprotective effects of Cimicifuga racemosa and its triterpene-saponins are responsible for reduction of bone marrow fat  ap. 855-860.  aPURPOSE: Elderly people often develop visceral obesity accompanied by osteoporosis. Visceral adipocytes secrete a number of adipokines and cytokines which augment the development of arteriosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. Bone marrow fat cells also secrete these pro-inflammatory cytokines which stimulate osteoclast and inhibit osteoblast activity. Ovariectomized (ovx) rats also develop general and bone marrow obesity and osteoporosis both of which can be partially prevented by estradiol (E2) and the special extract of Cimicifuga racemosa (CR) BNO 1055. Whether this extract or the thereof isolated triterpene-saponins or polar substances can also prevent bone marrow obesity and thereby the development of osteoporosis was compared with the effects of estradiol (E2). METHODS: Rats were ovx and fed with food containing either CR BNO 1055 or its triterpene-saponin or polar constituents or with E2 for 4 weeks. Histomorphometry and STRUT analyses were applied to histological preparations to determine the amount of trabecles, hematopoietic and fat tissue in the bone marrow. RESULTS: Ovx rats lost significant amounts of trabecular BMD, surface and nodes while the number of free trabecular ends and fat load in the marrow increased. This was totally prevented by E2 and partially by CR BNO 1055 and the triterpene-saponin but not by the polar fraction. High serum osteocalcin and CrossLaps levels were reduced by E2 and the S-fraction. CONCLUSIONS: It is well established that E2 prevents osteoporosis. It is also known that CR BNO 1055 does not contain estrogenic substances. CR BNO 1055 and the triterpene-saponin-fraction reduced the development of osteoporosis most likely by a reduction of the bone marrow fat load and possibly by reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Hence, the triterpene-saponin-fraction may serve as a basis for a new osteoporosis preventing preparation also in human patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActaea racemosa 3aadipocytes 3aadipokines 3ablood serum 3abone marrow 3acytokines 3aestradiol 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aosteoclasts 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3arats 3asecretion1 aStecher, Günther1 aRobo Bass HiFic(Musician)1 aHaunschild, Jutta1 aEder, Nicole1 aStahnke, Vera1 aWessels, Johannes1 aWuttke, W.,0 tPhytomedicine.g2012 July 15, v. 19, no. 10 p.855-860dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245013500205300002000340520154700360592002801907650001501935650001601950650003001966650001601996650001302012650002302025650001302048700005702061773013802118856008102256852000902337655001202346IND60756118120221119195611.0211111e20211008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075611812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c078822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamencek, Tomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5654-824110aUnderstanding the Anisotropic Elastic Properties of Metal–Organic Frameworks at the Nanoscale: The Instructive Example of MOF-74  ap. 24728-24745.  aMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a particularly intriguing class of self-assembled materials, whose elastic properties crucially impact many of their envisioned applications. Thus, we here present an in-depth, “nanoscale” discussion of these properties for the prototypical class of MOF-74 derivatives. These provide a particular wealth of insights due to their pronounced anisotropy with fundamentally different building blocks connecting the structures parallel and perpendicular to the pore direction. To go beyond solely reporting macroscopic parameters, we trace their values back to atomistic displacements under stress employing state-of-the-art dispersion-corrected density functional theory. Interestingly, all of the studied MOFs exhibit qualitatively different responses to either unidirectional or isotropic stress, which can be ascribed to distinctly different atomic rearrangements for stress parallel or perpendicular to the channel direction. In the former case, one primarily observes a lateral expansion and rotation of the nodes, which can be impeded, e.g., by an exoskeleton formed by an adsorbed water layer. Conversely, for stress perpendicular to the channel, the MOFs comply with a deformation of the hexagonal pores, which causes a significant expansion perpendicular to the stress direction. We also show that the details of these atomistic motions impact the structure-to-property relationships for a variety of MOF-74 variants beyond the expectations based on bonding strengths and the degree of porosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3adeformation 3adensity functional theory 3aexoskeleton 3aisotropy 3aphysical chemistry 3aporosity1 aZojer, Egbert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6502-17210 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 08, v. 125, no. 44 p.24728-24745dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c078823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245010500209300001600314520133500330592002801665650002501693650001701718650001901735650001101754650001401765650001001779650000901789650002001798650002401818650002901842650001201871651001101883653002101894653000901915653003601924653003001960653002101990653002302011700002402034700006002058700002302118773009002141856008502231852000902316655001202325IND60568635920221121031557.0180912e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056863592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiemele, Jelena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4064-294310aSustainability of heat energy tariff in district heating system: Statistic and dynamic methodologies  ap. 834-845.  aThe article analyzes district heating system efficiency by using benchmarking system. The 26 biggest Latvian DH companies were taken as case study for analysis. Two main components were distinguished from existing district heating systems tariffs: cost of fuel in tariff and other costs. Non-linear regression model is used for benchmarking analysis. Equation, which describes other costs as dependent variable, whereas fuel part of costs in tariff as independent variable was obtained. Performance of Latvian district heating companies were evaluated by using various efficiency indicators describing systems technical, scale, dynamic and financial parameters. Data envelopment analysis was used for measuring efficiency of these companies by taking into account multiple factors. In order to indicate main parameters that influence heat energy tariff and efficiency of all district heating system, sensitivity analysis by using system dynamic model developed in previous study was carried out. The model finds out the possibility to introduce the 4th generation district heating system in Latvia. Model includes the transition of heat network to the low-temperature regime at 80% share of the renewable energy. Moreover, matrix with district heating system efficiency parameters, which are most vital for optimization, was made.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3aequations 3afuels 3aheat 3aheating systems 3aregression analysis 3arenewable energy sources 3atariffs 3aLatvia 0aDistrict heating 0a4GDH 0aData Envelopment Analysis (DEA) 0aSystem dynamics modelling 0aRenewable energy 0aSustainable energy1 aGravelsins, Armands1 aBlumberga, Andra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4712-47941 aBlumberga, Dagnija0 tEnergy.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 137 p.834-845dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245011500181300001800296520150700314592002801821650001501849650001901864650001201883650001301895650001801908650001401926650002101940650001301961650001901974650001401993650001702007650001002024650000802034650001602042650001402058650000902072650001402081650001602095650001102111650002702122650001102149650001302160651002302173651001102196773011902207856008102326852000902407655001202416IND60615872020221121225714.0181015e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061587202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0599-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMárquez-Farías, J.

However, little is known of the life history of this species. To address this lack of critical biological information, the reproductive biology of Rhinobatos productus was investigated in the eastern Gulf of California. Development of claspers and testes indicated that males reach maturity at 53 cm total length (TL). Measurements of oviducal gland, largest ovum diameter, and uterus width indicated that females >57 cm TL are mature. This species possesses two functional ovaries: the ovarian cycle and gestation run concurrently. Histological analysis of oviducal glands did not provide evidence of sperm storage, but females carrying uterine capsules were observed over an extended period, suggesting the possibility of diapause in the early embryonic development. Following 4–5 months of embryonic growth, pups were typically born from late June to October after a gestation period of approximately 11–12 months. Width of yolk sac was inversely related to embryo length. The rate of reduction of yolk sac width suggests that embryos depend on the sac until birth. Mean fecundity was estimated to be 5 (range 1–10, s.d. = 2.24) with a 1:1 sex ratio. Average size at birth was 175 mm TL. Seasonally, gravid females enter shallow waters for parturition, becoming extremely vulnerable to gill nets used in the artisanal ray fishery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhinobatos 3aanimal ovaries 3abycatch 3adiapause 3aembryogenesis 3afecundity 3agestation period 3agillnets 3agravid females 3ahistology 3alife history 3amales 3aova 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3apups 3asex ratio 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atraditional technology 3auterus 3ayolk sac 3aGulf of California 3aMexico0 tMarine biology.g2007 May, v. 151, no. 4 p.1445-1454dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-006-0599-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009000162300001400252520116000266592002801426650002201454650002201476650002201498650001301520650001901533650001201552650002201564650001301586650001901599650001401618650002301632650002101655650001201676653002301688653001901711653003501730653005301765653002201818700001701840700001401857700001601871700001601887700001701903700001601920700001601936700001701952773012201969856008202091852000902173655001202182IND60599844820221120025838.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasui, M.10aSynthesis, crystal structure and thermal decomposition kinetics of yttrium propionate  ap. 92-98.  aYttrium propionate, Y2(CH3CH2COO)6·xH2O, has been used as a precursor in the preparation of Y2O3 and YBa2Cu3O7−x thin films. The molecular structure of this precursor was determined by X-ray diffraction on single crystals, in good agreement with the formula calculated from the thermogravimetric analysis data. The molecular structure consists of a bimetallic complex with two Y atoms linked by two propionate groups in a bridging bimetallic tridentate fashion, and each metal bearing an extra two monometallic bidentate propionate ligands. The thermal decomposition was studied using the thermogravimetry–differential thermal analysis and mass spectrometry (TG–DTA–MS), in inert atmosphere. The influence of the different heating rates, such as 5, 7.5, 10, 15 and 20°C/min on the thermal behaviour of yttrium propionate was investigated. The X-ray diffraction pattern on the precursor powder heat treated under nitrogen has shown that the final decomposition product of [Y2(CH3CH2COO)6·4H2O]·H2O is Y2O3. The activation energy, as a kinetic parameter, was determined by using both Kissinger and Friedman methods for the decomposition process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3aheat treatment 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3apropionic acid 3apyrolysis 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3ayttrium 0aYttrium propionate 0aSingle crystal 0aThermal decomposition kinetics 0aThermogravimetry–differential thermal analysis 0aMass spectrometry1 aPetrisor, T.1 aMos, R.B.1 aMesaros, A.1 aVarga, R.A.1 aVasile, B.S.1 aRistoiu, T.1 aCiontea, L.1 aPetrisor, T.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Mar., v. 106 p.92-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011600166300001400282520117800296592002801474650001601502650002401518650001601542650001701558650001201575650001601587651001001603700002601613773009001639856008401729852000901813655001201822IND60097519820221119180448.0141104e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009751982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeco, Jaime10aDisplacement based coupled model for unconfined seepage problems applied to the Gasset Dam (Ciudad Real, Spain)  ap. 64-73.  aThe present work shows the application of a new methodology, to find out the free surface inside earth fill dams under steady flow conditions, to a real field case: the Gasset Dam, in Ciudad Real, Spain. An accurate and fast computation of the free surface is of paramount importance, since it is a previous and necessary step for evaluating the safety of an earth dam in terms of its stress–strain behavior. This new methodology is based on a coupled numerical model formulated in terms of displacements (so called u–w formulation) instead of a more usual approach of water heads. The developed general code has been previously validated using several theoretical seepage problems through porous media. The selected field case is an earth dam built a century ago, which has been subjected to several rehabilitation works since then. Hence, it is a very irregular and nonhomogeneous dam. The comparison of computations and real field measurements, in terms of the free surface location and the total discharge through the dam under steady conditions, is presented in this paper, demonstrating the accuracy and applicability of this formulation to this kind of problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3amathematical models 3amethodology 3aporous media 3aseepage 3asteady flow 3aSpain1 aLópez-Querol, Susana0 tEngineering geology.g2012 June 1, v. 137-138 p.64-73dElsevier B.V.x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009600165500001400261520147000275592002801745650002301773650002601796650002901822650001501851650001601866650002901882650001901911650002101930650001701951650001101968650002301979650001102002650003002013650001202043700002202055700002502077700002502102773012102127856007302248852000902321655001202330IND60732246420221118022252.0210326e20210311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073224642DNAL7 a10.3390/v130304552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutcliffe, Steven  G.10aCommon Oral Medications Lead to Prophage Induction in Bacterial Isolates from the Human Gut  aNAL-light  aMany bacteria carry bacteriophages (bacterial viruses) integrated in their genomes in the form of prophages, which replicate passively alongside their bacterial host. Environmental conditions can lead to prophage induction; the switching from prophage replication to lytic replication, that results in new bacteriophage progeny and the lysis of the bacterial host. Despite their abundance in the gut, little is known about what could be inducing these prophages. We show that several medications, at concentrations predicted in the gut, lead to prophage induction of bacterial isolates from the human gut. We tested five medication classes (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, chemotherapy, mild analgesic, cardiac, and antibiotic) for antimicrobial activity against eight prophage-carrying human gut bacterial representative isolates in vitro. Seven out of eight bacteria showed signs of growth inhibition in response to at least one medication. All medications led to growth inhibition of at least one bacterial isolate. Prophage induction was confirmed in half of the treatments showing antimicrobial activity. Unlike antibiotics, host-targeted medications led to a species-specific induction of Clostridium beijerinckii, Bacteroides caccae, and to a lesser extent Bacteroides eggerthii. These results show how common medication consumption can lead to phage-mediated effects, which in turn would alter the human gut microbiome through increased prophage induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides caccae 3aBacteroides eggerthii 3aClostridium beijerinckii 3aanalgesics 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteriophages 3adigestive system 3adrug therapy 3agenome 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aprogeny1 aShamash, Michael 1 aHynes, Alexander  P.1 aMaurice, Corinne  F.0 tViruses.g2021 Mar. 11, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130304553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04278naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013000175300001600305520262100321592002802942650000802970650001002978650002002988650000903008650001003017650001303027650002003040650001003060650001503070650001603085650001703101650001903118650001803137650001003155650002603165650001103191650002503202650001603227650004303243650000903286650001403295650001303309700001503322700001603337700002003353700001703373700001703390700001603407700001703423700001503440700001903455700001903474773009003493856008403583852000903667655001203676IND60083906420221120111511.0141101e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008390642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlrich-Merzenich, G.10aNovel neurological and immunological targets for salicylate-based phytopharmaceuticals and for the anti-depressant imipramine  ap. 930-939.  aInflammatory processes are increasingly recognised to contribute to neurological and neuropsychatric disorders such as depression. Thus we investigated whether a standardized willow bark preparation (WB) which contains among other constituents salicin, the forerunner of non-steroidal antiphlogistic drugs, would have an effect in a standard model of depression, the forced swimming test (FST), compared to the antidepressant imipramine. Studies were accompanied by gene expression analyses. In order to allocate potential effects to the different constituents of WB, fractions of the extract with different compositions of salicyl alcohol derivative and polyphenols were also investigated. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n=12/group) were treated for 14 days (p.o.) with the WB preparation STW 33-I (group A) and its fractions (FR) (groups FR-B to E) in concentrations of 30mg/kg. The FRs were characterized by a high content of flavone and chalcone glycosides (FR-B), flavonoid glycosides and salicyl alcohol derivatives (FR-C), salicin and related salicyl alcohol derivatives (FR-D) and proanthocyanidines (FR-E). The tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (20mg/kg) (F) was used as positive control. The FST was performed on day 15. The cumulative immobility time was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in group A (36%), group FR-D (44%) and by imipramine (16%) compared to untreated controls. RNA was isolated from peripheral blood. RNA samples (group A, group FR-D, and imipramine) were further analysed by rat whole genome microarray (Agilent) in comparison to untreated controls. Quantitative PCR for selected genes was performed. Genes (>2 fold, p<0.01), affected by WB and/or FR-D and imipramine, included both inflammatory (e.g. IL-3, IL-10) and neurologically relevant targets. Common genes regulated by WB, FR-D and imipramine were GRIA 2 ↓, SRP54 ↓, CYP26B ↓, DNM1L ↑ and KITLG ↓. In addition, the hippocampus of rats treated (27d) with WB (15–60mg/kg WB) or imipramine (15mg/kg bw) showed a slower serotonin turnover (5-hydroxyindol acetic acid/serotonin (p<0.05)) depending on the dosage. Thus WB (30mg/kg), its ethanolic fraction rich in salicyl alcohol derivatives (FR-D) (30mg/kg) and imipramine, by being effective in the FST, modulated known and new targets relevant for neuro- and immunofunctions in rats. These findings contribute to our understanding of the link between inflammation and neurological functions and may also support the scope for the development of co-medications from salicylate-containing phytopharmaceuticals as multicomponent mixtures with single component synthetic drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aSalix 3aantidepressants 3abark 3ablood 3achalcone 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycosides 3ahippocampus 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-3 3amales 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyphenols 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3aserotonin 3aswimming1 aKelber, O.1 aKoptina, A.1 aFreischmidt, A.1 aHeilmann, J.1 aMüller, J.,1 aZeitler, H.1 aSeidel, M.F.1 aLudwig, M.1 aHeinrich, E.U.1 aWinterhoff, H.0 tPhytomedicine.g2012 July 15, v. 19, no. 10 p.930-939dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010700172300001600279520147000295592002801765650001501793650001301808650002301821650001901844650001201863650002701875650000901902650002901911650001301940650001401953650000901967650002901976650000702005650002302012650001502035650001302050700001902063700001802082773009502100856008502195852000902280655001202289IND60084342520221119110530.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008434252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2010.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Rachel A.10aPlant-derived phenolic compounds impair the remediation of acid mine drainage using treatment wetlands  ap. 172-175.  aThe use of wetlands to remediate acid mine drainage has expanded rapidly since the realisation that acid coal mine drainage running into natural sphagnum wetlands undergoes an increase in pH and a precipitation of metals. However, our study suggests that the inclusion of plants in the acid mine drainage treatment system may be questionable, due to inefficiencies caused by exudation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and in particular its phenolic constituents. They complex with iron, causing increased solubility, the exact opposite of what is required to facilitate amelioration. The addition of minewater to planted wetland mesocosms initially caused a decline in Fe concentrations, typically from over 1100 to a low of 75mgL⁻¹. However, it increased higher than 300mgL⁻¹ after 15 days. The rise in iron occurred concurrently with DOC and phenolic increases; 15–69 and 5–15mgL⁻¹, respectively, for Eriophorum angustifolium. Removal of DOC by precipitation with calcium lowered the DOC abundance, but without a simultaneous decrease in iron concentration. The concentration of one fraction of the DOC, phenolic compounds, did not decline, and we propose that the Fe was complexed with that phenolic DOC pool. The proposal was confirmed by enzymic depletion of the phenolic compounds using phenol oxidase. Our findings suggest that phenolic complexation represents a potent constraint on wetland-based bioremediation of iron in acid mine drainage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEriophorum 3aSphagnum 3aacid mine drainage 3abioremediation 3acalcium 3achemical precipitation 3acoal 3adissolved organic carbon 3adrainage 3aexudation 3airon 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3asolubility 3awetlands1 aFreeman, Chris1 aKang, Hojeong0 tEcological engineering.g2011 Feb., v. 37, no. 2 p.172-175dElsevier B.V.x0925-85747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2010.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245011200199300002000311520114600331592002801477650001101505650001201516650001401528650001301542650001301555650002101568650001701589650001601606700001501622700005201637700001801689700001601707700001401723700005501737773013801792856008101930852000902011655001202020IND60756118420221119195502.0211111e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075611842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c080702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovak, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7813-118010aTemperature Dependent Local Atomic Structure and Vibrational Dynamics of Barium Hydride and Calcium Hydride  ap. 24328-24339.  aSolid-state ionic conductors that exhibit pure ionic transport of hydride anions are rare. In this study, we investigate two alkaline earth metal hydrides, barium hydride and calcium hydride, using neutron scattering techniques to understand how the local atomic environment plays a role in the diffusion of hydride ions. At high temperatures, barium hydride exhibits exceptional transport properties with ionic conductivities that are higher than those of many of the typical proton and oxide ion conductors in use today. Total neutron scattering and pair distribution function analysis reveal how a structural phase transition converts barium hydride from a modest ionic conductor into a fast ionic conductor through the introduction of disorder, deuterium site splitting, and dynamic structural fluctuations. Furthermore, neutron vibrational spectroscopy is employed to probe changes in the temperature evolution of the lattice dynamics and local energy landscape. These results improve our fundamental knowledge of the interplay between structure and dynamics governing a rare conduction process of hydride ions in solid-state materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium 3acalcium 3adeuterium 3ahydrides 3aneutrons 3aphase transition 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aDaemen, L.1 aPage, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9071-33831 aNeuefeind, J.1 aEverett, M.1 aEgami, T.1 aJalarvo, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0644-68660 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 125, no. 44 p.24328-24339dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c080703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016200166300001600328500001500344520180900359592002802168650001902196650001202215650001102227650001302238650001402251650002202265650001502287650001902302650001302321650002102334650002002355650002002375650001102395650001002406653002502416700001402441700001502455700001502470700001402485700001802499700001902517700001802536700001502554700001702569700002402586700002002610773009002630856008402720852000902804655001202813IND60083906620221120101540.0141101e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008390662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuler, V.10aBryophyllum pinnatum inhibits detrusor contractility in porcine bladder strips—A pharmacological study towards a new treatment option of overactive bladder  ap. 947-951.  a2019-12-06  aAIMS: A broad spectrum of synthetic agents is available for the treatment of overactive bladder. Anti-cholinergic drugs show a poor compliance due to side effects. There is an increasing use of plant extracts in medicine. We have therefore investigated the inhibitory effects of leaf press juice from Bryophyllum pinnatum (Lam.) Oken (Kalanchoe pinnata L.) on bladder strips and compared the effects to that of oxybutynin. METHODS: Strips of porcine detrusor were prepared in Krebs solution and contractility was measured in a myograph system chamber aired with O₂/CO₂ at 37°C. To induce contractions, electrical field stimulation (32Hz, 40V) was used for the inhibitory effect measurements, and carbachol (50μM) for the relaxant effect measurements. Recordings were obtained in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of Bryophyllum pinnatum leaf press juice (BPJ, 0.1–10%), and oxybutynin (10⁻⁷–10⁻³M) as a reference substance. RESULTS: In inhibition experiments, BPJ as well as oxybutynin inhibited electrically induced contractions of porcine detrusor. BPJ at concentrations of 5% inhibited the contraction compared to a time matched control significantly by 74.6±10.2% (p<0.001). BPJ as well as oxybutynin relaxed carbachol pre-contracted porcine detrusor strips. The maximum relaxant effect of BPJ compared to a time matched control was 18.7±3.7 (p<0.05) at a concentration of 10% BPJ. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations show that BPJ inhibits contractions induced by electrical field stimulation and relaxes carbachol-induced contractions. However, the effect was lower than that of the reference substance oxybutynin. It is important to continue in vitro experiments as well as clinical studies with BPJ that might offer a new treatment option for patients with OAB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3abladder 3ajuices 3amedicine 3acarbachol 3aKalanchoe pinnata 3acompliance 3aplant extracts 3apatients 3ain vitro studies 3aclinical trials 3aadverse effects 3aleaves 3aswine 0aBryophyllum pinnatum1 aSuter, K.1 aFürer, K.1 aEberli, D.1 aHorst, M.1 aBetschart, C.1 aBrenneisen, R.1 aHamburger, M.1 aMennet, M.1 aSchnelle, M.1 aSimões-Wüst, A.P.1 avon Mandach, U.0 tPhytomedicine.g2012 July 15, v. 19, no. 10 p.947-951dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011200166300001400278520093700292592002801229650002001257650002101277650002601298650001801324650001201342653002501354653003201379653003701411653002101448700001701469700001901486700001601505700001301521773008701534856008501621852000901706655001201715IND60566472120221119164033.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056647212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Dongxu10aThermohydraulic performance of solar air heater with staggered multiple V-shaped ribs on the absorber plate  ap. 68-77.  aFluid flow and heat transfer in a solar air heater roughened with staggered multiple V-shaped ribs on the absorber plate were investigated numerically. Three dimensional simulations were performed for different rib geometries with varying stagger distance; rib height, pitch, and attack angle; and Reynolds number. Staggered multiple V-shaped ribs provide better heat transfer than the corresponding inline arrangement, with maximum enhancement 26% and 18% for average Nusselt number and thermohydraulic performance factor, respectively. Streamwise primary vortex with inter-rib subsidiary vortex is still the basic flow structure for the staggered ribs, similar to the inline case. The gap flow induces two competing effects on heat transfer, enhancing heat transfer efficiency maximally at the optimum stagger distance. Maximum thermohydraulic performance factor for the staggered ribs was 2.43 in the range of parameters studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 3aheat transfer 3aheaters 0aNumerical simulation 0aThermohydraulic performance 0aStaggered multiple V-shaped ribs 0aSolar air heater1 aZuo, Jianguo1 aQuan, Shenglin1 aXu, Shiming1 aGao, Hao0 tEnergy.g2017 May 15, v. 127 p.68-77dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001600167245010600183300001600289520069700305592002801002650002001030650001401050650001401064650002901078650001001107650001901117650001401136650003001150650001201180650001401192650006201206650002401268650005101292651001701343651003201360700002101392700001801413700001601431700001901447773010201466856008401568852000901652655001201661IND4450095120221120185007.0141111e20110310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445009512DNAL7 a211456602pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfitzer, S.10aTick-borne blood parasites in nyala (Tragelaphus angasii, Gray 1849) from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  ap. 126-131.  aA total of 97 blood samples of nyala (Tragelaphus angasii, Gray 1849) from South Africa were tested for the presence of tick-borne haemoparasites by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization.

Despite the growing interest in Hg₁–ₓCdₓTe, very little information currently exists on how their electrical properties are affected upon compression. Here, we systematically investigate the high-pressure behaviors of bulk Au-doped Hg₀.₇₈₁Cd₀.₂₁₉Te crystals with the doping level close to the Kane fermion point. A clear structure evolution path of this compound with pressure varying from zinc blende (F43̅m) through cinnabar (P3₁21) and rocksalt (Fm3̅m) to the orthorhombic one (Cmcm) is established from the measurements of phonon spectra, resistivity, and the Hall effect. Pressure-induced phonon softening is proposed to be the driving force for the phase transition. The last two phases are found to exhibit superconductivity with different pressure dependence of the critical temperature. These results and findings suggest that superconductivity is the general nature of mercury cadmium tellurium compounds at high pressures. The group II–VI compounds thus also offer a pool for finding new superconductors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achemical composition 3aevolution 3amercury 3aphase transition 3asuperconductivity 3atellurium 3atemperature 3azinc1 aBai, Feng-Xian1 aHuang, Ge1 aYu, Hao1 aDong, Zuo-Yuan1 aSun, Quan-Zhi1 aDai, Ning1 aSun, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9801-29871 aChen, Xiao-Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3921-94240 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 125, no. 44 p.24746-24754dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c081693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03997naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006600166300001600232520211700248592002802365650002002393650001402413650001002427650001702437650002202454650001502476650001602491650001802507650001302525650001002538650002402548650003502572650001002607650001102617650001802628650001902646650001002665650001202675650001702687650000902704650001902713650001602732650002102748650003202769650001602801700001802817700002202835700002202857700001802879700001802897700001902915700001902934700001802953700001702971700002502988700001803013700002303031700001703054700002303071700002203094773009003116856008403206852000903290655001203299IND60083906720221120111335.0141101e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008390672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yueshan10aLipid-lowering effect of berberine in human subjects and rats  ap. 861-867.  aDue to serious adverse effects and the limited effectiveness of currently available pharmacological therapies for obesity, many research efforts have focused on the development of drugs from natural products. Our previous studies demonstrated that berberine, an alkaloid originally isolated from traditional Chinese herbs, prevented fat accumulation in vitro and in vivo. In this pilot study, obese human subjects (Caucasian) were given 500mg berberine orally three times a day for twelve weeks. The efficacy and safety of berberine treatment was determined by measurements of body weight, comprehensive metabolic panel, blood lipid and hormone levels, expression levels of inflammatory factors, complete blood count, and electrocardiograph. A Sprague-Dawley rat experiment was also performed to identify the anti-obesity effects of berberine treatment. The results demonstrate that berberine treatment produced a mild weight loss (average 5lb/subject) in obese human subjects. But more interestingly, the treatment significantly reduced blood lipid levels (23% decrease of triglyceride and 12.2% decrease of cholesterol levels) in human subjects. The lipid-lowering effect of berberine treatment has also been replicated in the rat experiment (34.7% decrease of triglyceride and 9% decrease of cholesterol level). Cortisol, calcitriol, ACTH, TSH, FT4, and SHBG levels were not significantly changed following 12 weeks of berberine treatment. However, there was interestingly, an increase in calcitriol levels seen in all human subjects following berberine treatment (mean 59.5% increase, p=0.11). Blood inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-6, TNFα, COX-2) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were not significantly affected by treatment with berberine. Tests of hematological, cardiovascular, liver, and kidney function following berberine treatment showed no detrimental side effects to this natural compound. Collectively, this study demonstrates that berberine is a potent lipid-lowering compound with a moderate weight loss effect, and may have a possible potential role in osteoporosis treatment/prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aberberine 3ablood 3ablood lipids 3abody measurements 3acalcitriol 3acholesterol 3acorticotropin 3acortisol 3adrugs 3aelectrocardiography 3aerythrocyte sedimentation rate 3aherbs 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-6 3alipemic effect 3aliver 3aobesity 3aosteoporosis 3arats 3arenal function 3athyrotropin 3atriacylglycerols 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aweight loss1 aEhli, Erik A.1 aKittelsrud, Julie1 aRonan, Patrick J.1 aMunger, Karen1 aDowney, Terry1 aBohlen, Krista1 aCallahan, Leah1 aMunson, Vicki1 aJahnke, Mike1 aMarshall, Lindsey L.1 aNelson, Kelly1 aHuizenga, Patricia1 aHansen, Ryan1 aSoundy, Timothy J.1 aDavies, Gareth E.0 tPhytomedicine.g2012 July 15, v. 19, no. 10 p.861-867dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01172naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245009500158300001600253520025200269592002800521650002300549650001400572650001100586650001300597650001100610700002300621700001800644773012600662856007300788852000900861655001200870IND60657491220221123003447.0190816e20040310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065749122DNAL7 a10.1039/b315839j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachida, Masato10aNovel oxygen storage mechanism based on redox of sulfur in lanthanum oxysulfate/oxysulfide  ap. 662-663.  aA sulfur redox cycle between La₂O₂SO₄(S⁶⁺) and La₂O₂S(S²⁻) phases was found for the first time to achieve the oxygen storage of 2 mol O₂ mol⁻¹, which is eight times larger than that of the conventional CeO₂–ZrO₂ system.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3alanthanum 3aoxygen 3asulfides 3asulfur1 aKawamura, Kiyotaka1 aIto, Kazuhiro0 tChemical communications.g2004 Mar. 10, , no. 6 p.662-663dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b315839j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245006200167300001600229500001400245520076900259536006001028592002801088596001301116650001001129650001401139650001801153650002001171650001501191650001901206650002501225650001301250650001601263653002501279653001801304700001701322700001801339700002001357773013201377856008601509852000901595655001201604IND60730422820221119053829.0210312e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073042282DNAL7 a10.1080/15378020.2020.18421132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaiki, Mika10aRestaurant menu-planning in Japan: A qualitative analysis  ap. 165-176.  aNAL-light  aIn Asia, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is a serious problem. Eating out is now common, including in Japan, and eating out has been reported to be positively related to the onset of NCDs. To improve the nutritional quality of out-of-home meals, we must be able to identify the factors affecting menu planning. However, there are no reports on how restaurateurs plan their menus in Asian countries. So, we used semi-structured interviews with 26 restaurateurs. As a result, we identified the following five factors: Sales Promotion, Internal Factors of Restaurateurs, Customer Prioritization, External Factors, and Management for Profit, which indicate that to improve the nutritional quality, efficient strategies should consider these factors.  aThis work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [18K02219].  aPublisher supplied data  a18K02219 3aJapan 3amarketing 3amenu planning 3anutritive value 3aprevalence 3aprioritization 3aqualitative analysis 3aresearch 3arestaurants 0aqualitative research 0apublic health1 aShimpo, Misa1 aAkamatsu, Rie1 aKomatsu, Mihono0 tJournal of foodservice business research.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 24, no. 2 p.165-176dRoutledgewJournal:J000000105x1537-80397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15378020.2020.18421133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009900162300001800261520157200279592002801851650001201879650001401891650001701905650001101922650001901933650000901952650002601961650001201987650001201999650001802011650001302029650001402042650001102056651001402067700002102081700001802102773011902120856008102239852000902320655001202329IND60615872520221121233814.0181015e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061587252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-006-0560-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesche, A.10aOverwintering strategies of dominant calanoid copepods in the German Bight, southern North Sea  ap. 1309-1320.  aAbundance, stage composition and reproductive parameters (egg production, egg viability, proportion of spawning females) of the four copepod species Acartia clausi, Centropages hamatus, C. typicus and Temora longicornis were measured at the long term sampling station Helgoland Roads (German Bight, southern North Sea) from September 2003 to May 2004 to study their overwintering strategies. A. clausi was overwintering as females with arrested reproduction from November to January. T. longicornis, which is known to produce resting eggs in the North Sea, had a pelagic population with all developmental stages present during winter and reproductive rates closely related to food concentrations. Although their females produced eggs in response to ambient food conditions, both C. hamatus and C. typicus were rare in the pelagic. The C. hamatus population returned in May, probably from resting eggs, whereas C. typicus depended on advection. The Centropages species seemed to be less adapted to pelagic life in winter than A. clausi and T. longicornis. Sporadic occurrence of large numbers of nauplii and young copepodids of A. clausi and Centropages spp. pointed to different overwintering strategies or more successful survival in adjacent regions and advection of them into the waters around Helgoland island. While A. clausi was decoupled from environmental conditions in late autumn and winter, the other species were able to respond to variations in the food environment. Thus, egg production of T. longicornis increased during an unusual autumn diatom bloom.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcartia 3aadvection 3aalgal blooms 3aautumn 3aegg production 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3anauplii 3aoverwintering 3aspawning 3aviability 3awinter 3aNorth Sea1 aWiltshire, K.

Employing a phenomenological epistemology, a qualitative methodology was adopted to explore FPF. Extant literature was reviewed. Using purposive sampling, and employing an emic posture, 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior restaurant and hotel chefs until saturation occurred. Interviews were transcribed, read repeatedly, and coded using the qualitative analysis software package QDA Miner Lite. An inter-rater reliability score of .78 using Cohen’s Kappa coefficient formula reflected substantial agreement between coders. Thematic analysis was used. The study revealed three main categories of FPF types (sensory/organoleptic, safety, other) and FPF causes (People related failure; Operation-related failure; and Food supply/supplier-related failures). A conceptual model was developed from these categories underpinned by management control systems, continuous training, clear communication, and the organizational culture and climate of kitchens. Chefs found that FPF was inevitable based on human error, and can be precipitated by certain factors but reduced by other interventions. Research findings may assist in reducing its frequency, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and retention while reducing financial and environmental costs of FPF. Practical, theoretical, and managerial implications are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3aconsumer satisfaction 3afood production 3afrequency 3ahospitality industry 3ahumans 3aliterature 3amodels 3apaper 3apeople 3aposture 3aqualitative analysis 3areliability 3aresearch 3arestaurants 0aFood production failure 0achefs 0aphenomenology 0apractice theory1 aAfifi, Mohamed Fawzi1 aHealy, JJ0 tJournal of foodservice business research.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 24, no. 2 p.177-214dRoutledgewJournal:J000000105x1537-80397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15378020.2020.18429553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01733naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245021300160300001600373520032200389592002800711650001100739650002300750650002300773650000900796650001300805650001400818700002200832700002300854700001900877700002200896700001900918700002100937700002400958700002100982700002201003700002301025700002001048700002501068773012501093856007201218852000901290655001201299IND60657491320221123003512.0190816e20040407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065749132DNAL7 a10.1039/b315854n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonova, Alla B.12aA novel methodology for the synthesis of complexes containing long carbon chains linking metal centres: molecular structures of {Ru(dppe)Cp*}₂(μ-C₁₄) and {Co₃(μ-dppm)(CO)₇}₂(μ₃:μ₃-C₁₆)  ap. 960-961.  aElimination of AuX(PR₃) (X = halogen, R = Ph, tol) occurs readily in reactions between compounds containing C(sp)– or C(sp²)–X bonds and alkynyl or polyynyl gold(i) complexes; this reaction has been applied to the syntheses of complexes containing a variety of metal centres linked by Cₙ chains (n up to 16).  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3agold 3ahalogens 3aruthenium1 aBruce, Michael I.1 aEllis, Benjamin G.1 aGaudio, Maryka1 aHumphrey, Paul A.1 aJevric, Martyn1 aMelino, Giovanni1 aNicholson, Brian K.1 aPerkins, Gary J.1 aSkelton, Brian W.1 aStapleton, Bronwin1 aWhite, Allan H.1 aZaitseva, Natasha N.0 tChemical communications.g2004 Apr. 7, , no. 8 p.960-961dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b315854n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012500165300001600290520091100306592002801217650002701245650001501272650002501287650001401312650000901326650001501335650001501350650002401365650002301389650001501412650002301427650001301450650002101463700002301484700002101507700002101528700002301549700002401572700002901596773007801625856008101703852000901784655001201793IND4477223920221120185106.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447722392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2012.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasas, GÃ¡bor10aOccurrence of toxic Prymnesium parvum blooms with high protease activity is related to fish mortality in Hungarian ponds  ap. 102-110.  aThe unicellular alga Prymnesium parvum has been responsible for toxic incidents with severe ecological impacts in many parts of the world, and causes massive fish kills worldwide. Recently the haptophyte microalgae have caused water-bloom (4.3Ã10â´cellsmlâ»Â¹) in 6 fish ponds with high conductivity in Hungary, and caused fish mortality with typical symptoms. Toxicity of P. parvum from water samples was quantified by the assay of the influence of its cell-free filtrates on haemolysis (346Â±42.2) and in fish and daphnia toxicity tests. High amount of proteases in P. parvum containing waterbloom samples were detected with the help of activity gel electrophoresis. The proteases of investigated P. parvum samples (125â18kDa) showed high gelatinolytic activity and some of them showed sensitivity to EDTA (inhibitors of metalloproteases) and to PMSF (inhibitors of serine proteases).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aPrymnesium 3aenvironmental impact 3afiltrates 3afish 3afish kills 3afish ponds 3agel electrophoresis 3ametalloproteinases 3amicroalgae 3aserine proteinases 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing1 aM-Hamvas, MÃ¡rta1 aBorics, GÃ¡bor1 aGonda, SÃ¡ndor1 aMÃ¡thÃ©, Csaba1 aJÃ¡mbrik, Katalin1 aNagy, Zsolt LÃ¡szlÃ³0 tHarmful algae.g2012 May, v. 17 p.102-110dElsevier B.V.x1568-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2012.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014200166300001600308520072000324592002801044650002101072650001301093650001301106650002401119650001501143650001401158650001101172650001701183653001401200653003301214653002401247653002301271653002801294700002701322700006501349773008901414856008501503852000901588655001201597IND60566472420221119165847.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056647242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖz, Çisem14aThe effect of vinegar–acetic acid solution on the hydrogen generation performance of mechanochemically modified Magnesium (Mg) granules  ap. 328-334.  aAn environmentally friendly magnesium (Mg)-based hydrogen (H2) generation system was set up based on an anodic polarization reaction using mechanochemically modified Mg granule samples combined with aqueous, biodegradable, vinegar-acetic acid solutions. The composition of the vinegar-acetic acid solutions (4.0–0.8 wt %) was changed to obtain the maximum H2 generation rate. An interpretation of the kinetic mechanisms for Nucleation–Growth and Surface Area models was made, and it was concluded that mechanochemical modification changed the hydrolysis kinetics from surface area control to nucleation and growth.

However, the genetic mechanisms underlying flower color formation in this non-model plant remain unclear. Here, the biochemical and molecular basis of the flavonoid/anthocyanin biosynthesis between purple petal cultivar (PP) and white petal cultivar (WP) was investigated. The results revealed that 142 differential flavonoid-related metabolites were identified using LC–MS/MS method, and the primary anthocyanins were identified as cyanidin derivatives. Moreover, RNA-seq revealed a total of 9523 upregulated and 6941 downregulated genes were detected. GO and KEGG analysis of DEGs indicated metabolic pathways were preferentially upregulated in PP. The expression of most known genes encoding the enzymes in anthocyanin and related derivative biosynthesis was significantly higher in PP than in WP, especially the downstream ones. We hypothesized that altered flavanone and flavone accumulation may lead to pigment elimination in WP, and the limited flux in cyanidin biosynthesis pathway seems to be the most likely reason for the colorless petal. Besides, 115 differentially expressed regulatory genes relating to anthocyanin biosynthesis were also detected, including MYB, bHLH, WD40, WRKY, MADS and bZIP. Subsequently, high consistency was observed between the results of qRT-PCR and those of RNA-seq. collectively, this study provides a comprehensive metabolic and transcriptional dataset for Phalaenopsis, the informative list of candidate structural and regulatory genes associated with purple trait offer a valuable opportunity to unravel the genetic mechanism underlying flower color formation in Phalaenopsis.  aPublisher supplied data  a31700226cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aPAPDcPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)  aBK20160215cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  aKYCX17-1619cGraduate Innovation Project of Jiangsu Normal University  a2016-K1-028cScience and Technology Program of Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China 3aPhalaenopsis 3aanthocyanins 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acorolla 3acultivars 3acyanidin 3adata collection 3aenzymes 3aflavanones 3aflavones 3aflower color 3agene expression regulation 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amolecular biology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregulator genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aLi, Ge1 aGu, Lingya1 aSun, Yu1 aLi, Zongyun1 aLiu, Jingran1 aWu, Xiaoqing1 aDong, Tingting1 aZhu, Mingku0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2020 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.823-840dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-019-10025-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144242011300170245008900283300001200372520120300384592002801587650002401615650001101639650002601650650001501676650002101691650001201712650001301724650001801737650002201755650002101777650001001798650000901808650001701817651001301834700001901847700001801866700001601884773009901900856007801999852000902077655001202086IND60132727320221119014444.0150511e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013272732DNAL7 a10.1051/forest:20080392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWimmer, R.q(Rupert),10aEffet du site sur les propriétés des fibres, de la pâte et des feuilles d’essai d’Eucalyptus globulus10aEffects of site on fibre, kraft pulp and handsheet properties of Eucalyptus globulus  ap. 602.  a• Eight-year old trees from two Eucalyptus globulus Labill. clones planted across three different sites in Tasmania, Australia, were sampled for wood and kraft pulp/handsheet properties. • Site had a significant effect on all measured properties. Compared with the poor site (Parkham) the wood from the good site (West Ridgley) had on average 11 % lower wood density. The poor site had also greater microfibril angles, shorter fibres at lower pulp yields. • The handsheets produced with pulp from the poor site resulted in comparatively higher bulkiness, lower burst, lower tear and tensile indices, lower zero span tensile strength, but higher opacity, higher light scattering and higher surface roughness. Significant height effects were found with all wood properties, and also with tear index, zero span tensile strength and opacity. • Discriminant analysis showed that for 76 out of 100 handsheets the raw material source, i.e. growth site, could be predicted correctly using a set of handsheet properties with tear index and bulk index being most prominent. • This is unique evidence that site conditions are strongly reflected in handsheet properties produced from Eucalyptus pulp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aclones 3adiscriminant analysis 3akraft pulp 3alight scattering 3aopacity 3aplanting 3araw materials 3asurface roughness 3atensile strength 3atrees 3awood 3awood density 3aTasmania1 aDownes, Geoff,1 aEvans, Robert1 aFrench, Jim0 tAnnals of forest science.g2008 Jan., v. 65, no. 6 p.602-602dSpringer-Verlagx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest:20080393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008600164520140700250592002801657650002301685650001901708650001901727650001001746650001701756650001801773650001401791650001701805650002601822650002201848653000801870653000801878653002701886653001801913653001401931653002001945653002301965700001401988700002202002700001202024700001802036773012702054856008302181852000902264655001202273IND60760322820221116203458.0220228e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076032282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2021.1107032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Liyan12aA novel Ush transcription factor involving in hematopoiesis of Eriocheir sinensis  aThe FOG transcriptional factor is a co-regulator that recognizes and binds to the GATA N-terminal zinc-finger domain and participates in hemocyte production and differentiation. In this study, an FOG-like gene, Ush, was characterized from Eriocheir sinensis, which consists of an 897 bp full-length open reading frame, encoding a polypeptide of 298 amino acids with four ZnF_C2H2 domains. The EsUsh mRNA transcripts were mainly expressed in the hematopoietic tissue (HPT) and hemocytes, and were significantly higher in hyalinocytes than semi-granulocytes and granulocytes, which were separated by Percoll gradient centrifugation. The transcription levels of EsUsh were found to be significantly upregulated in HPT, but downregulated in hemocytes after exsanguination. By using flow cytometry to determine the percentage of hemocyte sub-population after exsanguination, the percentage of hyalinocytes was found to significantly downregulated, while the percentage of granulocytes was significantly upregulated. Silencing EsUsh by dsRNA interference significantly decreased the percentage of hyalinocytes and small granulocytes, and increased the percentage of medium granulocytes and large granulocytes. Such findings suggest that EsUsh might be involved in hemocyte production and differentiation, especially in promoting hyalinocyte formation and limiting granulocyte generation and differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEriocheir sinensis 3acentrifugation 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3agranulocytes 3ahematopoiesis 3ahemocytes 3apolypeptides 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif 0aUsh 0aFOG 0aTranscriptional factor 0aHematopoiesis 0aHemocytes 0aDifferentiation 0aEriocheir sinensis1 aLiu, Fang1 aChang, Donald K.,1 aSu, Hui1 aSun, Jinsheng0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Apr.,  May, v. 259 p.110703-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12506x1096-49597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2021.1107033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03820naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245019100165506011700356506007600473520171800549592002802267506003702295650002602332650001602358650001602374650001602390650001602406650001602422650002002438650000902458650001402467650002302481650001902504650001402523650001602537650002102553650001102574650001002585650001202595650002602607650001702633650002502650650001502675650001602690653002602706653001802732653001102750653002502761653002102786700001702807700001602824700001802840700001802858700001802876700001602894700001402910700001602924700001302940773010002953856008403053852000903137655001203146IND60763162820221207060703.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076316282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1010132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Chao10aEffects of different lipid sources on growth performance, fatty acids composition in tissue and expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn eight-week feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary lipid sources on growth performance, fatty acids composition in tissue and expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Four experimental diets were formulated to contain 6% coconut oil (CO), rapeseed oil (RO), linseed oil (LO) and fish oil (FO), respectively. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of juvenile for 8 weeks. The results indicated that final body weight (FBW), percent weight gain (PWG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency (FE), survival, hepatopancreas index (HSI), viscerosomatic index (VSI) and intraperitoneal fat ratio (IPF) were not significantly influenced by dietary different lipid sources (P＞0.05). Moreover, proximate composition in whole body, dorsal muscle and liver were also not significantly affected by dietary different lipid sources (P ＞0.05). Fish fed with FO diet was significantly higher MDA concentration in hepatic and serum than those fed with CO, RO and LO diets (P < 0.05). However, T-AOC, SOD and GSH activities in hepatic and serum were not affected by different lipid sources (P＞0.05). Fish fed with RO diet had significantly higher relative expression of fas and acc in liver than those fed the other diets, the highest expression of lpl was occurred at fish fed with CO diet (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, fish fed with CO and FO diets had significantly lower expression of elovl5 and Δ6fad in liver than those fed with RO diet (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of present study indicated that vegetable oils such as CO, RO and LO can potentially be used as dietary FO substitutes for juvenile largemouth bass.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aaquaculture 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acoconut oil 3adietary fat 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish oils 3agrowth performance 3ahepatopancreas 3ajuveniles 3alinseed oil 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3aliver 3amuscles 3aproximate composition 3arapeseed oil 3aspecific growth rate 3avegetables 3aweight gain 0aMicropterus salmoides 0aLipid sources 0aGrowth 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aLipid metabolism1 aZhao, Xiaoyi1 aJiao, Lefei1 aShen, Yuedong1 aLuo, Jiaxiang1 aZhu, Tingting1 aZhao, Wenli1 aGen, Zhao1 aZhou, Qicun1 aJin, Min0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 Apr., v. 23 p.101013-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1010133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245015400163500001400317520195700331592002802288650002802316650002102344650002502365650001102390650001602401650002102417650001502438650002202453700002302475700001902498700002302517700002102540700002102561700002002582700002202602700002002624700002402644773012102668856007302789852000902862655001202871IND60732247120221118022110.0210326e20210311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073224712DNAL7 a10.3390/v130304622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKicuntod, Jintawee 10aProperties of Oligomeric Interaction of the Cytomegalovirus Core Nuclear Egress Complex (NEC) and Its Sensitivity to an NEC Inhibitory Small Molecule  aNAL-light  aHerpesviral nuclear egress is a regulated process shared by all family members, ensuring the efficient cytoplasmic release of viral capsids. In the case of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the core of the nuclear egress complex (NEC) consists of the pUL50-pUL53 heterodimer that builds hexameric lattices for capsid binding and multicomponent interaction, including NEC-associated host factors. A characteristic feature of NEC interaction is the N-terminal hook structure of pUL53 that binds to an alpha-helical groove of pUL50, thus termed as hook-into-groove interaction. This central regulatory element is essential for viral replication and shows structural–functional conservation, which has been postulated as a next-generation target of antiviral strategies. However, a solid validation of this concept has been missing. In the present study, we focused on the properties of oligomeric HCMV core NEC interaction and the antiviral activity of specifically targeted prototype inhibitors. Our data suggest the following: (i) transiently expressed, variably tagged versions of HCMV NEC proteins exert hook-into-groove complexes, putatively in oligomeric assemblies that are distinguishable from heterodimers, as shown by in vitro assembly and coimmunoprecipitation approaches; (ii) this postulated oligomeric binding pattern was further supported by the use of a pUL50::pUL53 fusion construct also showing a pronounced multi-interaction potency; (iii) using confocal imaging cellular NEC-associated proteins were found partly colocalized with the tagged core NECs; (iv) a small inhibitory molecule, recently identified by an in vitro binding inhibition assay, was likewise active in blocking pUL50–pUL53 oligomeric assembly and in exerting antiviral activity in HCMV-infected fibroblasts. In summary, the findings refine the previous concept of HCMV core NEC formation and nominate this drug-accessible complex as a validated antiviral drug target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3acapsid 3afibroblasts 3aprecipitin tests 3aprototypes 3avirus replication1 aAlkhashrom, Sewar 1 aHäge, Sigrun 1 aDiewald, Benedikt 1 aMüller, Regina,1 aHahn, Friedrich 1 aLischka, Peter 1 aSticht, Heinrich 1 aEichler, Jutta 1 aMarschall, Manfred 0 tViruses.g2021 Mar. 11, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130304623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011300163520135100276592002801627650002701655650002801682650002101710650002201731650001401753650001801767650001001785650001901795650001801814650002201832650002201854650002201876650002701898653002701925653001401952653001401966653002101980653002202001653003402023700001702057700001602074700001702090700001802107700001702125700001402142700001402156700001902170700001902189700001602208700001802224700001602242700001902258773012702277856008302404852000902487655001202496IND60760322920221116203839.0220228e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076032292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2021.1107042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Dawei10aIdentification and expression pattern of the sex determination gene fruitless-like in Cherax quadricarinatus  aThe fruitless (fru) gene has an important function in the courtship behavior and sex determination pathway of Drosophila melanogaster; however, the fru gene has never been reported in shrimps. In this study, the fruitless-like gene was identified in Cherax quadricarinatus (Cqfru) and is reported here for the first time. A sequence analysis revealed a conserved BTB domain in Cqfru which is the same as fru in D. melanogaster. An analysis of the expression level of Cqfru showed that it was highly expressed in the gastrula stage during embryonic development. Furthermore, in situ hybridization and expression distribution in tissues showed that its sexually dimorphic expression may be focused on the hepatopancreas, brains, and gonads. The gonads, brains, and hepatopancreas of males had a higher expression level of Cqfru than those of females; however, the expression level of the abdominal ganglion was found to be higher in females than in males in this study. The results of an RNA interference treatment showed that a knockdown of Cqfru reduced the expression of the insulin-like androgenic gland hormone (IAG) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The characteristic fru gene in shrimps is reported here for the first time, with the results providing basic information for research into the sex-determination mechanism in C. quadricarinatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCherax quadricarinatus 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aRNA interference 3aabdominal ganglia 3acourtship 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3ahepatopancreas 3ahybridization 3asequence analysis 3asex determination 3asexual dimorphism 3atumor necrosis factors 0aCherax quadricarinatus 0aEmbryonic 0aFruitless 0aRNA interference 0aSex determination 0aSexually dimorphic expression1 aGuo, Yongjun1 aChen, Xiuli1 aYang, Huizan1 aLi, Qiangyong1 aLiu, Qingyun1 aLuo, Fuli1 aMeng, Kui1 aYang, Songting1 aCheng, Xinquan1 aMa, Wenming1 aChen, Xiaohan1 aWang, Moran1 aZhao, Yongzhen0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Apr.,  May, v. 259 p.110704-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12506x1096-49597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2021.1107043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01380naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245014300157300001800300520038200318592002800700650002100728650002300749650002500772650001100797650001100808700001900819700003200838773012700870856007200997852000901069655001201078IND60657491620221123003319.0190816e20040407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065749162DNAL7 a10.1039/b315919a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzaun, Miklós10aFacile copper-mediated activation of the N–H bond and the oxidative cleavage of the C2–C3 bond in 1H-2-phenyl-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline  ap. 1004-1005.  aThe reaction of 1H-2-phenyl-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline (PhquinH₂; 1) with metallic copper leads to Cuᴵᴵ(PhquinH)₂ while in the presence of PPh₃ to Cuᴵ₂Cuᴵᴵ(Phquin)₂(PPh₃)₄.

The integrase can perform a palindrome cleavage reaction. In this work, a hairpin DNA probe with a palindromic DNA sequence mimicking the HIV-1 LTR–LTR junction of the 2-LTR circles in its long stem was designed for fluorescence detection of specific restriction-like cleavage activity of HIV-1 integrase. Results showed that the designed probe could be recognized and cleaved by HIV-1 integrase. The palindrome cleavage reaction can be monitored according to the increase in fluorescent signal. The assay can be applied to real-time detection of palindrome cleavage of HIV-1 integrase with advantages of simplicity, high sensitivity, and specificity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA probes 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3afluorescence 3anucleotide sequences 0aFluorescent probe 0aHIV-1 0aIntegrase 0aPalindrome cleavage1 aHe, Hong-qiu1 aGuo, Shun-xing0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 460 p.36-38dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2014.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014500171300001600316520111100332592002801443650001301471650002101484650001501505650002501520650005301545650001101598650002201609650001301631650001101644650001401655650001301669650001401682650001001696650001101706650001101717653002201728653001901750653001201769653001701781700002401798700002601822700002601848700002501874700002301899700006401922773012401986856008202110852000902192655001202201IND60599845720221117155915.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Raquel V.S.14aThe analytical characterization of castor seed cake pyrolysis bio-oils by using comprehensive GC coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry  ap. 152-159.  aThe castor oil is one of the world's most useful and economically important natural plant oils. The castor oil extraction from the pressing of castor seeds is responsible for the daily generation of half a ton of a solid residue, called castor seed cake, for every ton of seed used in this process. The aim of this work was to use slow pyrolysis to obtain, from castor seed cakes, pyrolysis oil and determine its chemical composition. The bio-oil composition was investigated using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS), and 408 compounds were tentatively identified. Among the compounds identified were: hydrocarbon (13.2%), nitrogen (9.5%), oxygen (8.4%) and sulphur (0.2%) compounds. The calorific value of the pyrolysis oils (37.5MJkg⁻¹) was similar to petroleum fuels used commercially (43–46MJkg⁻¹) and greater than typical wood-derived crude bio-oils (17MJkg⁻¹). Thus, this oil may be potentially useful for production of chemicals and energy, after upgrading, proving to be a great choice destination of this waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acastor bean cake 3acastor oil 3achemical composition 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3aenergy 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3apressing 3apyrolysis 3aseeds 3asulfur 3awastes 0aCastor seed cakes 0aSlow pyrolysis 0aBio-oil 0aGC×GC-TOFMS1 aCasilli, Alessandro1 aSampaio, Alexandre L.1 aÁvila, Bárbara M.F.1 aVeloso, Márcia C.C.1 aAzevedo, Debora A.1 aRomeiro, Gilberto A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1659-49420 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Mar., v. 106 p.152-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144242009200165245014100257300001200398500001500410520138300425592002801808650002101836650002201857650002401879650001501903650001801918650002301936650001701959650002501976650002202001650002102023650001202044651001202056653001102068700002202079700002202101700002202123700001502145773009902160856007802259852000902337655001202346IND60132727520221119014439.0150511e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013272752DNAL7 a10.1051/forest:20080342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLettens, Suzanna10aÉvolution des stocks de carbone dans la biomasse des forêts belges entre 1984 et 200010aOrganic carbon stocks and stock changes of forest biomass in Belgium derived from forest inventory data in a spatially explicit approach  ap. 604.  a2019-12-04  a• Carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems is an important though still uncertain process in the global greenhouse gas balance. • We computed biomass organic carbon (BOC) stocks of spatially explicit forested landscape units (LSU) in Belgium based on data collected in the regional forest inventories of 1984 (Wallonia region only) and 2000 (Wallonia and Flanders). C stock changes between 1984 and 2000 were estimated for Wallonia. • The total BOC pool stored in Belgian forests in 2000 amounts to 57.8 Mt C in 6222 km², or 10.0 kg C m⁻²in broadleaf, 9.5 kg C m⁻²in coniferous and 8.7 kg C m⁻²in mixed forest. Based on previous soil organic carbon (SOC) analysis for the same LSU, BOC and SOC stock per LSU appeared only weakly correlated. The total BOC sequestration between 1984 and 2000 equals 5.7 Mt C over an area of 5 107 km², resulting in a flux of 0.07 kg C m⁻²y⁻¹. The BOC content of broadleaf forest in Wallonia increased with 6%, of coniferous forest with 32% and of mixed forest with 11%. • The observed regional differences in BOC stocks and in BOC sequestration rates are explained by the forest age-class distribution and site productivity. The strength of the spatially explicit approach lies in the fact that BOC and SOC data originating from diverse sampling strategies can be combined for spatial or temporal comparison of C stocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouse gases 3adeciduous forests 3asoil organic carbon 3alandscapes 3amixed forests 3aconiferous forests 3acarbon sinks 3acarbon sequestration 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest inventory 3abiomass 3aBelgium 0acarbon1 aVan Orshoven, Jos1 aPerrtn, Dominique1 aVan Wesemael, Bas1 aMuys, Bart0 tAnnals of forest science.g2008 Jan., v. 65, no. 6 p.604-604dSpringer-Verlagx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest:20080343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013300171300001600304520202700320592002802347650002002375650002102395650001502416650002002431650001802451650001502469650002302484650002502507650003002532650002202562650002102584651001002605653002602615653002302641653002802664653001402692653002002706700001702726700001902743700001702762700001202779700001502791773010802806856008602914852000903000655001203009IND50071183820221119071140.0190318e20131212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007118382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin-Ping,10aTemporal stability analysis of surface and subsurface soil moisture for a transect in artificial revegetation desert area, China  ap. 100-109.  aTemporal stability analysis is a statistical approach for describing the persistence of spatial patterns and characteristic behavior of soil moisture. Using temporal stability method, we aimed to identify statistically stable locations to estimate mean soil moisture content and examine the feasibility of confirming temporally stable locations by using other properties that were themselves relatively temporally stable. The temporal stability of near-surface soil moisture contents were investigated at three depths at the hillslope scale in an artificial revegetation desert area, China. Soil moisture were measured at soil depth of 0–6, 0–15 and 0–30cm, using temporary frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) and time domain reflectometry (TDR), at ten locations along a hillslope with relatively homogeneous soil properties and vegetation cover but contrasting topography during May to September in 2006. Summary variables were determined at corresponding locations. Results indicated that strong temporal persistence existed at three depths, and the temporal stability was more pronounced at deep soil layer than at soil surface. The temporal stability characteristics were relatively lack in a state of transition from wet to dry. Identified statistically stable locations at three depths represented well for the mean soil moisture content; the offset values were 0.011, 0.002 and 0.001m3m−3 at 0–6, 0–15 and 0–30cm depth, respectively. The representative site for 0–6cm soil layer can serve as a good indicator of soil moisture at other depths. Elevation and soil properties were the leading factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture at the hillslope scale. The mean soil moisture contents at different depths can be predicted by other topographic and edaphic factors. This study is expected to be useful in characterizing mean soil moisture content in soil profiles on a hillslope scale, which helps to a good management of soil water on sloping land in desert areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aedaphic factors 3aland restoration 3asoil depth 3asoil management 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3astatistical analysis 3atime domain reflectometry 3atopographic slope 3avegetation cover 3aChina 0aSoil moisture content 0aTemporal stability 0aRepresentative location 0aElevation 0aSoil properties1 aPan, Yan-xia1 aZhang, Ya-feng1 aDou, Deqiang1 aHu, Rui1 aZhang, Hao0 tJournal of hydrology.g2013 Dec. 12, v. 507 p.100-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001800183245015200201300001200353506007600365520134100441592002801782506003701810650001101847650002501858650001401883650002101897650001501918650001101933650001101944650001701955650002001972650001201992650001202004650002202016650002502038650002302063650001602086650001802102650003002120650001102150650003302161700002302194700002002217700002602237700001702263700001702280700002402297700002102321700002402342700002202366773009702388856004502485852000902530655001202539IND4471288020221207083405.0120907e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447128802DNAL7 a216498932pmid7 aPMC31177002pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-6148-7-262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbraham, Getu10aGrowth and differentiation of primary and passaged equine bronchial epithelial cells under conventional and air-liquid-interface culture conditions  ap. 257.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Horses develop recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) that resembles human bronchial asthma. Differentiated primary equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBEC) in culture that closely mimic the airway cells in vivo would be useful to investigate the contribution of bronchial epithelium in inflammation of airway diseases. However, because isolation and characterization of EBEC cultures has been limited, we modified and optimized techniques of generating and culturing EBECs from healthy horses to mimic in vivo conditions. RESULTS: Large numbers of EBEC were obtained by trypsin digestion and successfully grown for up to 2 passages with or without serum. However, serum or ultroser G proved to be essential for EBEC differentiation on membrane inserts at ALI. A pseudo-stratified muco-ciliary epithelium with basal cells was observed at differentiation. Further, transepithelial resistance (TEER) was more consistent and higher in P1 cultures compared to P0 cultures while ciliation was delayed in P1 cultures. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an efficient method for obtaining a high-yield of EBECs and for generating highly differentiated cultures. These EBEC cultures can be used to study the formation of tight junction or to identify epithelial-derived inflammatory factors that contribute to lung diseases such as asthma.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasthma 3acell differentiation 3adigestion 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3ahorses 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3atight junctions 3atrypsin 2aAnimals 2aBronchixcytology 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Proliferation 2aClone Cells 2aCulture Media 2aCulture Media, Serum-Free 2aHorses 2aRespiratory Mucosaxcytology1 aZizzadoro, Claudia1 aKacza, Johannes1 aEllenberger, Christin1 aAbs, Vanessa1 aFranke, Jana1 aSchoon, Heinz-Adolf1 aSeeger, Johannes1 aTesfaigzi, Yohannes1 aUngemach, Fritz R0 tBMC veterinary research.g2011 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.257-257dSpringer-Verlagx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-7-26  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015500163300001600318520180600334592002802140650002202168650001602190650001602206650001302222650001002235650001502245650001602260650001002276650001102286650001402297650001602311650003402327653005002361653001002411653002802421653001402449653003402463653002602497700001702523700001602540700001502556773012402571856008202695852000902777655001202786IND60599845820221123041011.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosaka, A.10aDevelopment of a new micro reaction sampler for pyrolysis-GC/MS system facilitating on-line analytical chemolysis of intractable condensation polymers  ap. 160-163.  aA new micro reaction sampler is developed to facilitate the thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) reaction of intractable condensation polymers, at an elevated temperature in a sealed glass capsule under high pressure. The sampler is integrated with a glass capsule and a crushing metal rod, and it is air-tightly mounted inside a vertical micro-furnace pyrolyzer of a pyrolysis (Py)-GC/MS system. The developed sampler is firstly applied for THM-GC/MS measurements of polycarbonate (PC) whose structural characterization using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) as a reagent has been reported in detail previously, to confirm the applicability of the developed sampler. Two peaks are clearly observed in the pyrogram and they are assigned to methyl derivatives of a main chain unit (bisphenol A) and a terminal group (tert-butyl phenol) which are the THM reaction products of PC. The area ratio of these two peaks is almost the same as that obtained by the conventional THM-GC/MS, suggesting the effectiveness of the developed reaction sampler. Further, the developed sampler is applied for THM of nylon 6.6 which has been hardly analyzed by conventional THM-GC/MS using TMAH as a reagent in the open system where samples are exposed to the ambient gas in a pyrolyzer. Using the developed method, measured pyrogram clearly shows several peaks with fairly high yields that are assigned to methyl derivatives of monomer units of nylon 6.6, that is, adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine, and a hybrid dimer of each monomer. Therefore, it can be said that the developed sampler based on the closed system, sealed glass capsule, is quite useful for the pyrolysis analysis of intractable condensation polymers such as nylon 6.6, compared to the conventional THM-GC/MS using the open system.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,6-hexanediamine 3aadipic acid 3abisphenol A 3acrushing 3aglass 3ahydrolysis 3amethylation 3anylon 3aphenol 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3atetramethylammonium compounds 0aThermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation 0aGC/MS 0aMicro furnace pyrolyzer 0aPolyamide 0aTetramethylammonium hydroxide 0aSealed sample capsule1 aWatanabe, C.1 aTeramae, N.1 aOhtani, H.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Mar., v. 106 p.160-163dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245011700172300002000289520195200309592002802261650001402289650001002303650002302313650001702336650001302353650002602366650001402392650000902406650001902415650002102434650000902455650001802464650001202482650002202494650001902516650002702535650003702562653002602599653002702625653001002652653002802662653002302690700005802713773014202771856007802913852000902991655001203000IND60677423420200331000000.0191127e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067742342DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b176062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlander, Annika M.-B.10aTemperature-Induced Coloration and Interface Shell Cross-Linking for the Preparation of Polymer-Based Opal Films  ap. 44764-44773.  aThe formation of colloidal crystals and their use as photonic materials are of high interest for various technologies in the field of sensing applications, as templates, absorber materials, catalysts, and membranes. In this study, core–shell particles consisting of a cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) core featuring a (polyacrylonitrile-co-styrene) shell are synthesized by starved-feed emulsion polymerization. The resulting particles are investigated with respect to size and monodispersity, as well as the core-to-shell ratio, by means of dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Optimized particle sizes are 218 nm for the cores and 276 nm for the core–shell particles. For the formation of highly ordered and free-standing opal films, the particles are processed by the melt-shear organization technique. The resulting films show angle-dependent reflection colors, while reflected colors can be tailored by the design of the core–shell particles. As a focus of this work, polyacrylonitrile as part of the copolymer particle shell is advantageously used both for particle opal film stabilization and for tailoring the reflection colors of the opal films. It is shown that the cyclization reactions at the interface of the particles and within the matrix material significantly influence the optical properties of the opal films upon thermal treatment at 240 °C and for different heat holding times. For instance, the change of color can be simply set from red to blue upon defined thermal treatment conditions. Via this convenient protocol, brilliant reflection colors can thus be obtained based on the insights into the structure–property relationships of the underlying particle architectures and interface reactions. The scalable opal films will pave the way to functional colored materials as interesting candidates for a manifold of sensing applications and temperature-responsive polymeric materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acolor 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3acrystals 3acyclization reactions 3aemulsions 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3alight scattering 3aopal 3aparticle size 3aphotons 3apolyacrylonitrile 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3atransmission electron microscopy 0athermal cross-linking 0acore−shell particles 0aopals 0amelt-shear organization 0acolloidal crystals1 aGallei, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3740-51970 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 11, no. 47 p.44764-44773dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b176063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245024100195300001800436500002000454520190700474592002802381650002302409650001002432650002202442650002302464650001202487650001602499650001502515650002402530650001802554650002002572650002302592650001402615650001702629650000702646650001502653650001502668650001302683650001602696700005502712773015202767856007402919852000902993655001203002IND60756119420221119152405.0211111e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075611942DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.135372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, De Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9672-892210aEffects of adding high‐dosing Aspergillus oryzae phytase to corn–wheat–soybean meal‐based basal diet on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, faecal gas emission, carcass traits and meat quality in growing‐finishing pigs  ap. 1056-1062.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study tests the effects of supplementation of high‐dosing Aspergillus oryzae phytase into the corn–wheat–soybean meal (SBM)‐based basal diet on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, faecal gas emission, carcass traits and meat quality in growing‐finishing pigs (29.73–110.86 kg live weight; 70‐day‐old to 166‐day‐old). A total of 56 crossbred pigs [(Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc] were divided into two dietary groups for a 96‐day experiment (growing period, days 0–42; finishing period, days 43–96) with a completely randomized block design. There were seven replicate pens in each dietary group, and each pen has four pigs (two barrows and two gilts). The dietary treatments consisted of a corn–wheat–SBM‐based nutrient sufficient basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 1500 FTU/kg A. oryzae phytase. One phytase unit (FTU) was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyses the release of one micromole phosphate from phytate/min at 37°C and pH 5.5. Higher average daily gain and lower feed conversion ratio were observed in growing‐finishing pigs consuming a high‐dosing A. oryzae phytase supplementing diet during days 0–42 and 0–96. Supplementing high‐dosing A. oryzae phytase to the diet of growing‐finishing pigs increased apparent total tract digestibility of phosphorus on days 42 and 96. Moreover, growing‐finishing pigs fed the diet supplemented with high‐dosing A. oryzae phytase had higher carcass back‐fat thickness than those fed the control diet. However, the faecal gas emission and meat quality were not affected by high‐dosing A. oryzae phytase supplementation. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of high‐dosing A. oryzae phytase (1500 FTU/kg) had beneficial effects on the growth performance, apparent phosphorus digestibility and carcass back‐fat thickness in growing‐finishing pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aDuroc 3aanimal physiology 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3abody weight 3acrossbreds 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3alandraces 3ameat quality 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3aphytic acid1 aKim, In-ho,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3135-63120 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2021 Nov., v. 105, no. 6 p.1056-1062dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.135373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245014000180300001600320520155100336592002801887650002601915650002801941650003001969650002801999650001302027650001902040650001902059650001102078650002602089650002102115650003702136650000702173650001102180700002502191700003202216700003002248700002602278700002602304700002902330700002202359700002602381700003602407700002902443773009002472856008402562852000902646655001202655IND60083907620221122062314.0141101e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008390762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Thially Braga10aEffect of subinihibitory and inhibitory concentrations of Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour.) Spreng essential oil on Klebsiella pneumoniae  ap. 962-968.  aWe evaluated the antimicrobial activity and some mechanisms used by subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations of the essential oil, obtained from leaves of Plectranthus amboinicus, against a standard strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 5 multiresistant clinical isolates of the bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), the rate of kill and the pH sensitivity of the essential oil were determined by microdilution tests performed in 96-well plates. Subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations of the essential oil were tested in order to check its action on K. pneumoniae membrane permeability, capsule expression, urease activity and cell morphology. The MIC and MBC of the essential oil were 0.09±0.01%. A complete inhibition of the bacterial growth was observed after 2h of incubation with twice the MIC of the essential oil. A better MIC was found when neutral or alkaline pH broth was used. Alteration in membrane permeability was found by the increase of crystal violet uptake when the bacteria were incubated with twice the MIC levels of the essential oil. The urease activity could be prevented when all the subinhibitory concentrations were tested in comparison to the untreated group (p<0.001). Alteration of the bacterial morphology besides inhibition of the capsule expression was verified by atomic force microscopy, and Anthony's stain method, respectively. Our data allow us to conclude that the essential oil of P. amboinicus can be a good candidate for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPlectranthus amboinicus 3aanti-infective properties 3aatomic force microscopy 3abacteria 3aessential oils 3agentian violet 3aleaves 3amembrane permeability 3amicrobial growth 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apH 3aurease1 aBraga, Milena Aguiar1 ade Oliveira, Francisco F.M.1 aSantiago, Gilvandete M.P.1 aCarvalho, Cibele B.M.1 aCabral, Paula Brito e1 aSantiago, Thiago de Melo1 aSousa, Jeanlex S.1 aBarros, Eduardo Bedê1 aNascimento, Ronaldo Ferreira do1 aNagao-Dias, Aparecida T.0 tPhytomedicine.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 19, no. 11 p.962-968dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009800164300001600262520107100278592002801349650002101377650001401398650001801412653003001430653003301460653002101493653003201514653002801546700002401574773015301598856008201751852000901833655001201842IND60763163420221117014308.0220315e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076316342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2021.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBal, Alperen12aA simulation-based optimization approach for network design: The circular economy perspective  ap. 761-775.  aThe Circular Economy (CE) is identified as a solution to address negative impacts due to conventional ‘take-make-consume-dispose’ practices. We posit that a new business model termed Lease & Sell, which integrates the product-service-system (PSS) strategy with product sale for ownership, could enhance opportunities to promote circularity. This paper presents a simulation-based optimization approach for closed-loop network design to make location and allocation decisions when implementing a Lease & Sell strategy. The proposed approach is applied to the case of appliance manufacturer to compare performance when the company only sells product for ownership vs. when a Lease & Sell strategy is applied. Results show that while profitability increases with Lease & Sell when more End of Life (EoL) strategies are introduced (i.e., reuse, remanufacture, and recycling), the selling price for products in secondary markets has a higher impact on overall benefits. Findings also show that trade-offs exist between profitability, lead time, and social objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aownership 3aprofitability 0aDiscrete event simulation 0aMulti objective optimization 0aCircular economy 0aSupply chain network design 0aProduct service systems1 aBadurdeen, Fazleena0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2022 Mar., v. 30 p.761-775dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04324naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005300152245011900205300001600324520272200340592002803062650001903090650002003109650001603129650002703145650002403172650002403196650001303220650002903233650001503262650001703277650001203294650001903306651001403325653002503339653001503364653001703379653002903396653003503425653003303460700001103493700002303504700002503527700001703552700002403569700001903593773009803612856008703710852000903797655001203806IND60634625520221117233947.0190502e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063462552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2703-380910aImpact of urban block typology on building solar potential and energy use efficiency in tropical high-density city  ap. 513-533.  aThis paper presents the results of an investigation on the relationship between urban block typology, solar energy harvesting potential and building energy use efficiency in the context of the tropical high-density city Singapore. Thirty generic urban block cases in six typologies that represent a diverse range of urban forms were examined through simulation-based studies under the same planning conditions and simulation assumptions so as to rule out the impact of non-design related factors. Several key planning and geometric parameters which capture the formal characteristics of the urban blocks were examined as independent variables, and the dependent variables include the performance indicators on solar energy harvesting potential and building net energy use intensity that capture the dual benefits of photovoltaic (PV) systems in reducing building cooling loads and offsetting local plug loads with electricity generated on site. The results indicate that, under the same planning conditions and design premises, differences in urban block typology could lead to up to 200% increase in solar energy harvesting potential and electricity generated from rooftop PV, twelve times higher rate of reduction in building cooling loads, tow times higher rate of reduction in net purchased electricity, and 25% lower building net energy use intensity. The courtyard and hybrid urban block typologies consistently outperform the other typologies, especially the commonly implemented tower and slab blocks, and they benefit the most from PV deployment in the tropics. The comparison between an existing residential precinct and a hypothetical alternative hybrid urban block further demonstrated the significant impact of urban design on efficiency of PV electricity generation and building energy use efficiency. In addition to the significant economic benefit in reduction in utility cost and environmental implication in terms of equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions on urban scale, this study highlights the crucial role that urban design plays in terms of maximising on-site renewable energy production such as solar energy. The significant planning and geometric parameters in relation to the performance indicators provide insight as reference for establishing solar energy friendly urban planning and architectural design guidelines. The methodology and technical workflow as developed can support reliable and efficient feasibility studies, especially in the early stage of urban planning and architectural design. Integrated with other performance evaluations, they can facilitate decision-making on implementation of renewable energy integrated green building technologies and passive design strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3afeasibility studies 3afinancial economics 3ageometry 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aguidelines 3asolar energy 3atropics 3aurban planning 3aSingapore 0aUrban block typology 0aUrban form 0aSolar energy 0aPhotovoltaic (PV) system 0aBuilding energy use efficiency 0aRenewable energy application1 aXu, Le1 aShabunko, Veronika1 aTay, Stephen En Rong1 aSun, Huixuan1 aLau, Stephen S.

Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of DN remains unclear, and effective and safe therapies are in great demand. Rather than conventional medicines that concentrate on delaying renal failure by controlling blood sugar and/or ameliorating microalbuminuria, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) emphasize on the patients' whole inner system and devote to repair the kidney with consideration of overall health. Since many TCM herbs are edible, edible plants from TCM as diet therapy would be a promising alternative for DN management. To date, remarkable progresses have been made on the therapeutic effects of TCM edible plants for DN. In this review, the pathogenesis and experimental models of DN are firstly discussed. Thereafter, the structures of active components from TCM edible plants are summarized followed by discussion of recent research on TCM edible plants as functional food for diet therapy. Additionally, the necessity for safety evaluation of TCM edible plants for DN treatment is addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalbuminuria 3ablood glucose 3adiabetic nephropathy 3adiet therapy 3afood plants 3afunctional foods 3aherbs 3akidneys 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3arenal failure 0aDiabetic nephropathy 0aTraditional Chinese medicine 0aEdible plants 0aActive components 0aDiet therapy1 aChen, Xiao-Xin1 aTang, Sydney C.

At 700 million cooking with open biomass chulhas, the Indian population exposed has not changed in several decades, in spite of hundreds of programs to make the “available clean”, i.e. to burn biomass cleanly in advanced stoves. While such efforts continue, there is need to open up another front to attack this health hazard. Gas and electric cooking, which are clean at the household, are already the choice for one-third of Indians. Needed is a new agenda to make the “clean available”, i.e., to vigorously extend these clean fuels into populations that are caught in the Chulha Trap. This will require engaging new actors including the power and petroleum ministries as well as the ministry of health, which have not to date been directly engaged in addressing this problem. It will have implications for LPG imports, distribution networks, and electric and gas user technologies, as well as setting new priorities for electrification and biofuels, but at heart needs to be addressed as a health problem, not one of energy access, if it is to be solved effectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aburning 3acooking 3aenergy 3agirls 3ahealth hazards 3aheart 3aimports 3aliquid petroleum gas 3apetroleum 3apollution 3arisk 3awomen 3aIndia 0aHousehold energy ladder 0aCooking fuel 0aHousehold air pollution 0aEnergy access 0aLPG 0aBiomass stoves1 aSagar, Ambuj0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 Dec., v. 75 p.410-414dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245014600130300001600276520083200292592002801124650001701152650002501169650001301194650003001207650001401237650001501251650001201266650000901278650001501287650002101302653001201323653000801335653001001343653000901353653000801362653001201370700001501382773015001397852000901547655001201556IND60706520220221118012408.0210117e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070652022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, Bineeta10aNature and Magnitude of Combining Ability in Relation to Yield and Yield Component Traits in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)

Egypt is suffering from water quantity and quality, especially in desert areas. El Obour city and environs Northeast Cairo face waterlogging owing to the elevated-shallow groundwater table. In the present research work, the water quality of the shallow groundwater aquifer was studied. The remediation efficiency of polluted water using photocatalytic treatment technique in the presence of modified nano-titania and solar radiation has also been investigated. Twenty-eight representative samples have been collected from different locations, and their microbial, physical, and chemical characteristics were determined. The average contents of Pb (214.96 µg/L), As (1517 µg/L), Cd (8.79 µg/L), total bacterial count (2.22 × 10⁵ CFU/ml), and bacterial indicators (MPN-index/100 ml): total coliform (497.4), fecal coliform (358.3), and fecal streptococci (115.9) were higher than WHO permissible limits for drinking water, possibly due to higher industrialization, agricultural, and urbanization rates. The organic pollutants reached critical concentrations (chemical oxygen demand up to 960.8 mg O₂/L). Most of the studied samples contained acceptable concentrations of the major ions, (e.g., K⁺, Mg²⁺, HCO₃⁻), for drinking and irrigation purposes. The statistical analyses (e.g., principal component analysis and cluster analysis) pointed out the control of water–rock interaction and anthropogenic activities in water composition. The hydrochemical data show that most of the water samples (96.4%) are Na₂SO₄ and NaHCO₃ type, indicating its meteoric origin. The contamination with human and animal fecal substances, NO₃¯, and NH₄⁺ was identified in all samples, which pointed out the control of anthropogenic activities in water pollution. The photocatalytic technique efficiently eliminated more than 82–95% of organic contents and microbial pollutants, respectively, but it was inefficient in reducing heavy metal levels. According to the current results, shallow groundwater injection into the deep aquifer must be constrained and reusable after treatment. Finally, more studies are imperative to disseminate the applied treatment techniques to elude bacteria and organic pollutants from water at a pilot scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3achemical oxygen demand 3acluster analysis 3acoliform bacteria 3aface 3afecal bacteria 3afreshwater 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3ahydrochemistry 3aindustrialization 3airrigation 3aphotocatalysis 3aplate count 3aprincipal component analysis 3aremediation 3asolar radiation 3aurbanization 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater quantity 3awater table 3aEgypt1 aSeleem, El-Montser M.1 aEl Nazer, Hossam A.1 aZeid, Salah A.

Molasses wastewater as a sugar-rich waste is one of the most valuable raw material for bioenergy production due to its high organic strength and bioavailability. Interpretation for complex interactions of microbial community structures and operational parameters can help to establish stable biogas production. RNA-based approach for biogas production systems is recommended for analysis of functionally active community members which are significantly underestimated. In this study, methane production and active microbial community were characterized in an UASB reactor using molasses wastewater as feedstock. The UASB reactor achieved a stable process performance at an organic loading rate of 1.7~13.8-g chemical oxygen demand (COD,·L⁻¹ day⁻¹; 87–95 % COD removal efficiencies), and the maximum methane production rate was 4.01 L-CH₄·at 13.8 g-COD L⁻¹ day⁻¹. Lactococcus and Methanosaeta were comprised up to 84 and 80 % of the active bacterial and archaeal communities, respectively. Network analysis of reactor performance and microbial community revealed that Lactococcus and Methanosaeta were network hub nodes and positively correlated each other. In addition, they were positively correlated with methane production and organic loading rate, and they shared the other microbial hub nodes as neighbors. The results indicate that the close association between Lactococcus and Methanosaeta is responsible for the stable production of methane in the UASB reactor using molasses wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3amethane production 3abiogas 3acommunity structure 3abioavailability 3amicrobial communities 3amolasses 3aproduction technology 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 3aMethanosaeta 3aLactococcus 3asludge 3achemical oxygen demand 3afeedstocks 3abiomass 3awastewater 3aorganic production 0araw materials1 aYun, Jeonghee1 aCho, Kyung-Suk0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 99, no. 19 p.8271-8283dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6725-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013900164300001200303520112700315592002801442596005301470596006401523596006401587650001401651650004101665650001701706650001001723650001801733650001401751650003001765650001401795651001101809700006701820700005901887700006101946700006602007700007002073700002102143700006102164773014202225856008102367852000902448655001202457IND60674630220221123031706.0200201e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067463022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-019-4277-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagemann, L.10aFour Decades of Organic Anthropogenic Pollution: a Compilation for Djerdap Lake Sediments, Serbia [Erratum: Feb. 2020, v.231(2), p.67]  ap. 246.  aAnalysis of limnic sediments can serve as a tool to assess sedimentary pollution for both the status quo as well as changes over time. However, in environmental studies, often only a small number of established well-studied contaminants are considered. This study focused on a more comprehensive investigation of sedimentary pollution of Djerdap Reservoir. Therefore, complementary analytical approaches were applied covering lipophilic organic contaminants and heavy metals. Investigations were performed on limnic sediment layers representing a period of 43 years of reservoir functioning. The core was sectioned on 11 samples and analyzed for, loss on ignition (LOI), and organic compounds (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). Here, we report the quantitative data of 43 lipophilic organic compounds indicating both domestic and industrial emissions. Measured concentrations are generally low. Surprisingly, no polychlorinated biphenyls have been detected. Data concerning grain size, sedimentological, and inorganic composition were measured and published by in Kasanin-Grubin et al.

Because western corn rootworm larvae cannot survive on soybean roots, adult western corn rootworm population dynamics in these fields is governed by aerial movement. Malaise trap samples from soybean fields were used to describe temporal variation in western corn rootworm immigration and emigration during 1997, 1998, and 1999. Sixty-eight percent of western corn rootworm collected in the soybean fields were female. A diel periodicity in western corn rootworm immigration and emigration was observed on days conducive to beetle flight in soybean fields. Flight activity was low during the early morning (500-700 hours solar time) when air temperatures were cool. Aerial movement peaked between 7000 and 1100 hours. During the first half of this interval (700-900 hours), immigration of western corn rootworm to the soybean field exceeded emigration, thereafter emigration exceeded immigration. Before sunset (1700-1900 hours), flight activity increased. Western corn rootworm were not caught in the malaise traps between sunset and sunrise. Micrometeorological measurements from days when western corn rootworm captures were large indicate that western corn rootworm movement may be gated to late morning, when wind speed and air temperature gradients above the soybean crop frequently create unstable atmospheric conditions that facilitate fight. Because of the diel periodicity and high day-to-day variability of western corn rootworm movement to soybean fields, scouting tools, such as sticky traps and vial traps that integrate captures over an entire day or multiple days, are likely to provide more reliable western corn rootworm population estimates in soybean fields than sampling techniques that measure western corn rootworm abundance at single points in time (e.g., plant counts and sweep net samples). 3aperiodicity 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3aGlycine max 3asolar radiation 3afields 3aair temperature 3aseasonal variation 3aflight 3adiurnal variation 3awind speed 3apopulation density 3aIllinois 0aseasonal abundance 0amovement 0aactivity 0aemigration 0ameteorological parameters 0ainterfield movement 0aatmospheric stability 0aimmigration1 aSpencer, J.L.1 aNasser, M.A.1 aLevine, E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2000 Apr., v. 29, no. 2 p.226-234dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2000)029%5B0226:AMOWCR%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02409naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011700156300002000273520119600293592002801489650002201517650001301539650002201552650002001574650001101594650002301605650001301628650002201641650003201663700001701695700001601712700001601728700002501744700001601769700001901785773012401804856007401928852000902002655001202011IND60642097620221119042536.0190506e20171109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064209762DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07463h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatron, N.10aIdentification of the functional states of human vitamin K epoxide reductase from molecular dynamics simulations  ap. 52071-52090.  aIn mammalians, the enzymatic activity of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) requires a protein conformational reorganisation that includes several transient enzymatic states involving a dynamic electron transfer. Regarding the structurally non-characterised human enzyme (hVKORC1), this process remains poorly explained and the different redox states of the enzyme generated by its biochemical transformation are unknown. Here, we report a 3D model of the fully reduced hVKORC1 at the atomistic level. By exploring this model through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we established the most probable intermediate states of the enzyme which were used for generation of the putative functionally-related enzymatic states. Enzymatic functionality of each state was assigned by probing their recognition properties with respect to vitamin K in its quinone and hydroxyquinone forms.

A new coding implementation according to the class environment created in object oriented C++ programming language is carried out in structuring and building the solver. The model is based on the Godunov type finite volume scheme on unstructured triangular meshes. A mass balance preserving wet/dry boundary solution algorithm is integrated in the numerical scheme to satisfy the positive-depth condition and minimize the numerical instability when treating the propagation of wave front in regions of dry bed. The balance between bed slope and flux terms is also preserved for still water conditions on irregular topography. The 2-D solver is verified by simulating selected dam break cases, where good agreement with measured data is achieved. For the simulation of flood flows in the Ulus basin, in general, the simulated outflow hydrograph is found to compare well with the recorded data. A selected inundation map that is extracted from the model results is also presented to show the water surface level in the Floodplain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abasins 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3afloodplains 3ahydrograph 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3aprediction 3atopography 3awatersheds 3aBlack Sea 3aTurkey (country) 0aFlood inundation 0aDam break 0aFinite volume 0aWet/dry 0aHydrograph 0aObject oriented programming1 aWang, Keh-Han0 tJournal of hydrology and hydromechanics.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 62, no. 3 p.209-217dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21369x1338-43337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johh-2014-00293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245012400212506010400336506007600440520072800516592002801244506003701272650002101309650001901330650001201349650002301361651001001384653002101394653003001415653003001445653003101475653002801506653001501534653001801549700002601567700002901593773009401622856008201716852000901798655001201807IND60788943320221207045700.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078894332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1085372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcuña-Duran, Eduardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2470-169110aSurvey data of Entrepreneurial intention and perceived social support from academics-scientists at Chilean Universities  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe data comes from a survey applied to 1027 scientists working in Chile.

Although BMPs are voluntary in most states in the southeastern United States (U.S.), forest landowners operating under the auspices of a forest certification system are required to use BMPs, and forest-certified wood procurement organizations also require loggers who supply them with fiber to use BMPs. Current implementation rates are, on average, 93.6% throughout the southeastern U.S. We conducted a literature review to better understand potential effectiveness of BMPs to conserve aquatic resources and species in the southeastern U.S. Our review focuses on how BMPs reduce NPS pollutants, particularly sediment, fertilizers, and herbicides; how BMPs are monitored throughout the southeastern U.S.; and current implementation rates. Additionally, we discuss how state BMP monitoring programs, coupled with participation in forest certification programs that require routine third-party audits, provide assurance to federal and state agencies that BMPs protect aquatic resources and species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has recognized that working forests where management activities implement BMPs represent a clear, actionable, and scientifically sound approach for conserving at-risk aquatic species. However, there is a data gap in directly linking BMPs to the conservation of aquatic resources. Given the high diversity of aquatic species in the southeastern U.S., it is important to better understand this potential linkage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 3aaquatic organisms 3aforest certification 3aforests 3apollution 3asediments 3asurface water 3awood 3aSoutheastern United States1 aLarsen-Gray, Angela L.1 aMiller, Darren A.0 tWater.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 13, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131926113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245006300181300001800244520161200262592002801874650002601902650001701928650001801945650002301963650003001986650001002016650002102026650001402047650001802061650003602079650001202115650001202127650002202139650001402161700002202175700002002197700002102217700002202238700002002260700002002280700001802300700002402318773011702342856005502459852000902514655001202523IND4510124520221119155459.0150730e200010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451012452DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01702.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Charles H., Jr10aThioredoxin reductase: Two modes of catalysis have evolved  ap. 6110-6117.  aThioredoxin reductase (EC 1.6.4.5) is a widely distributed flavoprotein that catalyzes the NADPH‐dependent reduction of thioredoxin. Thioredoxin plays several key roles in maintaining the redox environment of the cell. Like all members of the enzyme family that includes lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase and mercuric reductase, thioredoxin reductase contains a redox active disulfide adjacent to the flavin ring. Evolution has produced two forms of thioredoxin reductase, a protein in prokaryotes, archaea and lower eukaryotes having a Mr of 35 000, and a protein in higher eukaryotes having a Mr of 55 000. Reducing equivalents are transferred from the apolar flavin binding site to the protein substrate by distinct mechanisms in the two forms of thioredoxin reductase. In the low Mr enzyme, interconversion between two conformations occurs twice in each catalytic cycle. After reduction of the disulfide by the flavin, the pyridine nucleotide domain must rotate with respect to the flavin domain in order to expose the nascent dithiol for reaction with thioredoxin; this motion repositions the pyridine ring adjacent to the flavin ring. In the high Mr enzyme, a third redox active group shuttles the reducing equivalent from the apolar active site to the protein surface. This group is a second redox active disulfide in thioredoxin reductase from Plasmodium falciparum and a selenenylsulfide in the mammalian enzyme. P. falciparum is the major causative agent of malaria and it is hoped that the chemical difference between the two high Mr forms may be exploited for drug design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aactive sites 3abinding sites 3acatalytic activity 3acellular microenvironment 3adrugs 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3aflavoproteins 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3amalaria 3amammals 3aprokaryotic cells 3apyridines1 aArscott, L.

Under the context of increasingly severe water shortages, studying the relationship among crop water requirements (ETc), actual crop evapotranspiration (ETₐ), irrigation water requirements (Iᵣ), yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) would be beneficial to improve the agricultural application of irrigation water. Based on the daily data of 26 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province from 1960 to 2015, this study used the calibrated AquaCrop model to calculate the ETc, ETₐ, Iᵣ, and yield of maize (Zea mays L.) in different hydrological years (extremely dry years, dry years, normal years, and wet years) along with WUE to evaluate the mass of yield produced per unit mass of crop evapotranspiration (ET) under rainfed and irrigated scenarios. The results showed that ETc and ETₐ decreased first and then increased from the west to the east during the four types of hydrological years. Iᵣ exhibited a decreasing trend from the west to the east. Compared with the irrigation scenario, the rainfed scenario’s average yield only decreased by 2.18, 0.55, 0.03, and 0.05 ton/ha, while the WUE increased by 0.32, 0.4, 0.33, and 0.21 kg/m³ in the extremely dry years, dry years, normal years, and wet years, respectively. The results indicated that in the normal and wet years, the WUE was high in the central regions, and irrigation did not significantly increase yield; further, we determined that irrigation should not be considered in these two hydrological years in Heilongjiang Province. In the extremely dry and dry years, irrigation was necessary because it increased the yield, even though the WUE decreased. This study provides a theoretical basis for studying the regional irrigation schedule in Heilongjiang Province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aevapotranspiration 3afreshwater 3airrigated farming 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3amodels 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aJiao, Yang 1 aTang, Yi 1 aLi, Na 1 aWang, Tianyi 1 aDu, Chong 1 aZhang, Zhongxue 1 aLi, Tiecheng 1 aZhu, Shijiang 1 aSun, Zhongyi 1 aLi, Fengrui 0 tWater.g2021 Sept. 27, v. 13, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131926653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245010300197300001800300500002000318520190000338592002802238596004602266596003202312596004702344596004102391596003002432596004702462596005902509650002402568650002602592650001302618650002202631650002702653650002402680650001502704650001202719650001302731650001402744650001702758650002202775650001702797650001402814650001202828651001402840700002302854700002002877700002002897773012502917856007303042852000903115655001203124IND60663195320221119220718.0190909e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066319532DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.129632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYando, Erik S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8786-617810aJump‐starting coastal wetland restoration: a comparison of marsh and mangrove foundation species  ap. 1145-1154.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDuring coastal wetland restoration, foundation plant species are critical in creating habitat, modulating ecosystem functions, and supporting ecological communities. Following initial hydrologic restoration, foundation plant species can help stabilize sediments and jump‐start ecosystem development. Different foundation species, however, have different traits and environmental tolerances. To understand how these traits and tolerances impact restoration trajectories, there is a need for comparative studies among foundation species. In subtropical and tropical climates, coastal wetland restoration practitioners can sometimes choose between salt marsh and/or mangrove foundation species. Here, we compared the early life history traits and environmental tolerances of two foundation species: (1) a salt marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora) and (2) a mangrove tree (Avicennia germinans). In an 18‐month study of a recently restored coastal wetland in southeastern Louisiana (USA), we examined growth and survival along an elevation gradient and compared expansion and recruitment rates. We found that the rapid growth, expansion, and recruitment rates of the salt marsh grass make it a better species for quickly establishing ecological structure at suitable elevations. The slower growth, limited expansion, and lower recruitment of the mangrove species show its restricted capacity for immediate structural restoration, especially in areas where it co‐occurs with perennial salt marsh species. Our findings suggest that the structural attributes needed in recently restored areas can be achieved sooner using fast‐growing foundation species. Following salt marsh grass establishment, mangroves can then be used to further assist ecosystem development. This work highlights how appropriate foundation species can help jump‐start ecosystem development to meet restoration objectives.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Golden Meadow Plant Materials Center  cUL Lafayette Ecology Center  cUSGS‐Wetland and Aquatic Research Center  cUniversity of Louisiana at Lafayette  cCoastal Plant Ecology Lab  cUL Lafayette Graduate Student Organization  cSociety for Wetland Scientists' Student Research Grant 3aAvicennia germinans 3aSpartina alterniflora 3aaltitude 3acomparative study 3aecological communities 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3ahydrology 3alife history 3amangroves (trees) 3asalt marshes 3asediments 3atropics 3aLouisiana1 aOsland, Michael J.1 aJones, Scott F.1 aHester, Mark W.0 tRestoration ecology.g2019 Sept., v. 27, no. 5 p.1145-1154dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.129633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245008100170300001600251520091800267592002801185650002601213650001101239650001501250650002401265653003301289653002701322653002601349700002501375773010301400856007801503852000901581655001201590IND60481785220221120212722.0160210e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048178522DNAL7 a10.2478/johh-2014-00312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArtichowicz, Wojciech10aComputational issues of solving the 1D steady gradually varied flow equation  ap. 226-233.  aIn this paper a problem of multiple solutions of steady gradually varied flow equation in the form of the ordinary differential energy equation is discussed from the viewpoint of its numerical solution. Using the Lipschitz theorem dealing with the uniqueness of solution of an initial value problem for the ordinary differential equation it was shown that the steady gradually varied flow equation can have more than one solution. This fact implies that the nonlinear algebraic equation approximating the ordinary differential energy equation, which additionally coincides with the wellknown standard step method usually applied for computing of the flow profile, can have variable number of roots. Consequently, more than one alternative solution corresponding to the same initial condition can be provided. Using this property it is possible to compute the water flow profile passing through the critical stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential equation 3aenergy 3awater flow 3awatershed hydrology 0aSteady gradually varied flow 0aDifferential equations 0aInitial value problem1 aSzymkiewicz, Romuald0 tVodohospodársky časopis.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 62, no. 3 p.226-233dDe Gruyter Openx0042-790X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johh-2014-00313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01375naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245009400171300001600265520033900281592002800620650001600648650001700664650001900681650001700700653001900717653002000736653001900756653001600775653001700791773015300808856007900961852000901040655001201049IND60522795420221118163156.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052279542DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1988-9-10152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrody, Seymour Steven10aRebinding of the 33 kDalton Polypeptide of Photosystem II to the D-1/D-2 Sub-Core Complex  ap. 727-730.  aSpecific and stoichiometric binding is shown between the D-1/D-2 sub-core complex and the 33 kDa polypeptide of photosystem II.

The guanosine 5′ triphosphate hydrolase (GTPase) activity of elongation factor G (EF‐G) requires the presence of L7/L12, which is critical for ribosomal translocation. Here, we have developed new methods for the complete depletion of L7/L12 from Escherichia coli 70S ribosomes to analyze the effect of L7/L12 on the activities of the GTPase factors EF‐G, RF3, IF2, and LepA. Upon removal of L7/L12 from ribosomes, the GTPase activities of EF‐G, RF3, and IF2 decreased to basal levels, while the activity of LepA decreased marginally. Upon reconstitution of ribosomes with recombinant L12, the GTPase activities of all GTPases returned to full activity. Moreover, ribosome binding assays indicated that EF‐G, RF3, and IF2 require L7/L12 for stable binding in the GTP state, and LepA retained > 50% binding. Lastly, an EF‐G∆G′ truncation mutant possessed ribosome‐dependent GTPase activity, which was insensitive to L7/L12. Our results indicate that L7/L12 is required for stable binding of ribosome‐dependent GTPases that harbor direct interactions to the L7/L12 C‐terminal domains, either through a G′ domain (EF‐G, RF3) or a unique N‐terminal domain (IF2). Furthermore, we hypothesize this interaction is concomitant with counterclockwise ribosomal intersubunit rotation, which is required for translocation, initiation, and post‐termination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aenzyme activity 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3amethodology 3amutants 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes1 aHaddad, Bassam G.1 aWeis, Amanda J.1 aBlackwood, Colby S.1 aShelton, Catherine D.1 aWuerth, Michelle E.1 aWalter, Justin D.1 aSpiegel, Paul Clint, JrcJr0 tFEBS journal.g2017 June, v. 284, no. 11 p.1631-1643dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.140673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245016200178300001600340520136200356592002801718650002201746650002701768650002101795650001701816650002501833650001401858650001901872650001701891650001901908650001201927650001601939650001901955650001101974650001101985650002401996650001402020650001902034650001402053650001102067700001802078700002302096700002302119700001702142700002402159773010402183856008402287852000902371655001202380IND60121780620221117200816.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012178062DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2013.8787362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTayarani-Najaran, Zahra10aComparative Studies of Cytotoxic and Apoptotic Properties of Different Extracts and the Essential Oil of Lavandula angustifolia on Malignant and Normal Cells  ap. 424-434.  aLavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.) is a bush-like shrub from Lamiaceae. The herb has been used in alternative medicine for several centuries. In this study, the cytotoxicity and the mechanisms of cell death induced by 3 different extracts of aerial parts and the essential oil of L. angustifolia were compared in normal and cancerous human cells. Malignant (HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines) and nonmalignant (human fibroblasts) cells were incubated with different concentrations of the plant extracts. Cell viability was quantified by MTS assay. Apoptotic cells were determined using propidium iodide staining of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak). The molecules as apoptotic signal translation, including Bax and cleaved PARP, were identified by Western blot. Ethanol and n- hexane extracts and essential oil exhibited significant cytotoxicity to malignant cells but marginal cytotoxicity to human fibroblasts in vitro and induced a sub-G1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated cells compared to the control. Western blot analysis demonstrated that EtOH and n- hexane extracts upregulated Bax expression, also it induced cleavage of PARP in HeLa cells compared to the control. In conclusion, L. angustifolia has cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines, and apoptosis is proposed as the possible mechanism of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aLavandula angustifolia 3aWestern blotting 3aaerial parts 3aalternative medicine 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aessential oils 3aethanol 3afibroblasts 3aflow cytometry 3ahexane 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3anutrition 3aplant extracts 3apropidium 3ashrubs1 aAmiri, Atefeh1 aKarimi, Gholamreza1 aEmami, Seyed Ahmad1 aAsili, Javad1 aMousavi, Seyed Hadi0 tNutrition and cancer.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 66, no. 3 p.424-434dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2013.8787363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002700191245006000218300001800278506007600296520123600372592002801608506003701636650001201673650001801685650001201703650002101715650001101736650002801747650000901775650001201784650001901796650001001815650001401825650001201839650001501851650001101866650001401877650001401891650001101905650000701916650001301923650000901936650001201945650001301957650000901970700001801979700001801997700002802015700005202043700005502095773012802150856008402278852000902362655001202371IND60598655920221207104455.0180702e20180412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059865592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b008482doi7 aPMC67609092pmcid7 a296488042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoozbahani, Golbarg M.10aComputation-Assisted Nanopore Detection of Thorium Ions  ap. 5938-5944.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThorium is a well-known radioactive and chemically toxic contaminant in the environment. The continuous exposure to thorium may cause an increased risk of developing lung and liver diseases as well as lung, pancreas, and bone cancer. Due to its use in nuclear industry and other industrial applications, thorium may be accidentally released to the environment from its mining and processing plants. In this work, we developed a rapid, real-time, and label-free nanopore sensor for Th⁴⁺ detection by using an aspartic acid containing peptide as a chelating agent and tuning the electrolyte solution pH to control the net charges of the peptide ligand and its metal ion complex. The method is highly sensitive with a detection limit of 0.45 nM. Furthermore, the sensor is selective: other metal ions (e.g., UO₂²⁺, Pb²⁺, Cu²⁺, Ni²⁺, Hg²⁺, Zn²⁺, As³⁺, Mg²⁺, and Ca²⁺) with concentrations of up to 3 orders of magnitude greater than that of Th⁴⁺ would not interfere with Th⁴⁺detection. In addition, simulated water samples were successfully analyzed. Our developed computation-assisted sensing strategy should find useful applications in the development of nanopore sensors for other metal ions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarsenic 3aaspartic acid 3acalcium 3achelating agents 3acopper 3aindustrial applications 3alead 3aligands 3aliver diseases 3alungs 3amagnesium 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amining 3ananopores 3aneoplasms 3anickel 3apH 3apancreas 3arisk 3athorium 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aChen, Xiaohan1 aZhang, Youwen1 aJuárez Matute, Óscar,1 aLi, Dien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8375-05811 aGuan, Xiyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2022-48720 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 12, v. 90, no. 9 p.5938-5944dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b008483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012400166300001800290500001400308520122800322592002801550650002501578650001301603650001201616650001001628650004501638650002201683650001501705650003701720650001901757650001801776650001401794650001701808651001001825651001301835700001601848700001801864700001901882700001601901700001701917700001801934700005801952773013402010856008202144852000902226655001202235IND60714660120221120194722.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071466012DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-020-00874-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Su-jung,10aIdentification of valid reference genes for quantitative RT-PCR in Caragana microphylla under salt and drought stresses  ap. 2103-2108.  aNAL-light  aCaragana microphylla is a leguminosae plant and grows mainly in semi-arid areas of northwest China and Mongolia. However, the lack of studies on C. microphylla reference genes limits the accurate understanding of the molecular biology mechanisms in this crop under abiotic stresses. In this study, we selected nine candidate genes from salt-treated C. microphylla transcriptome data and evaluated their stability by using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder in salt and drought conditions. In addition, the relative expressions of Delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase 2 (P5CS2) and Catalase 2 (CAT2) were examined to confirm the stability of the candidate reference genes. As a results, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase C2 (GAPC2) and 26S proteasome regulatory subunit (RPN5) were the most stable in both salt and drought treatments. The relative expression of P5CS2 and CAT2 also showed more stable levels in normalization by GAPC2 and RPN5 than the most unstable gene, Ubiquitin 4 (UBQ4). Therefore, it is believed that these candidate reference genes selected and validated in our study could be used to study the molecular biological study of response to salt and drought stress in C. microphylla.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaragana microphylla 3acatalase 3adrought 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amolecular biology 3aphysiology 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3asemiarid zones 3atranscriptome 3aubiquitin 3awater stress 3aChina 3aMongolia1 aNa, Jung Up1 aKim, Ji Seong1 aLee, Jeong Eun1 aNie, Haulin1 aLee, Keum Ah1 aWoo, Su Young1 aKim, Sun Hyung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8934-38910 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2020 Oct., v. 26, no. 10 p.2103-2108dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-020-00874-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01504naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007600140245009600216300001800312520038100330592002800711650001900739650002000758650001400778650001100792650002000803650000900823650001900832650002800851700002800879700001800907700002100925773012500946856007401071852000901145655001201154IND60639935820221120191119.0190503e20170522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063993582DNAL7 a10.1039/c6gc03527b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosas-HernándezThese authors contributed equally to this work., Alonso10aEarth-abundant photocatalytic systems for the visible-light-driven reduction of CO₂ to CO  ap. 2356-2360.  aHerein, we report a highly selective photocatalytic system, based on an in situ copper photosensitizer and an iron catalyst, for the reduction of CO₂ to CO.

However, limited research has concurrently evaluated blood pressure and small arterial elasticity (SAE), an index of endothelial function, among African American (AA) and European American (EA) women the morning after (i.e., ≈22 h later) acute bouts of moderate-intensity continuous (MIC) and high-intensity interval (HII) exercise matched for total work. Because of greater gradients of shear stress, it was hypothesized that HII exercise would elicit a greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to MIC exercise. After baseline, 22 AA and EA women initiated aerobic exercise training 3 times/week. Beginning at week 8, three follow-up assessments were conducted over the next 8 weeks at random to measure resting blood pressure and SAE. In total all participants completed 16 weeks of training. Follow-up evaluations were made: (i) in the trained state (TS; 8–16 weeks of aerobic training); (ii) ≈22 h after an acute bout of MIC exercise; and (iii) ≈22 h after an acute bout of HII exercise. Among AAs, the acute bout of HII exercise incited a significant increase in SBP (mm Hg) (TS, 121 ± 14 versus HII, 128 ± 14; p = 0.01) whereas responses (TS, 116 ± 12 versus HII, 113 ± 9; p = 0.34) did not differ in EAs. After adjusting for race, changes in SAE were associated (partial r = −0.533; p = 0.01) with changes in SBP following HII exercise. These data demonstrate an acute, unaccustomed bout of HII exercise produces physiological perturbations resulting in a significant increase in SBP that are independently associated with decreased SAE among AA women, but not EA women.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aexercise 3ametabolism 3anutrition 3ashear stress 3asystolic blood pressure 3awomen 0aaerobic training 0aarterial stiffness 0aendothelial function 0ahealth disparity 0ahypertension 0arace1 aGoldsby, TaShauna U.1 aFisher, Gordon1 aPlaisance, Eric P.1 aGower, Barbara A.1 aGlasser, Stephen P.1 aHunter, Gary R.0 tApplied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.g2016 Jan. 7, v. 41, no. 5 p.484-490dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2015-05123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013000168300001400298520129300312592002801605650001601633650001701649650001601666650001301682650001201695650001301707650001301720650001201733650001201745650001801757650002501775650001601800650000801816650001301824653001601837653001601853653001501869653001701884700002501901700001901926773010101945856008102046852000902127655001202136IND60604069720221117063110.0180716e20150310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060406972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2014.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, Christian10aExperimental determination of the nucleation rates of undercooled micron-sized liquid droplets based on fast chip calorimetry  ap. 39-45.  aAccurate thermal analyzes and calorimetry measurements depend on careful calibration measurements. For conventional differential scanning calorimeters (DSC) the calibration procedure is well known. The melting point of different pure metals is measured and compared with literature data to adjust the temperature reading of the calorimeter. Likewise, the measured melting enthalpies of standard reference substances serve for enthalpy calibration. Yet for fast chip calorimetry, new procedures need to be established. For the medium-area and large-area calorimeter chips, this procedure needs to be modified, because the calibration behavior depends on the position of the sample on the measurement area. Additionally, a way to calibrate the calorimeter for measurements performed during cooling will also be shown. For this second aspect, the athermal and diffusionless martensitic phase transformation of Ni49.9–Ti50.1 at% was used. The well-calibrated sensor chips are ideally suited to perform nucleation rate density analyzes based on a statistical approach. Here, the nucleation rate densities of micron-sized pure Sn droplets that had been coated with a non-catalytic coating have been determined by experimental analysis of the statistical variance of the undercooling response.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3acalorimeters 3acalorimetry 3acoatings 3acooling 3adroplets 3aenthalpy 3aliquids 3amelting 3amelting point 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3atin 3avariance 0aCalorimetry 0aCalibration 0aNucleation 0aUndercooling1 aPeterlechner, Martin1 aWilde, Gerhard0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Mar. 10, v. 603 p.39-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2014.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016800156300001800324520058600342592002800928650001400956650001400970650002100984650001101005650002001016650001801036650001801054650001201072650001801084650001301102650001401115650001301129700001801142700001801160700001401178700001701192700002301209700001801232700002301250700001501273773012401288856007401412852000901486655001201495IND60639935920221120175622.0190503e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063993592DNAL7 a10.1039/c6gc03528k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoherty, S.10aHighly efficient aqueous phase chemoselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes catalysed by phosphine-decorated polymer immobilized IL-stabilized PdNPs  ap. 1635-1641.  aPhosphino-decorated polymer immobilised ionic liquid phase stabilised palladium nanoparticles (PdNP@PPh₂-PIILP) and their PEGylated counterparts (PdNP@PPh₂-PEGPIILP) are remarkably active and exceptionally selective catalysts for the aqueous phase hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters and nitriles with PdNP@PPh₂-PEGPIILP giving complete conversion and 100% selectivity for reduction of the CC bond, under mild conditions.

In the estuary Mugil cephalus are the most dominant species, whereas Liza subviridis, Liza macrolepis and Liza haematocheilus are common, and Liza affinis, Liza dussumieri and Valamugil seheli are rare. They have adapted a size-related salinity preference. A mean Sr/Ca ratio of (7.5–10.2) × 10⁻³ in the otolith cores demonstrated that all seven mullet species spawned in the sea. After recruiting to the estuary (mean ratios of (3.6–6.4) × 10⁻³ at the estuarine check in the otoliths), the ratios fluctuate between (0.1–3.5) × 10⁻³ and (9.5–19.5) × 10⁻³ indicating that the mullet shared a common movement between marine and brackish waters and probably even freshwater habitats. However, the profiles fluctuated substantially among individuals. There was high intra-specific variation among M. cephalus and L. subviridis, intermediate intra-specific variation among L. macrolepis and L. affinis, and relatively little among L. haematocheilus, L. dussumieri and V. seheli. Persistent residency in high or low saline environments was found to vary among species, and the extent of their catadromy is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiza 3aMugil cephalus 3aValamugil 3aadults 3acalcium 3acatadromous fish 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3amullet 3aotoliths 3asalinity 3aspatial distribution 3astrontium 3aTaiwan1 aIizuka, Yoshiyuki0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 June 20, v. 106 p.121-126dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.04.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009700168300001600265520070500281592002800986650001701014650002201031650002201053650001101075650002101086650001101107650001501118653004301133653003001176653002501206653001101231700002001242700002401262700002101286700002001307773012001327856008401447852000901531655001201540IND60123550220221118133250.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012355022DNAL7 a10.1080/19320248.2014.8981712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanko, Ashley10aEvaluating Community Gardens in a Health Disparate Region: A Qualitative Case Study Approach  ap. 137-169.  aThough community gardens (CGs) have emerged as a potential strategy to improve access to and consumption of fruit and vegetables, few published studies inform program planning, implementation, or maintenance of CG initiatives.

Herein, we successfully prepared Bi₄O₅I₂ powders via a facile solvothermal method. The Bi₄O₅I₂ photocatalyst exhibited significantly higher photocatalytic activity as compared to the common BiOI photocatalyst in the degradation of methyl orange, methylene blue and rhodamine B under visible light irradiation. Especially, for the degradation of methyl orange, the photocatalytic activity of Bi₄O₅I₂ is about 10 times that of BiOI. Moreover, Bi₄O₅I₂ exhibits an extremely high second harmonic generation response of about 20 × KDP (the benchmark) estimated by the unbiased ab initio calculations. The coexisting multifunction of Bi₄O₅I₂ is mainly because of the increased dipole moment due to the stereochemical activity of lone pairs that promotes separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, then enhances the photocatalytic activity and results in a high second harmonic generation response. This indicates that Bi₄O₅I₂ may have good potential applications in photocatalytic and nonlinear optical fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3airradiation 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apowders 3arhodamines 3astereochemistry1 aLi, Yang1 aZhong, Kangdi1 aYao, Hang1 aZhang, Yamin1 aLai, Kangrong0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 9, no. 8 p.4539-4544dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra08984a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013100175300001600306520111900322592002801441650002201469650002001491650001201511650003001523650001401553650001401567650001601581650002001597650001701617650001501634650001801649650001801667650001101685650001301696650000901709650002901718650001401747650001701761650001201778700003001790700001701820700003401837700001901871700002201890700002201912773010401934856008402038852000902122655001202131IND60121781020221117200653.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012178102DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2014.8842282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatouillat, Grégory10aCytotoxicity and Apoptosis Induced by Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) Leaf Extracts in Sensitive and Multidrug-Resistant Tumor Cells  ap. 483-491.  aAlfalfa (Medicago sativa) has been used to cure a wide variety of ailments. However, only a few studies have reported its anticancer effects. In this study, extracts were obtained from alfalfa leaves and their cytotoxic effects were assessed on several sensitive and multidrug-resistant tumor cells lines. Using the mouse leukaemia P388 cell line and its doxorubicin-resistant counterpart (P388/DOX), we showed that the inhibition of cell growth induced by alfalfa leaf extracts was mediated through the induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation analysis. The execution of programmed cell death was achieved via the activation of caspase-3, leading to PARP cleavage. Fractionation of toluene extract (To-1), the most active extract obtained from crude extract, led to the identification of 3 terpene derivatives and 5 flavonoids. Among them, (-)-medicarpin, (-)-melilotocarpan E, millepurpan, tricin, and chrysoeriol showed cytotoxic effects in P388 as well as P388/DOX cells. These results demonstrate that alfalfa leaf extract may have interesting potential in cancer chemoprevention and therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell growth 3achemoprevention 3acytotoxicity 3aflavonoids 3afractionation 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3aleukemia 3amice 3amultiple drug resistance 3anutrition 3atherapeutics 3atoluene1 aAlabdul Magid, Abdulmagid1 aBertin, Eric1 aOkiemy-Akeli, Marie-Genevieve1 aMorjani, Hamid1 aLavaud, Catherine1 aMadoulet, Claudie0 tNutrition and cancer.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 66, no. 3 p.483-491dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2014.8842283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013500166300001400301520195600315592002802271650001702299650001202316650001902328650002302347650001502370650001602385650001802401650001802419650001302437650001802450650001402468650001702482650002102499650002102520650001702541650001402558650001402572650001002586650001902596650001202615650001802627700001702645773010302662856008202765990002302847852000902870655001202879IND60097680020221119222110.0141104e20120620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009768002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpencer, K.L.10aUnderstanding system disturbance and ecosystem services in restored saltmarshes: Integrating physical and biogeochemical processes  ap. 23-32.  aCoastal saltmarsh ecosystems occupy only a small percentage of Earth's land surface, yet contribute a wide range of ecosystem services that have significant global economic and societal value. These environments currently face significant challenges associated with climate change, sea level rise, development and water quality deterioration and are consequently the focus of a range of management schemes. Increasingly, soft engineering techniques such as managed realignment (MR) are being employed to restore and recreate these environments, driven primarily by the need for habitat (re)creation and sustainable coastal flood defence. Such restoration schemes also have the potential to provide additional ecosystem services including climate regulation and waste processing. However, these sites have frequently been physically impacted by their previous land use and there is a lack of understanding of how this ‘disturbance’ impacts the delivery of ecosystem services or of the complex linkages between ecological, physical and biogeochemical processes in restored systems. Through the exploration of current data this paper determines that hydrological, geomorphological and hydrodynamic functioning of restored sites may be significantly impaired with respects to natural ‘undisturbed’ systems and that links between morphology, sediment structure, hydrology and solute transfer are poorly understood. This has consequences for the delivery of seeds, the provision of abiotic conditions suitable for plant growth, the development of microhabitats and the cycling of nutrients/contaminants and may impact the delivery of ecosystem services including biodiversity, climate regulation and waste processing. This calls for a change in our approach to research in these environments with a need for integrated, interdisciplinary studies over a range of spatial and temporal scales incorporating both intensive and extensive research design.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aengineering 3ageomorphology 3ahydrodynamics 3aland use 3amicrohabitats 3anutrients 3aplant growth 3aprocessing waste 3arange management 3asalt marshes 3asea level 3asediments 3aseeds 3asocial benefit 3asolutes 3awater quality1 aHarvey, G.L.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 June 20, v. 106 p.23-32dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.04.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01477naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010800167300001600275520069200291592002800983650001101011650001101022651001101033700002101044773008901065856004801154852000901202655001201211IND50068564220221118093928.0130816e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006856422DNAL7 a10.1134/S20790961130300982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovikova, N.

Results showed that the iron content in raw (control), soaked, germinated and roasted niger seeds ranged between 38.56–42.43 mg/100g. The germination process increased the bio-availability of iron (36%) and reduced the phytic acid level (52.6%) of niger seeds.

Water samples, as well as sediment samples, were collected in multilevel piezometers in different sites of the Buenos Aires province for the determination of stable isotopes, ²²²Rn concentrations and mineralogical analyses. The identification of uranium-bearing minerals in the loess sediments of the Pampeano aquifer was carried out with a scanning electron microscope allowing identifying zircon and monazite. The ²²²Rn was determined with a RAD7 detector, showing a range of activities from 3.1 to 14.9 Bq/L. The results showed a relation between the ²²²Rn activity, the depth of the wells, and the proximity of the Precambrian basement. The activity of ²²²Rn increases linearly with increasing depth at a rate of 0.09 Bq·L⁻¹·m⁻¹. However, at the same depth the concentration of ²²²Rn in wells near the Precambrian basement showed to be three times higher than the concentrations in the wells that have a Paleozoic bedrock, clearly showing that the proximity of granitoids rocks results in higher concentrations of radon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaleozoic era 3aPrecambrian time 3aaquifers 3abedrock 3acatenas 3agroundwater 3aloess 3apiezometers 3aradon 3azircon 3aArgentina 0aLoess mineralogy 0aStable isototopes 0aGranitoids rocks1 aMartínez, Daniel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7640-17541 aGrondona, Sebastián I.1 aQuiroz-Londoño, Mauricio O.1 aDonna, Flavia1 aMorvan, Gilles0 tCatena.g2020 Nov., v. 194 p.104692-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.1046923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001900157245011200176300001600288500001500304520152500319592002801844650001901872650002101891650001801912650001401930650001901944650001901963650001701982650000901999650002402008650001802032650001302050650003702063650001402100650001602114653001002130700001402140700001702154700001202171700001502183700001402198700001202212700001602224773009702240856009102337990002302428852000902451655001202460IND60098795620221119191701.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009879562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.08.1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hong-Xia10aNADPH oxidases mediate a cellular “memory” of angiotensin II stress in hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy  ap. 897-907.  a2019-12-06  aA long-term “memory” of hyperglycemic stress, even when glycemia is normalized, has been previously reported in diabetes. In this report we propose a similar hypothesis that exposure to continuous high angiotensin II (Ang II) results in a cellular “memory” in isolated cardiomyocytes and in the heart tissues, and we investigate the role of NADPH oxidases in this phenomenon. Continuous high Ang II for 3 days markedly increased cardiomyocyte size, TUNEL-positive apoptotic cardiomyocytes, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress. These deleterious effects were also observed in the memory condition (high Ang II for 2 days followed by normal medium for 1 day). Furthermore, in a mouse model, Ang II infusion for 3 weeks significantly increased cardiac hypertrophy, apoptosis, inflammation, and ROS generation but decreased cardiac function compared with control mice, and similar effects were also observed in mice in the memory condition. Importantly, blockade of NADPH oxidase using apocynin diminished the induction of high Ang II stress markers in isolated cardiomyocytes and in the mouse heart. These effects were associated with inhibition of NADPH oxidase-mediated AKT/mTOR/S6K and ERK signaling pathways. The present results demonstrate the hypothesis that exposure to continuous high Ang II results in a hypertensive cellular memory that remains, even when cells or mice are switched back to normal Ang II. This phenomenon was associated with NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiotensin II 3aoxidative stress 3ablood glucose 3acytokines 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3ainflammation 3amice 3asignal transduction 3aanimal models 3adiabetes 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aapoptosis 3ahypertrophy 0aheart1 aYang, Hui1 aHan, Qiu-Yue1 aLi, Nan1 aJiang, Xue1 aTian, Cui1 aDu, Jie1 aLi, Hui-Hua0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2013 Dec., v. 65 p.897-907dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.08.1793Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006100168300001600229520105800245592002801303650001601331650001201347650001901359650001001378700002101388700002001409773012001429856008201549852000901631655001201640IND60618859720221119035200.0181030e198009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061885972DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517580050009062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomori, Takashi10aMechanics of Large Deformation of Twisted-Filament Yarns  ap. 548-555.  aAn extended theory on the mechanics of twisted homogeneous-filament yarns is put forth, in which yarns are regarded as random fiber assemblies characterized by the distributions of fiber orientation; the large deformation is discussed, taking into consideration the possible change in fiber orientation. The obtained result relates the load-strain properties of twisted-filament yarns to those of the original twistless strands, the orientation distributions, and the ratios of transverse contraction of the yarns. The general expression is applied to a special case of constant contraction ratio and reduced to an explicit formula. Experimental estimations of the distributions of orientation and other properties are carried out for actual yarns of various twists, on the basis of which their load-elongation relations are numerically calculated using the special formula. Their agreement with the experimental values is fairly good over the wide range of strain up to the breaking-point for the yarns of moderate twist (less than about 3.2 turns/cm).  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3afabrics 3atextile fibers 3ayarns1 aMakishima, Kunio1 aItoh, Motoyoshi0 tTextile research journal.g1980 Sept., v. 50, no. 9 p.548-555dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517580050009063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011500163300001800278500001900296520156200315592002801877650001301905650002001918650001201938650002001950650002201970650001301992650001902005650001302024650001602037700005602053700001902109700001602128700001402144700001602158700005302174773017002227856008002397852000902477655001202486IND60740930720221119053057.0210609e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074093072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c010312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yiting10aSpherical Agglomerates of m-Aminobenzoic Acid: Solvent Selection, Preparation, Mechanism, and Characterization  ap. 8280-8290.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolvents for spherical agglomerates preparation are usually selected according to the Lifshitz–van der Waals acid–base theory with negative adhesion free energies. However, some solvents with positive adhesion free energies in which spherical agglomerates can be obtained are easily ignored. This work proposes that solvents should be screened comprehensively by theoretical calculation combined with experiments using m-aminobenzoic acid (m-ABA) as a model compound. According to the Lifshitz–van der Waals acid–base theory, water, isopropyl alcohol, and ethylene glycol with negative adhesion free energies were screened out as the possible solvents for the preparation of m-ABA spherical agglomerates. Crystallization experiments showed that in addition to the three solvents, methanol and ethanol with positive adhesion free energies were also appropriate for spherical crystallization of m-ABA. A common feature of the five solvents which can form spherical agglomerates is that they have both hydrogen-bond-donating and hydrogen-bond-accepting capabilities. The single-factor analysis method was used to systematically investigate the effects of stirring speed, terminal temperature, and supersaturation on spherical agglomerates of m-ABA. The formation mechanism of m-ABA spherical agglomerates was elucidated with the help of the in situ Pixact Crystallization Monitoring system. Comparative experiments proved that the obtained spherical agglomerates exhibit better chemical stabilities and crystal form stability than needle-like crystals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acrystallization 3aethanol 3aethylene glycol 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amethanol 3aprocess design 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aWang, Liping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8354-37181 aTuo, Zhenguang1 aGao, Yufeng1 aZhao, Pei1 aLiu, Ailing1 aBao, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4461-80350 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 May 28, v. 60, no. 22 p.8280-8290dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c010313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245011400182300001600296506002800312520097400340592002801314506003701342650001101379650001401390650001101404650002501415650001901440650001301459650001501472650001101487650001001498650001401508650001701522650001001539653000901549653001801558653002701576653001101603653001001614653002501624653000901649653001201658653001201670700002501682700002201707773012801729856008801857852000901945655001201954IND60739861620221215143100.0180530e200112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073986162DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2001.35.4.9842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaudillère, Jean-Pierre14aThe assessment of vine water uptake conditions by <sup>13</sup>c/<sup>12</sup>c discrimination in grape sugar  ap. 195-205.  aResource is Open Access  aCarbon isotope discrimination in primary products of photosynthesis varies with plant water uptake conditions. This property was used to show that the 13C/12C ratio (called ΔC13) in grape sugars and tartrate measured at ripeness can be a valuable indicator of vine water deficit. Correlation between ΔC13 in grape sugar and minimum pre-dawn leaf water potential is excellent (R2 = 0,81; n = 36). A statistically significant effect of soil and vintage is pointed out. When measured on a great number of plots of an estate, ΔC13 varies with the soil type. This proves ΔC13 can be a valuable tool in « terroir » studies. ΔC13 measured on phenolic compounds in wine is also significantly correlated to minimum pre-dawn leaf water potential as well as to ΔC13 in grape sugar. ΔC13 is actually the only tool capable to assess global vine water uptake conditions between veraison and harvest at a low cost, without the installation of heavy equipment in the vineyard.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3aequipment 3agrapes 3aleaf water potential 3aphotosynthesis 3aripening 3asoil types 3asugars 3avines 3avineyards 3awater uptake 3awines 0avine 0awater deficit 0aisotope discrimination 0acarbon 0aΔC13 0aleaf water potential 0asoil 0aclimate 0aterroir1 aCornelis van Leeuwen1 aTrégoat, Olivier0 tOENO One.g2001 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.195-205dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2001.35.4.9843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245017300177300001600350520211100366592002802477650003402505650002702539650001302566650000902579650002902588650002502617650001702642650001202659650002502671650001202696650001402708650001402722650001002736650001902746650004102765650003202806650001302838650002802851650000902879650001402888651001202902653004702914653002702961653001802988653001303006653002703019653002503046700001803071700001303089700001303102700001803115700002403133700003103157773011703188856008603305852000903391655001203400IND60636389920221119074954.0190620e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063638992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlažeković, Biljana10aChemical composition, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of essential oils of Lavandula × intermedia ‘Budrovka’ and L. angustifolia cultivated in Croatia  ap. 173-182.  aIn the search for new natural resources with promising biological activity, chemical composition as well as antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant activities of the essential oil from Croatian indigenous cultivar of lavandin (Lavandula × intermedia‘Budrovka’) were studied for the first time and compared with those of lavender (L. angustifolia) cultivated under the same pedo-climatic conditions of central Croatia. Forty compounds were identified in the studied Lavandula essential oils by GC–MS analysis. Linalool (57.1%), linalyl acetate (9.8%) and 1,8-cineole (8.4%) were the most abundant compounds of lavandin ‘Budrovka’ oil while lavender oil contained mainly linalool (54.0%), linalyl acetate (11.6%) and lavandulol (6.6%). Both essential oils were characterized by a very low amount of camphor (≤0.3%). The antimicrobial activities of two Lavandula essential oils and their dominant constituents were evaluated against 30 medically important pathogens and microbial contaminants of food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products using agar well diffusion and broth dilution methods. L. × intermedia ‘Budrovka’ essential oil showed a broad-spectrum of antibacterial (MICs 0.25–2.5 mg/mL) and antifungal (MICs 0.1–2 mg/mL) activities, being generally more than or at least as effective as those from L. angustifolia. Among the two dominant compounds which were also tested comparatively and found to exhibit antimicrobial effect, linalool has been pointed out as much more potent agent then linalyl acetate. Antioxidant studies based on DPPH assay indicated that the lavandin ‘Budrovka’ essential oil has significantly stronger antioxidant properties than lavender essential oil (IC50 21.6 mg/mL and 27.7 mg/mL, respectively). This study highlighted Croatian indigenous cultivar lavandin ‘Budrovka’ as a rich source of essential oil with pronounced antimicrobial properties due to abundance of linalool and indicated its potential use as biopreservative in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products or as natural remedy with promising health benefit.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLavandula angustifolia 3aacetates 3aagar 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acamphor 3achemical composition 3acineole 3acosmetics 3acultivars 3adrugs 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alinalool 3amicrobial contamination 3aoils 3apathogens 3aCroatia 0aLavandula × intermedia ‘Budrovka’ 0aLavandula angustifolia 0aEssential oil 0aLinalool 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aAntioxidant activity1 aYang, Weifeng1 aWang, Yi1 aLi, Chun1 aKindl, Marija1 aPepeljnjak, Stjepan1 aVladimir-Knežević, Sanda0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 123 p.173-182dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245010100160300002000261520104900281592002801330650002201358650002101380650001801401650001901419650001501438650002201453650002501475653002801500653002801528653003101556653001401587653002201601700001501623700001801638700001601656700002201672773012601694856008001820852000901900655001201909IND60566204520221121060216.0170405e20170405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056620452DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b165012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Daewoo10aStimuli-Responsive Self-Immolative Polymer Nanofiber Membranes Formed by Coaxial Electrospinning  ap. 11858-11865.  aThe first self-immolative polymer (SIP) nanofiber membrane is demonstrated in this report, in which the immolation can be triggered by external stimulus. Electrospun SIP/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers provide depolymerization that is ∼25 times quicker and more responsive (i.e., immolation) than that of a cast film in the triggering condition. Depolymerization of SIP in the SIP/PAN blended fiber membrane results in the transition of the surface properties from hydrophobic (∼110°) to hygroscopic (∼0°). Triggered release of encapsulated functional molecules was demonstrated using coaxially electrospun fiber membrane made of a SIP/PAN blend sheath and polyvinylpyrrolidone/dye core. Coaxial fibers with the SIP/PAN sheath provide minimal release of the encapsulated material in nontriggering solution, while it releases the encapsulated material instantly when the triggering condition is met. Its versatility has been strengthened compared to that of non-SIP coaxial fibers that provide no triggering reaction by external stimulus.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3adepolymerization 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophobicity 3ananofibers 3apolyacrylonitrile 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 0acoaxial electrospinning 0aself-immolative polymer 0astimuli-responsive polymer 0ananofiber 0atriggered release1 aYu, Xinjun1 aChai, Qinyuan1 aAyres, Neil1 aSteckl, Andrew J.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 9, no. 13 p.11858-11865dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b165013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007300169520101700242592002801259650001301287650001201300650001901312650001801331650001501349650001401364650003001378650001701408650002201425650002001447653001301467653001701480653001401497653001401511653001501525653001501540700001701555700001501572700001401587700001701601700001501618700001701633773009901650856008701749852000901836655001201845IND60719785920221117211104.0220103e20210530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071978592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1287712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuanfeng, Wu10aApproaches for enhancing the stability and formation of sulforaphane  aThe isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SF) is one of the most potent naturally occurring Phase 2 enzymes inducers derived from brassica vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, brussel sprouts, etc. Ingestion of broccoli releases SF via hydrolysis of glucoraphanin (GRP) by plant myrosinase and/or intestinal microbiota. However, both SF and plant myrosinase are thermal-labile, and the epithiospecifier protein (ESP) directs the hydrolysis of GRP toward formation of sulforaphane nitrile instead of SF. In addition, bacterial myrosinase has low hydrolyzing efficiency. In this review, we discuss strategies that could be employed to improve the stability of SF, increase SF formation during thermal and non-thermal processing of broccoli, and enhance the myrosinase-like activity of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, new cooking methods or blanching technologies should be developed to maintain myrosinase activity, and novel thermostable myrosinase and/or microbes with high SF producing abilities should also be developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroccoli 3acabbage 3afood chemistry 3aglucoraphanin 3ahydrolysis 3aingestion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3asulforaphane 3athermal stability 3athioglucosidase 0aBroccoli 0aSulforaphane 0aStability 0aFormation 0aMyrosinase 0aMicrobiota1 aChengzhi, Lv1 aLigen, Zou1 aJuan, Sun1 aXinjie, Song1 aYao, Zhang1 aJianwei, Mao0 tFood chemistry.g2021 May 30, v. 345 p.128771-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1287713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012600161300001400287500001900301520109400320592002801414650001401442650002001456650001901476650001601495650002001511650001901531651001001550653001801560653002501578653003501603700001701638700002001655700001201675700002101687773015601708856008201864852000901946655001201955IND60716764520221122040930.0201107e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071676452DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.v36i01.74542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGopi, R.10aSocio-economic characteristics and its relationship with information seeking pattern of dairy farmers in Tamilnadu, India  ap. 16-20.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLivestock plays a significant role in the rural economy of Tamil Nadu.

A comparison of the pulsed and quasi-static characteristics in the high resistance part of the I–V revealed that Joule self-heating significantly affected the current and was a likely source of negative differential resistance (NDR) and thermal runaway. The experimental quasi-static I–V’s were simulated using a finite element electro-thermal model that coupled current and heat flow and incorporated an external circuit with an appropriate load resistor. The simulation reproduced the experimental I–V including the OFF-state at low currents and the volatile NDR region. In the NDR region, the simulation predicted spontaneous current constriction forming a small-diameter hot conducting filament with a radius of 250 nm in a 6 μm diameter device.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3aheat 3amodels 3aoxygen 3atemperature 0atantalum oxide 0aPoole−Frenkel conduction 0athreshold switch 0anegative differential resistance 0athermal runaway1 aSharma, Abhishek A.1 aLi, Dasheng1 aBain, James A.1 aSkowroński, Marek,0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 9, no. 13 p.11704-11710dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b165593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003800152245016300190520111300353592002801466650002501494650001801519650003501537650001601572650001301588650001001601650001901611650004301630650001701673650001101690650001501701650001301716650002901729653004101758653003901799653003801838653003401876653003801910653000901948653001301957653002401970653002401994653002502018700003002043700004002073700003602113700003502149700007202184700002602256700003102282700003602313700003002349773009902379856008702478852000902565655001202574IND60719786020221117203935.0220103e20210530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071978602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1287722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Jaqueline Vieira Piovezana10aComparison of bioactive compounds and nutrient contents in whey protein concentrate admixture of turmeric extract produced by spray drying and foam mat drying  aWe developed a whey protein admixture of turmeric extract by spray drying (TWPC-SD) and by foam mat drying (TWPC-FMD) and compared its bioactive compounds and nutrients contents.

Thus, the TWPC-SD is a good alternative for human consumption since it showed good sensory acceptability and its nutrients and bioactive compounds can contribute to human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarotenoids 3acurcumin 3afoams 3afood chemistry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ariboflavin 3aturmeric 3awhey protein concentrate 0aAscorbic acid (PubChemCID: 54670067) 0aα-carotene (PubChem CID: 4369188) 0aβ-carotene (PubChemCID: 5280489) 0acurcumin (PubChemCID: 969516) 0ariboflavin: (PubChem CID: 493570) 0aWhey 0aTurmeric 0aProduct development 0aBioactive compounds 0aAntioxidant capacity1 ade Oliveira, Lívya Alves1 aPereira, Stephanie Michelin Santana1 ada Conceição, Aline Rosignoli1 aAnunciação, Pamella Cristine1 ade Souza, Eliana Carla Gomes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2229-74291 aPerrone, Ítalo Tuler1 ada Silva Junqueira, Mateus1 aPinheiro Sant'Ana, Helena Maria1 aDella Lucia, Ceres Mattos0 tFood chemistry.g2021 May 30, v. 345 p.128772-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1287723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245003900169500001900208520155600227592002801783650001001811650001401821650001801835650001101853650001901864650001001883653002001893653002001913653003001933653002201963700002501985700002202010773009002032856008402122852000902206655001202215IND60696664620221118114319.0200614e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069666462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2020.1516272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Lance S.10aXylem conductivities in leaf veins  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLeaves are the main photosynthetic organs of plants. There is almost an infinite variety of leaf shapes and venations. The purpose of the current study was to determine if leaf areas, leaf veins and xylem conductivities are well scaled among primary, secondary and tertiary tiers in leaves with percurrent leaf venation for 32 species. Data from both fully-expanded leaves and leaves that underwent expansion were analyzed. Thirty-two species with leaves of 7.25 to 887 cm² lamina areas with a median leaf area of 81 cm² were tested. On average, leaves had 19 secondary veins 45 mm long to produce secondary areas of 4.1 cm². Leaves had 272 tertiary areas, each 0.30 cm², in which the median tertiary veins were 10 mm in length. There were strong relationships between lamina areas, vein lengths, vessel numbers, vessel radii and xylem conductivities among tier levels. Primary veins had a median xylem conductivity of 1.02 g cm⁻¹ MPa⁻¹ s⁻¹ while secondary and tertiary xylem conductivities were 0.51 and 0.00081 g cm⁻¹ MPa⁻¹ s⁻¹, respectively. The above strong relationships for fully-expanded leaves were confirmed for five species during leaf expansion. Estimates of water conduction with respect to lamina areas, vein characteristics and xylem conductivities among tier levels are presented. The strong relationships among the above parameters of this study suggest that leaf characteristics of leaf lamina areas, veins lengths and xylem conductivities of each species are well scaled to provide water to all areas of leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflora 3aleaf area 3aleaf venation 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3axylem 0aleaf vein tiers 0avessel geometry 0aHagen-Poiseuille equation 0ahydraulic scaling1 aCarvalho-Evans, Maya1 aLeoncavallo, Gina0 tFlora.g2020 July, v. 268 p.151627-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2020.1516273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009800174300001600272520132100288592002801609650001801637650001601655650001801671650002601689650001901715650001601734650001901750650000701769650001601776650002301792650002101815650001501836653002401851653001501875653001901890653000701909653001901916700002701935700001901962700002501981700006102006773012202067856008102189852000902270655001202279IND60626419620221122053308.0190318e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062641962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogahawaththa, Dimuthu10aImpact of selected process parameters on solubility and heat stability of pea protein isolate  ap. 246-253.  aPea protein isolate (PPI) is considered a promising substitute for commonly used protein ingredients of animal origin. Its application in food industry is limited by lack of scientific knowledge on functional properties including solubility. PPI dispersions adjusted to concentration (4% or 8% w/w protein), pH (6.8 or 7.5) and ionic strength (IS non-adjusted, 50 or 100 mM) were subjected to two industrially applied heat treatments of 140 °C for 4 s (ultra-high temperature, UHT) or 121 °C for 2.8 min. Solubility and heat stability varied depending on pH, IS, protein concentration and heat treatment. Both 4% and 8% PPI dispersions demonstrated high solubility (>97%) at pH 7.5 and IS non-adjusted either non-heated or 121 °C/2.8 min heated conditions. They also showed high heat stability (>92%) after 121 °C/2.8 min treatment. UHT generally resulted in low solubility and heat stability regardless of solution conditions. Treatment at 121 °C/2.8 min mostly formed soluble protein aggregates through covalent (thiol-disulphide) interactions while UHT mainly produced non-soluble aggregates through non-covalent interactions. Manipulation of solution conditions and optimization of heat treatments could be a promising approach to improve solubility and heat stability of pea proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUHT treatment 3adispersions 3afood industry 3afunctional properties 3aheat stability 3aingredients 3aionic strength 3apH 3apea protein 3aprotein aggregates 3aprotein isolates 3asolubility 0aPea protein isolate 0aSolubility 0aHeat stability 0apH 0aIonic strength1 aBao Chau, Nguyen Hoang1 aTrivedi, Jigar1 aDissanayake, Muditha1 aVasiljevic, Todor1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1395-73490 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Mar., v. 102 p.246-253dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245010400176506002800280520138400308592002801692506003701720650001401757650001001771650001401781650002401795650001001819650002101829650001701850650001301867650001601880650001201896650002701908650001001935650002001945650001901965650001001984700002501994700002702019700001602046700001902062700002502081773008002106856008302186852000902269655001202278IND60739861920221207073250.0161117s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073986192DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201607040082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsteban-Fernández, A.10aUnderstanding the protective effects of wine components and their metabolites in the brain function  aResource is Open Access  aModerate wine consumption has been suggested to exert a positive effect in prevention of neurodegenerative process and cognitive impairment. With the ultimate aim of achieving a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this benefit, we have investigated the role of certain wine- derived phenolic metabolites and aroma compounds in the MAPK cascade (including ERK1/2, p38), one of the routes directly related to inflammation in neuronal cells. Some of the tested phenolic compounds, especially in the case of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, showed a significant neuroprotective effect against SIN-1-induced neuronal death. Regarding their effect over MAPK phosphorylation, inmunoblotting technique revealed a beneficial and significant decrease on the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 kinases after incubation with wine constituents. In addition, activity of caspase3-like protease, an executor of neuronal apoptosis and a downstream signal of MAPK, was significantly diminished by 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid and linalool, counterbalancing the increase produced by SIN-1. Altogether, these results suggest that wine aroma, phenolic compounds and their gut metabolites could exert neuroprotective actions by modulating MAPK signalling and caspase-3 proteases activation, which are known to play a key role in oxidative/ nitrosative stress-induced response.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3acaspase-3 3acognitive disorders 3adeath 3adigestive system 3ainflammation 3alinalool 3ametabolites 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aodors 3aphosphorylation 3apropionic acid 3awines1 aGigorro, del Coso D.1 ade Llano, D.

The recovery of wax from the pyrolysis of virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and plastic solid waste (PSW) in a patented fixed-bed reactor has been investigated in this study. The highest wax yield (64.5 wt %) was obtained from LDPE at 500 °C. Results show that the average densities of the waxes recovered from PSW, HDPE, and LDPE are 851.7 ± 1.0, 849.4 ± 5.3, and 879.5 ± 2.2 kg m–³, respectively. These values are similar to that of commercial wax and slightly higher than that of commercial paraffin wax. Considering their energy content, the waxes studied can be used as sources of fuel. The calorific values of the recovered waxes are estimated to be in the range of 45.61–46.22 kJ g–¹, which is in the acceptable range of commercial kerosene, gas oil, and light fuel oil. Furthermore, the waxes obtained have flash points that are above the specifications of diesel fuel, indicating that they fall within the acceptable flammability range.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy content 3aflammability 3afuel oils 3akerosene 3aparaffin wax 3apatents 3apolyethylene 3apolyolefin 3aprocess design 3apyrolysis 3asolid wastes 3avalue added1 aDutta, Animesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9995-807X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 May 26, v. 60, no. 22 p.8301-8309dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c011763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245013300171300001400304500001900318520066600337592002801003650001201031650001701043650001801060650001701078650002801095650002001123650002101143650002001164650000901184653003501193653001601228653002101244653001401265700001801279700001901297700002001316700001401336773015601350856008201506852000901588655001201597IND60716764920221122025702.0201107e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071676492DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.v36i01.74572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Shashi Kr.10aEffect of incorporation of sapota pulp and cocoa powder on the physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of shrikhand  ap. 34-36.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present investigation was made with an attempt to develop shrikhand by partial addition of different level of sapota pulp and cocoa powder and to evaluate its effect on nutritional and microbial quality.

The results showed the maneb group could be melt and stabilized by 5 v% ethylenediamine for 60 days keeping in conventional refrigerators, in which a stable and ionizable pentadentate ligand complex was considered to be formed by the bidentate diamine and sulfhydryl followed by Density Functional Theory calculation. The validated method showed a sensitive quantification limits (0.03 mg/kg), a steady recovery (82.1%–91.0%) and an excellent precision (2.7%–4.3% RSD). This method is applied to analyze fruit samples and achieved satisfactory results. Therefore, this method can be proposed as a robust analytical method of maneb group in fruit, and can be adapted to detect other compounds with sulfhydryl group.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aethylenediamines 3afood chemistry 3afruits 3aligands 3aliquid chromatography 3amaneb 3aprecision 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aManeb group 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 0aDirect-determination 0aStabilization1 aKe, Zhuofeng1 aXu, Zhenlin1 aHuang, Weilong1 aSun, Yuanming1 aLei, Hongtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1697-17471 aWei, Xiaoqun0 tFood chemistry.g2021 May 30, v. 345 p.128774-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1287743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006800168300001400236500001900250520076500269592002801034650001601062650001101078650001801089650001101107650000901118650002401127650002001151650002301171650002001194653001101214653001401225653002101239653002101260653001401281653001801295700001601313773015601329856008101485852000901566655001201575IND60716765020221122045559.0201107e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071676502DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.v0iOF.73032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalla, Adarsh M.10aMicrowave energy and its application in food industry: A reveiw  ap. 37-44.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper reviews an overview of microwave heating as one method of thermal food processing. The higher standard of living and soaring income of consumers have lead for the demand for the modern food processing application. The technological revolution and nutritional awareness have increased the popularity of the microwave heating. Microwave heating is known for its operational safety and nutrient retention capacity with minimal loss of heat-labile nutrients such as vitamins B and C, dietary antioxidants, phenols and carotenoids. This review aims to provide a brief update of microwave heating and its application for food processing applications, with special emphasis on its impact on food quality in terms of microbial and nutritional value changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarotenoids 3aenergy 3afood industry 3aincome 3alead 3amicrowave treatment 3amilk production 3anutrient retention 3anutritive value 0aBaking 0aBlanching 0aDipolar rotation 0aIonic conduction 0aMicrowave 0aSterilization1 aDevaraju, R0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2017 Mar., v. 36, no. 1 p.37-44dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.v0iOF.73033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009500161300001800256500001900274520161400293592002801907650001401935650002101949650001801970650002301988650001702011650001302028650001202041650001402053650001202067650001902079650001602098650001702114700005602131700001702187700005202204700005302256700005502309700005802364773017002422856008002592852000902672655001202681IND60740931220221119053151.0210609e20210526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074093122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c012772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Dan-Na10aInjectable Temperature/Glucose Dual-Responsive Hydrogels for Controlled Release of Insulin  ap. 8147-8158.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelf-regulating insulin controlled-release systems have gained more attention due to their advantages of timely response to blood glucose change and avoiding side effects caused by the high-frequency injection. In this paper, the temperature-responsive monomer N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and glucose-responsive monomer 3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid (AAPBA) are copolymerized and then grafted with alginate to prepare temperature/glucose dual-responsive copolymers alginate-g-P(NIPAM-co-AAPBA) (Alg-g-PNA). The temperature and glucose responsiveness under different conditions, rheological characteristics, glucose-mediated insulin release, and biotoxicity of the Alg-g-PNA copolymers are studied. The results show that the copolymer solution is in the sol state at 10 °C and insulin can be dispersed uniformly, while it turns into the gel state when the temperature rises to physiological 37 °C for in situ delivery of insulin. Due to the sensitivity to blood glucose levels, the hydrogels can quickly respond to the increase in blood glucose and undergo the gel-to-sol transition and release insulin to reduce blood glucose when the environmental blood glucose rises. Moreover, the hydrogels have good sol–gel transition reversibility in response to changes between normoglycemic and hyperglycemic levels. The cell cytotoxicity results show that the hydrogels have good biocompatibility to be a safe carrier for insulin delivery. The proposed injectable temperature/glucose dual-responsive hydrogels in this study provide a novel type of self-regulating insulin delivery systems for diabetes therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiocompatibility 3ablood glucose 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adiabetes 3aglucose 3ahydrogels 3ainsulin 3aprocess design 3atemperature 3atherapeutics1 aJu, Xiao-Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1086-338X1 aPu, Xing-Qun1 aXie, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2857-74801 aWang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2281-87061 aLiu, Zhuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6898-59081 aChu, Liang-Yin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2676-63250 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 May 26, v. 60, no. 22 p.8147-8158dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c012773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03877naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011700174300001600291520176700307592002802074650003402102650002602136650002902162650002502191650001702216650001802233650001402251650001402265650001502279650001602294650001402310650002302324650002402347650003502371650001502406650002202421650002002443650001902463650002002482650001802502650001702520650002102537650004402558650001602602653002102618653002002639653002202659653002502681653001802706653002002724700002402744700002402768700006002792700002002852700002902872700001802901700002002919700002002939700002002959773011702979856008603096852000903182655001203191IND60636390320221120043147.0190620e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063639032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Cristiana10aActive polylactic acid film incorporated with green tea extract: Development, characterization and effectiveness  ap. 100-110.  aA new antioxidant active packaging film has been developed based on polylactic acid (PLA) in which green tea extract (GTE) has been immobilized by extrusion. Two GTE concentrations were tested, 1% (w/w) and 2% (w/w). Four GT samples were compared regarding their antioxidant capacity (by DPPH radical scavenging method and β-carotene bleaching method), total phenolics content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC). The commercial GTE presented with highest antioxidant capacity by the DPPH radical assay (EC50 = 0.12 ± 0.00 mg/mL) and the highest TPC (416 ± 9.95 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g extract) and it was selected to be incorporated in the active film. Films were evaluated regarding their mechanical properties (e.g. tensile strength decreased 12% with the incorporation of GTE in the PLA matrix and strain at break increased 9.6 and 36% with the addition of 1 and 2% of GTE) and water vapour transmission rates (water-vapour barrier properties improved with the addition of higher amounts of GTE).The study of the effectiveness of PLA/GTE films against lipid oxidation was performed by the following methods: peroxide value, p-anisidine value, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay and hexanal monitoring, after packaging smoked salmon slices during different storage times (0, 7, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days). The results showed that the incorporation of GTE in the PLA films protects the smoked salmon from lipid oxidation in the different storage times tested. However, additional studies should be performed to better understand the GTE mechanism of action as the results suggest a pro-oxidant effect of PLA/GTE 2% after 60 days of storage and to evaluate the potential antimicrobial activity of active films.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aactive food packaging 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3ableaching 3aextrusion 3aflavonoids 3agallic acid 3agreen tea 3alipid peroxidation 3amechanism of action 3amedian effective concentration 3amonitoring 3ap-anisidine value 3apackaging films 3aperoxide value 3apolylactic acid 3asmoked salmon 3astorage time 3atensile strength 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3awater vapor 0aActive packaging 0aPolylactic acid 0aGreen tea extract 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aSmoked salmon 0aLipid oxidation1 aVilarinho, Fernanda1 aSilva, Ana Sanches,1 aAndrade, Mariana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4297-22411 aMachado, Ana V.1 aCastilho, M.

In this study, small-caliber (2.0 mm) electrospun poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) vascular grafts were modified with a fusion protein VEGF–HGFI which consists of the class I hydrophobin (HGFI) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), via hydrophobic interactions. Immunofluorescence staining with the anti-VEGF antibody showed that VEGF–HGFI formed a protein layer on the surface of fibers in the grafts. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical measurements showed that VEGF–HGFI modification had no effect on the structure and mechanical properties of PCL grafts. Blood compatibility tests demonstrated a lower level of fibrinogen (FGN) absorption, platelet activation, and aggregation on the VEGF–HGFI-modified PCL mats than that on the bare PCL mats. The hemolysis rate was comparable in both the modified and bare PCL mats. In vitro culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrated that VEGF–HGFI modification could remarkably enhance nitric oxide (NO) production, prostacyclin₂ (PGI₂) release, and the uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) by HUVECs. The healing characteristics of the modified grafts were examined in the replacement of rat abdominal aorta for up to 1 month. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that endothelialization, vascularization, and smooth muscle cell (SMC) regeneration were markedly improved in the VEGF–HGFI-modified PCL grafts. These results suggest that modification with fusion protein VEGF–HGFI is an effective method to improve the regeneration capacity of synthetic vascular grafts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantibodies 3aaorta 3ablood 3aendothelium 3afibrinogen 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahemolysis 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobins 3ahyperplasia 3ain vitro culture 3alow density lipoprotein 3amechanical properties 3anitric oxide 3aplatelet activation 3arats 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asmooth muscle 3astaining 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0afusion protein VEGF-HGFI 0aPCL 0avascular grafts 0asurface modification 0avascular regeneration1 aZhang, Qiuying1 aZhao, Liqiang1 aPan, Yiwa1 aWang, Ting1 aZhi, Dengke1 aMa, Shaoyang1 aZhang, Peixin1 aZhao, Tiechan1 aZhang, Siming1 aLi, Wen1 aZhu, Meifeng1 aZhu, Yan1 aZhang, Jun1 aQiao, Mingqiang1 aKong, Deling0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 9, no. 13 p.11415-11427dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b167133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245006700174300001400241506002800255520212300283592002802406506003702434650001702471650000802488650001302496650002402509650001902533653003102552653003502583653002202618653002602640653001702666653002402683653002602707773016102733856009102894852000902985655001202994IND60739862220221207070936.0210112e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073986222DNAL7 a10.22314/2073-7599-2020-14-1-40-452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopov, A. Yu.14aThe Air Flow Distribution in the Overpressure Sowing Apparatus  ap. 40-45.  aResource is Open Access  aTo improve the quality of the pneumatic sowing apparatus, it is necessary to study its aerodynamics. (Research purpose) Determination of air flow distribution in the upper part of the seed chamber of the sowing apparatus, taking into account the protrusions of the sowing disk, on which the quality of seeds dosing depends. (Materials and methods) The author chose a sowing apparatus operating at overpressure as an object of research. The author showed that the seed chamber constant sealing in it is provided by the protrusions of the sowing disk, which are made with cut edges on the side of the sowing disk metering element in two planes. The author applied computer simulation of the sowing apparatus. To conduct a numerical experiment, the initial and boundary conditions were determined, and the rotation of the seed disk was taken into account. The calculation of the model was carried out by changing the volumetric air flow in the range of 15-35 liters per second. (Results and discussion) The author constructed isolines of the air velocity distribution at various air flow rates. He determined the values of the air flow in the directions X, Y and Z in the sowing apparatus seed chamber. It was revealed that the largest and the smallest values of this indicator are achieved at 35 and 25 liters per second respectively. It was shown that at an air flow rate in the range of 15-25 liters per second, the distribution of the air flow in the upper part of the seed chamber would be optimal for transporting the seeds with a metering element. The air flow velocity components in Z direction vary in the range from 5.4 to 16.5 meters per second, and in the X and Y directions do not exceed 8 meters per second. (Conclusions) Based on simulation modeling, the author constructed and analyzed graphs of air flow velocity components changes in the three directions of air flow propagation. He determined the nature of the distribution of air flow in the excess seeds discharge area in the design of protrusions with cut corners. He proposed a rational range of air volumetric flow rate of 15-25 liters per second.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaerodynamics 3aair 3aair flow 3acomputer simulation 3aisogenic lines 0apneumatic sowing apparatus 0aaerodynamics of dosing systems 0aair flow velocity 0aseed plate protrusion 0aseed chamber 0acomputer simulation 0aair flow distribution0 tSelʹskohozâjstvennye mašiny i tehnologii.g2020 Mar., v. 14, no. 1 p.40-45dFederal Scientific Agroengineering Centre VIMwJournal:27913x2618-67487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22314/2073-7599-2020-14-1-40-453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245012200153300001600275520200700291592002802298650002502326650001902351650001502370650001502385650002302400650001802423650001202441650001702453650001502470651001402485700001902499700001802518700001702536773011302553856003902666852000902705655001202714IND4485817320221117232917.0120308e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448581732DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.14582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoda, M.

Currently under threat from climate change, urbanization and increasing freshwater demands, there is a need for innovative approaches to tropical watershed assessment and management. This study investigated cascade habitat macroinvertebrate communities among four tropical mountain streams with the goal of enhancing future efforts to identify flow biocriteria for watersheds of Polynesia. Cascade macroinvertebrate communities were compared between streams of differing size and magnitude of flow removal to evaluate the biological effects of water withdrawal on benthic communities. Two cascade microhabitats, identified as torrenticolous and amphibious, were evaluated for macroinvertebrate community differences and presence of native taxa among watersheds. Cascade habitat in general was reduced, by as much as 98%, in downstream reaches, having a significant impact on the stream ecosystem physical template important for native stream communities. In addition, twoâway ANOVA results revealed no main effects, but significant interactions of watershed size and flow removal on mean macroinvertebrate density for torrenticolous microhabitats; however, the opposite was true for the amphibious microhabitat. Diversity was significantly higher under undiverted flow conditions (tâ=â4.21, dfâ=â272, pâ=â0.0004) and in torrenticolous microhabitats (tâ=â3.86, dfâ=â272, pâ<â0.0001) over the entire study period. The amphibious microhabitat was composed of 39% native taxa, while the torrenticolous microhabitat contained <7%. This study provides new options for biomonitoring of native populations in Polynesian watersheds.

Dewey] is a cool‐season perennial forage grass bred for higher seed yield. It is the first perennial grain crop in the United States, commercialized as Kernza since 2015. Managing IWG as a dual‐use grain and forage crop could provide several ecosystem services including conserving soil and clean water while increasing economic income to growers. However, little is known about the weed management risks associated with IWG. Therefore, we studied weed community composition, biomass, IWG grain, and aboveground biomass in a factorial experiment with two weed management treatments, two nitrogen fertilization rates, and four forage harvest schedules (no harvest, summer only, summer + fall, and spring + summer + fall). Over three production years, weed biomass decreased by 88% regardless of treatment, and the weed community composition changed from predominantly winter annual to perennial species. In the second and third production years the weed community composition remained relatively stable. Grain yield was 16% greater with 135 kg N ha⁻¹ than 90 kg N ha⁻¹ but was not affected by in‐season forage harvest or weed management treatments in the second and third years. Grain yield decreased from 763 to 371 kg ha⁻¹ over three years, while aboveground biomass remained stable. Weed presence did not affect yields in second and third years. Dual‐use IWG cropping systems effectively suppressed weeds and IWG is a promising grain crop alternative for farmers interested in diversifying their cropping systems under similar conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Land Institute, KS  cUniversity of Wisconsin Madison 3aThinopyrum intermedium subsp. intermedium 3aaboveground biomass 3aagronomy 3acold season 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aforage crops 3aforage grasses 3agrain yield 3aincome 3anitrogen 3aseed yield 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3aweed control 3aweeds1 aStoltenberg, David E.1 aPicasso, Valentin D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4989-63170 tAgronomy journal.g2020 May, v. 112, no. 3 p.2164-2175dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.201943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04030naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011100210300001600321520185500337592002802192650002402220650002402244650002002268650002402288650001702312650001502329650002202344650002202366650003202388650002202420650002302442650002202465650001402487650001602501650001902517650001502536650002502551651001402576651001102590651001102601653001702612653006702629653000802696653000702704653000802711653000702719653000802726653000902734653001002743653001102753653001102764653000902775653000802784653000802792653000802800653000902808653000902817653000902826653000802835653000802843653000902851653000802860653000902868653000802877653000802885653000802893653000902901653000902910653000902919700001902928700002402947700002402971773009902995856008503094852000903179655001203188IND60745226620221118024016.0210813e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074522662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Bikash R1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8269-711710aCritical insights into psychrophilic anaerobic digestion: Novel strategies for improving biogas production  ap. 513-526.  aAnaerobic digestion (AD) under psychrophilic temperature has only recently garnered deserved attention. In major parts of Europe, USA, Canada and Australia, climatic conditions are more suited for psychrophilic (<20 ℃) rather than mesophilic (35 – 37 ℃) and thermophilic (55 – 60 ℃) AD. Low temperature has adverse effects on important cellular processes which may render the cell biology inactive. Moreover, cold climate can also alter the physical and chemical properties of wastewater, thereby reducing the availability of substrate to microbes. Hence, the use of low temperature acclimated microbial biomass could overcome thermodynamic constraints and carry out flexible structural and conformational changes to proteins, membrane lipid composition, expression of cold-adapted enzymes through genotypic and phenotypic variations. Reduction in organic loading rate is beneficial to methane production under low temperatures. Moreover, modification in the design of existing reactors and the use of hybrid reactors have already demonstrated improved methane generation in the lab-scale. This review also discusses some novel strategies such as direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), co-digestion of substrate, bioaugmentation, and bioelectrochemical system assisted AD which present promising prospects. While DIET can facilitate syntrophic electron exchange in diverse microbes, the addition of organic-rich co-substrate can help in maintaining suitable C/N ratio in the anaerobic digester which subsequently can enhance methane generation. Bioaugmentation with psychrophilic strains could reduce start-up time and ensure daily stable performance for wastewater treatment facilities at low temperatures. In addition to the technical discussion, the economic assessment and future outlook on psychrophilic AD are also highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioaugmentation 3abioelectrochemistry 3acell biology 3acold zones 3aeconomic analysis 3aelectron transfer 3agas production (biological) 3alipid composition 3amethane production 3amicrobial biomass 3aphenotype 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aAustralia 3aCanada 3aEurope 0aCo-digestion 0aDirect interspecies electron transfer, psychrophilic anaerobes 0aACF 0aAF 0aAFP 0aAH 0aAHS 0aAMBR 0aAnMBR 0aAnSMBR 0aAnIBPR 0aASBR 0aBES 0aCOD 0aCPH 0aDIET 0aEGSB 0aΔǴ 0aGAC 0aHRT 0aHUSB 0aLCA 0aLCFA 0aOLR 0aPTF 0aSBR 0aUASB 0aUSFA 0aVFAs1 aRouissi, Tarek1 aBrar, Satinder Kaur1 aSurampalli, Rao Y.,0 tWaste management.g2021 July 15, v. 131 p.513-526dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245009300178300001600271506002800287520155100315592002801866506003701894650001401931650001401945650001901959650001201978650000901990650001301999650002602012650001502038650002102053653001302074653002102087653002602108653001402134653002202148653002302170700001902193700001902212700002202231773018602253856009002439852000902529655001202538IND60739862420221207073600.0200116e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073986242DNAL7 a10.30901/2227-8834-2019-4-121-1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBochkaryova, E.

Pustovoit All-Russian Research Institute of Oil Crops (VNIIMK) performs the breeding of interline rapeseed hybrids using the Ogura CMS. The program of interline winter rapeseed hybrid development was aimed at studying the efficiency of self-pollinated line breeding from population cultivars, assessing the impact of inbreeding depression on economically important traits, analyzing the changes in the lines’ traits after their transition to the sterile basis, and obtaining fertility restorer lines with an acceptable level of glucosinolate content in seeds.Materials and methods. Intraspecific hybrids, cultivars developed at the Pustovoit Institute and those of foreign breeding were employed as parent material for the development of self-pollinated lines. Self-pollination of rapeseed plants was performed using spunbond isolators. Over 1000 plants were self-pollinated every year. Generations of self-pollinated lines S1 –S4 were planted on 2.25 m2 plots, and during the growth season their visual screening was undertaken to assess their morphobiological traits. Starting with S5, the lines were evaluated for their yield on 7.5 m2 plots.Results. The inbreeding depression was found to not exceed 3–15% of the seed yield. The transition of the lines to sterile cytoplasm did not have any negative consequences. A series of experimental hybrids were developed, exceeding the reference cultivar ‘Loris’ in seed yield by 23–48%. New hybrid combinations also exceeded the reference in seed yield by 21–54%.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acultivars 3acytoplasm 3aglucosinolates 3ahybrids 3aoils 3arapeseed 3aresearch institutions 3aseed yield 3aself-pollination 0arapeseed 0aself-pollination 0ainbreeding depression 0aogura cms 0asterile analogues 0afertility restorer1 aGorlova, L.

F.10aVitamin A deficiency in patients with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease  ap. 1724-1731.  aHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with oxidative stress and vitamin A possesses antioxidant activity. The objective of the present study was to investigate vitamin A nutritional status in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), according to biochemical, functional and dietetic indicators correlating these findings with liver function, liver damage and death. Vitamin A nutritional status was analysed by serum retinol levels, dietetic indicators and functional indicators. A total of 140 patients with HCV-related liver disease were enrolled. Vitamin A deficiency was detected in 54·3 % of all patients, and there was a progressive drop in serum retinol levels from chronic hepatitis C patients towards cirrhosis and HCC patients. Increased total bilirubin, liver transaminases and prothrombin time, presence of hepatic encephalopathy and ascites were related to reduced serum retinol levels, and values ≤ 0·78 μmol/l of serum retinol were associated with liver-related death. A high prevalence of inadequate intake of vitamin A was observed in all stages of chronic liver disease. The functional indicator was not an adequate parameter for evaluating the vitamin A nutritional status. Therefore, serum retinol concentration is related to severity of the disease, liver complications and mortality. The effectiveness of nutritional counselling and measures of intervention in this group in improving vitamin A nutritional status should be examined further in a controlled study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aantioxidant activity 3aascites 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3achronic hepatitis C 3acounseling 3adeath 3adisease severity 3aencephalopathy 3ahepatoma 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3aliver function 3amortality 3anutrient intake 3anutritional status 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aprothrombin 3atransaminases 3avitamin A 3avitamin deficiencies 2aChronic Disease 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aHepatitis Cxcomplications 2aHumans 2aLiver Diseasesxcomplications 2aVitamin Axblood 2aVitamin A Deficiencyxcomplications 0aVitamin A deficiency 0aHepatitis C virus infection 0aRetinol 0aLiver disease1 aChaves, G.

Although much research regarding the environmental application of MoS₂ have been recently summarized, reports on the recent progress of the removal of various environmental pollutants on MoS₂ are still scarce. Herein, we systematically summarize the efficient elimination of environmental contaminants (e.g., gas, organic, heavy metals, and radionuclides) on MoS₂-based nanosheets. In addition, the interaction mechanisms (e.g., physical (hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces), ion-exchange, chemical adsorption, and redox) of environmental contaminants on MoS₂-based materials were elucidated in detail. Finally, the major challenges and future prospective on MoS₂-based materials were presented. This review has important implication for the design of MoS₂-based materials with high adsorption performance and strong redox capacity toward the removal of various environmental pollutants in actual application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3aion exchange 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananosheets 3apollution 3aprocess design 3aremediation 3avan der Waals forces1 aSun, Yubing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4931-80390 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 May 25, v. 60, no. 22 p.8007-8026dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c013113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011500178520158700293592002801880650002601908650002501934650001401959650001001973650000901983650001201992650002102004650001002025650001002035650001002045650001402055650001502069653002102084653001702105653002002122653002002142653002602162700002102188700002602209773010402235856008502339852000902424655001202433IND60696665220221118114559.0200804e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069666522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2020.1041522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTosi-Germán, Rafael A.10aFemale and male rufous horneros eject shiny cowbird eggs using a mental template of the size of their own eggs  aHosts of interspecific brood parasites often evolve antiparasitic defences, like the recognition and rejection of parasite's eggs. Most hosts use differences in coloration and maculation to discriminate between their own and parasitic eggs, but there are a few cases of hosts using the size of eggs as a cue. To recognize parasite eggs, hosts may require the presence of their own eggs and use a discordancy rule or may use a mental template of their own eggs. Females are responsible for egg rejection in hosts in which they incubate alone, but if incubation is shared, males can also reject parasitic eggs. The rufous hornero, Furnarius rufus, a host of the shiny cowbird Molothrus bonariensis, ejects parasite eggs using egg size as a cue. We studied the cognitive mechanism underlying the recognition and ejection of parasitic eggs by this host. We experimentally parasitized hornero nests with eggs of different size, with and without the presence of host eggs and determined which sex was responsible for the ejection. We found that horneros ejected parasitic eggs using the size of the egg as a cue and did not need to compare parasitic eggs with their own eggs, which is consistent with the hypothesis of a mental template. Females and males ejected eggs at similar frequencies. We also found that cowbird eggs laid in hornero nests were longer and wider than those laid in nests of other host in the same area, which is consistent with the hypothesis of host-specific female cowbird lineages evolving larger eggs to deceit horneros from recognizing and ejecting their eggs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMolothrus bonariensis 3aantiparasitic agents 3acognition 3acolor 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahost specificity 3ahosts 3amales 3anests 3aparasites 3aparasitism 0aBrood parasitism 0aEgg ejection 0aEgg recognition 0aFurnarius rufus 0aMolothrus bonariensis1 aTassino, Bettina1 aReboreda, Juan Carlos0 tBehavioural processes.g2020 Sept., v. 178 p.104152-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2020.1041523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245009000196300001800286500002000304520162100324592002801945596006301973596006302036596006202099650001302161650001502174650002202189650001302211650002302224650001102247650000902258650002202267650001602289650001102305650000902316650001302325650002102338650001902359650001702378650001202395650002502407651001002432700005402442700005502496700005702551773011802608856007502726852000902801655001202810IND60786321020221122140510.0220803e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078632102DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.202102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9999-623610aHigh‐yield characteristics and root support of rain‐fed maize under film mulching  ap. 2115-2131.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFull ridge‐furrow plastic film‐mulching (FM) is an important drought‐resistant and high‐yield agricultural method employed in the Loess Plateau. The characteristics of FM, which are closely related to high‐efficiency resource utilization and root–shoot coordination of crops, may serve as references for yield increases in a broad range of farmland types. However, few studies have investigated this topic. A 2‐yr field study was conducted in the rain‐fed arid farmland of the Loess Plateau experimental station to investigate the canopy development and root support of FM maize (Zea mays L.). Our results showed that FM not only accelerated canopy growth in the vegetative phase and prolonged the reproductive phase but also promoted N and biomass accumulation in leaves after flowering. The leaf N concentration and biomass in FM maize increased by 6.2–24.7% and 16.9–29.3%, respectively, during R1 (silking)–R3 (milk) stage compared with the control. However, although the total root biomass decreased, and less RL (root length) and root surface area were distributed in deep soil, FM reduced the decline rate of RL and surface area during the R1–R3 period by 20.5 and 15.2% in topsoil, respectively, compared to the control. Moreover, FM significantly increased the root efficiency of leaf nitrogen (REN) absorption by 66.7–84.6% at the R1 stage and increased the water use efficiency (WUE) of grain yield by 20.3–69.4%. In conclusion, maize plants under FM had strengthened photosynthetic organs with high efficiency and long‐lasting root support in a prolonged reproductive phase.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0201801cNational Key Research and Development Plan  a2017YFD0201807cNational Key Research and Development Plan  a2015CB150402cMinistry of Science and Technology of China 3aZea mays 3aabsorption 3aagricultural land 3aagronomy 3abiomass production 3acanopy 3acorn 3adrought tolerance 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3amilk 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphotosynthesis 3asurface area 3atopsoil 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aMeng, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1595-394X1 aLi, Shiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6886-76371 aYue, Shanchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8724-29740 tAgronomy journal.g2020 May, v. 112, no. 3 p.2115-2131dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.202103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245012300213300001600336520177400352592002802126650001402154650002002168650002302188650002502211650001902236650001302255650004402268650000902312650001902321650002102340650002202361653002402383653001502407653001802422653002202440653001502462700002202477700002302499700006302522700002602585773014002611856008502751852000902836655001202845IND60766133420221117081558.0220307e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076613342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2022.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinteguiaga, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3177-727210aNew C9-polyacetylenes from the essential oil of the highly endangered species Baccharis palustris Heering (Asteraceae)  ap. 106-113.  aThe essential oil composition of the aerial parts from Baccharis palustris Heering (Asteraceae), a highly endangered species, was analyzed by GC/qMS, GC/HRMS-TOF, FT-IR, UV–vis and NMR spectroscopy using 1D and 2D techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the essential oil composition of B. palustris, as well as the first phytochemical study on this plant species. The volatile extracts were obtained from different phenologicals stages of plant, at flowering stage (FS) and vegetative stage (VS), where 51 components were identified accounting for 96.3 % and 99.0 % of the oil, respectively. The oil was rich in polyacetylene compounds (> 75 %), being the main components identified the new natural C₉-polyacetylenes 1-nonene-3,5-diyne (1, here named as baccharisdiyne) (52.7–65.0 %), 1,7(Z)-nonadiene-3,5-diyne [2, 7(Z)-dehydro-baccharisdiyne] (14.4–17.8 %), and 1,7(E)-nonadiene-3,5-diyne [3, 7(E)-dehydro-baccharisdiyne] (1.5–2.4 %). In addition, the known polyacetylenic compounds (Z)-lachnophyllum acid methyl ester (4) (4.3–5.3 %) and (E)-lachnophyllum acid methyl ester (5) (0.2 %) were also identified. Moreover, GC/qMS analysis allowed the identification of other 46 components in the essential oil samples, mainly mono- and sesquiterpenoids. In B. palustris, C₉-polyacetylenes probably derive biogenetically from a C₁₀ precursor: baccharisdiyne (1) would be derived from either or both lachnophyllum methyl ester geometric isomers (4 or 5), by enzymatic hydrolysis followed by decarboxylation. Dehydro-baccharisdiynes (2 and 3) could be produced by a similar pathway starting from the corresponding matricaria acid methyl ester isomers, one of which was tentatively identified at trace-level in B. palustris essential oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaccharis 3adecarboxylation 3aendangered species 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aessential oils 3ageometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3apolyacetylenes 3asesquiterpenoids 3avegetative growth 0aBaccharis palustris 0aAsteraceae 0aEssential oil 0aC9-polyacetylenes 0aBiogenesis1 aUmpierrez, Noelia1 aGonzalez, Andrés,1 aDellacassa, Eduardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4764-42121 aCatalán, César A.N.0 tPhytochemistry letters.g2022 Apr., v. 48 p.106-113dElsevier LtdaPhytochemical Society of EuropewJournal:J000000131x1874-39007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytol.2022.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006700146245017200213300001800385500001900403520143200422592002801854650001501882650001401897650002301911650001301934650001601947650001901963650001901982650001202001650001302013700005602026700005702082700006102139773017002200856008002370852000902450655001202459IND60740931620221119053015.0210609e20210526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074093162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c013762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBashir, Muhammad Sohail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2975-654410aPorous Polyurea Supported Pd Catalyst: Easy Preparation, Full Characterization, and High Activity and Reusability in Reduction of Hexavalent Chromium in Aqueous System  ap. 8108-8119.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeveloping efficient supports for transition-metal nanoparticles (M-NPs) to prevent their agglomeration and to facilitate their handling and recycled use has been a constant objective. Herein, porous polyurea (PPU) is prepared by simple precipitation polymerization of toluene diisocyanate through its reaction with water in water–acetone, followed by Pd(OAc)₂ immobilization on a PPU surface to get Pd(OAc)₂@PPU and by Pd(OAc)₂ reduction to get a hybrid composite Pd@PPU with Pd-NPs on a PPU surface. Multiple characterizations revealed that the porous structure of PPU was retained in Pd(OAc)₂@PPU and Pd@PPU. Pd NPs were well dispersed on the Pd@PPU surface with a mean diameter of 7.18 nm. Pd@PPU was used as catalyst for reduction of toxic hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) to benign trivalent chromium with formic acid as the reducer. A higher catalytic performance was detected compared to that of reported heterogeneous catalysts under similar conditions. A slight decrease in catalytic activity was detected in recycled use of the catalyst, which is ascribed to CO poisoning, a byproduct in formic acid decomposition. Full regeneration was obtained by heating the catalyst under N₂ atmosphere for 2 h at 180 °C. This work provides therefore a novel approach for the preparation of a Pd@PPU catalyst of high performance for Cr(VI) reduction, featured by low cost, facile synthesis, easy handling, and reusability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achromium 3aformic acid 3apolymerization 3aprocess design 3atoluene 3atoxicity1 aJiang, Xubao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4099-99261 aYang, Xingjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5371-88661 aKong, Xiang Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1725-46190 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 May 26, v. 60, no. 22 p.8108-8119dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c013763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006400172520108700236592002801323650003101351650001501382650001401397650001201411650001901423650002401442650002601466650001601492650002201508650001101530650001701541650004401558650002801602650001401630650001601644650001601660650001501676653001601691653001301707653001801720653000901738653002301747653002901770700002501799700002301824700002501847700002101872700001901893700002101912700002001933700002201953700006001975773011102035856008602146852000902232655001202241IND60684244920221120145223.0200427e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068424492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1090682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Khawand, Toni10aResveratrol transformation in red wine after heat treatment  aResveratrol is a well-known wine constituent. Its concentration can vary according to the cultivar choice and the winemaking process. Due to its phenolic structure, resveratrol could be transformed under high temperature or oxidative conditions, leading to the formation of various derivatives including oligomers. Hence, the goal of this study is to investigate the presence of these derivatives in wine. In the first stage, hemisynthesis of oligomeric stilbenes was achieved from resveratrol in ethanol by oxidative coupling using metals. Four de novo synthetized resveratrol derivatives were identified by MS and NMR spectroscopy including two new molecules, oxistilbenin F and oxistilbenin G. In the second stage, analysis of red wine after heat treatment by LC-MS confirmed the presence of some of these compounds in wine. Finally, the anti-inflammatory effects of the compounds were evaluated by studying their ability to prevent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced upregulation of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acell lines 3acultivars 3aethanol 3aheat treatment 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliquid chromatography 3amacrophages 3amass spectrometry 3ametals 3anitric oxide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areactive oxygen species 3ared wines 3aresveratrol 3atemperature 3awinemaking 0aResveratrol 0aStilbene 0aHemisynthesis 0aWine 0aOxidative coupling 0aAnti-inflammatory effect1 aValls Fonayet, Josep1 aDa Costa, Grégory1 aHornedo-Ortega, Ruth1 aJourdes, Michael1 aFranc, Céline1 ade Revel, Gilles1 aDecendit, Alain1 aKrisa, Stéphanie1 aRichard, Tristan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5308-86970 tFood research international.g2020 June, v. 132 p.109068-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1090683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003500149245010300184520147900287592002801766650001501794650001801809650001301827650001401840650000901854650002501863650001001888650001701898650002001915650001201935650001301947650001301960650001501973650001301988650001502001650001302016650001802029653002302047653002502070653003102095653001502126653002602141700003602167700003502203700003602238700001902274700003202293700003002325773010602355856008402461852000902545655001202554IND60766133720221117081934.0220719e20220330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076613372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2022.1044972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sá Schiavo Matias, Gustavo10aProteomic profile of extracellular matrix from native and decellularized chorionic canine placenta  aPlacental plasticity, employing rapid growth and remodeling to supply the growing fetus, is majorly related to its extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Thus, we studied the proteome profiled of canine native and decellularized placenta to characterize the proteome related to maintenance of a microenvironment and structure suitable for tissue engineering applications. Protein was profiled from native (n=3) and decellularized (n=3) 35-days old canine placenta using the mass spectrometer Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. A total of 52 proteins were filtered and revealed ontologies connected to skeleton structuration, collagen processing, germ layers formation, cell adhesion, response to amino acids, and others. Also, the major enriched pathways were ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, protein digestion and absorption. Aside, proteins related to structure (collagens), cell adhesion (laminin and fibronectin), ECM remodeling (MMP2 and TIMP3) and vascularization (VEGF and RLN) were present in decellularized condition. Our findings support the requirement of a proteomic profile to visualize the maintenance of essential protein groups for ECM structuring and physiology, that should support functions related to cell adhesion, vasculogenesis and as a reservoir of soluble molecules. Altogether, the 35-days old decellularized canine placenta can provide an adequate microenvironment for cell anchoring for further regenerative medicine application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acell adhesion 3acollagen 3adigestion 3adogs 3aextracellular matrix 3afetus 3afibronectins 3afocal adhesions 3alaminin 3amedicine 3aplacenta 3aplasticity 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3askeleton 3aspectrometers 0aTissue biomaterial 0aExtracellular matrix 0aEndotheliochorial placenta 0aProteomics 0aRegenerative medicine1 ada Silva Nunes Barreto, Rodrigo1 aCarreira, Ana Claudia Oliveira1 aJunior, Milton Yutaka Nishiyama1 aFratini, Paula1 aFerreira, Christina Ramires1 aMiglino, Maria Angélica,0 tJournal of proteomics.g2022 Mar. 30, v. 256 p.104497-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2022.1044973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010400158300001800262500002000280520106100300592002801361596006801389650002501457650001301482650001001495650002201505650001601527650001401543650001801557650001701575700006001592700002601652773011801678856007501796852000901871655001201880IND60786321320221122140506.0220803e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078632132DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.201512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlivo, Mateus10aCombining ability and heterosis in a diallel cross of safflower under Brazilian tropical conditions  ap. 1580-1588.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSafflower (Carthamus tinctorius) can become an important crop in Brazilian tropical conditions. Combining ability and heterosis of safflower were studied in a five‐by‐five diallel cross from 2013 to 2015 to determine the nature of gene action. The results indicated significant differences among parents for general and specific combining abilities, except for a number of branches. For plant height, grain yield, number of grains per plant, number of grains per capitulum, and oil content, the contribution of the specific combining ability in the genetic variation was observed in the progenies, showing evidence of nonadditive genetic actions. The results of this study showed that best cross for oil content was PI572450 × PI572470 (27%) with gain over genitors. Combination PI537697 × PI653152 presented promising results for increase grain yield. These superior genotypes could be used in recombination breeding programs to accumulate suitable genes responsible for improving grain yield and oil content under the Brazilian tropical conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aagronomy 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3aheterosis 3alipid content 3aplant height1 aBassegio, Doglas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6628-85941 aZanotto, Maurício D.0 tAgronomy journal.g2020 May, v. 112, no. 3 p.1580-1588dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.201513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04279naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245009300172520238400265592002802649650003002677650002502707650001202732650001702744650001702761650001702778650001802795650002802813650001602841650002402857650001602881650001302897650001102910653000802921653000802929653000902937653000802946653000702954653000702961653000902968653000602977653000702983653000702990653000702997653000803004653000903012653000703021653000803028653001003036653000703046653000803053653000803061653000903069653000803078653000603086653000703092653000803099653000803107653000703115653000803122653002603130653002703156653002103183653002103204653003103225700002003256700001703276773011803293856008903411852000903500655001203509IND60696665620221118114606.0200913e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069666562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.1145232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRandby, Å.T.10aLosses and grass silage quality in bunker silos compacted by tractor versus wheel loader  aThe study aimed to explore whether an increase in bunker silage density obtained by turning to a heavier packing machine than a farm size tractor would reduce losses and improve grass silage quality and aerobic stability. At each of three harvests, two bunkers were packed with either a 14.5 t wheel loader (WL) or an 8.3 t tractor (T). For comparison with the bunker silages, silage was produced simultaneously in round bales with high and low chamber pressure and wrapped immediately or after delay, and in laboratory silos.Compaction with WL increased silage dry matter (DM) density by 9 % compared with T, from 204 to 222 kg DM/m³. On average for three harvests, DM recovered as silage, or lost, was almost identical for the two packing treatments, with 870 g/kg of harvested DM recovered as feed offered to animals, 55 g/kg as wasted silage, and 75 g/kg as invisible losses due to respiration, effluent, fermentation and aerobic deterioration. However, in the harvest with lowest crop DM content, 266 g/kg, invisible DM losses with WL exceeded losses with T by 46 g/kg, of which the main portion was assumed to be caused by more effluent squeezed out by the WL. In the harvest with highest crop DM, 332 g/kg, invisible DM losses with T exceeded losses with WL by 43 g/kg, of which the main portion was assumed to be caused by poorer compaction with T, and therefore higher respiration and aerobic deterioration losses. Wasted silage DM was lower in bales than in bunkers (P = 0.004). The proportion of offered silage DM from poorly compacted bales sealed after delay (867 g/kg) was similar to that of bunkers, whereas the proportion of offered silage DM from well compacted and immediately sealed bales (963 g/kg) was similar to that of laboratory silos.Significant increases in protein bound in the neutral detergent and acid detergent fiber fractions were found in bales sealed after delay where temperatures had rised to 47 °C at wrapping. Similar levels of fiber bound protein were found in bunker silage, suggesting that they were also heated during filling. Spot samples from bunker silo shoulders were more infected by yeasts, moulds and Clostridium tyrobutyricum than samples from mid in bunkers and from bales. No differences in losses, silage composition or aerobic stability were observed between bunker silo packing with WL or T on average over three harvests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium tyrobutyricum 3aacid detergent fiber 3aanimals 3abunker silos 3afeed quality 3agrass silage 3amolds (fungi) 3aneutral detergent fiber 3around bales 3asilage fermentation 3atemperature 3atractors 3ayeasts 0aAAT 0aADF 0aADIP 0aADL 0aCP 0aDM 0aDOMD 0aH 0aIP 0aLA 0aME 0aNDF 0aNDIP 0aNE 0aNEL 0aNH3-N 0aOM 0aOMD 0aPBV 0aSDMI 0aSEM 0aT 0aTP 0aVFA 0aVOS 0aWL 0aWSC 0aBunker silage density 0aPacking vehicle weight 0aInvisible losses 0aPlastic covering 0aClostridium tyrobutyricum.1 aHalvorsen, H.N.1 aBakken, A.K.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2020 Aug., v. 266 p.114523-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.1145233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002200157245013400179300001800313520166900331592002802000650002802028650003602056650001302092650001602105650001602121650001702137650001802154650003102172650001402203650001402217650002002231650001402251650001102265650001402276650002402290650002102314650003702335650001802372650001102390650001302401700002402414700001802438700002002456700002902476700001802505700002602523773009902549856009102648990002302739852000902762655001202771IND60098796820221119191645.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009879682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.08.1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsakiri, Eleni N.10aDiet-derived advanced glycation end products or lipofuscin disrupts proteostasis and reduces life span in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 1155-1163.  aAdvanced glycation end product (AGE)-modified proteins are formed by the nonenzymatic glycation of free amino groups of proteins and, along with lipofuscin (a highly oxidized aggregate of covalently cross-linked proteins, sugars, and lipids), have been found to accumulate during aging and in several age-related diseases. As the in vivo effects of diet-derived AGEs or lipofuscin remain elusive, we sought to study the impact of oral administration of glucose-, fructose-, or ribose-modified albumin or of artificial lipofuscin in a genetically tractable model organism. We report herein that continuous feeding of young Drosophila flies with culture medium enriched in AGEs or in lipofuscin resulted in reduced locomotor performance and in accelerated rates of AGE-modified proteins and carbonylated proteins accumulation in the somatic tissues and hemolymph of flies, as well as in a significant reduction of flies health span and life span. These phenotypic effects were accompanied by reduced proteasome peptidase activities in both the hemolymph and the somatic tissues of flies and higher levels of oxidative stress; furthermore, oral administration of AGEs or lipofuscin in flies triggered an upregulation of the lysosomal cathepsin B, L activities. Finally, RNAi-mediated cathepsin D knockdown reduced flies longevity and significantly augmented the deleterious effects of AGEs and lipofuscin, indicating that lysosomal cathepsins reduce the toxicity of diet-derived AGEs or lipofuscin. Our in vivo studies demonstrate that chronic ingestion of AGEs or lipofuscin disrupts proteostasis and accelerates the functional decline that occurs with normal aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aalbumins 3acathepsin B 3acathepsin D 3acrosslinking 3aculture media 3agene expression regulation 3aglycation 3ahemolymph 3ain vivo studies 3aingestion 3alipids 3alongevity 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3asomatic cells 3asugars 3atoxicity1 aIliaki, Kalliopi K.1 aHöhn, Annika1 aGrimm, Stefanie1 aPapassideri, Issidora S.1 aGrune, Tilman1 aTrougakos, Ioannis P.0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2013 Dec., v. 65 p.1155-1163dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.08.1863Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009500167300001600262520114900278592002801427650001201455650001901467650002501486650001301511650001101524650001701535650001501552651001001567651001001577651001301587651001501600651001001615653001501625653001801640653002001658653002601678653001901704653001001723773012101733856005101854852000901905655001201914IND50087330020221122235933.0140412e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008733002DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2011.5770372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwain, Ashok10aChallenges for water sharing in the Nile basin: changing geo-politics and changing climate  ap. 687-702.  aFor most of the 20th century, the Nile River has been the source of political tensions and low-intensity conflicts among three of its major riparian countries (Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt). However, since the late 1990s, the Nile basin countries—with the encouragement and support of the international community—have made some attempts to establish basin-wide cooperative institutions. This process of engagement and collaboration is presently under severe stress due to increasing demand and decreasing supply of water resources in the basin. This situation may be complicated further by the global climate change, which is anticipated to result in long-term changes in the volume and pattern of runoff in the Nile River system. Moreover, the emergence of China as a major player in the power politics of the Nile basin has facilitated a number of unilateral initiatives for large-scale water development projects. In this context, this paper critically examines the survival and sustainability of water cooperation endeavours in the Nile basin as the river faces challenges from the global climate change and shifting regional geo-politics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adevelopment projects 3apolitics 3arunoff 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aEgypt 3aEthiopia 3aNile River 3aSudan 0aNile River 0awater sharing 0awater conflicts 0aNile Basin Initiative 0aclimate change 0aChina0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2011 June 1, v. 56, no. 4 p.687-702dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2011.577037  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245006100162300001400223500001900237520110000256592002801356650001601384650001101400650002001411650001601431650001601447650001101463650001501474650002001489650001101509653001101520653001201531700001401543700002001557700001701577700001701594700001701611773015601628856008201784852000901866655001201875IND60716766020221122025931.0201107e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071676602DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.v36i02.79492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, S.10aRole of niacin supplementation in dairy cattle: A review  ap. 93-99.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNiacin (Vitamin B₃) is significantly important for the metabolism of animals and human beings due to its incorporation into the coenzymes NAD and NADP. For dairy cows, the microbial synthesis of niacin in the rumen is an important source besides its availability from feed and endogenous formation. This vitamin is involved in various energy-yielding pathways and for synthesis of amino acid and fatty acid; for which it is important for milk production. Supplementation of niacin has beneficial effects on growth of cattle. The production performance of dairy cows fed with niacin at 6g/day may not be satisfactory, but supplementation of 12g of niacin per head per day can increase milk production by about 1lb. An optimistic return on asset is possible if the supplementation is limited to high producing early lactation cows. Supplementing the dairy animals with a dose of 6-12g of niacin will not only protect them from various metabolic diseases but will also help them defend from severe heat stress; ultimately leading to augmentation of their health, production potential and economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aassets 3aearly lactation 3afatty acids 3aheat stress 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3amilk production 3aniacin 0aGrowth 0aKetosis1 aPanda, N.1 aPanigrahy, K.K.1 aGupta, S.

In this paper, we provide a historical and social analysis of categories used to define soil management practices and farmers by agricultural programmes in colonial and post-colonial Kenya. For this purpose, we have conducted archive research, recorded the social memory of agricultural policies and farming techniques, and examined contemporary conceptual frameworks and institutional networks around CA in Ethi and Umande in Laikipia County, Central Kenya. We identified evidence of historical continuity in the strategies and methods of agricultural promotional practices. CA networks have broadly advertised the advantages of CA as a means to revert soil degradation and improve livelihoods. However, farmer categorizations based on engagement with CA, promotional strategies, and unclear operational definitions have all prevented CA from being understood by farmers as a technological farming proposal. Instead its adoption is linked with social status and occasional free access to agricultural inputs. Additionally, information about the potential risks and limitations of CA should be explicitly made available to farmers in Laikipia in order to promote transparency and informed decision-making.  aThis work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (Portugal): [Grant Number UIDP/50012/2020]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (Portugal): [Grant Number CEECIND/04424/2017]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia through the ERAfrica programme: [Grant Number ERA-AFR/0001/2013].  aPublisher supplied data  aUIDP/50012/2020  aCEECIND/04424/2017  aERA-AFR/0001/2013 3aagricultural conservation practice 3adecision making 3afarmers 3amemory 3asocioeconomic status 3asoil degradation 3asoil fertility 3asoil management 3asustainable agriculture 3aKenya 0aConservation agriculture 0asmallholders 0atechnology 0aagrarian history1 aRodrigues, Paulo1 aBasch, Gottlieb0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2020 Nov. 1, v. 18, no. 6 p.554-566dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2020.17981793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245009500180300001600275520089100291592002801182650001901210650001301229650001901242650001601261650001701277650001601294650001001310650002501320650001901345650000901364650001201373651001101385651001001396651001401406653002501420653001801445653002301463653002901486700003501515700001801550700001501568773010501583856008401688852000901772655001201781IND60123547320221118132842.0150325e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012354732DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2013.8434852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Tzong-Ru (Jiun-Shen)10aRice-Buying Behavior of Chinese People in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada  ap. 193-212.  aThis study investigates rice-buying behavior in Chinese people living in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada and suggests marketing strategies for rice products.

For China-Chinese consumers, we suggest that the rice marketing mix should focus on higher quality, fair price, extra healthfulness, wide distribution channels, and food safety guarantees during promotion. For China-English consumers, the marketing mix should ensure that rice products contain clear educational instructions and also focus on stable price, convenience of locations, and sufficient communication with consumers during promotion.

A central assumption of common oxygen-based approaches is that oxygen consumption rates (primarily respiration) are similar under light and dark conditions. Evaluating this assumption is critical, especially in benthic-dominated systems, because differences between daytime and nighttime respiration could result in underestimation or overestimation of ecosystem productivity. We evaluated rates of gross oxygen production over hourly to seasonal time scales in a shallow, temperate salt marsh pond. To assess whether a dissolved oxygen diel mass balance underestimated gross oxygen productivity, we compared rates using this traditional approach and using the triple oxygen isotope tracer of photosynthesis. This is a powerful combination because the triple oxygen isotope approach is theoretically insensitive to respiration. The methods agreed well over daily to seasonal time scales. However, during midday periods of peak light and productivity, the triple oxygen isotope approach resulted in higher hourly scale gross oxygen production rates. The timing and magnitude of this short-term difference is consistent with light-dependent oxygen uptake fluxes including photoreduction and/or light-stimulated community respiration. Finally, aquatic vegetation was associated with variability in productivity across the pond. Such small-scale environmental heterogeneity is evidence that this shallow pond was not laterally well mixed, and likely contributes to the dynamism of these common estuarine environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic plants 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aoxygen isotopes 3aoxygen production 3aphotoreduction 3aphotosynthesis 3asalt marshes1 aSpivak, Amanda C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6743-07831 aKarolewski, Jennifer S.1 aGosselin, Kelsey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9327-89541 aSandwith, Zoe O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9952-95261 aManning, Cara C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4984-50931 aStanley, Rachel H.

A facile precipitation–deposition approach has been chosen to deposit Pt–Ni nanoparticles on bimodel porous MgAl₂O₄, synthesized by a template-assisted solvothermal method. These newly developed materials are used successfully for steam reforming of glycerol for syngas production. The MgAl₂O₄ was prepared with different MgO contents between 10 and 30 wt % with a constant Pt (1 wt %) and Ni (5 wt %). All the synthesized materials were characterized in detail to elucidate their physicochemical properties, morphologies, and surface properties via N₂ sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and temperature programmed desorption (CO₂-TPD) techniques. The catalyst containing 30 wt % MgO produced a syngas ratio of ∼3 and a minimal amount of CO₂ at 850 °C. The influence of all major parameters was evaluated to maximize the catalyst performance, such as reaction temperature, feed rate, space–time, and feed molar ratios. The catalyst exhibited a high activity with a conversion of glycerol close to unity, and the catalysts were found to be stable in glycerol reforming at high temperatures. To understand the catalyst deactivation, spent catalysts have been further examined through XRD, TEM, XPS, and TGA/DTA analysis. The analysis of the used catalyst confirms the high framework stability, low amount of carbonaceous deposits, and high resistance to metal oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen 3amethanol 3aoxidation 3asorption 3aspace and time 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSingh, Lovjeet1 aGahtori, Jyoti1 aTucker, Chelesea1 aKumar, Arun1 aVan Steen, E.q(Eric),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4659-85221 aBordoloi, Ankur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6792-43770 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 35, no. 6 p.5217-5230dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c039543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010600170300001800276500001900294520144300313592002801756650001601784650001101800650001601811650001301827650001701840650001701857650002601874650001401900650001701914650001601931650003001947650002001977650001501997650001102012650001602023653001902039653001902058653002802077700001502105700001502120700001402135700001202149700001502161700001502176773013702191856008702328852000902415655001202424IND60710712620221120144410.0201111e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071071262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.2552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Mingxiao10aMarine polysaccharides from Gelidium pacificum Okamura and Cereus sinensis reveal prebiotic functions  ap. 4381-4390.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany marine polysaccharides as prebiotics can promote host health by modulating gut microbiota. This study investigated the beneficial effects of purified marine plant-derived Gelidium pacificum Okamura polysaccharide (GPOP-1) and marine animal-derived Cereus sinensis polysaccharide (CSP-1) on normal mice by modulating gut microbiota. The composition and diversity of gut microbiota were evaluated using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that GPOP-1 and CSP-1 altered the composition of the gut microbiota and promoted the growth of beneficial bacteria. At the genus level, GPOP-1 increased the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, and decreased the relative abundance of Ruminococcus, Helicobacter, Allobaculum, Dorea and AF12. While CSP-1 increased the relative abundance of Coprococcus, Adlercreutzia, Roseburia, Phascolarctobacterium, and decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira. The changes in the gut microbiota may affect the body weight, immune organ index and the production of short-chain fatty acids in normal mice. Compared to the normal control group, GPOP-1 decreased average weight gain while CSP-1 increased average weight gain. Furthermore, both GPOP-1 and CSP-1 significantly increased thymus and spleen indexes and total short chain fatty acids production in mice. In summary, GPOP-1 and CSP-1 exerted prebiotic effects on normal mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aCereus 3aCoprococcus 3aGelidium 3aHelicobacter 3aOscillospira 3aPhascolarctobacterium 3aRoseburia 3aRuminococcus 3abody weight 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apolysaccharides 3aprebiotics 3aspleen 3aweight gain 0aPolysaccharide 0aGut microbiota 0aShort-chain fatty acids1 aZhang, Min1 aWu, Junwen1 aHan, Ping1 aLv, Min1 aDong, Ling1 aLiu, Kehai0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.4381-4390dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.2553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245005600179300001600235500001900251520123300270536013301503592002801636650001601664650001901680650002001699650001201719650001201731650001501743650000901758650002601767650002801793653002001821653002301841653001701864653003301881653003001914700002501944700002001969773015001989856008502139852000902224655001202233IND60718036620221118024806.0201118e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071803662DNAL7 a10.1080/14735903.2020.18073012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManalo, Jaime Albarillo10aRice farmers adapting to drought in the Philippines  ap. 594-605.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDrought, which is expected to occur more frequently under the climate change regime, is a major challenge in rice cultivation. This paper aims to unpack the decision-making processes of rice farmers when faced with drought. The study was conducted in two drought-prone rice-farming communities in the Philippines, with 87 rice farmers as the main participants. A range of qualitative methods including in-depth interviews, focus groups, and windshield surveys were used to collect data. The study combined insights from Protection Motivation Theory and the Social Identity Approach in interpreting the findings. Past experiences of farmers of natural disasters influence their perception that drought is real and that they should take action. Farmers employ adaptive mechanisms that they have easy access to. If there are issues securing an adaptive mechanism, decision-making gravitates around farmers’ commitment to their social identity as rice farmers. Those who are strongly committed to their rice farmer identity will find ways to continue cultivating rice no matter what. Those who are not strongly committed to their identity as rice farmers may leave rice farming if they find it to be infeasible because of drought.  aThis research was funded by the University of Queensland Research Training Programme and the Philippine Rice Research Institute.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilippines 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3adrought 3afarmers 3amotivation 3arice 3asocial identification 3asustainable agriculture 0aSocial identity 0adrought adaptation 0arice farmers 0aProtection Motivation Theory 0adecision-making processes1 avan de Fliert, Elske1 aFielding, Kelly0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2020 Nov. 1, v. 18, no. 6 p.594-605dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2020.18073013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015700163300002000320520141200340592002801752650002201780650001601802650002001818650001201838650001901850650001301869650001801882650001701900650001101917650002501928650001301953650001501966650002501981650002002006650002302026653002702049653001702076653001602093653002302109653004302132700002202175700001402197700001802211700005502229773014202284856007802426852000902504655001202513IND60639205820221120040543.0190501e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063920582DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b018452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Youngjin10aHierarchically Porous Composite Scaffold Composed of SBA-15 Microrods and Reduced Graphene Oxide Functionalized with Cyclodextrin for Water Purification  ap. 15764-15772.  aLarge-scale decontamination of bisphenol A (BPA) from wastewater under field conditions is an urgent need because of the harmful toxic effects of BPA on living organisms. In this study, we report the fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous composite scaffold composed of mesoporous SBA-15 silica microrods and reduced graphene oxide (rGO-CD) functionalized with β-cyclodextrin (CD) and its application for BPA separation from contaminated water. The macroporous structure was achieved by sacrificial salt leaching, and the mesoporous structure was derived from the interparticle pores between compressed SBA-15 particles and intrinsic mesopores in SBA-15. The 3D hierarchical macroporous and mesoporous architecture of the scaffold enhances mass transport without any external forces, and the rGO-CD component provides good capture sites for BPA in solution via inclusion complexation between CD and BPA. The inorganic SBA-15 component of the scaffold also allows long-term operation of filters by increasing the mechanical strength of the scaffold. The hierarchically porous SBA-15/rGO-CD composite scaffold could separate BPA from contaminated water significantly better than the scaffold without rGO-CD in both batch and filter systems. Our study indicates that the functional hierarchically porous composite scaffold can be a potential material in wastewater treatment technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abisphenol A 3adecontamination 3afilters 3agraphene oxide 3aleaching 3amass transfer 3aporous media 3asilica 3astrength (mechanics) 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awater purification 0areduced graphene oxide 0acyclodextrin 0abisphenol A 0awater purification 0amacroporous mesoporous silica scaffold1 aSinha, Arjyabaran1 aIm, Jihye1 aJung, Hooyeon1 aKim, Jaeyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4687-67320 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 11, no. 17 p.15764-15772dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b018453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001700171245013100188300001800319520095000337592002801287650001501315650002201330650001401352650001401366650001001380650001201390650001101402650001501413650002301428650001901451650001501470650002501485650001301510650002301523650001901546650004201565650003201607651001001639651001001649653002001659653002301679653001301702653001901715653001301734700001401747700001601761700001401777700001801791700001601809773011101825856008701936852000902023655001202032IND50060283020221121012023.0190402e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006028302DNAL7 a231945552pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.09.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zengdi10aAdsorption kinetics, thermodynamics and isotherm of Hg(II) from aqueous solutions using buckwheat hulls from Jiaodong of China  ap. 1508-1514.  aThe adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms of buckwheat hulls in the region of Jiaodong, China (BHJC) for Hg(II) were investigated. Results revealed that the adsorption kinetics of BHJC for Hg(II) were well described by a pseudo second-order reaction model, and the adsorption thermodynamic parameters ΔG, ΔH and ΔS were –5.83kJmol−1(35°C), 73.1, and 256JK−1mol−1, respectively. Moreover, Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich–Peterson isotherm models were applied to analyse the experimental data and to predict the relevant isotherm parameters. The best interpretation for the experimental data was given by the Langmuir isotherm equation, and the maximum adsorption capacity for Hg(II) is 243.90mg/g at 35°C. Furthermore, investigation of the adsorption selectivity showed that BHJC displayed strong affinity for mercury in the aqueous solutions and exhibited 100% selectivity for mercury in the presence of Zn(II) and Cd(II).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abuckwheat 3aequations 3ahulls 3amercury 3amodels 3aprediction 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics 2aAdsorption 2aFagopyrumxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aMercuryxchemistry 2aThermodynamics 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 2aWater Purificationxmethods 3aChina 0aChina 0aBuckwheat hulls 0aMercury adsorption 0aKinetics 0aThermodynamics 0aIsotherm1 aYin, Ping1 aQu, Rongjun1 aChen, Hou1 aWang, Chunhua1 aRen, Shuhua0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Feb. 01, v. 136, no. 3-4 p.1508-1514dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.09.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012000172300001800292500001900310520202100329592002802350650002102378650001502399650001502414650001102429650001502440650001102455650001402466650001602480650001202496700005902508700002002567700002502587700001902612773011902631856008702750852000902837655001202846IND60731234720210419000000.0210318e20210306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073123472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c039592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolimann, Téo10aSuitability of Thermal Swing Adsorption for the Treatment of Siloxanes and Toluene in Biogas: An Experimental Study  ap. 4954-4965.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe use of biogas has been proven to be an interesting alternative energy source. However, biogas usually contains trace compounds, which can lead to damage in the valorization installation. Consequently, their treatment is an important issue for the suitability of biogas valorization. Although thermal swing adsorption (TSA) has already been implemented, there is still a lack of knowledge about the deactivation of the adsorbent. This work examined under dynamic conditions, the treatment of three typical trace compounds from landfills (L2, D4, and toluene) via the TSA process using activated carbon cloth (ACC). The process was implemented according to temperature programs: one with a moderate desorption temperature (180 °C) and the other with a high desorption temperature (220 °C). Both experiments involved several cycles of adsorption and desorption (60 cycles). In the single-compound adsorption experiment, the adsorption capacities were 24%, 19%, and greater than 15% weight basis for toluene, L2, and D4, respectively. From TSA experiments, it was found that the adsorption capacities of the ACC decreased rapidly over the first four cycles for the two temperature programs. This decrease was lower at high temperatures: no significant decrease was found between the 4th cycle and the 50th cycle. On the contrary, a constant decrease was measured at moderate temperatures. Both the surface analysis (infrared measure) and the analysis of the gas from the desorption step indicate that siloxanes were deposited on the ACC and polymerized to a high-molecular-weight polymer. This reaction could cause ACC deactivation by pore clogging. Mass balances and gas analysis also suggested that toluene could be thermally degraded during the desorption step. The high temperatures promoted desorption of high-molecular-weight compounds, such as D5, L5, and D6, formed during adsorption/desorption processes. Thus, a high-temperature program was found to be more effective than a moderate-temperature program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiogas 3adesorption 3aenergy 3asiloxanes 3atemperature 3atoluene1 aOndarts, Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0086-85311 aOutin, Jonathan1 aLe Pierrès, Nolwenn1 aGonze, Evelyne0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Mar. 06, v. 35, no. 6 p.4954-4965dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c039593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147242054800174245012400722300001600846520135400862592002802216650003502244650001602279650001302295650002402308650002002332650002302352651000902375700002802384773009402412856008102506852000902587655001202596IND50088944620221119060841.0150214e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008894462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-013-1089-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourtaghi, Zohre Sadat10aEvaluation de la potentialité des sources d’eau souterraine à partir d’un SIG et cartographie dans le district de Birjand, Sud de la province de Khorasan, Iran Evaluación del potencial de manantiales de agua subterránea basado en GIS y mapeo en el Birjand Township, sur de la provincia de Khorasan, Irán 伊朗Khorasan省南部Birjand镇基于GIS的地下水泉潜力评价和编图 Avaliação e mapeamento do potencial em nascentes de água subterrânea com base em SIG no município de Birjand, sul da Província de Khorasan, Irão10aGIS-based groundwater spring potential assessment and mapping in the Birjand Township, southern Khorasan Province, Iran  ap. 643-662.  aThree statistical models—frequency ratio (FR), weights-of-evidence (WofE) and logistic regression (LR)—produced groundwater-spring potential maps for the Birjand Township, southern Khorasan Province, Iran. In total, 304 springs were identified in a field survey and mapped in a geographic information system (GIS), out of which 212 spring locations were randomly selected to be modeled and the remaining 92 were used for the model evaluation. The effective factors—slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), slope length (LS), plan curvature, lithology, land use, and distance to river, road, fault—were derived from the spatial database. Using these effective factors, groundwater spring potential was calculated using the three models, and the results were plotted in ArcGIS. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn for spring potential maps and the area under the curve (AUC) was computed. The final results indicated that the FR model (AUC = 79.38 %) performed better than the WofE (AUC = 75.69 %) and LR (AUC = 63.71 %) models. Sensitivity and factor analyses concluded that the bivariate statistical index model (i.e. FR) can be used as a simple tool in the assessment of groundwater spring potential when a sufficient number of data are obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3aland use 3aregression analysis 3asprings (water) 3astatistical models 3aIran1 aPourghasemi, Hamid Reza0 tHydrogeology journal.g2014 May, v. 22, no. 3 p.643-662dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-013-1089-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245005100167300001600218500001900234520124500253536038601498592002801884596001001912650002601922650002701948650001501975650001001990650002802000650001702028650002602045650002202071650001602093650001802109650000902127650001802136653001802154653001502172653002602187700002202213700002002235700001802255773013502273856008502408852000902493655001202502IND60718036720221118024851.0201118e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071803672DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2020.17127402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHumar, Miha10aMonitoring a building made of CLT in Ljubljana  ap. 335-342.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe importance of renewable and environmentally acceptable materials in the construction industry is increasing. Wood is one of the most important construction materials and its use in building applications has further expanded in recent decades, mainly due to the development of modern composites, firstly glue lam, OSB (Oriented Strand Board), LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) and a considerable breakthrough was later achieved with the development of cross-laminated timber. In order to enable even more extensive and reliable use of wood in outdoor applications, factors affecting a wood’s service life need to be understood. It is well known that fungal degradation of wood is predominantly affected by temperature and wood moisture content. In order to elucidate the influence of these two factors, long-term monitoring of temperature, relative humidity and moisture content at the newly-built Annex of the Department of Wood Science and Technology was carried out. The Annex is designed from CLT composites and glue-lam beams and was finished in December 2015. The results clearly show that microclimatic conditions in the monitored building in the first years of use are far below the limit required for fungal decay or mould growth.  aThe authors acknowledge the support of the Slovenian Research Agency (Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS) within the framework of project L4-7547, program P4-0015 and the infrastructural centre (IC LES PST 0481-09).

Many patients with TNBC relapse quickly and commonly develop metastases. There are no individualized targeted adjuvant or induction treatments for TNBC, and the current treatments are highly toxic. Development of chemoprevention methods using natural products would be beneficial to patients at risk of TNBC. To investigate the inhibitory effect of blueberries on inflammation-induced TNBC and identify the mechanism underlying modulation of inflammatory proteins by blueberries, we induced a proinflammatory microenvironment by feeding female MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice a high fat western diet (W) with 5% whole blueberry powder (BB) and studied the effect on tumor formation and metastasis. We showed that mice fed a BB diet had significantly smaller tumors, less ulceration, and significantly less metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes than mice fed a W diet. In BB-fed mice, serum levels of specific antiinflammatory cytokines were increased and specific cytokine expression was also altered. Together, these results suggest that blueberries may inhibit TNBC and TNBC-related metastasis by reducing inflammation via specific cytokine-driven pathways and thus reduce tumor growth and metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern diets 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3ablueberries 3abreast neoplasms 3achemoprevention 3acytokines 3ainflammation 3alymph nodes 3ametastasis 3amice 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aproteins 3arelapse 3arisk 3atoxicity1 aAdams, Lynn1 aTakasaki, Ayano1 aChen, Shiuan0 tNutrition and cancer.g2014 Feb. 1, v. 66, no. 2 p.242-248dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2014.8633663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009300168300001800261500001900279520188900298592002802187650003702215650002102252650001502273650001202288650001502300650001102315650001902326650001302345650001902358650001102377650002102388650002302409650001602432650001402448650001202462650001602474700001502490700001202505700005602517773011902573856008702692852000902779655001202788IND60731234820221120162757.0210318e20210226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073123482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c039712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jinjin10aAdsorption of Low-Concentration VOCs on Modified Activated Carbons in a Humid Atmosphere  ap. 5090-5100.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA large amount of water vapor present in low-concentration organic exhaust gases severely inhibited the adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this paper, three coal-based activated carbon samples were prepared by heat treatment, sodium hydroxide impregnation, and ammonia solution impregnation and were analyzed by N₂ adsorption isotherm, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Boehm titration, and water and toluene adsorption isotherms. Besides, the low-concentration toluene adsorption performance of samples was investigated under different humidities, and the desorption activation energies (DAEs) of toluene and water on samples were estimated through temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. Furthermore, the effect of molecule polarity was investigated under 0 and 60 RH%. The results indicated that samples treated by heating (CAC-1) significantly improved the uptake of low-concentration toluene under humid conditions compared to samples modified by alkali impregnation, which is related to surface chemistry. The analysis confirmed that CAC-1 possessed more graphitic (C + N), enhancing the π–π interaction, and possessed lower acidic groups, reducing the bonding sites with water. The Yoon and Nelson (Y–N) model indicated that CAC-1 presented a higher diffusion rate of toluene than CAC under high humidity. TPD experiments further demonstrated that the CAC-1 had smaller DAE of water and larger DAE of toluene, suggesting a stronger hydrophobic and stronger interaction with toluene. In addition, the experiments demonstrated that CAC-1 had superior adsorption performance both for polar and weakly polar VOCs at high humidity, especially for weakly polar VOCs. These conclusions would help to emphasize that activated carbons after heat treatment have better selectivity in removing low-concentration VOCs from high-humid conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aheat treatment 3ahumidity 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3asodium hydroxide 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3atitration 3atoluene 3awater vapor1 aMa, Xiuwei1 aWu, Hao1 aYang, Linjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7302-43780 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Feb. 26, v. 35, no. 6 p.5090-5100dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c039713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012800165300001600293520200200309592002802311650001802339650002502357650001802382650001502400650001202415650000902427650001602436650001202452650002602464650001302490650002502503650000902528650001302537650001002550650000902560650001102569650001102580651001902591653002302610653001002633653002002643653001202663653001802675653001802693700002002711700002102731700001602752773014402768856008202912852000902994655001203003IND60519516120221121082750.0190803e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051951612DNAL7 a10.1017/S17421705150001132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJani, Arun D.10aWinter legume cover-crop root decomposition and N release dynamics under disking and roller-crimping termination approaches  ap. 214-229.  aSeveral approaches can be used to terminate legume cover crops in the spring prior to planting summer crops, but the effect that these methods have on decomposition and nitrogen (N) release dynamics of legume cover-crop roots is poorly understood. The main objectives of this study were to: (i) quantify decomposition and N release of roots from pea (Pisum sativum), clover (Trifolium incarnatum) and vetch (Vicia villosa Roth); (ii) determine if roots decompose and release N faster when cover crops are terminated by disking compared with roller-crimping; and (iii) determine if roots decompose and release N faster under higher soil inorganic N levels. Two field experiments were conducted in Goldsboro and Kinston, North Carolina in the summer of 2012. Cover crops at these sites were terminated in spring by disking or roller-crimping and planted to unirrigated corn. Air-dried roots placed in litterbags were buried in their corresponding cover-crop plots and in plots where cover crops had not been grown that had either synthetic N fertilizer added at burial or had no fertilizer addition. Root litterbags were collected over 16 weeks at both sites. Cover-crop plots terminated by disking had up to 117 and 49% higher soil inorganic N than roller-crimped plots in Goldsboro and Kinston, respectively. However, roots did not appear to contribute significantly to these increases, as measured root decomposition and N release was not affected by termination approach at either site. Roots decomposed rapidly at both sites, losing up to 65% of their original biomass within 4 weeks after burial. Root N release was also rapid at both sites, with vetch generally releasing N fastest and clover slowest. It was estimated that cover-crop roots supplied 47–62 and 19–33 kg N ha⁻¹ during the corn cycle in Goldsboro and Kinston, respectively. Our results indicate that under the warm, humid summer conditions of the Southeastern USA, legume cover-crop roots decompose and release N rapidly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aTrifolium incarnatum 3aVicia villosa 3aair drying 3abiomass 3acorn 3acover crops 3adiscing 3afield experimentation 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apeas 3aplanting 3aroots 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3aNorth Carolina 0alegume cover crops 0aroots 0aroller-crimping 0adisking 0adecomposition 0asoil nitrogen1 aGrossman, Julie1 aSmyth, Thomas J.1 aHu, Shuijin0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2016 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.214-229dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3649527x1742-17137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17421705150001133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245007500155300002000230500001500250520143800265592002801703650002301731650001001754650001401764650001201778650001201790650001301802650001301815650001301828650001701841653001701858700002101875700001801896773012301914856007502037852000902112655001202121IND60559000320170926000000.0161122e20131121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900032DNAL7 a10.1021/jp40894362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuchs, Anna10aSolvation and Association of 3:1 Electrolytes in N,N-Dimethylformamide  ap. 14468-14476.  a2019-12-06  aA detailed study has been made of the solvation and ion association of the trifluoromethanesulfonate (Tf–) salts of aluminum(III), scandium(III), and lanthanum(III) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 25 °C using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy over the frequency range of 0.1 ≲ ν/GHz ≤ 89. The spectra of all solutions exhibited either two (for ScTf₃ and LaTf₃) or three (for AlTf₃) relaxation processes, a dominant mode centered at ∼15 GHz due to the solvent and one or (for AlTf₃ solutions) two solute-related processes at lower frequencies (νₘₐₓ ≲ 2 GHz). Effective solvation numbers, Zᵢb, calculated from the solvent relaxation process indicated that all three cations were strongly solvated by DMF with Zᵢb⁰ values at infinite dilution in the order (Al³⁺ ≈ Sc³⁺ ≈ 10) < (La³⁺ ≈ 13), consistent with at least partial formation of a second solvation shell around each cation. One solute-related mode for each set of salt solutions was assigned to the rotational diffusion of solvent-shared ion pairs (SIPs) of 1:1 stoicheometry; the additional slower process for AlTf₃ solutions in DMF was attributed to the presence of double-solvent-separated IPs. The overall association constants at infinite dilution for the 1:1 IPs, KA°(MTf²⁺), were significant, but as expected from Debye–Hückel considerations, the KA values decreased rapidly with increasing solute concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphysical chemistry 3asalts 3alanthanum 3acations 3asolutes 3aaluminum 3asolvents 3ascandium 3aspectroscopy 0aelectrolytes1 aBuchner, Richard1 aHefter, Glenn0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Nov. 21, v. 117, no. 46 p.14468-14476dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp40894363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245003900157300001800196520132000214592002801534650002701562650001501589650002101604650002001625650003101645650001301676650001401689650002601703650002101729700002301750700001801773773012101791856007401912852000901986655001201995IND60631253920221121053759.0190220e20190206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063125392DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra06705h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Xiaolin10aBroadening the scope of sortagging  ap. 4700-4721.  aSortases are enzymes occurring in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Sortase A (SrtA), the best studied sortase class, plays a key role in anchoring surface proteins with the recognition sequence LPXTG covalently to oligoglycine units of the bacterial cell wall. This unique transpeptidase activity renders SrtA attractive for various purposes and motivated researchers to study multiple in vivo and in vitro ligations in the last decades. This ligation technique is known as sortase-mediated ligation (SML) or sortagging and developed to a frequently used method in basic research. The advantages are manifold: extremely high substrate specificity, simple access to substrates and enzyme, robust nature and easy handling of sortase A. In addition to the ligation of two proteins or peptides, early studies already included at least one artificial (peptide equipped) substrate into sortagging reactions – which demonstrates the versatility and broad applicability of SML. Thus, SML is not only a biology-related technique, but has found prominence as a major interdisciplinary research tool. In this review, we provide an overview about the use of sortase A in interdisciplinary research, mainly for protein modification, synthesis of protein–polymer conjugates and immobilization of proteins on surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3acell walls 3achemical bonding 3aenzyme activity 3ainterdisciplinary research 3apeptides 3asortase A 3asubstrate specificity 3asurface proteins1 aBöker, Alexander,1 aGlebe, Ulrich0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 06, v. 9, no. 9 p.4700-4721dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06705h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009900167300001600266520161200282592002801894650001501922650001101937650001501948650002501963650001501988650001502003653002902018653003302047653004502080653002702125653001902152653000802171653000802179653000802187653000802195653000702203653000802210653000802218653000702226653000802233653000902241653001202250653001002262653001302272653001002285653000902295653000902304653000902313653000802322653000802330653000802338653000902346653000902355653000902364700005102373700001602424773011602440856008702556852000902643655001202652IND60589633420221122133402.0181207e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058963342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lili10aShort-term wind speed prediction using an extreme learning machine model with error correction  ap. 239-250.  aWind speed forecasting is an important technology in the wind power field; however, because of their chaotic nature, predicting wind speeds accurately is difficult. Aims at this challenge, a new hybrid model is proposed for short-term wind speed forecasting, where the short-term forecasting period is ten minutes. The model combines extreme learning machine with improved complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The extreme learning machine model is employed to obtain short-term wind speed predictions, while the autoregressive model is used to determine the best input variables. An ensemble method is used to improve the robustness of the extreme learning machine. To improve the prediction accuracy, the ICEEMDAN-ARIMA method is developed to postprocess the errors; this method can also be used to preprocess original wind speed. Additionally, this paper reports the results of a comparative study on preprocessing and postprocessing time series data. Three experimental results show that: (1) the error correction is effective in decreasing the prediction error, and the proposed models with error correction are suitable for short-term wind speed forecasting; (2) the ICEEMDAN method is more powerful than other variants of empirical mode decomposition in performing non-stationary decomposition, and the ICEEMDAN-ARIMA method achieves satisfactory performance both for preprocessing and postprocessing; and (3) for prediction, the preprocessing of time series is more effective than its postprocessing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3aprediction 3atime series analysis 3awind power 3awind speed 0aExtreme learning machine 0aEmpirical mode decomposition 0aAutoregressive integrated moving average 0aWind speed forecasting 0aError revision 0aELM 0aANN 0aSVR 0aCRO 0aWD 0aENN 0aPSR 0aAR 0aMAE 0aRMSE 0aCEEMDAN 0aCEEMD 0aICEEMDAN 0aARIMA 0aSLFN 0aRELM 0aLRNN 0aWPD 0aVMD 0aEMD 0aEEMD 0aMAPE 0aPACF1 aLi, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2999-98181 aBai, Yulong0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 162 p.239-250dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245011200179300001800291520076200309592002801071650002901099650002101128650001601149650002801165650001001193650004001203650001601243650002001259650002001279650003501299650005001334650002701384650005201411650002301463650002801486700001501514700001701529700001701546700001801563700001701581700001801598773009801616856008101714852000901795655001201804IND50067624920221120084618.0150207e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006762492DNAL7 a236092302pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-013-1205-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lin10aExpression of cellulase genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae via δ-integration subject to auxotrophic markers  ap. 1303-1307.  aδ-Integration can improve the expression stability and increase the copy number of exogenous genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

More knowledge is needed regarding the moisture performance of massive timber elements. There is uncertainty regarding the need for vapour barriers or retarders, and construction tents are rarely used despite the elements’ sensitivity to moisture. Twelve massive timber cases from the Mycoteam database, evenly distributed between the construction phase and use phase, have been studied. The types and causes of damage are compared, and remedial measures studied. Examination was challenging, and long electrodes in pre-drilled holes were found as a feasible method for moisture measurements. Drying took place from one week to several months, depending on wetting and drying conditions. The main cause of moisture intrusion was insufficient protection from precipitation, either during construction or due to constructional errors. Fungal growth was observed in all but three cases, while decay was found in six cases. High moisture content within elements did not cause fungal growth if the surfaces were dry. Decay in outdoor exposed elements was mainly caused by Gloeophyllum sepiarium, whereas Antrodia sp. was most common in elements not exposed outdoors. More research is needed regarding fungal damage in massive timber elements in combination with other materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntrodia 3aGloeophyllum sepiarium 3acase studies 3adatabases 3afungal growth 3afungi 3amass timber 3auncertainty 3avapors 3awater content 3awood 3aNorway 0aMassive timber 0aCLT 0amoisture damage 0adecay damage 0amould growth 0amoisture measurements1 aMattsson, J.0 tWood material science and engineering.g2020 Nov. 1, v. 15, no. 6 p.326-334dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000166x1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2020.18018353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01831naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013600159300002000295520079300315592002801108650001501136650002001151650001701171650002101188650001301209650001101222650002301233700002201256700002001278773012301298856007501421852000901496655001201505IND60559000620221121024503.0161122e20131121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900062DNAL7 a10.1021/jp409388b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSloniec, Jagoda10aPhotophysics and Release Kinetics of Enzyme-Activatable Optical Probes Based on H-Dimerized Fluorophores on Self-Immolative Linkers  ap. 14336-14344.  aA series of activatable optical probes for the model enzyme penicillin G amidase based on intramolecular formation of non-fluorescent H-dimer between two identical dyes were synthesized. The probes are based on a self-immolative linker, which allows positioning both dyes in close spatial proximity to ensure efficient quenching of probes with absorption and fluorescence emission in the near-infrared (NIR) range. A detailed photophysical investigation of the novel optical probes led to a revision of a previously anticipated quenching mechanism and revealed their potential for optimizing the performance of activatable probes based on H-dimer formation.

The effects of microstructure transformation in the electrode materials caused by lithium-ion intercalation/deintercalation on the evolution of dynamic responses are investigated including the effects of the state of charge, aging, and cell-to-cell variations. The dynamic responses obtained from a finite element analysis show two interesting phenomena. First, the high modal density is controllable with the design modification of a pack component. Second, dynamic responses, especially the evolution of the natural frequencies of the fixed-boundary modes, of a Li-ion battery pack provide useful information to estimate the dynamic states or health states of the battery. A probabilistic analysis is also carried out considering stochastic operational conditions of hybrid electric vehicles with a parametric reduced-order model. The probabilistic analysis not only suggests appropriate modes and locations for monitoring its dynamic responses, but also determines the maximum response level of every cell in the battery pack. The proposed modeling approach can improve the safety and reliability of the structural design of battery cells and packs. Furthermore, it can be useful for the identification of the battery states during the operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3afinite element analysis 3alithium batteries 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprobability analysis 3avehicles (equipment) 0aDiagnosis 0aEvolution of elastic modulus 0aLithium-ion battery pack 0aLi-ion intercalation 0aSensor placement1 aKim, Ji-Young1 aOh, Ki-Yong0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 162 p.264-275dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245011400211300001600325520136600341592002801707650001701735650001601752650002201768650001501790651001001805653002201815653001501837653001701852653001701869653002201886653002301908700006001931700002101991773010802012856008502120852000902205655001202214IND60607418820221116152903.0180904e20161122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060741882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.10.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontana, Federica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8710-442110aTechnological continuity and discontinuity in the Romagnano Loc III rock shelter (NE Italy) Mesolithic series  ap. 252-265.  aThis paper reports results of a technological study carried out on the lithic assemblages of the Mesolithic sequence of Romagnano rock shelter, in the south-eastern Alps, which represents the reference site for the Sauveterrian and Castelnovian of northeastern Italy. Considering the technical differences between the two phases, this work has tried to ascertain aspects of continuity and discontinuity within this series in the aim of investigating the way this transition occurred – abrupt or progressive. The objectives of débitage and the techniques applied, along with the reductions sequences and the methods involved, have been reconstructed. In order to interpret these data, a comparison with other main Castelnovian assemblages of the Italian peninsula has been carried out. Results attained indicate that the major changes occurred at the transition between I and II Mesolithic are closely related to the introduction of new knapping techniques – indirect percussion/pressure. The persistence of some characters derived from the more ancient pragmatic Sauveterrian tradition has also been highlighted. The existence of a real progressive transition seems difficult to be proved considering that Romagnano, as other continuous series available from other rock shelters of the peninsula, could have undergone problems of stratigraphic disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesozoic era 3aarchaeology 3ahuman settlements 3atechnology 3aItaly 0aRomagnano Loc III 0aMesolithic 0aSauveterrian 0aCastelnovian 0aLithic technology 0aReduction sequence1 aFlor, Elisabetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1372-75381 aDuches, Rossella0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Nov. 22, v. 423 p.252-265dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.10.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245012100192300001600313520161900329592002801948650003001976650001302006650001102019650001202030650001102042650001202053650001202065650001202077650001202089650001402101650001302115650001102128650001302139650002802152650001702180650001102197650001602208650001902224650000902243650001502252650000902267650001402276650001402290650001202304650001102316650001402327650001302341650001102354650001502365650001102380650001402391650001802405650000902423650002802432650001602460650001502476650003002491650001102521650002102532651000902553651000902562700002502571773011202596856008102708852000902789655001202798IND50088948620221119060749.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008894862DNAL7 a238878692pmid7 a10.1007/s10653-013-9555-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAwadh, Salih Muhammad10aAssessment of sulfurous springs in the west of Iraq for balneotherapy, drinking, irrigation and aquaculture purposes  ap. 359-373.  aThis research deals with the sulfurous spring waters flow along the course of the Euphrates River in western Iraq in the area extended between Haqlaniya and Hit within the Al-Anbar governorate. Eleven springs (3 in Haqlanya, 4 in Kubaysa and 4 in Hit) have been addressed for the purpose of water evaluation for balneology, drinking, irrigation and aquaculture (fish farming). In order to meet the objectives of this research, all springs were sampled and analyzed for the total dissolved solid, electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, major cations (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺and K⁺), major anions (SO₄²⁻, Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻and CO₃²⁻), minor anions (PO₄³⁻and NO₃⁻) as well as the trace elements that included Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni, Fe, Mn, Cu, Br, F, Ba, B, Sr, Al, As, Cr, Hg and Se. The International Standards of World Health Organization are used for assessing the water quality. The results revealed that the springs belong to the tepid springs of 27–30 °C and classified as hypothermal to the thermal springs. Lithochemistry and geochemical processes clearly affected the water chemistry. The hydrogeochemical processes are responsible for the element enrichment in water by the chemical dissolution of carbonate and gypsum and evaporation as well. The results of the study indicate the possibility of using spring water for therapeutic purposes, but not allowed for drinking and aquaculture (fish farming), except those free of H₂S gas. On the other hand, it can be used for irrigation with risk.

Particulate organic carbon (POC) accounted for 60–112% of net accumulated total organic carbon (TOC) during exponential growth and blooms of phytoplankton in all incubations regardless of the concentrations of nutrients and the forms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) as well as the composition and size of phytoplankton. After the blooms of phytoplankton, microzooplankton (mainly ciliates) (>20 μm) increased rapidly in majority of incubations. This suggests that a large fraction of new production may also be transferred to higher trophic levels rather than immediately exported. After the depletion of initial DIN, accumulation of both POC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased. DOC accounted for major fraction of TOC in most of the incubations. Continued accumulation of high C/N organic matter implies that recycling through the food web is not necessarily the dominant fate of organic carbon produced under low DIN condition but rather that a major fraction of the organic carbon is exported to deep water through sinking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3afood webs 3aphytoplankton 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aseawater 3adissolved organic carbon 3anutrients 3aCiliophora 3arecycling 3aJapan 0acarbon1 aNiraula, Mohan P.1 aSuzuki, Yoshimi0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 May 1, v. 102-103 p.84-94dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.03.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245016000161300001600321520181500337592002802152650001602180650001102196650001602207650002302223650002402246650001102270650000902281650002002290650001002310650001202320651001002332700001702342700001602359700001802375700001602393700001702409773011202426856008102538852000902619655001202628IND50088948820221119060834.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008894882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-013-9557-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jia10aExposure assessment, chemical characterization and source identification of PM2.5 for school children and industrial downwind residents in Guangzhou, China  ap. 385-397.  aTo assess the exposure doses of PM₂.₅and to investigate its chemical components for the subpopulation (i.e., school children and industrial downwind residents), simultaneous sampling of indoor and outdoor PM₂.₅was conducted at an elementary school close to traffic arteries and a residence located in the downwind area of a steel plant in metropolitan Guangzhou in 2010. Chemical components, i.e., organic carbon, elemental carbon and 6 water soluble ions were analyzed in PM₂.₅. A survey was also conducted to investigate the time-activity patterns of the school children and the industrial downwind residents. Indoor and outdoor PM₂.₅were 63.2 ± 20.1 and (76.7 ± 35.8) μg/m³at the school, and 118.8 ± 44.7 and 125.7 ± 57.1 μg/m³in the community, respectively. Indoor PM₂.₅was found to be highly related to outdoor sources, and stationary sources were the significant contributors to PM₂.₅at both sites. The daily average doses of PM₂.₅for the school children at the school (Dcₕᵢₗdᵣₑₙ) and the industrial downwind residents in the community (Dᵣₑₛᵢdₑₙₜₛ) were (7.6 ± 1.9) and (36.1 ± 36.8) μg/kg-day, respectively. The daily average doses of particulate organic mass and SO₄²⁻were the two most abundant chemical components in PM₂.₅. PM₂.₅exposure for the school children was contributed by indoor and outdoor environments by 48.8 and 51.2 %, respectively; for the industrial downwind residents, the contributions were 66.0 and 34.0 %, respectively. Age and body weight were significantly and negatively correlated with Dcₕᵢₗdᵣₑₙ, while age, body weight and education level were significantly and negatively correlated with Dᵣₑₛᵢdₑₙₜₛ; gender was not a significant factor at both cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3aeducational status 3aexposure assessment 3agender 3aions 3aschool children 3asteel 3asurveys 3aChina1 aLai, Senchao1 aKe, Zhaoyue1 aZhang, Yingyi1 aYin, Shasha1 aZheng, Junyu0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2014 June, v. 36, no. 3 p.385-397dSpringer-Verlagx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-013-9557-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009400173300001800267500001900285520169800304592002802002650001502030650001902045650001702064650002102081650001202102650002402114650001602138650001502154650001402169650002102183650001102204650000702215650001802222650001302240650002202253650001102275650001502286651001802301700002602319700002202345700001802367773011302385856008202498852000902580655001202589IND60714657820221117164745.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071465782DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-020-00750-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCórdoba-Mena, Noris10aChanges in Phytoplankton Communities in a Tropical Estuary in the Colombian Caribbean Sea  ap. 2106-2127.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhytoplankton community species composition, diversity, biomass, and distribution experience constant changes because of seasonal and temporal variations. This study was done with the aim of describing the response to environmental and seasonal changes of the phytoplankton communities of a tropical estuary in the south of the Colombian Caribbean Sea (Gulf of Urabá) with an emphasis on potential producers of toxin genera. To do these, 15 sites along the Gulf were studied during two cruises in the rainy season and one during the dry season. In each site, water samples from above and below the halocline were collected. Environmental factors such salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentration were correlated with diatoms, dinoflagellate, cyanobacteria, and biotoxin producer abundance. The results showed that the number of diatoms was at a maximum of 11,166 cell/L in the fluvial zone. Dinoflagellates were at a maximum of 4250 cell/L in the same zone during the dry season and cyanobacteria blooms during the rainy season. Four genera of potential biotoxin producers were found: Dolichospermum, Prorocentrum, Dinophysis, and Pseudo-nitzschia; this last genus represents 44% of the total diatom abundance during the rainy season with a detectable domoic acid production in a range between 25.54 and 1580.7 pg/mL; this substance can affect different trophic levels in the Gulf, especially mammals due to its non-reversible amnesic effect. Overall, this study shows that the phytoplankton community structure in this tropical stratified estuary presents environment conditions during the rainy season that increase the abundance of phytoplankton that may thrive into blooms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophysis 3aDolichospermum 3aProrocentrum 3aPseudo-nitzschia 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3adomoic acid 3adry season 3aestuaries 3anutrient content 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3aspecies diversity 3atoxins 3awet season 3aCaribbean Sea1 aFlorez Leiva, Lennin,1 aAtehortua, Lucia,1 aObando, Erika0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2020 Dec., v. 43, no. 8 p.2106-2127dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4000572x1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-020-00750-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169300001500272520078800287592002801075650001101103650001101114650002401125653001101149653001901160653001301179653001501192653002201207700001901229773010701248856008501355852000901440655001201449IND60607419120221116152858.0180904e20160729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060741912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.09.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoler, Joaquim10aCattle without herdsmen: Animal and human beings in the prehistoric rock art of the Western Sahara  ap. 93-102.  aBecause of the scarcity and discontinuity of the archaeological excavations in the Western Sahara, rock-art appears to be one of the most relevant sources of information in order to discuss the subsistence, technology and ideology of the neolithic communities. However, in contrast to what we would expect from the evident pastoral scenes depicted on the Central Saharan rock art, the Western Saharan art of Neolithic age is dominated by wild or isolated animals. The pastoral scenes always are more uncertain to describe than the hunting scenes, which are also marginal but easier to interpret. In the current state of the research, the nature of the Western Saharan Neolithic, the putative age of the images, and the type of information expected from rock art should be questioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3ahumans 3ainformation sources 0aSahara 0aWestern Sahara 0aRock art 0aPrehistory 0aAfrican Neolithic1 aSoler, Narcís0 tQuaternary international.g2016 July 29, v. 410 p.93-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.09.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010500158300001800263520112500281592002801406650002201434650001201456650001301468650001401481650001801495650000901513650001501522650002401537650001301561650002001574653001301594653001701607653001201624653001001636700001801646700002601664773014801690856007301838852000901911655001201920IND60548855720221120173652.0160905e20120711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054885572DNAL7 a10.1021/jf20502842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Grace C.10aImpact of Thermal Processing on Sulforaphane Yield from Broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. ssp. italica)  ap. 6743-6748.  aIn broccoli, sulforaphane forms when the glucosinolate glucoraphanin is hydrolyzed by the endogenous plant thiohydrolase myrosinase. A myrosinase cofactor directs hydrolysis away from the formation of bioactive sulforaphane and toward an inactive product, sulforaphane nitrile. The cofactor is more heat sensitive than myrosinase, presenting an opportunity to preferentially direct hydrolysis toward sulforaphane formation through regulation of thermal processing. Four broccoli cultivars were microwave heated, boiled, or steamed for various lengths of time. Production of nitrile during hydrolysis of unheated broccoli varied among cultivars from 91 to 52% of hydrolysis products (Pinnacle > Marathon > Patriot > Brigadier). Boiling and microwave heating caused an initial loss of nitrile, with a concomitant increase in sulforaphane, followed by loss of sulforaphane, all within 1 min. In contrast, steaming enhanced sulforaphane yield between 1.0 and 3.0 min in all but Brigadier. These data are proof of concept that steaming for 1.0–3.0 min provides less nitrile and more sulforaphane yield from a broccoli meal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aboiling 3abroccoli 3acultivars 3aglucoraphanin 3aheat 3ahydrolysis 3amicrowave treatment 3asteaming 3athioglucosidase 0abroccoli 0asulforaphane 0anitrile 0asteam1 aFarnham, Mark1 aJeffery, Elizabeth H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 July 11, v. 60, no. 27 p.6743-6748dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf20502843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013400170300001800304520146500322592002801787650002301815650002301838650002301861650001501884650001301899650001301912650001801925650001501943650001801958650001301976650001101989650001602000650001302016700001302029700001802042700001502060700001702075700005402092773012102146856008702267852000902354655001202363IND60673192420221120195646.0191018e20190912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067319242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b014912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Peipei10aEfficient Ring-opening Reaction of Tetralin over Nanosized ZSM-5 Zeolite: Effect of SiO₂/Al₂O₃ Ratio and Reaction Condition  ap. 9480-9490.  aThe naphtheno-aromatics from the hydrogenation of light cycle oil and coke gas oil are important feedstocks for producing high octane number gasoline via a cracking reaction. However, besides the ring-opening reaction to desired products, the condensation of naphtheno-aromatics to polycyclic aromatics is inevitable. In this work, the typical micrometer-sized ZSM-5 zeolite and various nanosized ZSM-5 zeolites with different SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratios have been prepared and evaluated for the catalytic cracking of tetralin as model molecule for naphtheno-aromatics. Compared with the micrometer-sized ZSM-5 zeolite, the nanosized ZSM-5 zeolite with higher porosity and shorter diffusion channel exhibited both an enhanced reactivity and an improved selectivity to the ring-opening reaction. Among the various nanosized ZSM-5 zeolites with different SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratios, the zeolite with SiO₂/Al₂O₃ ratio of 200 showed the highest selectivity to ring-opening products, which probably resulted from the low hydrogen transfer activity for the lesser amount of acid sites and the efficient diffusion of product molecules from the micropores. Furthermore, the reaction conditions for the ring-opening reaction of tetralin have been tested. The results indicate that the optimal reaction conditions are a temperature of 550 °C and WHSV of 2 h–¹, at which 85.41% conversion of tetralin and 80.38% selectivity to ring-opening products have been achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalytic activity 3acatalytic cracking 3afeedstocks 3agasoline 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amicropores 3ananomaterials 3aporosity 3asilica 3atemperature 3azeolites1 aLi, Kang1 aFan, Jiangtao1 aXu, Naiwen1 aZhu, Xiaolin1 aLi, Chunyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2595-46900 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Sept. 12, v. 33, no. 10 p.9480-9490dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b014913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011900176300001800295500001900313520096800332592002801300650001401328650003201342650001401374650002201388653001101410653001901421653002201440653001701462653001701479700002101496773013701517856008701654852000901741655001201750IND60710713720221120144609.0201104e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071071372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmail, Abdallah R.10aLipase immobilization with support materials, preparation techniques, and applications: Present and future aspects  ap. 1624-1639.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImmobilized lipase has become one of the most important biocatalytic systems used for many industrial purposes, especially in the fuel, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food industries. Immobilized lipase has advantages of good chemical and thermal stability, in addition to reuse and easy recovery, allowing it to serve as a replacement for chemical catalysts in industrial applications. In this regard, there has been rapidly growing interest in developing new support materials (SMs) and new protocols for lipase immobilization (LI). In this review, various types of SMs used for LI are extensively discussed, with clarification of their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, different methods of LI are explained with a particular emphasis on their respective benefits and drawbacks. The applications of immobilized lipase in producing biodiesel as well as other organic synthesis processes are summarized with a mention of future prospects and directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acosmetics 3athermal stability 0aLipase 0aImmobilization 0aSupport materials 0aBiocatalysts 0aApplications1 aBaek, Kwang-Hyun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 163 p.1624-1639dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009900164300001800263520136100281592002801642650002801670650002701698650002501725650001201750650001801762650003501780650002601815650001201841650002201853650001501875650003301890650001401923650002301937700003201960700002201992700002502014700001902039700002402058700002602082700002102108700001702129700002902146700002502175700002202200700002102222700002202243700001902265773012102284856007402405852000902479655001202488IND60631254820221121053835.0190220e20190214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063125482DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra08187e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDattola, Elisabetta10aDevelopment of 3D PVA scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering and cell screening applications  ap. 4246-4257.  aThe aim of this study was the design of a 3D scaffold composed of poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA) for cardiac tissue engineering (CTE) applications. The PVA scaffold was fabricated using a combination of gas foaming and freeze-drying processes that did not need any cross-linking agents. We obtained a biocompatible porous matrix with excellent mechanical properties. We measured the stress–strain curves of the PVA scaffolds and we showed that the elastic behavior is similar to that of the extracellular matrix of muscles. The SEM observations revealed that the scaffolds possess micro pores having diameters ranging from 10 μm to 370 μm that fit to the dimensions of the cells. A further purpose of this study was to test scaffolds ability to support human induced pluripotent stem cells growth and differentiation into cardiomyocytes. As the proliferation tests show, the number of live stem cells on the scaffold after 12 days was increased with respect to the initial number of cells, revealing the cytocompatibility of the substrate. In addition, the differentiated cells on the PVA scaffolds expressed anti-troponin T, a marker specific of the cardiac sarcomere. We demonstrated the ability of the cardiomyocytes to pulse within the scaffolds. In conclusion, the developed scaffold show the potential to be used as a biomaterial for CTE applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3across-linking reagents 3aextracellular matrix 3afoaming 3afreeze drying 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3amechanical properties 3amuscles 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asarcomeres 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ascreening 3atissue engineering1 aParrotta, Elvira Immacolata1 aScalise, Stefania1 aPerozziello, Gerardo1 aLimongi, Tania1 aCandeloro, Patrizio1 aColuccio, Maria Laura1 aMaletta, Carmine1 aBruno, Luigi1 aDe Angelis, Maria Teresa1 aSantamaria, Gianluca1 aMollace, Vincenzo1 aLamanna, Ernesto1 aDi Fabrizio, Enzo1 aCuda, Giovanni0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 14, v. 9, no. 8 p.4246-4257dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra08187e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04139naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245010300186300001600289520228700305592002802592650003002620650002802650650001702678650001202695650001202707650001102719650001002730650001102740650001102751650001202762650001202774650000802786650001702794650001502811650001402826650000902840650001402849650001402863650002002877650001302897650001102910650001302921650002102934650001802955650001502973650001002988650001102998650001203009650001303021650000903034650001203043650001403055650001403069650001103083650002203094650005403116650003303170651001203203700002403215773011203239856008103351852000903432655001203441IND50088949320221119060526.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008894932DNAL7 a240969412pmid7 a10.1007/s10653-013-9572-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGramss, Gerhard10aForage and rangeland plants from uranium mine soils: long-term hazard to herbivores and livestock?  ap. 441-452.  aMetalliferous uranium mine overburden soils integrated into arable land or stabilized by perennial rangeland plants evoke concern about the quality of crops and the exposure of grazing and thereby soil-ingesting (wildlife) herbivores to heavy metals (HM) and radionuclides. In a 2-year trial, thirteen annual and perennial forage and rangeland plants were thus potted on, or taken from, cultivated field soil of a metalliferous hot spot near Ronneburg (Germany). The content of soil and shoot tissues in 20 minerals was determined by ICP-MS to estimate HM (and uranium) toxicities to grazing animals and the plants themselves, and to calculate the long-term persistence of the metal toxicants (soil clean-up times) from the annual uptake rates of the plants. On Ronneburg soil elevated in As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, U, and Zn, the shoot mineral content of all test plants remained preferentially in the range of “normal plant concentrations” but reached up to the fourfold to sixfold in Mn, Ni, and Zn, the 1.45- to 21.5-fold of the forage legislative limit in Cd, and the 10- to 180-fold of common herb concentrations in U. Shoot and the calculated root concentrations in Cd, Cu, Ni, and Zn accounted for phytotoxic effects at least to grasses and cereals. Based on WHO PTWI values for the tolerable weekly human Cd and Pb intake, the expanded Cd and Pb limits for forage, and reported rates of hay, roots, and adhering-soil ingestion, the tolerable daily intake rates of 0.65/11.6 mg in Cd/Pb by a 65 kg herbivore would be surpassed by the 11- to 27/0.7- to 4.7-fold across the year, with drastic consequences for winter-grazing and thereby high rates of roots and soil-ingesting animals. The daily intake of 5.3–31.5 mg of the alpha radiation emitter, U, may be less disastrous to short-lived herbivores. The annual phytoextraction rates of critical HM by the tested excluder crops indicate that hundreds to thousands of years are necessary to halve the HM and (long-lived) radionuclide load of Ronneburg soil, provided the herbage is harvested at all. It is concluded that the content in Cd/As, Cd, and Cu exclude herbage/Ronneburg soil from the commercial use as forage or pasture land soil for incalculable time spans. Caution is required, too, with the consumption of game.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aacceptable daily intake 3aarable soils 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acopper 3acrops 3aforage 3agrains 3agrasses 3agrazing 3ahay 3aheavy metals 3aherbivores 3aingestion 3alead 3alivestock 3amanganese 3amineral content 3aminerals 3anickel 3apastures 3aphytoremediation 3aradionuclides 3arangelands 3aroots 3ashoots 3auranium 3awildlife 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aHerbivory 2aLivestock 2aMining 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutants, Radioactivexanalysisxtoxicity. 2aUraniumxanalysisxtoxicity. 3aGermany1 aVoigt, Klaus-Dieter0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2014 June, v. 36, no. 3 p.441-452dSpringer-Verlagx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-013-9572-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008500165300001600250520137200266592002801638650000801666650001801674650002101692650001901713650001401732650001401746650001901760650003101779650002401810650001601834650001301850650001401863650000901877650001601886650000901902650001001911700001401921700002001935700002101955700002201976773010401998856008402102852000902186655001202195IND60121779120221122232656.0150325e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012177912DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2014.8689102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Wenyi10aMethylation and miRNA Effects of Resveratrol on Mammary Tumors vs. Normal Tissue  ap. 270-277.  aWe reported that resveratrol decreased DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and 3b expression in vitro and demethylates tumor suppressor RASSF-1a in women at increased breast cancer risk. We investigated the effects of resveratrol on DNMT and miRNA expression in normal and tumor mammary tissue in a rodent model of estrogen dependent mammary carcinoma. Eighty-nine female ACI rats received estradiol plus: low dose (lo) resveratrol, high dose (hi) resveratrol, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (Aza), a known inhibitor of DNMTs, or control (no additional treatment). After 21 wk of treatment, animals were sacrificed and mammary glands harvested. Matched tumor/normal tissues were available from 36 rats. DMNT3b (but not DNMT1) differed in tumor vs. normal tissue after lo (P = .04) and hi (P = .007) resveratrol and Aza treatment. With hi resveratrol, DNMT3b decreased in tumor but increased normal tissue. Hi resveratrol increased miR21, −129, −204, and −489 >twofold in tumor and decreased the same miRs in normal tissue 10–50% compared to control. There was an inverse association between DNMT3b and miR129, −204, and −489 in normal and/or tumor tissue. Treatment with resveratrol differentially influences tumor vs. normal tissue DNMT3b and miRNA expression. This mechanism of action of resveratrol to influence mammary carcinogenesis warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanimal models 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3aestradiol 3amammary glands 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3amechanism of action 3amethylation 3amicroRNA 3anutrition 3arats 3aresveratrol 3arisk 3awomen1 aZhang, Ke1 aClarke, Kaitlin1 aWeiland, Timothy1 aSauter, Edward R.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2014 Feb. 1, v. 66, no. 2 p.270-277dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2014.8689103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245008800200300002000288520154800308592002801856650002501884650002601909650001701935650003101952650002201983650001502005650001302020650001302033650001702046650001502063650001302078653003502091653002802126653001502154653003202169700002202201700001602223700001702239700002202256700006102278773014202339856007802481852000902559655001202568IND60639206920221120022952.0190501e20190409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063920692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b021152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadman, Kazi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2872-752X10aVersatile and High-Throughput Polyelectrolyte Complex Membranes via Phase Inversion  ap. 16018-16026.  aHigh-flux filtration membranes constructed through scalable and sustainable methods are desirable for energy-efficient separations. Often, these criteria are difficult to be reconciled with one another. Polymeric membranes can provide high flux but frequently involve organic solvents in processing steps. Solubility of many polymeric membranes in organic media also restricts their implementation in solvent filtration. In the present work, we report a simple and high-throughput aqueous processing approach for polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) membranes with controllable porosity and stability in various aqueous and organic environments. PECs are materials composed of oppositely charged polymer chains that can form solids in aqueous environments, yet which can be dissolved in very specific salt solutions capable of breaking the interpolymer ion pairs. By exploiting the salt-induced dissolution and subsequent reformation of the complex, nano- to microporous films are rapidly synthesized which resemble membranes obtained through conventional solvent-phase inversion techniques. PECs remain stable in organic solvents because of the low dielectric constant of the environment, which enhances electrostatic interactions, making them suitable for a wide range of water and solvent filtration applications. Here, we elucidate how the polymer-phase behavior can be manipulated to exercise morphological control, test membrane performance for water and solvent filtration, and quantify the mechanical stability of PECs in relevant conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3adielectric properties 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy efficiency 3afiltration 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asolubility 3asolvents 0aHigh-flux filtration membranes 0apolyelectrolyte complex 0acoacervate 0aquartz crystal microbalance1 aDelgado, David E.1 aWon, Yechan1 aWang, Qifeng1 aGray, Kimberly A.1 aShull, Kenneth R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8027-900X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 09, v. 11, no. 17 p.16018-16026dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b021153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013600160300001800296520131900314592002801633650002601661650001001687650002901697650002101726650001701747650001801764650002001782650001901802650002201821650002201843650001901865650001601884650001601900650001901916650002101935650001601956650001601972700001701988700001602005700001502021700001702036773012102053856007402174852000902248655001202257IND60631254920221121053848.0190220e20190208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063125492DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra08295b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guangjie10aBrowning control of fresh-cut Chinese yam by edible coatings enriched with an inclusion complex containing star anise essential oil  ap. 5002-5008.  aStar anise essential oil (SAEO) has a variety of antioxygenic and antimicrobial properties, and is widely used in food preservation. However, its application is still challenging due to poor water solubility and physicochemical stability. We now report that encapsulation of SAEO in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) enhances its water solubility, as well as its thermal, storage, and photostability. The solubility of SAEO encapsulated by HPCD was increased by 47.5 times at 45 °C, and the onset temperature of thermal volatilization was delayed by at least 200 °C. The encapsulated material is also more uniformly and more stably dispersed in xanthan gum, and is thus released in a controlled manner. Importantly, fresh-cut Chinese yam coated with xanthan gum containing encapsulated SAEO is more effectively preserved, as assessed using weight loss, L* value, browning index, and polyphenol oxidase activity. The data suggest that the encapsulated SAEO reduced the weight loss of the samples by more than 30%, and the encapsulation of HPCD increased the inhibitory effect of SAEO on browning and polyphenol oxidase activity of the samples by nearly 8 times and more than 7 times, respectively. Collectively, SAEO encapsulated in HPCD is promising as a preservative coat for fresh-cut fruits and vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea polystachya 3aanise 3aantimicrobial properties 3acatechol oxidase 3aedible films 3aencapsulation 3aenzyme activity 3aessential oils 3afood preservation 3afresh-cut produce 3aphotostability 3apolyphenols 3atemperature 3avolatilization 3awater solubility 3aweight loss 3axanthan gum1 aGu, Lingbiao1 aLu, Zhifang1 aYuan, Chao1 aSun, Yonghai0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 08, v. 9, no. 9 p.5002-5008dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra08295b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001400191245008900205300001600294500001500310506007600325520138400401592002801785506003701813650001501850650002501865650002001890650001301910650002001923650002401943650001401967650002501981650002402006650003102030650003702061650001402098650001402112650001102126650001602137650001702153650001102170650000902181650001402190650001202204650001502216653001702231700001502248700001402263700001502277700001502292700002502307700001602332700001702348773010402365856008402469852000902553655001202562IND60121779220221207094938.0150325e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012177922DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2014.8689112doi7 aPMC68126532pmcid7 a244471482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aMethylseleninic Acid Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer Growth Involving Multiple Pathways  ap. 295-307.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs a potential novel agent for treating pancreatic cancer, methylseleninic acid (MSeA) was evaluated in cell culture and xenograft models. Results showed that MSeA induced G ₁ cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a majority of human and mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines, but G ₂ arrest in human PANC-1 and PANC-28 cell lines. In contrast to our previous finding in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells having a lack of P53 activation by MSeA, induction of G ₂ arrest in PANC-1 cells was accompanied by increased mutant P53 Ser15 phosphorylation, upregulation of P53-targets P21Cip1 and GADD45 and G ₂ checkpoint kinase (Chk2) activation, suggestive of DNA damage responses. A rapid inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was followed by reduced mTOR signaling and increased autophagy in PANC-1 cells attenuating caspase-mediated apoptosis execution. Furthermore, daily oral treatment with MSeA (3 mg Se/kg body weight) significantly suppressed growth of subcutaneously inoculated PANC-1 xenograft in SCID mice. Immunohistochemical analyses detected increased p-Ser15 P53, P21Cip1, pS139-H2AX (DNA damage responses), and caspase-3 cleavage and decreased pSer473AKT and Ki67 proliferative index and reduced intratumor vascular density in MSeA-treated xenograft. These results provide impetus for further research of MSeA in the therapy and/or chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3apancreatic neoplasms 3achemoprevention 3aselenium 3aphosphorylation 3aoral administration 3aautophagy 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aprostatic neoplasms 3agene expression regulation 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3ahumans 3abody weight 3acell culture 3amodels 3amice 3anutrition 3amutants 3acell cycle 0atherapeutics1 aHu, Hongbo1 aWang, Zhe1 aXiong, Hua1 aCheng, Yan1 aLiao, Joshua Dezhong1 aDeng, Yibin1 aLü, Junxuan0 tNutrition and cancer.g2014 Feb. 1, v. 66, no. 2 p.295-307dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2014.8689113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008900171300001400260520151600274592002801790650001101818650001501829650002601844650001301870650001901883650002701902650002101929650000901950650002001959650001501979653001801994653001402012653002202026653002002048653001002068700002202078700002102100773011702121856008502238852000902323655001202332IND60559001420221120022830.0161122e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900142DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2016.12160802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVia, Stephen M.10aMultiple metrics quantify and differentiate responses of vegetation to composition B  ap. 56-64.  aQuantifying vegetation response to explosive compounds has focused predominantly on morphological impacts and uptake efficiency. A more comprehensive understanding of the total impacts of explosives on vegetation can be gained using a multivariate approach. We hypothesized that multiple variables representing morphological and physiological responses will more clearly differentiate species and treatments than any single variable. Individuals of three plant species were placed in soils contaminated with Composition B, which comprises 60% hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and 40% 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and grown for 2 months. Response metrics used included photosynthetic operation, water relations, growth characteristics, as well as nitrogen and carbon concentrations and isotopic compositions. Individual metrics showed high variability in response across the three species tested. Water relations and nitrogen isotopic composition exhibited the most consistent response across species. By comparing multiple variables simultaneously, better separation of both species and exposure was observed. The inclusion of novel metrics can reinforce previously established concepts and provide a new perspective. Additionally, the inclusion of various other metrics can greatly increase the ability to identify and differentiate particular groups. By using multivariate analyses and standard vegetation metrics, new aspects of the vegetation response to explosive compounds can be identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aexplosives 3amultivariate analysis 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3aphytoremediation 3asoil 3atrinitrotoluene 3avegetation 0aComposition B 0aexplosive 0afunctional groups 0astress response 0aδ15N1 aZinnert, Julie C.1 aYoung, Donald R.0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 19, no. 1 p.56-64dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2016.12160803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014400170300001400314520125800328592002801586650001901614650002001633650001301653650002001666650001501686650001801701653002801719653003401747653001601781653003001797653001801827700001901845700001801864773011301882856008701995852000902082655001202091IND60589634220221122195647.0200712e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058963422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Seongmin10aPrediction of inner pinch for supercritical CO2 heat exchanger using Artificial Neural Network and evaluation of its impact on cycle design  ap. 66-73.  aSupercritical CO₂ (S-CO₂) power cycles have received much attention due to their desired advantages in various applications. Due to the substantial difference in specific heat of S-CO₂ at different pressure, unique characteristics inside heat exchangers, especially in the recuperator, are observed and affect the cycle design. In this research, the problem of inner pinch occurring inside the S-CO₂ recuperator is identified and resolved by suggesting a new framework for the definition of heat exchanger effectiveness using the point of zero inner pinch. The design methodology of S-CO₂ cycles is improved using this definition by developing a module to calculate the zero inner pinch using artificial neural network (ANN) to undergo a learning process. As a result, the computation time required for cycle analysis is reduced by an order of 103 in the case of simple recuperated Brayton cycle, under the accuracy of 10-7 error bound. As the readers gain the access to the developed module for calculating the zero inner pinch, the procedure for S-CO₂ cycle optimization will become far more manageable for researchers, and as a result, this result can allow the conceptualization of even further complex layouts in S-CO₂ cycle research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aheat exchangers 3alearning 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aspecific heat 0aSupercritical CO2 cycle 0aSupercritical CO2 recuperator 0aRecuperator 0aArtificial Neural Network 0aEffectiveness1 aHeo, Jin Young1 aLee, Jeong Ik0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 May 01, v. 163 p.66-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.02.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245017100158300001600329520126400345592002801609650001301637650001001650650001301660650001101673650002301684650002301707650001301730651002001743651001501763653001701778653001601795653001901811653002601830653002801856653002501884653002701909653001601936700001701952700002201969700002101991700002102012700002102033700002102054700001802075773010202093856007202195852000902267655001202276IND60519517020221120235731.0210707e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051951702DNAL7 a10.1071/MU150422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisovski, Simeon10aMovement patterns of Sanderling (Calidris alba) in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and a comparison of methods for identification of crucial areas for conservation  ap. 168-177.  aWorldwide, most populations of migratory shorebirds are in jeopardy, none more so than those of the East Asian—Australasian Flyway (EAAF). In order to preserve these highly mobile species a detailed understanding of their use of feeding and resting sites along the flyway is required. In this study we used light-level geolocators and new analytical tools to reveal individual breeding locations and migration routes of 13 Sanderlings (Calidris alba) that spend their non-breeding season in South Australia. We then used these individual migration routes to identify the timing and location of important stopping areas and compared this with assessments based on resightings of leg-flagged birds and count data. During both northward and southward migration, Sanderlings were found to make extensive use of five main areas of the Chinese coastline, the Yellow Sea and the northern end of the Sakhalin Peninsula. Insights gained from the individual migration routes highlight inherent biases in using only count and resighting data to identify important feeding and resting sites along the Flyway. These findings suggest that data on individual movements may be crucial to effective conservation planning of shorebirds in the EAAF and elsewhere in the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalidris 3abirds 3abreeding 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3amigratory behavior 3aplanning 3aSouth Australia 3aYellow Sea 0abanding data 0abird counts 0abird migration 0aconservation planning 0alight-level geolocation 0aMCMC path estimation 0amigratory connectivity 0aresightings1 aGosbell, Ken1 aChristie, Maureen1 aHoye, Bethany J.1 aKlaassen, Marcel1 aStewart, Iain D.1 aTaysom, Alice J.1 aMinton, Clive0 tEmu.g2016 June 1, v. 116, no. 2 p.168-177dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU150423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245011000212300001600322500001500338506007600353520120600429592002801635506003701663650002001700650001701720650001801737650001901755650001401774650001301788650002601801650001401827650000901841650001501850650002801865650001401893653001701907700002401924773010401948856008402052852000902136655001202145IND60121779320221207093623.0150325e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012177932DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2014.8689122doi7 aPMC39434952pmcid7 a244471822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolf, M.

Herein, we investigated benzyl isothiocyanate's (BITC) ability to inhibit HNSCC migration and invasion and enhance chemotherapy. Our data suggests that treatment with BITC 1) induced significant reductions in the viability of multiple HNSCC cell lines tested (HN12, HN8, and HN30) after 24 and 48 h, 2) decreased migration and invasion of the HN12 cells in a dose dependent manner, and 3) inhibited expression and altered localization of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker, vimentin. We also observed that a pretreatment of BITC followed by cisplatin treatment 1) induced a greater decrease in HN12, HN30, and HN8 cell viability and total cell count than either treatment alone and 2) significantly increased apoptosis when compared to either treatment alone. Taken together these data suggest that BITC has the capacity to inhibit processes involved in metastasis and enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Consequently, the results indicate that further investigation, including in vivo studies, are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ain vivo studies 3adrug therapy 3acell movement 3acell viability 3acisplatin 3avimentin 3abenzyl isothiocyanate 3anutrition 3ahead 3ametastasis 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3aapoptosis 0achemotherapy1 aClaudio, Pier Paolo0 tNutrition and cancer.g2014 Feb. 1, v. 66, no. 2 p.285-294dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2014.8689123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245019500158300001800353520115200371592002801523650001801551650001501569650001301584650001101597650002001608650003101628650001001659650002001669650001101689650001801700650001101718650004301729650001301772650001201785650002001797653002001817653001901837653000901856653001801865653002201883700001901905700002301924773014801947856007502095852000902170655001202179IND60548856220221120163639.0160905e20120711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054885622DNAL7 a10.1021/jf300419w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNonis, Alberto10aEvaluation of RNA Extraction Methods and Identification of Putative Reference Genes for Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Expression Studies on Olive (Olea europaea L.)

These data need to be supported by quantitative approaches enabling the precise estimation of transcript abundance. qPCR being the most widely adopted technique for mRNA quantification, preliminary work needs to be done to set up robust methods for extraction of fully functional RNA and for the identification of the best reference genes to obtain reliable quantification of transcripts. In this work, we have assessed different methods for their suitability for RNA extraction from olive fruits and leaves and we have evaluated thirteen potential candidate reference genes on 21 RNA samples belonging to fruit developmental/ripening series and to leaves subjected to wounding. By using two different algorithms, GAPDH2 and PP2A1 were identified as the best reference genes for olive fruit development and ripening, and their effectiveness for normalization of expression of two ripening marker genes was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aalgorithms 3afruiting 3afruits 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3aolives 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aripening 3asurveys 3atranscriptomics 0agene expression 0areference gene 0aqPCR 0anormalization 0afruit development1 aVezzaro, Alice1 aRuperti, Benedetto0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 July 11, v. 60, no. 27 p.6855-6865dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf300419w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245009700177300001800274500001900292520124300311592002801554650002501582650001101607650001301618650002401631650001201655650001901667650001901686650001901705700002101724700006001745773011901805856008701924852000902011655001202020IND60731236020221120184028.0210318e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073123602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c041632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrusty, Deeptimayee10aRecent Advances on Alloyed Quantum Dots for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution: A Mini-Review  ap. 4670-4686.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHydrogen is becoming a promising eco-friendly energy carrier to replace traditional nonrenewable fossil fuels. In this context, photocatalytic water splitting photosystems are considered a green tactic. Alloyed quantum dots (QDs) are considered as earth abundant, low cost, and environmentally friendly photocatalysts to be utilized effectively in photocatalytic H₂ evolution. H₂ production efficiency greatly depends upon tunable optical and electronic properties associated with chemical composition as well as nanoscale particle sizes of alloyed QDs. Recent efforts toward the fabrication of various alloyed QDs by varying the surface atomic ratio and ligand exchange for photocatalytic hydrogen production has been presented and appraised here. Furthermore, in this review, we presented the microstructure and optical properties of alloyed QDs with their advantages and the construction of efficient cadmium-bound and cadmium-free alloyed QDs toward a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. At last, the challenges as well as critical issues of alloyed QDs and alloyed QDs-based photocatalysts for H₂ evolution has been proposed, with the hope that this mini-review will give a superior perceptive of different alloyed QDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aligands 3amicrostructure 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts1 aParamanik, Lekha1 aParida, Kulamani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7807-55610 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Mar. 09, v. 35, no. 6 p.4670-4686dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c041633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04134naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003000131040001800161100001600179245011100195300001800306500000900324520209600333592002802429650001702457650001502474650002002489650002502509650001602534650001802550650002302568650002202591650001902613650001102632650002102643650002002664650001602684650001702700650002302717650001502740650001602755650004402771650004102815650003402856650003602890650001002926650003502936650003202971650001703003650003703020650001003057700001903067700001803086773019403104852000903298856011103307856007703418961001303495655001203508IND4385181720221122001152.0191028e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438518172DNAL7 a167383912pmid7 a10113/38982hdl7 a10.2134/jeq2005.02042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoss, J.

Remote sensing technology to quantify salinity and water stress effects on forage yield can be an important tool to address yield loss potential when deficit irrigating with poor water quality. Two important forages, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum L.), were grown in a volumetric lysimeter facility where rootzone salinity and water content were varied and monitored. Ground-based hyperspectral canopy reflectance in the visible and near infrared (NIR) were related to forage yields from a broad range of salinity and water stress conditions. Canopy reflectance spectra were obtained in the 350- to 1000-nm region from two viewing angles (nadir view, 45° from nadir). Nadir view vegetation indices (VI) were not as strongly correlated with leaf area index changes attributed to water and salinity stress treatments for both alfalfa and wheatgrass. From a list of 71 VIs, two were selected for a multiple linear-regression model that estimated yield under varying salinity and water stress conditions. With data obtained during the second harvest of a three-harvest 100-d growing period, regression coefficients for each crop were developed and then used with the model to estimate fresh weights for preceding and succeeding harvests during the same 100-d interval. The model accounted for 72% of the variation in yields in wheatgrass and 94% in yields of alfalfa within the same salinity and water stress treatment period. The model successfully predicted yield in three out of four cases when applied to the first and third harvest yields. Correlations between indices and yield increased as canopy development progressed. Growth reductions attributed to simultaneous salinity and water stress were well characterized, but the corrections for effects of varying tissue nitrogen (N) and very low leaf area index (LAI) are necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforage crops 3acrop yield 3aMedicago sativa 3aThinopyrum elongatum 3arhizosphere 3asoil salinity 3asoil water content 3aspectral analysis 3aremote sensing 3acanopy 3avegetation cover 3aleaf area index 3asalt stress 3awater stress 3astatistical models 3airrigation 2aAgriculture 2aMedicago sativaxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aSalts 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aSpectroscopy, Near-Infrared 2aTime Factors 2aTriticumxchemistryxphysiology. 2aWater1 aRussell, W.

Acetone was used as solvent and the extraction was carried out at temperatures ranging from 35°C to 50°C using solid-to-solvent ratios between 1/5 and 1/30 (g/g). Equilibrium time was affected by temperature but not by the solid-to-solvent ratio. Results suggest that the increase in oleoresin yield was insignificant after 60min of extraction time. A highest oleoresin yield of 6.49% (db) was obtained at 50°C with solid-to-solvent ratio (1/30). A non-linear regression model was fitted to represent the kinetics of oleoresin yield. Effect of process variables (temperature and solvent-to-solid ratio) on model parameters, k (maximum possible extraction, percent dry basis) and a (initial extraction rate as a fraction of k – under specified conditions) were also studied. Equilibrium time is used to reduce lengthy extraction time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma longa 3aacetone 3aleaching 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arhizomes 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aturmeric 0aLeaching 0aOleoresin 0aEquilibrium time 0aRegression model1 aMajumdar, Gautam Chandra1 aMishra, Hari Niwas0 tJournal of food engineering.g2015 Feb., v. 146 p.116-121dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2014.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245011200181300001600293506002800309520141300337592002801750506003701778650000801815650002201823650001501845650001201860650002201872650001401894650002001908650001201928650001001940650002101950650001201971650001601983650001301999650003002012650001102042650001002053651001402063653001702077653002902094653001602123653000802139700002102147700001102168773011402179856008902293852000902382655001202391IND60785491120221207092209.0160419e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078549112DNAL7 a10.15294/biosaintifika.v8i1.53652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoslim, Dewi Indriyani13aAn Analysis of Partial DNA Sequence of Meisa1 Gene on Sweet and Bitter Cassavas (Manihot esculenta Crantz.)  ap. 105-112.  aResource is Open Access  a<p>Sweet and bitter taste on cassava tuber is affected by starch metabolisms. Meisa1 gene is a gene in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz.) encoding isoamylase1 enzyme involved in starch metabolisms. This study aimed to analyze partial DNA sequences of Meisa1 gene on sweet and bitter cassavas collected by Genetics Laboratory, Department Biology, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Riau University, Indonesia. Methods included total DNA extraction from fresh young leaves of cassava using CTAB buffer, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), electrophoresis, and sequencing. The obtained data were analyzed using MEGA software version 5. The results showed that there were nucleotide variations in the intron region, not in the exon region. The variations were caused by the transition substitution mutation (35.39%) and transversion substitution mutation (64.61%). The genetic distance range between seven cassava genotypes was approximately 0% to 11%. Partial DNA sequence variations of Meisa1 gene located in intron region were unable to cluster seven cassava genotypes separately into two groups based on tuber taste.</p><p><strong>How to Cite</strong></p><p>Roslim, D., Nisa, F., & Herman, H.

Specifically, stressed or otherwise more aroused individuals will produce alarm calls that are relatively more nonlinear (i.e. they sound noisier). The position of an individual in a social network can influence an individual's sense of security. More centrally located individuals may feel more secure and thus we might expect that they would produce noisier calls. Building on previous research about the influence of social relationships on an individual's sense of security, we asked whether social network position explained variation in the noisiness (quantified as Wiener entropy) and goodness of pitch of alarm calls produced by trapped yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. More socially isolated individuals, characterized by lower instrength, produced alarm calls with higher entropy and higher goodness of pitch. These isolated individuals may be more aroused because they have fewer social partners to depend on when presented with a predatory threat; therefore, they produce both noisy and potentially louder calls. Additionally, individuals with higher outcloseness produced calls with higher goodness of pitch, which may be indicative of their ability to better inform neighbours of impending threats. Overall, this study further illustrates how an individual's social network position influences the structure of its alarm calls, which could reflect how individuals perceive their current safety levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarmota 3aantipredatory behavior 3aentropy 3afearfulness 3asocial networks 0aacoustic analysis 0aalarm calling 0acentrality 0asecurity 0asocial attribute 0asocial network 0ayellow-bellied marmots1 aBlumstein, Daniel T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5793-92440 tAnimal behaviour.g2019 Aug., v. 154 p.131-136dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011400154300001400268520134000282592002801622650000801650650001301658650001501671650002301686650002001709650002101729650002401750650002401774650001401798650003001812650001801842650001601860650001001876700001801886700002301904700002101927773010601948856007502054852000902129655001202138IND60529050020221119221556.0160717e20120103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052905002DNAL7 a10.1021/ac202599b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLam, Brian10aPolymerase Chain Reaction-Free, Sample-to-Answer Bacterial Detection in 30 Minutes with Integrated Cell Lysis  ap. 21-25.  aAn important goal for improved diagnosis and management of infectious disease is the development of rapid and accurate technologies for the decentralized detection of bacterial pathogens. Most current clinical methods that identify bacterial strains require time-consuming culture of the sample or procedures involving the polymerase chain reaction.(1-3) Neither of these approaches has enabled testing at the point-of-need because of the requirement for skilled technicians and laboratory facilities. Here, we demonstrate the performance of an effective, integrated platform for the rapid detection of bacteria that combines a universal bacterial lysis approach and a sensitive nanostructured electrochemical biosensor. The lysis is rapid, is effective at releasing intercellular RNA from bacterial samples, and can be performed in a simple, cost-effective device integrated with an analysis chip. The platform was directly challenged with these unpurified lysates in buffer and urine. We successfully detected the presence of bacteria with high sensitivity and specificity and achieved a sample-to-answer turnaround time of 30 min.

One way to reduce the metal content in acid mine water is to use a silica membrane. In the study, silica membranes were made by extracting silica from fly ash by using two types of solvents or extractors, namely HCl and HNO3. The adsorption time are 100 min, 120 min, and 140 min with the aim to find out which extractors can produce membranes with performance good and optimum time in the absorption of metal content from acid mine drainage. SEM analysis shows that there is no pore formed on the membrane. The membrane with HCl extractor works better in reducing metal content. The optimum adsorption time in the 120th min is 18.9 mg/L. Acid mine drainage also experienced a decrease in flux from 14.9283 L/m2 hours to 6.8244 L/m2 h for the membrane with HCl extractor and for HNO3 membrane decreased from 11.9427 L/m2 h to 7.6774 L/m2 h.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aacid mine drainage 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3acoal 3afly ash 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apyrite 3asilica 0aSilica Membranes 0aFly Ash Coal 0aMetal Content 0aMine Acid Water 0aextractor 0aMine acid extractor1 aPurnamasari, Indah1 aAhmadan, Fatria0 tIJFAC (Indonesian Journal of Fundamental and Applied Chemistry).g2019 Feb., v. 4, no. 1 p.9-14dSriwijaya UniversitywJournal:27892x2540-94097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.24845/ijfac.v4.i1.093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245012600213300001600339506007600355520113600431592002801567506003701595650002701632650002401659650002701683650002901710650001001739650002401749650001201773650001101785650001301796650001401809650001601823650000901839650001001848650001401858650001301872650002101885700001901906700002901925700002201954700002201976700002201998773013002020856008202150852000902232655001202241IND60589024520221207075119.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058902452DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2979-82doi7 aPMC57853942pmcid7 a293916332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastellano, Patricia10aAntilisterial efficacy of Lactobacillus bacteriocins and organic acids on frankfurters.

LA/AA solution (2.5% v/v each) reduced pathogen population by 1.50 log₁₀ CFU/ml during storage. Semi-purified Bact705/1862 prevented L. monocytogenes growth, while nisin was not able to avoid its regrowth after 20 days. The combined addition of Bact705/1862 + LA/AA was the most effective approach for pathogen reduction below detection level from day 6 to final storage. Frankfurters treated with Bact705/1862 + LA/AA compared to fresh-purchased samples did not show significant differences in flavor, juiciness, color intensity and overall preference at 22 days-storage at 5 °C.

These relationships have led to the use of foliar nutrients as an index of nutrient status and to the prediction of broadscale patterns in ecosystem processes. More recently, a growing interest in ecological stoichiometry has fueled multiple analyses of foliar nitrogen : phosphorus (N:P) ratios within and across ecosystems. These studies have observed that N:P values are generally elevated in tropical forests when compared to higher latitude ecosystems, adding weight to a common belief that tropical forests are generally N rich and P poor. However, while these broad generalizations may have merit, their simplicity masks the enormous environmental heterogeneity that exists within the tropics; such variation includes large ranges in soil fertility and climate, as well as the highest plant species diversity of any biome. Here we present original data on foliar N and P concentrations from 150 mature canopy tree species in Costa Rica and Brazil, and combine those data with a comprehensive new literature synthesis to explore the major sources of variation in foliar N:P values within the tropics. We found no relationship between N:P ratios and either latitude or mean annual precipitation within the tropics alone. There is, however, evidence of seasonal controls; in our Costa Rica sites, foliar N:P values differed by 25% between wet and dry seasons. The N:P ratios do vary with soil P availability and/or soil order, but there is substantial overlap across coarse divisions in soil type, and perhaps the most striking feature of the data set is variation at the species level. Taken as a whole, our results imply that the dominant influence on foliar N:P ratios in the tropics is species variability and that, unlike marine systems and perhaps many other terrestrial biomes, the N:P stoichiometry of tropical forests is not well constrained. Thus any use of N:P ratios in the tropics to infer larger‐scale ecosystem processes must comprehensively account for the diversity of any given site and recognize the broad range in nutrient requirements, even at the local scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3atropical rain forests 3acanopy 3aforest trees 3asoil nutrients 3anitrogen 3ameta-analysis 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3aforest soils 3astoichiometry 3aphosphorus 3awet season 3aleaves 3asoil-plant interactions 2aBiodiversity 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aTreesxmetabolism 2aTropical Climate 3aCosta Rica 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aCosta Rica 0aprecipitation1 aCleveland, Cory C.1 aAsner, Gregory P.1 aBustamante, Mercedes M.

In this study a piston propelled flow-batch analyzer (PFBA) for the determination of Cu, Cr and Pb in gasoline and naphtha by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS) was explored. Investigative phase modeling for low dilution was conducted both for gasoline and naphtha microemulsions. Rheological considerations were also explored including a mathematical flow derivation to fine tune the system's operational parameters, and the GF AAS coupling. Both manual and automated procedures for microemulsion preparation were compared. The results of the paired t test at a 95% confidence level showed no significant differences between them. Further recovery test results confirmed a negligible matrix effect of the sample on the analyte absorption signals and an efficient stabilization of the samples (with metals) submitted to microemulsion treatment. The accuracy of the developed procedure was attested by good recovery percentages in the ranges of 100.0±3.5% for Pb in the naphtha samples, and 100.2±3.4% and 100.7±4.6% for Cu and Cr, respectively in gasoline samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achromium 3acopper 3aemulsions 3agasoline 3alead 3amodels 3at-test 3athermodynamics1 aSousa, Rafael A.1 aHarding, David P.1 aCadore, Solange1 aAlmeida, Luciano F.1 aAraújo, Mário César U.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2012 May 21, v. 727 p.34-40dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012200172300001600294520093900310592002801249650002001277650002001297650001101317650001201328650001201340651001201352651001901364700002801383700001801411700002201429773009001451856008101541852000901622655001201631IND50074330320221120183231.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007433032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-013-2386-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Katrina F.10aSurvival and remigration probabilities for loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting in the eastern Gulf of Mexico  ap. 863-870.  aFew long-term mark-recapture tagging datasets exist to estimate population parameters for loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) recovery units. Using a two-state open robust design model, we analyzed a 20-year (1990–2009) mark-recapture dataset from the Keewaydin Island loggerhead nesting assemblage off the southwest coast of Florida (USA) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. For this analysis, 2,292 turtle encounters were evaluated, representing 841 individual nesting turtles. Survival was estimated at 0.73 (95 % CI 0.69–0.76). This estimate is comparable with survival estimates elsewhere in the Peninsular Florida subpopulation and is among the lowest estimates for the Northwest Atlantic loggerhead population. We documented no changes in remigration rates or clutch frequency over time. These are the first survival and remigration probabilities estimated for a loggerhead nesting assemblage in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaretta caretta 3adata collection 3amodels 3anesting 3aturtles 3aFlorida 3aGulf of Mexico1 aMansfield, Katherine L.1 aDie, David J.1 aAddison, David S.0 tMarine biology.g2014 Apr., v. 161, no. 4 p.863-870dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-013-2386-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245013200164300001800296500002000314520112700334592002801461596004901489596002301538650001801561650001601579650001401595650002001609650001001629650001801639650001601657650002001673650001301693650001901706650002901725650001401754700002101768700003201789700001801821700006101839773013101900856007902031852000902110655001202119IND60655579320221120035917.0190803e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065557932DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.147042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiel, Benjamin12aA novel plasmid‐transcribed regulatory sRNA, QfsR, controls chromosomal polycistronic gene expression in Agrobacterium fabrum  ap. 3063-3075.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlasmids are mobile DNAs that can adjust host cell functions for their own amplification and dissemination. We identified Quorum sensing flagella small RNA regulator (QfsR), a small RNA, transcribed from the virulence tumour‐inducing (Ti) plasmid in the phytopathogen Agrobacterium fabrum. QfsR is widely conserved throughout RepABC plasmids carried by Rhizobiaceae. Target prediction, expression analysis and site‐direct mutagenesis experiments showed that QfsR directly pairs within polycistronic mRNAs transcribed from chromosome (genes involved in flagella apparatus) and Ti plasmid (genes involved in conjugative transfer). QfsR leads to a coordinated expression of whole polycistronic mRNA molecules. Whereas a lack of QfsR represses motility, its overproduction increases the quorum sensing signal accumulation and the Ti plasmid conjugative transfer. Based on these observations, we propose QfsR as a hub connecting regulatory networks of motility and plasmid conjugative transfer. To our knowledge, QfsR is the first example of a plasmid‐encoded sRNA that controls chromosomal polycistronic gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data  cCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique  cUniversité Lyon 1 3aAgrobacterium 3achromosomes 3aflagellum 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amutagenesis 3aplant pathogens 3aplasmids 3aquorum sensing 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence1 aDequivre, Magali1 aWisniewski‐Dyé, Florence1 aVial, Ludovic1 aHommais, Florence1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2151-35450 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2019 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.3063-3075dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.147043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04482naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002000189245017800209300001400387506007600401520174600477592002802223506003702251650001402288650002302302650004602325650001302371650002702384650001402411650002602425650001202451650001802463650001702481650001302498650001502511650002202526650002602548650002402574650002302598650001202621650001502633650002602648650002002674650003202694650001602726650002002742650003902762650002002801650002102821650005202842650001802894650001102912650002402923650001502947650002102962650003602983650002303019650001203042650002003054651001803074651001803092653004603110653001503156653001403171653001803185700002403203700002003227700002203247700002403269700002003293700002103313700002503334773017703359856008303536852000903619655001203628IND50060391420221207082719.0190416e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006039142DNAL7 a232607252pmid7 aPMC35485682pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jand.2012.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeung, Cindy W.12aA Qualitative Study of Diverse Experts' Views about Barriers and Strategies to Improve the Diets and Health of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Beneficiaries  ap. 70-76.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the largest federal food assistance program, currently serves 44.7 million Americans with a budget of $75 billion in 2011. This study engaged leading experts for in-depth, semi-structured interviews to explore their opinions concerning the existing challenges and barriers to eating nutritiously in SNAP. Experts also proposed strategies for improving nutritional status among SNAP recipients. Twenty-seven individuals were interviewed from advocacy, government, industry, and research organizations. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed for thematic content. The high cost of nutrient-rich foods, inadequate SNAP benefits, limited access to purchasing healthy foods, and environmental factors associated with poverty were identified as barriers that influence nutrition among low-income households in the United States. Six themes emerged among respondents from diverse sectors about how to address these challenges, including providing SNAP participants with incentives to purchase nutrient-rich food consistent with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, restricting the purchase of nutrient-poor foods and beverages with program benefits, modifying the frequency of SNAP benefit distribution, enhancing nutrition education, improving the SNAP retailer environment, and increasing state and federal level coordination and consistency of program implementation. Given the recent dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment, policymakers must address existing barriers as well as consider new strategies to improve nutrition policies in SNAP so that the program can continue to address food insecurity needs as well as provide a healthful diet for SNAP beneficiaries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmericans 3aDietary Guidelines 3aSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 3aadvocacy 3aattitudes and opinions 3abeverages 3aenvironmental factors 3aexperts 3afood security 3ahealthy diet 3aindustry 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alow income households 3anutrition education 3anutritional status 3apoverty 3apurchasing 3aresearch institutions 2aChoice Behavior 2aDietxeconomicsxstandards. 2aEnvironment 2aFood Assistance 2aFood Supplyxeconomicsxstandards. 2aHealth Behavior 2aHealth Education 2aHealth Promotionxorganization & administration 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMotivation 2aNutrition Policy 2aNutritional Sciencesxeducation 2aNutritional Status 2aPoverty 2aQuality Control 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0aSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 0aFood Stamp 0aNutrition 0aFood security1 aHoffnagle, Elena E.1 aLindsay, Ana C.1 aLofink, Hayley E.1 aHoffman, Vanessa A.1 aTurrell, Sophie1 aWillett, Walter,1 aBlumenthal, Susan J.0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2013 Jan., v. 113, no. 1 p.70-76dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2012.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011300168300001600281520109700297592002801394650001501422650000901437650001201446650001501458650001301473650001101486650002201497650001301519650001101532650001901543650002501562650002001587651001701607700002301624700002001647773009001667856008101757852000901838655001201847IND50074330520221120132032.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007433052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-013-2388-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, Andrew A.10aPoecilogony in Polydora hoplura (Polychaeta: Spionidae) from commercially important molluscs in South Africa  ap. 887-898.  aFemales of the polychaete Polydora hoplura (Claparède 1869) that produced planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae were compared genetically to determine whether the different reproductive morphs represented sibling species or poecilogony. Worms were collected from Saldanha Bay, South Africa (33°0′37.71S, 17°56′59.74E), and cultured in a laboratory setting from November 2012 to April 2013. The results based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Cyt b and ATPSα, respectively) showed shared haplotypes between reproductive morphs for both markers. Additionally, variation in mtDNA sequences was significantly higher within morphs than between morphs (95.8 and 4.2 %, respectively). A comparison of developmental modes found that broods of planktotrophic larvae were larger than broods of adelphophagic larvae, while the latter had larger eggs and larvae at hatching. Developmental time from oviposition to settlement for planktotrophic and adelphophagic larvae was 40.2 and 16.6 days, respectively. Polydora hoplura represents the fifth confirmed case of poecilogony in the Spionidae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahaplotypes 3ahatching 3alarvae 3amitochondrial DNA 3amolluscs 3amorphs 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3asibling species 3aSouth Africa1 aMatthee, Conrad A.1 aSimon, Carol A.0 tMarine biology.g2014 Apr., v. 161, no. 4 p.887-898dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-013-2388-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245008600159500001900245520115200264592002801416650002301444650001001467650002101477650001601498650002401514650000901538650001901547650001701566700001701583773015801600856007501758852000901833655001201842IND60703119920221120210513.0200720e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070311992DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi90603392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zengli 10aConstruction, Detection, and Interpretation of Crime Patterns over Space and Time  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEmpirical studies have focused on investigating the interactive relationships between crime pairs. However, many other types of crime patterns have not been extensively investigated. In this paper, we introduce three basic crime patterns in four combinations. Based on graph theory, the subgraphs for each pattern were constructed and analyzed using criminology theories. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to examine the significance of these patterns. Crime patterns were statistically significant and generated different levels of crime risk. Compared to the classical patterns, combined patterns create much higher risk levels. Among these patterns, “co-occurrence, repeat, and shift” generated the highest level of crime risk, while “repeat” generated much lower levels of crime risk. “Co-occurrence and shift” and “repeat and shift” showed undulated risk levels, while others showed a continuous decrease. These results outline the importance of proposed crime patterns and call for differentiated crime prevention strategies. This method can be extended to other research areas that use point events as research objects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acrime 3acrime prevention 3acriminology 3amathematical theory 3arisk 3aspace and time 3aspatial data1 aZhang, Hong 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 May 26, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90603393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009500161300001600256520175200272592002802024650001302052650001902065650002002084650001102104650000902115650002202124650001602146650001702162650001502179650001802194700002402212700002402236700002002260773010802280856007502388852000902463655001202472IND60529050520221119221633.0160717e20120103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052905052DNAL7 a10.1021/ac20265782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Jason W. H.10aMMSAT: Automated Quantification of Metabolites in Selected Reaction Monitoring Experiments  ap. 470-474.  aSelected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a mass spectrometry-based approach commonly used to increase analytical sensitivity and selectively for specific compounds in complex metabolomic samples. While the goal of well-designed SRM methods is to monitor for unique precursor–product ion pairs, in practice this is not always possible due to the diversity of the metabome and the resolution limits of mass spectrometers that are capable of SRM. Isobaric or near-isobaric precursor ions with different chromatographic properties but identical product ions often arise in complex samples. Without analytical standards, such metabolites will go undetected by conventional data analysis methods. Furthermore, a single SRM method may include simultaneous monitoring of tens to hundreds of different metabolites across multiple samples making quantification of all detected ions a challenging task. To facilitate the analysis of SRM data from complex metabolomic samples, we have developed the Metabolite Mass Spectrometry Analysis Tool (MMSAT). MMSAT is a web-based tool that objectively quantifies every metabolite peak detected in a set of samples and aligns peaks across multiple samples to enable quantitative comparison of each metabolite between samples. The analysis incorporates quantification of multiple peaks/ions that have different chromatographic retention times but are detected within a single SRM transition. We compare the performance of MMSAT against existing tools using a human glioblastoma tissue extract and illustrate its ability to automatically quantify multiple precursors within each of three different transitions.

Focus on applying the QbD concept to analytical methods has increased as it is fully integrated within pharmaceutical processes and especially in the process control strategy. In addition, there is the need to switch from the traditional checklist implementation of method validation requirements to a method validation approach that should provide a high level of assurance of method reliability in order to adequately measure the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the drug product. The intended purpose of analytical methods is directly related to the final decision that will be made with the results generated by these methods under study. The final aim for quantitative impurity assays is to correctly declare a substance or a product as compliant with respect to the corresponding product specifications. For content assays, the aim is similar: making the correct decision about product compliance with respect to their specification limits. It is for these reasons that the fitness of these methods should be defined, as they are key elements of the analytical target profile (ATP). Therefore, validation criteria, corresponding acceptance limits, and method validation decision approaches should be settled in accordance with the final use of these analytical procedures. This work proposes a general methodology to achieve this in order to align method validation within the QbD framework and philosophy. β-Expectation tolerance intervals are implemented to decide about the validity of analytical methods. The proposed methodology is also applied to the validation of analytical procedures dedicated to the quantification of impurities or active product ingredients (API) in drug substances or drug products, and its applicability is illustrated with two case studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acase studies 3acompliance 3adrugs 3aingredients 3aprocess control 3aproduct quality1 aZiemons, E.1 aMarini, R.D.1 aBoulanger, B.1 aHubert, Ph.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Jan. 03, v. 84, no. 1 p.106-112dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac202664s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245016200210300001600372520134400388592002801732650001901760650001201779650001501791650001401806650001001820650000901830650001301839650001301852650002401865650002501889650001201914650001301926650001101939650001301950653002301963653002001986653002302006653002402029653001902053700002002072700002102092773010602113856008702219852000902306655001202315IND60635192120221123021506.0200103e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063519212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhaleel, Abbas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0346-384X10aTi-doped γ-Al2O3 versus ZSM5 zeolites for methanol to dimethyl ether conversion: In-situ DRIFTS investigation of surface interactions and reaction mechanism  ap. 174-181.  aSolid acids are promising catalytic materials for the dehydration of methanol vapor to dimethyl ether, which has recently been recognized as an ultraclean environmentally friendly fuel. In the present work, methanol conversion to dimethyl ether was studied on the surface of Ti(IV)-doped γ-Al₂O₃ and over selected ZSM5 zeolites aiming at understanding the possible effect of the Ti ions, and to compare between the possible mechanisms over the studied catalyst surfaces. Doping γ-Al₂O₃ with Ti resulted in modified textural properties and an enhanced overall surface acidity. In-situ DRIFTS study of adsorption showed that the presence of Ti resulted in the formation of more acidic hydroxyl groups on the surface leading to an enhanced adsorption of methanol and conversion to dimethyl ether. Comparison between the studied alumina-based solids and ZSM5 zeolites showed that the acidic character of their surface OH groups varied and therefore, different routes of methanol reaction were proposed for the two types of materials. Methanol adsorption was proposed to be associative on the surface of ZSM5 zeolites, where Brønsted acid sites played a key role in the adsorption and dehydration reaction. On the other hand, dissociative adsorption on Lewis acid-base pairs dominates the interactions with γ-Al₂O₃-based solids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3afuels 3aions 3amethanol 3amoieties 3areaction mechanisms 3asurface interactions 3atexture 3atitanium 3avapors 3azeolites 0aSurface adsorption 0aSurface acidity 0aCatalytic activity 0aTextural properties 0aIn-situ-DRIFTS1 aAhmed, Mo’ath1 aSowaid, Salem Ba0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 June 20, v. 571 p.174-181dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245009000211300001600301506007600317520114800393592002801541506003701569650001001606650001101616650001301627650000901640650002001649650001001669650001801679650001001697650001001707650000901717650001701726650002101743650003001764650002001794650001001814650002701824650001001851700002201861700002401883700006101907700002301968700003801991773013002029856008202159852000902241655001202250IND60589025020221207055808.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058902502DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2980-22doi7 aPMC57853952pmcid7 a293916342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzadpanah, Mehrnaz10aSimple and fast multiplex PCR method for detection of species origin in meat products  ap. 698-703.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIdentification of animal species is one of the major concerns in food regulatory control and quality assurance system. Different approaches have been used for species identification in animal origin of feedstuff. This study aimed to develop a multiplex PCR approach to detect the origin of meat and meat products. Specific primers were designed based on the conserved region of mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I (COX1) gene. This method could successfully distinguish the origin of the pig, camel, sheep, donkey, goat, cow, and chicken in one single reaction. Since PCR products derived from each species represent unique molecular weight, the amplified products could be identified by electrophoresis and analyzed based on their size. Due to the synchronized amplification of segments within a single PCR reaction, multiplex PCR is considered to be a simple, fast, and inexpensive technique that can be applied for identification of meat products in food industries. Nowadays, this technique has been considered as a practical method to identify the species origin, which could further applied for animal feedstuffs identification.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasses 3acamels 3achickens 3acows 3aelectrophoresis 3afeeds 3afood industry 3agenes 3agoats 3ameat 3amitochondria 3amolecular weight 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquality control 3asheep 3aspecies identification 3aswine1 aMohebali, Nazanin1 aElyasi gorji, Zahra1 aFarzaneh, Parvaneh1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4124-774X1 aVakhshiteh, Faezeh1 aShahzadeh Fazeli, seyedAbolhassan0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2018 Feb., v. 55, no. 2 p.698-703dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2980-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012100176300001400297520113800311592002801449650002101477650002201498650001601520650002001536650000801556650001401564650002001578650001101598650001601609650002401625653001701649653001401666653001201680653002201692653001501714653000901729700002201738773010901760856008701869852000901956655001201965IND60541515920221117232432.0190318e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054151592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2014.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdoye, Fatou Toutie10aCharacterization of ice recrystallization in ice cream during storage using the focused beam reflectance measurement  ap. 24-34.  aIce recrystallization was investigated in two commercial and differently stabilized ice creams using an original and real time particles counting and sizing method: the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM). Ice cream A (with locust bean gum – LBG – as primary stabilizer) and ice cream B (with carrageenan as primary stabilizer) were stored for 154days at four different temperatures (−5, −8, −12 and −18°C) and three amplitudes of temperature fluctuations (±0.1°C, ±0.75°C, ±2.5°C). Crystal’s size distributions were assessed at various time and recrystallization kinetic data were derived by fitting the experimental results to the asymptotic Ostwald ripening model. As expected, recrystallization rates increase with mean storage temperature and amplitude of temperatures fluctuations. Carrageenan seems to be more effective than LBG in slowing down ice crystal growth during storage. Mean ice crystal size increased as a function of time1/3 for both ice creams. The temperature dependence of recrystallization rate fitted Arrhenius well, with activation energies fairly similar for ice creams A and B.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstwald ripening 3aactivation energy 3acarrageenan 3acrystallization 3aice 3aice cream 3alocust bean gum 3amodels 3areflectance 3astorage temperature 0aIce crystals 0aIce cream 0aStorage 0aRecrystallization 0aStabilizer 0aFBRM1 aAlvarez, Graciela0 tJournal of food engineering.g2015 Mar., v. 148 p.24-34dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2014.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245018800214300001800402520155600420592002801976596008302004596008302087650001102170650001502181650001302196650001902209650000902228650002702237650002202264650002402286700006102310700005902371700006502430700006402495700002502559700006402584700005902648700006002707773012402767856008302891852000902974655001202983IND60729827920221121224824.0210731e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072982792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-06076-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza-Shibatta, Lenice1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1948-507110aIsolation and characterization of microsatellite markers in two species of the neotropical Epicharis (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Centridini) genus and cross-amplification in related species  ap. 1977-1983.  aGenetics can provide invaluable tools for management and conservation of bee populations, which are declining worldwide. Among these tools, microsatellite are very useful molecular markers for population analyses. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize microsatellites for Epicharis (Anepicharis) dejeanii and Epicharis (Epicharis) nigrita, two Neotropical species of solitary bees, both exhibiting the habit of nesting in aggregations. Microsatellite loci were identified from two enriched genomic libraries. The characterization and analysis of loci were carried out using 35 females of E. dejeanii and 34 of E. nigrita. In total, we report the development of 12 microsatellite loci for E. dejeanii and 13 for E. nigrita. For E. dejeanii, all loci were polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 12, averaging 8.7 and, observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.485 (range 0.229–0.857) and 0.633 (range 0.288–0.843), respectively. For E. nigrita, only nine out of 13 loci amplified were polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 12, averaging 5.5. For this species, the observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.440 (range 0.118–0.676) and 0.545 (range 0.167–0.814), respectively. Cross-amplification of primers was successful in other Centridini species. The two sets of loci described for E. dejeanii and E. nigrita species are polymorphic and informative and show promising applicability for both population genetic approaches and relatedness on these and other Centridini species.  aPublisher supplied data  a305343/2018-1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a306932/2016-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aApidae 3aNeotropics 3agenomics 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular biology 3apopulation genetics1 aRicardo, Paulo C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3716-72561 aPina, Welber C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8886-25421 aFlaresso-Neto, Vilmar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3476-01421 aFreiria, Gabriele A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8499-69061 aKotelok-Diniz, Thais1 aGaglianone, Maria C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9206-28951 aArias, Maria C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1477-101X1 aSofia, Silvia H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3443-06960 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.1977-1983dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-06076-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03842naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016000169300001600329520259400345592002802939650001202967650001102979650002602990650001403016650001203030650001403042650001103056650001603067651002203083700001603105700002203121700002503143700002603168700002003194700001903214700001903233773009003252856008103342852000903423655001203432IND50074330920221120152710.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007433092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-014-2393-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKetchum, James T.10aInter-island movements of scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) and seasonal connectivity in a marine protected area of the eastern tropical Pacific  ap. 939-951.  aMarine top predators are common at offshore bathymetric features such as islands, atolls, and seamounts, where most pelagic reef fish reside, while certain sharks perform inter-island movements between these formations. Scalloped hammerhead sharks are known to school in great numbers at small islands and seamounts in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) and are very susceptible to fisheries while moving into the open sea. It is, therefore, essential to understand hammerhead inter-island movements and environmental effects to provide baseline information for their conservation and management within and beyond an insular marine protected area. Movements of scalloped hammerheads were analyzed in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) and ETP, and environmental factors were linked to their movements. Hammerheads were tagged (N = 134) with V16 coded pingers (July 2006 to July 2010) in the northern Galapagos and detected at listening stations around four islands in the GMR and two isolated islands in the ETP, 700 and 1,200 km away. Hammerheads formed daytime schools at specific locations, but dispersed at night. Overall, more daytime than nighttime detections were recorded at all receivers in the northern Galapagos Islands, and more detections in the up-current sides of these islands. Hammerheads remained more days at the northern islands during part of the warm season (December–February) compared to the cool; however, fewer individuals were present in March–June. Movement modes were diel island excursions (24-h cycles) in the northern Galapagos and inter-island in the GMR and ETP at different scales: (1) short back-and-forth (<50 km, SBF), <5 days cycles, (2) medium distance (50–300 km, MDT), 5–20 days, and (3) long distance (>300 km, LDT), 15–52 days. The high degree of inter-island connectivity of hammerheads within the northern GMR is striking compared to the almost nil movement to the central GMR. A seasonal migratory pattern to locations offshore is indicated by (1) fewer hammerheads observed in the northern GMR during part of the warm season (March–June) and (2) evidence of LDT movements from the northern GMR to other islands in the ETP. LDT movements of mature female hammerheads are possibly associated with pupping areas. Our results indicate that currents, season, and individual behavior mainly drive inter-island movements of hammerheads at small (SBF) and medium (MDT) scales. These findings have important implications for the management of a highly mobile and endangered top predator within a marine protected area and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphyrna 3aatolls 3aenvironmental factors 3afisheries 3aislands 3apredators 3asharks 3awarm season 3aGalapagos Islands1 aHearn, Alex1 aKlimley, A.

The generalization research community needs to broaden its scope to include thematic cartography and geovisualization. Generalization is not new to these areas of cartography, and has in fact always been involved in thematic geographic visualization, despite rarely being acknowledged. We illustrate this involvement with several examples of famous, public-audience thematic maps, noting the generalization procedures involved in drawing each, both across their basemap and thematic layers. We also consider, for each map example we note, which generalization operators were crucial to the formation of the map’s thematic message. The many incremental gains made by the cartographic generalization research community while treating reference data can be brought to bear on thematic cartography in the same way they were used implicitly on the well-known thematic maps we highlight here as examples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3ajournals 3aspatial data 3athematic maps 3atopographic maps1 aTouya, Guillaume1 aBereuter, Pia0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 June 04, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90603713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016800169300001600337520191500353592002802268650001902296650001102315650002502326650001102351650001302362650002202375650002302397650001202420650001202432650001502444650001302459650001102472650001302483650002002496700002102516700002102537700002102558700001702579773009002596856004802686852000902734655001202743IND50074331020221120152251.0140329e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007433102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-014-2394-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarravieri, Alice10aMoulting patterns drive within-individual variations of stable isotopes and mercury in seabird body feathers: implications for monitoring of the marine environment  ap. 963-968.  aOne major limitation in the use of body feathers of seabirds as a monitoring tool of the trophic structure and contamination levels of marine ecosystems is the degree of heterogeneity in feather chemical composition within individuals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that moulting patterns drive body feather heterogeneity, with synchronous moult minimizing within-individual variations, in contrast to asynchronous feather growth. Chicks of white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis (representative of bird chicks) and adults of king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus (representative of adult penguins) that moult their body feathers synchronously showed very low within-individual variations in their feather δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values and mercury (Hg) concentrations. By contrast, body feathers of adults of Antarctic prions Pachyptila desolata (representative of adult seabirds with asynchronous feather growth during a protracted moult) presented much higher within-individual variances for the three parameters. These findings have three important implications for birds presenting a synchronous body moult. (1) They suggest that all body feathers from the same individual have identical δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values and Hg content. (2) They predict negligible within-individual variations in the body feather values of other useful stable isotopes, such as δ²H and δ³⁴S, as well as in the concentrations of other compounds that are deposited in the keratin structure. (3) Analysis of one or any number of pooled body feathers is equally representative of the individual. In conclusion, we recommend that long-term routine monitoring investigations focus on birds presenting synchronous rather than asynchronous moult of body feathers both in marine and terrestrial environments. This means targeting chicks rather than adults and, for seabirds, penguins rather than adults of flying species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcellariidae 3aadults 3achemical composition 3achicks 3afeathers 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amercury 3amolting 3amonitoring 3apenguins 3aprions 3aseabirds 3astable isotopes1 aBustamante, Paco1 aChurlaud, Carine1 aFromant, Aymeric1 aCherel, Yves0 tMarine biology.g2014 Apr., v. 161, no. 4 p.963-968dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-014-2394-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016100158300001600319520187600335592002802211650001202239650001902251650002102270650001902291650001502310650002302325650001302348650001402361650001202375650001802387650002202405650001402427650002102441650003002462650001402492650002202506650002402528650006202552650001502614700001802629700001702647700001302664700001302677700002502690773010802715856007502823852000902898655001202907IND60529050820221119223528.0160717e20120103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052905082DNAL7 a10.1021/ac20269422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei Yun10aHighly Parallel Single-Molecule Amplification Approach Based on Agarose Droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction for Efficient and Cost-Effective Aptamer Selection  ap. 350-355.  aWe have developed a novel method for efficiently screening affinity ligands (aptamers) from a complex single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) library by employing single-molecule emulsion polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the agarose droplet microfluidic technology. In a typical systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) process, the enriched library is sequenced first, and tens to hundreds of aptamer candidates are analyzed via a bioinformatic approach. Possible candidates are then chemically synthesized, and their binding affinities are measured individually. Such a process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, inefficient, and expensive. To address these problems, we have developed a highly efficient single-molecule approach for aptamer screening using our agarose droplet microfluidic technology. Statistically diluted ssDNA of the pre-enriched library evolved through conventional SELEX against cancer biomarker Shp2 protein was encapsulated into individual uniform agarose droplets for droplet PCR to generate clonal agarose beads. The binding capacity of amplified ssDNA from each clonal bead was then screened via high-throughput fluorescence cytometry. DNA clones with high binding capacity and low Kd were chosen as the aptamer and can be directly used for downstream biomedical applications. We have identified an ssDNA aptamer that selectively recognizes Shp2 with a Kd of 24.9 nM. Compared to a conventional sequencing–chemical synthesis–screening work flow, our approach avoids large-scale DNA sequencing and expensive, time-consuming DNA synthesis of large populations of DNA candidates. The agarose droplet microfluidic approach is thus highly efficient and cost-effective for molecular evolution approaches and will find wide application in molecular evolution technologies, including mRNA display, phage display, and so on.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3abacteriophages 3abinding capacity 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3acost effectiveness 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aligands 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 3atechnology1 aZhang, Wenhua1 aLiu, Zhiyuan1 aLi, Cong1 aZhu, Zhi1 aYang, Chaoyong James0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Jan. 03, v. 84, no. 1 p.350-355dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac20269423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245014900167300001800316500002000334520131100354592002801665596005801693650002101751650002201772650002601794650002601820650002801846650001101874650001401885650000901899650002901908650002501937650001401962650002301976650001401999700002202013700002302035700002702058700001502085700003102100700005802131700005702189773013102246856007902377852000902456655001202465IND60655580120221120074207.0190803e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065558012DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.147132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClermont, Olivier10aCharacterization and rapid identification of phylogroup G in Escherichia coli, a lineage with high virulence and antibiotic resistance potential  ap. 3107-3117.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe phylogeny of the Escherichia coli species, with the identification of seven phylogroups (A, B1, B2, C, D, E and F), is linked to the lifestyle of the strains. With the accumulation of whole genome sequence data, it became clear that some strains belong to a group intermediate between the F and B2 phylogroups, designated as phylogroup G. Here, we studied the complete sequences of 112 strains representative of the G phylogroup diversity and showed that it is composed of one main sequence type complex (STc)117 and four other STcs (STc657, STc454, STc738 and STc174). STc117, which phylogeny is characterized by very short internal branches, exhibits extensive O diversity, but little H‐type and fimH allele diversity, whereas the other STcs are characterized by a main O, H and fimH type. STc117 strains possess many traits associated with extra‐intestinal virulence, are virulent in a mouse sepsis model and exhibit multi‐drug resistance such as CTX‐M production. Epidemiologic data on 4,524 Australian and French strains suggest that STc117 is a poultry‐associated lineage that can also establish in humans and cause extra‐intestinal diseases. We propose an easy identification method that will help to trace this potentially virulent and resistant phylogroup in epidemiologic studies.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEQ20161136698cFondation pour la Recherche Médicale 3aEscherichia coli 3aallelic variation 3aanimal disease models 3aantibiotic resistance 3aepidemiological studies 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3amice 3amultiple drug resistance 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3asepsis (infection) 3avirulence1 aDixit, Ojas V.

The time to first flowering and peak flowering are useful attributes for understanding how species and vegetation will respond to different fire intervals. Using a plant fire-response trait framework, we investigate patterns of reproduction in south-western Australian kwongan and woodland after prescribed fires with a 30-year longitudinal study, with the aim of identifying appropriate fire intervals. Modelling of post-fire flowering responses of species and aggregating responses into plant functional types showed substantial differences in the time after fire to first and peak flowering. Tests of hypotheses of flowering patterns after fire with different fire-response traits showed that (1) resprouters flower sooner than recruits of non-resprouters, (2) serotinous non-resprouters reach first and peak flowering later than do non-resprouters with soil-stored seed, (3) species in taller strata reach first and peak flowering later than those in lower strata and (4) geophytes flower earlier than other resprouters that lose their aboveground biomass in fire. The most fire interval-sensitive non-resprouting serotinous species take 15–20 years in kwongan to reach peak flowering and in Allocasuarina woodland 25–30 years, providing a working hypothesis for minimum fire intervals in the plant communities under investigation. Our study illustrates the value of long-term ecological studies for informing biodiversity management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllocasuarina 3aaboveground biomass 3abiodiversity 3aflowering 3ageophytes 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3aplant communities 3aprescribed burning 3areproduction 3ashrublands 3awoodlands 3aAustralia1 aHopkins, A.

Neonatal pigs, 1–2 days old, with an initial bodyweight of 1.63 ± 0.04 kg, were randomly allotted to 10 isocaloric diets varying in lysine concentration from 0.76 to 1.62 g lysine/MJ gross energy (GE). Diets were formulated using whey protein concentrate and casein as protein sources and contained similar balance of indispensable amino acids. On day 1 of the experiment, pigs were fed 350 g liquid diet/kg metabolic bodyweight (BW0.75) according to the average BW of all pigs. On day 2, feeding rate was increased to 400 g/kg BW0.75. Increments were 100 g/kg BW0.75 per day for the subsequent 3 days until pigs reached 700 g/kg BW0.75 on day 5. Thereafter, feed was offered to pigs at a common feeding level of 700 g/kg BW0.75 each day until they reached 5.5 kg BW. Feed intake and BW were measured daily. Concentration of fat in the carcass decreased (P < 0.05) and the ratio of crude protein (CP) to fat in the carcass increased (P < 0.05) linearly as lysine inclusion increased. Both average daily gain and CP accretion increased (quadratic, P < 0.05), whereas fat accretion decreased (quadratic, P < 0.05) as lysine inclusion increased. Using the maximum point of the quadratic function, the estimated dietary lysine required for maximal growth (271 g/day) and CP accretion (45.2 g/day) was 1.41 and 1.32 g lysine/MJ GE, respectively. The dietary lysine required, estimating the requirement at the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for CP accretion of 42.9 g/day, was 1.12 g lysine/MJ GE. Gross efficiency of CP deposition (CP deposition/CP intake) achieved a maximum of 0.85 at 1.01 g lysine/MJ GE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily gain 3acasein 3aconfidence interval 3acrude protein 3afeed intake 3afeeding level 3aliquid diet 3alysine 3aprotein sources 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3awhey protein concentrate 0aneonatal pigs.1 aLewis, H.

In this study, a sensitive and efficient ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) method was used for systematic identification of the total flavonoids in Plumula nelumbinis. Based on comparisons of retention times, mass spectrometry data and molecular weights with standards and references, thirty-eight flavonoid compounds were unambiguously or tentatively identified. Ten flavonoids were detected for the first time in Nelumbo and fifteen flavonoids were detected for the first time in Plumula nelumbinis. The study revealed a positive correlation between total flavonoids and the results of the antioxidant activity determinations which were accomplished with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assays. In 13 Chinese habitats that were examined for the first time, the content of flavonoids varied from 44.51 ± 0.58 to 117.82 ± 0.35 μg RE/mg DW. Among of them, Hunanxiangtan and Shandongheze provinces produce plants with the highest content of flavonoids, and also exhibiting the strongest antioxidant activity measured in the three assays. These two habitats could therefore have advantages over other habitats. This study applies rational and effective utilities to the analysis of Plumula nelumbinis samples from different habitats and allows their evaluation as natural medicines or functional food materials in commercial processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aNelumbo 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3ahabitats 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3atraditional medicine 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aPlumula nelumbinis 0aFlavonoids 0aUPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS 0aAntioxidant1 aTian, Wenyue1 aYang, Chao1 aShi, Weipeng1 aCao, Peihong1 aLong, Jiatang1 aXiao, Luomin1 aWu, Yang1 aLiang, Jizheng1 aLi, Xiaobin1 aZhao, Suqing1 aZhang, Kun1 aZhi, Hui1 aSun, Pinghua0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Jan., v. 127 p.36-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245017700201300001600378520176300394592002802157596006802185650002202253650001902275650002202294650001202316650001802328650002402346650002302370650002202393650001402415650001902429650002702448650002202475650002502497651001202522700001602534700002702550700002802577700002902605700001802634700002102652700002702673700002302700700001902723700001702742773012102759856008202880852000902962655001202971IND60729828220221121224802.0210303e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072982822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-020-01232-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarr, Awa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6743-310810aGenetic Diversity and Population Structure Analyses of Wild Relatives and Cultivated Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) from Senegal Using Simple Sequence Repeat Markers  ap. 112-124.  aCowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.)) is an important crop for food security in Senegal; therefore, understanding the genetic diversity of local germplasm is relevant for crop improvement and genetic maintenance in the era of climate change. For this purpose, 15 microsatellite markers were used to estimate the genetic diversity of Senegalese cowpea germplasm, including 671 accessions grown in eight regions and 66 wild relatives and intermediate forms (weedy). For the cultivated, the main expected heterozygosity (mHe) ranged between 0.317 (Fatick) and 0.439 (South). A narrow genetic variation between accessions from the different regions was observed with genetic similarity ranging from 0.861 to 0.965 and genetic differentiation indices (Fst) between 0.018 and 0.100. The accessions from southern Senegal (Kédougou, Sédhiou, and Kolda regions) are more diverse than the others. However, the accessions from the North (Saint-Louis) are genetically different from other regions. The diversity analysis in wild relatives from Senegal, which had never been performed before, revealed that the wild/weedy forms remain more diverse than the cultivated with genetic diversity values (He) of 0.389 and 0.480, respectively. STRUCTURE software divided the Senegalese germplasm into five subpopulations. Three of them (i, ii, and iii) included only cultivated accessions from several regions, one (v) mainly from Saint-Louis, and one (iv) the wild/weedy with some cultivated accessions. Our results support the hypothesis that Vigna unguiculata var. spontanea is the wild progenitor of cowpea. The accessions from the South, the northern recession accessions, and the wild/weedy could serve as sources of new genes for the genetic improvement of cowpea in Senegal.  aPublisher supplied data  aProjectcWest African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) 3aVigna unguiculata 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3acowpeas 3afood security 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheterozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular biology 3apopulation structure 3aSenegal1 aBodian, Amy1 aGbedevi, Kodjo Mawuena1 aNdir, Khadidiatou Ndoye1 aAjewole, Oyatomi Olaniyi1 aGueye, Badara1 aFoncéka, Daniel1 aDiop, Elisabeth A.M.C.1 aDiop, Baye Magatte1 aCisse, Ndiaga,1 aDiouf, Diaga0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2021 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.112-124dSpringer USwJournal:jnl43465x0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-020-01232-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245015800208300001600366506007600382520120800458592002801666506003701694650002101731650002801752650003201780650002301812650001101835650002201846650001401868650002101882650001501903650001301918650002301931650001201954650001301966650002201979653001202001653000902013653000702022653001702029653002402046653002302070653002102093653002402114700001502138700001902153773012102172856008502293852000902378655001202387IND60648269420221207091501.0200121e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064826942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2019.06.0162doi7 aPMC66683602pmcid7 a312519012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yunxiang10aInteraction between γC87 and γR242 residues participates in energy coupling between catalysis and proton translocation in Escherichia coli ATP synthase  ap. 679-687.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFunctioning as a nanomotor, ATP synthase plays a vital role in the cellular energy metabolism. Interactions at the rotor and stator interface are critical to the energy transmission in ATP synthase. From mutational studies, we found that the γC87K mutation impairs energy coupling between proton translocation and nucleotide synthesis/hydrolysis. An additional glutamine mutation at γR242 (γR242Q) can restore efficient energy coupling to the γC87K mutant. Arrhenius plots and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that an extra hydrogen bond could form between the side chains of γC87K and βTPE381 in the γC87K mutant, thus impeding the free rotation of the rotor complex. In the enzyme with γC87K/γR242Q double mutations, the polar moiety of γR242Q side chain can form a hydrogen bond with γC87K, so that the amine group in the side chain of γC87K will not hydrogen-bond with βE381. As a conclusion, the intra-subunit interaction between positions γC87 and γR242 modulates the energy transmission in ATP synthase. This study should provide more information of residue interactions at the rotor and stator interface in order to further elucidate the energetic mechanism of ATP synthase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aglutamine 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysis 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3amutation 3asimulation models 0aAMP-PNP 0aCCCP 0aMD 0aATP synthase 0aEnergy transmission 0aMolecular dynamics 0aMutational study 0aResidue interaction1 aMa, Xinyou1 aWeber, Joachim0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 1860, no. 8 p.679-687dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2019.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245016100160300001800321500002000339520133600359592002801695650001501723650002501738650002401763650001401787650001701801650001501818650001601833650001101849650002301860650000901883650001101892650001101903650001401914650001801928700003001946700002001976773013101996856007302127852000902200655001202209IND60572075620221117030719.0170712e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057207562DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.81672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhahom, Traiphop10aEffects of steam‐microwave blanching and different drying processes on drying characteristics and quality attributes of Thunbergia laurifolia Linn. leaves  ap. 3211-3219.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Dried Thunbergia laurifolia leaves are usually prepared using tray drying, resulting in products that have lost substantial amounts of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity. The maturity of the raw material, blanching techniques and drying methods were investigated in order to select the best condition to produce high qualities of dried T. laurifolia leaves. RESULTS: The 1st stage of maturity was selected and steam‐microwave blanching (SMB) for 4 min was adequate for blanching leading to the maximum recovery of bioactive compounds. The modified Halsey model was the best desorption isotherm model. A new drying model proposed in this study was the best to fit the drying curves as compared to five common drying models. Moisture diffusivities were increased with the increase of drying temperature when combining SMB and heat pump‐dehumidified drying. Microwave heat pump‐dehumidified drying (MHPD) provided the shortest drying time, high specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) and could reduce drying time by 67.5% and increase caffeic acid and quercetin by 51.24% and 60.89%, respectively. CONCLUSION: MHPD was found to be the best drying method and provided the highest antioxidant activity and bioactive compounds content, high SMER and short drying time. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aThunbergia 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3ablanching 3acaffeic acid 3adesorption 3adiffusivity 3adrying 3adrying temperature 3aheat 3aleaves 3amodels 3aquercetin 3araw materials1 aPhoungchandang, Singhanat1 aKerr, William L0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 Aug., v. 97, no. 10 p.3211-3219dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.81673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012400159300002000283520094500303592002801248650001601276650002401292650001801316650002401334650001301358650001901371650002301390650001901413650001501432650001501447650001501462650001701477700001801494700001201512700002001524773012401544856007401668852000901742655001201751IND60640462420221120215342.0190504e20160329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064046242DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra02840c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing, Fangwang10aDandelion-like ZnS/carbon quantum dots hybrid materials with enhanced photocatalytic activity toward organic pollutants  ap. 31551-31558.  aIn this paper, dandelion-like ZnS was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method, and then as the support to further synthesize dandelion-like ZnS/carbon quantum dot hybrid materials. Multiple techniques were applied to investigate the structures, morphologies, electronic and optical properties of the samples. It can be observed that the carbon quantum dots were distributed uniformly on the surface of the ZnS. The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared materials were investigated by the photodegradation of methylene blue, Rhodamine B and the colorless antibiotic ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, respectively. The as-synthesized hybrid materials exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than that of the pure ZnS under simulated sunlight (λ > 380 nm), indicating a broad-spectrum of photocatalytic degradation activity.

This study analyzes the heavy metal-induced glutathione (GSH) accumulation and the regulation at the intracellular heavy metal level in P. chrysosporium. P. chrysosporium accumulated high levels of GSH, accompanied with high intracellular concentrations of Pb and Cd. Pb bioaccumulation lead to a narrow range of fluctuation in GSH accumulation (0.72–0.84 μmol), while GSH plummeted under Cd exposure at the maximum value of 0.37 μmol. Good correlations between time-course GSH depletion and Cd bioaccumulation were determined (R² > 0.87), while no significant correlations have been found between GSH variation and Pb bioaccumulation (R² < 0.38). Significantly, concentration-dependent molar ratios of Pb/GSH ranging from 0.10 to 0.18 were observed, while molar ratios of Cd/GSH were at the scope of 1.53–3.32, confirming the dominant role of GSH in Cd chelation. The study also demonstrated that P. chrysosporium showed considerable hypertolerance to Pb ions, accompanied with demand-driven stimulation in GSH synthesis and unconspicuous generation of reactive oxygen stress. GSH plummeted dramatically response to Cd exposure, due to the strong affinity of GSH to Cd and the involvement of GSH in Cd detoxification mechanism mainly as Cd chelators. Investigations into GSH metabolism and its role in ameliorating metal toxicity can offer important information on the application of the microorganism for wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3achelating agents 3achelation 3aglutathione 3aheavy metals 3ahyperaccumulators 3aions 3alead 3ametabolism 3aoxygen 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 2aCadmiumxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aLeadxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aOxidative Stress 2aPhanerochaetexdrug effectsxmetabolism.1 aLiu, Liang1 aZeng, Guangming1 aHuang, Danlian1 aLai, Cui1 aZhao, Meihua1 aHuang, Chao1 aLi, Ningjie1 aWei, Chen,1 aWu, Haipeng1 aZhang, Chen1 aLai, Mingyong1 aHe, Yibin0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 July, v. 98, no. 14 p.6409-6418dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-5667-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01214naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007000162300001800232520026700250592002800517650002700545650002300572650002300595650001200618700002200630700002200652700002100674773013400695856007400829852000900903655001200912IND60659717120221119173827.0190823e20130418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065971712DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc37043c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerrier, Aurélie10aFull ring closing in a diarylethene hexamer: insights from theory  ap. 4247-4249.  aFirst principle simulations of an extended hexameric molecular switch are reported.

The transfer process of conjugated fatty acids (CFAs) into fish muscle tissue was evaluated by gas chromatography–flame ionization detection (GC‐FID) and easy ambient sonic‐spray ionization mass spectrometry (EASI‐MS). RESULTS: The results showed that conjugated fatty acids were transferred from enriched diet for muscle tissue of Nile tilapia. Conjugated linoleic acids biosynthesis from conjugated linolenic acids was also observed after 10 days. Other important fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic (DHA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and arachidonic (AA) acids were also identified over time; however, DHA showed the highest concentration when compared with EPA and AA compounds. CONCLUSION: Therefore, the nutritional quality of Nile tilapia was improved through feeding with enriched diets. The ingestion of these fish may contribute to reaching adequate levels of daily CFA consumption. Furthermore, other important substances which play an important role in human metabolism, such as EPA, DHA and AA, can also be ingested together with CFA. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aarachidonic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aconjugated linolenic acid 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afish 3agas chromatography 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aionization 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3ameat 3amuscle tissues 3anutritive value 3atung oil1 ade Figueiredo, Luana C1 aMartins, Alessandro F1 aMonteiro, Johny P1 aJunior, Oscar OS1 aCanesin, Edmilson A1 aMaruyama, Swami Arêa1 aVisentainer, Jesuí V0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 Aug., v. 97, no. 10 p.3469-3475dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.81493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245007900183300001800262520148100280592002801761650002901789650001301818650002501831650001901856650001301875650001101888650001401899650001401913650000901927650001301936650003701949650004401986650004902030650005002079650002802129650002502157650003202182650003802214650003902252650002702291650002402318650001702342700001702359700001602376700001802392700001302410773011602423856008102539852000902620655001202629IND50090610620221118165726.0150216e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009061062DNAL7 a247055072pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-014-5670-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xiaojin10aPolymer antimicrobial coatings with embedded fine Cu and Cu salt particles  ap. 6265-6274.  aMany diseases spread due to the bacterial infections, which cause significant economic and personal losses. Contact with infected surfaces is likely to catch infections. Hence, antimicrobial surfaces play an important role in public sectors that can prevent the spreading of disease and infection. Coatings on contact surfaces have been used to provide antimicrobial function. Copper (Cu), as one of the commonly used metals, has long been known to possess germ-killing properties. However, metallic Cu or Cu coatings have not been widely used for the purposes of antimicrobial due to the heavy weight, relatively high cost, limited corrosion resistance and low compatibility of the metal with substrates of non-metallic materials. We have recently developed a polymer-based coating system containing mixtures of fine particles of Cu and Cu salt, which provides excellent antimicrobial properties. The results indicate that the coating with embedded fine Cu salt showed higher antimicrobial property than the coating with only Cu due to the release of more Cu ions. The elimination of 10⁶bacteria by contacting the polymer-Cu coatings needs 8 h, while contacting with the polymer-CuCl₂coatings took only 20 min to kill the same amount of bacteria. We have also used transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron infrared microscopy technique to study the degradation of bacterial cell membrane to understand the mechanism of the antimicrobial function of Cu coating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acell membranes 3acoatings 3acopper 3acorrosion 3aeconomics 3aions 3apolymers 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aCell Membranexdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aCoated Materials, Biocompatiblexpharmacology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCopperxpharmacology 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aMicrobial Viabilityxdrug effects 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPolymersxpharmacology 2aSaltsxpharmacology 2aTime Factors1 aYang, Zhendi1 aWang, Yuxin1 aTay, See Leng1 aGao, Wei0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 July, v. 98, no. 14 p.6265-6274dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-5670-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03945naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013100158300002000289520213700309592002802446650004402474650002202518650001502540650001502555650002102570650002502591650003602616650001302652650001102665650002002676650001402696650002802710650001702738650003902755650002002794650002102814650002102835650001402856650001802870650001902888650002202907650003302929650002102962650001502983650003702998650002503035650001903060700001503079700001903094700002003113700001503133773012403148856007403272852000903346655001203355IND60640462820221120163859.0190504e20160412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064046282DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra02850k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Farooq10aSystematic elucidation of interactive unfolding and corona formation of bovine serum albumin with cobalt ferrite nanoparticles  ap. 35719-35730.  aNanoparticles (NPs) are extensively being used in modern nano-based therapies and nano-protein formulations. The exposures to these comprehensively used NPs lead to changes in protein structure and functionality, hence raising grave health issues. In this study, we thoroughly investigated the interaction and adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with CoFe₂O₄ NPs by circular dichroism (CD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results indicate that CoFe₂O₄ NPs cause fluorescence quenching in BSA by a static quenching mechanism. The negative values of van't Hoff thermodynamic expressions (ΔH, ΔS and ΔG) corroborate the spontaneity and exothermic nature of static quenching. The major contributors of higher binding affinity of CoFe₂O₄ NPs with BSA were van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, BSA protein corona formation on CoFe₂O₄ NPs was confirmed by SEM, TGA, DLS and zeta potential studies. TGA, DLS and zeta potential results confirmed the formation of a thick layer of BSA on CoFe₂O₄ NPs with negative boost in zeta potential. This coating of BSA over CoFe₂O₄ NPs leads to a decrease in the magnetic saturation value from 50.4 to 46.2 emu, hence the magnetic character of CoFe₂O₄ NPs. The development of protein corona on CoFe₂O₄ NPs was further estimated by comparing the steady state fluorescence quenching and theoretical data. In addition, FTIR, UV-CD, and UV-visible spectroscopy and three dimensional fluorescence techniques confirmed that CoFe₂O₄ NP binding could induce microenvironment perturbations leading to secondary and tertiary conformation changes in BSA. Furthermore, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the significant changes in microenvironment around tryptophan (Trp) residue caused by CoFe₂O₄ NPs. The denaturing of BSA biochemistry by CoFe₂O₄ NPs was investigated by assaying esterase activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3abinding capacity 3abovine serum albumin 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acoatings 3acobalt 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3aferrimagnetic materials 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aheat production 3ahydrogen bonding 3alight scattering 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3aprotein corona 3aprotein structure 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3atryptophan 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avan der Waals forces 3azeta potential1 aZhou, Ying1 aLing, Zhaoxing1 aXiang, Qingqing1 aZhou, Xing0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 12, v. 6, no. 42 p.35719-35730dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra02850k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010300167300001700270520177100287592002802058650002402086650002302110650002402133650001502157650001302172650002302185650002202208650001902230650002202249650001602271651001002287700001502297700001902312773010902331856008102440852000902521655001202530IND60519242220221121130900.0160423e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051924222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-016-1103-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkimura, Tokiyo10aDifferential processes underlying the roadside distributions of native and alien plant assemblages  ap. 995-1009.  aAlthough biological invasion often alters ecosystem properties and community composition at different scales, considerable uncertainty still exists regarding the underlying mechanisms that regulate the spread of alien species into new habitats. An alien invasion is generally achieved through multiple processes from multiple sources; this type of invasion often prevents us from understanding of the dispersal mechanisms. Here, we aim to disentangle the processes of alien invasion by focusing on a single migration source. We surveyed the distribution of alien and native plant species in Shiretoko National Park, located in northern Japan. We measured the coverage of each species and the environmental and spatial factors in 362 quadrats established along roadsides. We found 101 native species and 35 alien species (γ-diversity) throughout the quadrats. The local species richness (α-diversity) was higher for the alien species (6.1 species) than for the native species (3.2 species). There was a significant negative correlation in α-diversity between native and alien species. Moreover, the α-diversity and distance from the nearest town (migration source) showed a negative relationship for alien assemblages while the native assemblages showed the opposite trend. These results suggest that the alien species are expanding their distribution outward from the town, resulting in a decrease in the α-diversity of native species in localities close to the migration source. Overall, our results emphasize that roadsides could unintentionally act as corridors for alien species, even in protected areas. Careful consideration is thus needed for utilizing these human-created habitats even though they were designed for conservation and management purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3aconservation areas 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3anational parks 3aspecies diversity 3auncertainty 3aJapan1 aKoide, Dai1 aMori, Akira S.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2016 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.995-1009dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1103-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014700171300001600318520104300334592002801377650001601405650001201421650001201433650002001445650001801465650001401483650001301497650002101510650001401531650001301545650001001558650002001568651001201588653001301600653002601613653001601639653003101655653003601686700002301722700002501745700001901770773012201789856008401911852000901995655001202004IND60122220120221118011315.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012222012DNAL7 a10.1080/10256016.2014.9229632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPucher, Johannes10a15N tracer application to evaluate nitrogen dynamics of food webs in two subtropical small-scale aquaculture ponds under different managements  ap. 428-441.  aSmall, semi-intensively managed aquaculture ponds contribute significantly to the food security of small-scale farmers around the world. However, little is known about nutrient flows within natural food webs in such ponds in which fish production depends on the productivity of natural food resources. ¹⁵N was applied as ammonium at 1.1 and 0.4 % of total nitrogen in a traditionally managed flow-through pond and a semi-intensively managed stagnant pond belonging to small-scale farmers in Northern Vietnam and traced through the natural food resources over 7 days. Small-sized plankton (1–60 μ m) was the dominant pelagic biomass in both ponds with higher biomass in the stagnant pond. This plankton assimilated major portions of the applied tracer and showed a high sedimentation and turnover rate. High re-activation of settled nutrients into the pelagic food web was observed. The tracer was removed more quickly from the flow-through pond than from the stagnant pond. A steady nutrient supply could increase fish production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3abiomass 3afarmers 3afish production 3afood security 3afood webs 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aplankton 3aponds 3astable isotopes 3aVietnam 0afood web 0anatural food resource 0anitrogen-15 0asemi-intensive aquaculture 0astable isotope tracer technique1 aMayrhofer, Richard1 aEl-Matbouli, Mansour1 aFocken, Ulfert0 tIsotopes in environmental and health studies.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 50, no. 4 p.428-441dTaylor & Francisx1477-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2014.9229633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245011400211300002000325520126600345592002801611650000901639650001901648650001901667650001801686650001301704650001801717650003101735650002001766650001601786650001601802700006801818773011601886856008402002852000902086655001202095IND60606766520221121093325.0180727e20171219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060676652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b032772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulkarni, Amol A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6146-125510aInsights in the Diffusion Controlled Interfacial Flow Synthesis of Au Nanostructures in a Microfluidic System  ap. 14315-14324.  aContinuous segmented flow interfacial synthesis of Au nanostructures is demonstrated in a microchannel reactor. This study brings new insights into the growth of nanostructures at continuous interfaces. The size as well as the shape of the nanostructures showed significant dependence on the reactant concentrations, reaction time, temperature, and surface tension, which actually controlled the interfacial mass transfer. The microchannel reactor assisted in achieving a high interfacial area, as well as uniformity in mass transfer effects. Hexagonal nanostructures were seen to be formed in synthesis times as short as 10 min. The wettability of the channel showed significant effect on the particle size as well as the actual shape. The hydrophobic channel yielded hexagonal structures of relatively smaller size than the hydrophilic microchannel, which yielded sharp hexagonal bipyramidal particles (diagonal distance of 30 nm). The evolution of particle size and shape for the case of hydrophilic microchannel is also shown as a function of the residence time. The interfacial synthesis approach based on a stable segmented flow promoted an excellent control on the reaction extent, reduction in axial dispersion as well as the particle size distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amass transfer 3ananogold 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3awettability1 aSebastian Cabeza, Victor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6873-52440 tLangmuir.g2017 Dec. 19, v. 33, no. 50 p.14315-14324dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b032773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012200168300001600290520212100306592002802427650002402455650001402479650001102493650003102504650001002535650003202545650002302577650001102600650002002611650002002631650001702651650001102668650001402679650002302693650003102716653001802747653002202765653001302787653002102800700001502821700001702836700001602853700001402869700001802883773009802901856008602999852000903085655001203094IND60602850120221119134746.0180711e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060285012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeinert, M.10aBenefits of hybridisation of diesel driven rail vehicles: Energy management strategies and life-cycle costs appraisal  ap. 897-904.  aHybridisation of diesel-driven rail vehicles is already possible and promises significant reductions in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions (nitrogen oxides and particulate matter). However, current performance can be significantly improved by introducing technologies such as energy storage systems. The aim of this paper is to investigate the energy management strategies and technical life cycle cost aspects of railway-specific hybridisation architectures. To do so, twelve promising combinations of system architectures, energy storage systems and railway duty cycles have been selected, described and analyzed.A method based on a MATLAB/SIMULINK model has been used with three different approaches for the energy management strategy optimization (i) the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy as baseline optimization; (ii) dynamic programming to determine the global optimum and (iii) a sensitivity analysis approach for the energy storage systems. Based on these boundary conditions, a hybridisation life cycle cost analysis has been carried out. As part of this analysis three different fuel price scenarios have been considered (i) low price of 0.78€/l; (ii) medium price of 1.12€/l; (iii) high price of 1.64€/l.The results show that different energy storage technologies achieve diverse life cycle costs, triggering a range of investment, replacement and maintenance costs, as well as significantly reduced operational costs due to lower fuel consumption. In addition, the simulation results show that fuel consumption can be reduced up to 20%, in some cases rising to approximately 25% if energy management strategies are applied. Of these, Start/Stop and downsizing of the internal combustion engine are the most promising strategies for the emission reduction. Both require auxiliaries’ electrification and appropriate integration of energy storage systems. LCC results also indicate that operational conditions with high annual mileage are most beneficial when a hybrid consisting of an internal combustion engine and an energy storage system is used in a high fuel price scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic programming 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuels 3ainternal combustion engines 3alife cycle costing 3amodels 3anitrogen oxides 3aoperating costs 3aparticulates 3aprices 3arailroads 3astorage technology 3avariance covariance matrix 0aHybridisation 0aEnergy management 0aRailways 0aLife cycle costs1 aMelzer, M.1 aKamburow, C.1 aPalacin, R.1 aLeska, M.1 aAschemann, H.0 tApplied energy.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 157 p.897-904dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.05.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015400165300001600319520100800335592002801343650002401371650001301395650002201408650002501430650001701455650001801472650001701490650001201507650001301519650001701532650001201549650001301561650001301574650002501587650003301612650001401645700001501659700001801674700001601692773009101708856008501799852000901884655001201893IND60113982720221119232147.0141112e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011398272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2012.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Ying10aMedium optimization for the high yield production of single (+)-terrein by Aspergillus terreus strain PF26 derived from marine sponge Phakellia fusca  ap. 887-891.  aTerrein has potential application in the fields of medicine, cosmetology and agriculture, however, the chemical synthesis of terrein with single configuration is a difficult task, and the biosynthesis of terrein always results in low production (ca. 0.33–400mg/L). In this study, we reported an Aspergillus terreus strain PF26 which could produce (+)-terrein on a high level. After the selection of a suitable basic medium, the component concentrations were optimized using Plackett–Burman design and response surface methodology. Consequently, an optimal medium containing 28.41g glucose, 23.18g maltose, 20.00g mannitol, 8.52g malt extract, 10.00g monosodium glutamate 10.00g NH₄Cl in 1L ASW was obtained, and a high (+)-terrein production of 3.71g/L fermentation broth was achieved, which represents the highest fermentation production of (+)-terrein to date.

The contributions of β-glucan and starch molecular fine structure to physicochemical properties of wholemeal oat flour and to the texture of oat-fortified white salted noodles were investigated here. Hardness of oat-fortified noodles was controlled by the longer amylopectin chains (DP ≥ 26) and amount of longer amylose chains (DP ≥ 1000). Higher levels of β-glucan, in the range from 3.1 to 5.2%, result in increased noodle hardness. Pasting viscosities of wholemeal oat flour positively correlate with the hardness of oat-fortified noodles. The swelling power of oat flour is not correlated with either pasting viscosities of oat flour or noodle hardness. Longer amylopectin chains and the amount of longer amylose chains both control the pasting viscosities of oat flour, which in turn affect noodle texture. This provides new means, based on starch and β-glucan molecular structure, to choose oats with optimal starch structure and β-glucan content for targeted oat-fortified noodle quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abeta-glucans 3acarbohydrate structure 3ahardness 3anoodles 3anutritive value 3aoat flour 3aoats 3apasting properties 3aswelling (materials) 3atexture 3aviscosity 3awheat 3awheat flour 0aOat 0aβ-glucan 0aSize exclusion chromatography 0aStarch 0aPhysicochemical properties1 aGilbert, Robert G.1 aGidley, Michael J.1 aFox, Glen P.0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 324 p.126858-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1268583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03987naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006400145245007800209300001800287500002000305520253500325592002802860596002102888650002002909650001502929650001202944650001902956650001602975650002202991650001603013650001803029650002003047650001703067650002203084650001503106650002203121650001803143650001103161650001103172650001003183650001703193651001203210700006703222773012703289856008003416852000903496655001203505IND60776295820221119233639.0220505e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077629582DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.141322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalfour, Nicholas J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2426-389814aThe disproportionate value of ‘weeds’ to pollinators and biodiversity  ap. 1209-1218.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAgricultural intensification has been implicated in global biodiversity declines. In the European Union, agri‐environmental schemes are designed to address this. For pollinating insects, funding has been provided to sow wildflower mixes. However, previous research indicates that a suite of agricultural weeds are also of great importance to pollinators. Here, we compare the biodiversity associated with the species which are considered harmful to agricultural production and legally deemed as ‘injurious’ by the United Kingdom 1959 Weeds Act (common ragwort Jacobaea vulgaris, creeping thistle Cirsium arvense, spear thistle C. vulgare, curled dock Rumex crispus and broadleaved dock R. obtusifolius), with plant species recommended for pollinator‐targeted agri‐environmental options. In our field study, the abundance and diversity of pollinators visiting the weed species averaged twice that of the recommended plants and included the main insect orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera). This relationship was also seen in a meta‐analysis of literature data, which indicates that fourfold more flower‐visitor species and fivefold more conservation‐listed species are associated with the weeds. Additionally, the literature shows that twice the number of herbivorous insect species are associated with these plants. We suggest that several factors are responsible for this pattern. Injurious weed species are widely distributed, their flower morphology allows access to a wide variety of pollinator species, and they produce, on average, four times more nectar sugar than the recommended plant species. Freedom of information requests to public bodies such as local councils, Natural England and Highways England indicate that c. £10 million per year is spent controlling injurious weeds. Meanwhile, the cost of the four pollinator‐targeted agri‐environmental options in the United Kingdom exceeds £40 m annually. Synthesis and applications. Our results clearly show that weeds have an underappreciated value to biodiversity. Unfortunately, current UK agricultural policy encourages neither land sparing for nor land sharing with weeds. The UK government is, however, currently committed to overhauling agricultural payments to encourage more wildlife‐ and climate‐friendly practices. Thus, the challenge of reconciling the conflicts between agricultural production and these native and biodiverse species should be a renewed priority to land managers, researchers and policymakers.  aPublisher supplied data  cRowse Honey Ltd. 3aCirsium arvense 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aEuropean Union 3aHymenoptera 3aJacobaea vulgaris 3aLepidoptera 3aRumex crispus 3aapplied ecology 3abiodiversity 3aflower morphology 3aherbivores 3aintensive farming 3ameta-analysis 3anectar 3asugars 3aweeds 3awild flowers 3aEngland1 aRatnieks, Francis L.

The presence of Cu (II), added in range between 0.06 and 0.4mM, increases both algal viability and synthesis of carotenoids, mostly lutein and β-carotene. A copper concentration of 0.2mM was found to be as the most appropriate one to enhance productivity and lutein accumulation and was further used in semicontinuous cultures. Unlike acidophile microalgae, C. onubensis showed unusual high growth rates (0.50d⁻¹) when cultured semicontinuously at 0.2mM Cu (II) and getting an average productivity of 0.42gl⁻¹d⁻¹. Lutein content in 0.2mM Cu (II) cultures was roughly 50% higher than that obtained for control cultures. C. onubensis seems to have great potential as lutein producer when compared to known lutein accumulating microalgae. C. onubensis is able to live in highly selective environment, which confers the microalga a competitive advantage over other organisms that cannot survive at such low pH and high concentrations of heavy metals. This might make of C. onubensis a unique alga for large producer in open systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccomyxa 3abeta-carotene 3abiomass production 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alutein 3amicroalgae 3apH 3aviability1 aRuiz-Domínguez, M.

To define the temperature preferences of larvae over a defined linear range, we developed an assay using a temperature gradient. To establish a single-directional gradient, two aluminum blocks are connected to independent water baths, each of which controls the temperature of individual blocks. The two blocks set the lower and upper limits of the gradient. The temperature gradient is established by placing an agarose-coated aluminum plate over the two water-controlled blocks so that the plate spans the distance between them. The ends of the aluminum plate that is set on the top of the water blocks defines the minimum and maximum temperatures, and the regions in-between the two blocks form a linear temperature gradient. The gradient assay can be applied to larvae of different ages and can be used to identify mutants that exhibit phenotypes, such as those with mutations affecting genes encoding TRP channels and opsins, which are required for temperature discrimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aaluminum 3aambient temperature 3aanimals 3afruit flies 3agenes 3alandscapes 3alarvae 3amutants 3amutation 3aopsin 3aphenotype 3atransient receptor potential channels1 aSokabe, Takaaki1 aMontell, Craig0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 June 25, , no. 136 p.e57963-e57963dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/579633Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57963/a-temperature-gradient-assay-to-determine-thermal-preferences  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245011500181300001600296520166100312592002801973650001502001650002902016650001902045650001102064650001502075650001402090650001102104650001002115650001502125650002202140650002102162650001302183651001102196700001802207700002302225700001902248773010802267856008102375852000902456655001202465IND60519242720221121130843.0160423e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051924272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-016-1099-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro Neto, José Domingos,10aChronic anthropogenic disturbance causes homogenization of plant and ant communities in the Brazilian Caatinga  ap. 943-956.  aAlthough chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) represents a significant threat to the integrity of tropical biotas, few efforts have been made to understand its impacts. We address the effects of CAD on plant and ant communities in the Caatinga, a seasonally dry tropical forest in northeast Brazil. Both taxa were recorded across 25 0.1-ha plots within a 220-km² landscape dominated by old-growth vegetation exposed to human activities. CAD was measured indirectly via a disturbance index, which was calculated from proxies of human disturbance such as plot distance to roads and villages, and density of people and livestock. Plant and ant abundance was not correlated to the CAD index. However, CAD had negative, positive or neutral effects on species diversity, depending upon diversity measure, taxa and soil type; e.g. plants were more negatively affected than ants. Furthermore, several plant and ant species exhibited higher abundance in the most disturbed vegetation patches while some exhibited lower abundance. Species-level responses resulted in taxonomic responses at the community level and increments in cross-plot species similarity as CAD increased. Our results indicate that: (1) CAD affects several community-level attributes, but with differing intensities; (2) community-level effects can be either positive or negative, and effects are soil dependent; (3) plants are more negatively affected than ants; (4) some species benefit, while others are negatively affected by CAD; and (5) by affecting the abundance and occurrence of particular species, CAD causes biotic homogenization towards the higher end of the disturbance gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aanthropogenic activities 3ahomogenization 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3apeople 3aroads 3asoil types 3aspecies diversity 3atropical forests 3avillages 3aBrazil1 aArnan, Xavier1 aTabarelli, Marcelo1 aLeal, Inara R.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2016 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.943-956dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1099-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245007500197300001800272500002000290520199200310592002802302596004502330596003102375650002002406650001102426650001202437650002002449650001202469650001102481650001302492650000902505650001702514650001002531650002302541700001702564773012602581856007702707852000902784655001202793IND60776296020221119233445.0220505e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077629602DNAL7 a10.1029/2018WR0240892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoth, T.

We present results from a 6‐year study on snow‐forest interactions. This data set reveals the central role Tₐᵢᵣ plays in how a forest intercepts snow and the need to effectively incorporate this within snow process models. Warm temperature events show a higher canopy interception efficiency (CIE) for all sites across the study period, while colder Tₐᵢᵣ events demonstrated a lower corresponding CIE. Additionally, there is a structural component of the forest itself that plays a role in the ability of canopy to intercept snow. Recognizing the physical vertical structure of a forest as nontrivial, we present a simple canopy interception model that includes a novel three‐dimensional forest metric that captures canopy complexity, Gz, combined with event size and Tₐᵢᵣ to adequately predict event‐based interception. Low complexity forests decrease interception capacity from the outset, whereas a highly complex or diverse forest increases interception potential and leads to a nonlinear increase in temperature‐based canopy interception due to more surface area able to intercept falling snow. Essentially, forest structure sets the boundary condition of the potential to intercept, while event size and Tₐᵢᵣ determines the rate or amount of interception. We develop a simple canopy snow interception model from these data and compare modeled output against three commonly used interception models in both a maritime and continental snow climate. Partitioning the relative importance of snow‐forest interactions on canopy interception will help provide the information to accurately model snow‐forest interactions and also aid in our water resources predictive capabilities now and into the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aEAR 1039192cNational Science Foundation  a16‐EARTH16F‐0426cNASA 3aair temperature 3acanopy 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aforests 3amodels 3aresearch 3asnow 3asurface area 3awater 3awater interception1 aNolin, A.

No obvious evaporation processes are detected. A clear signal of the recent precipitation is given by the annual monsoon. The monsoon signal is confirmed by several springs existing in the south at the foot of the Dhofar mountains and sources at Gogub above 450 m and Tawi Atir at 650 m above sea level. They occur here first in the form of water intercepted by trees as stemflow and throughflow. The isotope signature of groundwater in the Dhofar mountains reflects the climatic conditions at the time of recharge and the lithological features of the limestone matrix. To the north, the isotope patterns of the groundwater are continuously depleted from the monsoon signal along the outcropping aquifer D (Lower Umm Er Radhuma). Here, a more negative signature towards the wells in the Najd desert region was observed. Cyclone water that flooded wadis in the Dhofar region occasionally, as observed in November 2011, falls isotopically into the same range as we observed in the fossil groundwater. Taking into account the different sources of precipitation and groundwater and thus a clear distinction of the isotopic composition of the water sources, we conclude a recharge process divided into a southward and a northward component in the Dhofar region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aclimatic factors 3adeuterium 3aevaporation 3afossils 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrochemistry 3alimestone 3amonsoon season 3amountains 3aoxygen 3aseawater 3astable isotopes 3astemflow 3atrees 3awells 3aAustria 3aOman 0adeuterium excess 0aDhofar mountains 0agroundwater 0ahydrogen-2 0aoxygen-18 0arecharge 0aspring water 0awater cycle1 aAl-Mashaikhi, Khalid S.1 aBawain, Abdullah1 aKnöller, Kay1 aFriesen, Jan1 aMüller, Thomas,0 tIsotopes in environmental and health studies.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 50, no. 4 p.475-490dTaylor & Francisx1477-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2014.9614513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013600158300001800294500002000312520157500332592002801907650001601935650001301951650002701964650002301991650001502014650001402029650001602043650002002059650001702079650002302096650001302119650002502132650001502157650001902172650001302191650002302204651001302227700002102240700001602261700002102277773013102298856007302429852000902502655001202511IND60572076420221117030608.0170712e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057207642DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.81842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaurenz, Randy10aDetermination of isoflavone (genistein and daidzein) concentration of soybean seed as affected by environment and management inputs  ap. 3342-3347.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Isoflavones, such as genistein and daidzein, are produced in soybean seed [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and may be associated with health benefits in the human diet. More research is required to determine the effect of agronomic soybean treatments on isoflavone concentration. In this study from 2012 to 2014 at Michigan State University and Breckenridge locations, we have evaluated agronomic input management systems which are marketed to increase or protect potential soybean grain yield, including: nitrogen fertilization, herbicide–defoliant, foliar applied fertilizer, a biological‐based foliar application, foliar applied fungicide, foliar applied insecticide, a seed applied fungicide, and a maximized seed treatment that included fungicide and insecticide as well as an inoculant and lipo‐chitooligosaccharide nodulation promoter, for their effect on soybean seed genistein and daidzein concentrations. RESULTS: Paired comparisons were made between treatments receiving a designated management input and those without the input. Year and location had a significant effect on isoflavone concentrations. Agronomic management inputs impacted soybean seed daidzein concentrations in 15 of 48 field observations and genistein concentrations in 11 of 48 observations. CONCLUSION: The research supports findings that soybean seed isoflavone levels exhibit a location specific response, and the temporal variability experienced between years appears to influence changes in soybean isoflavone levels more than location. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3adaidzein 3afertilizer application 3afoliar application 3afungicides 3agenistein 3agrain yield 3ahuman nutrition 3ainsecticides 3amanagement systems 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anodulation 3aseed treatment 3asoybeans 3atemporal variation 3aMichigan1 aTumbalam, Pavani1 aNaeve, Seth1 aThelen, Kurt D.,0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 Aug., v. 97, no. 10 p.3342-3347dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.81843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01236naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010100163300001800264520029900282592002800581650001200609650001100621650002700632650002300659700002500682700002200707773013400729856007400863852000900937655001200946IND60659718020221119174030.0190823e20130124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065971802DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc37067k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnan, Baiju P.10aSupramolecular design of a bicomponent topochemical reaction between two non-identical molecules  ap. 1494-1496.  aWe report the first design of a topochemical reaction between two non-identical reactants using a supramolecular chemistry approach.

The LBL assembly process is carried out in a nonpolar solvent by the combination of photopolymerization and adsorption of CdSe–Au nanoparticles. Absorption spectra suggest that the LBL assembly is performed in a stepwise and uniform way. The optical, morphological, thermal, and optical limiting properties of the resultant PMMA-SH/CdSe–Au nanocomposite thin films are characterized by transmission, TEM, TGA and laser measurements. The LBL assembled PMMA-SH/CdSe–Au nanocomposite thin films exhibit good thermal stability, transparency, and optical limiting response to a 532 nm pulsed laser. The optical limiting threshold of the PMMA-SH/CdSe–Au nanocomposite thin film is 13 J cm⁻².

Reestablishing geomorphological and hydrological conditions necessary to sustain ecosystems is a central challenge for restoration within highly altered systems. Meeting this challenge requires simultaneously addressing multiple and interacting stressors within the context of irreversible changes and socio‐economic constraints. Traditionally, river restoration approaches either physically change the landscape or channel (channel‐floodplain manipulation) or adjust hydrology (environmental flows), and such actions are often independent. We juxtapose these two subfields of river restoration, which have undergone parallel transformations, from goals of reproducing static representations of form and flow regime to goals of reestablishing processes. The parallel transformations have generated shared ideas, which point to benefits of coupling channel‐floodplain manipulation and environmental flow actions to achieve process‐based goals. Such coupling supports comprehensive river restoration efforts aimed at supporting resilient ecosystems within human dominated landscapes in a nonstationary climate. We identify four elements of coupled approaches for restoring highly modified rivers: (1) identify physical and ecological process potential given interactive effects of altered landscapes and flows; (2) consider capacity for sustaining identified processes under potential future change; (3) model alternatives for coupled restoration actions to support identified processes; and (4) evaluate alternatives using metrics representing integrative effects of coupled actions. We suggest these emergent elements contribute to the development of standard practices for restoring highly modified rivers and encourage an increasing number and quality of coupled applications.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW)  cDelta Stewardship Council, Delta Science Program  a1069333cNational Science Foundation IGERT  aMR‐15‐328473cUC Office of the President's Multi‐Campus Research Programs and Initiatives  aE1120001cCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife through the Ecosystem Restoration Program  a2271cDelta Stewardship Council through the Delta Science Program 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3afreshwater 3ageomorphology 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aresearch 3arivers 3asocioeconomics1 aViers, J.

However, only recently have microplastics in freshwater systems, such as rivers and lakes, been quantified. Microplastic sampling at the surface usually consists of deploying drift nets behind either a stationary or moving boat, which limits the sampling to environments with low levels of suspended sediments and floating or submerged debris. Previous studies that employed drift nets to collect microplastic debris typically used nets with ≥300 µm mesh size, allowing plastic debris (particles and fibers) below this size to pass through the net and elude quantification. The protocol detailed here enables: 1) sample collection in environments with high suspended loads and floating or submerged debris and 2) the capture and quantification of microplastic particles and fibers <300 µm. Water samples were collected using a peristaltic pump in low-density polyethylene (PE) containers to be stored before filtering and analysis in the lab. Filtration was done with a custom-made microplastic filtration device containing detachable union joints that housed nylon mesh sieves and mixed cellulose ester membrane filters. Mesh sieves and membrane filters were examined with a stereomicroscope to quantify and separate microplastic particulates and fibers. These materials were then examined using a micro-attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (micro ATR-FTIR) to determine microplastic polymer type. Recovery was measured by spiking samples using blue PE particulates and green nylon fibers; percent recovery was determined to be 100% for particulates and 92% for fibers. This protocol will guide similar studies on microplastics in high velocity rivers with high concentrations of sediment. With simple modifications to the peristaltic pump and filtration device, users can collect and analyze various sample volumes and particulate sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaquatic environment 3aboats 3acellulose 3acontainers 3adrift nets 3afilters 3afiltration 3afreshwater 3agovernment agencies 3alakes 3amicroplastics 3anylon 3aparticulates 3apollution load 3areflectance 3arivers 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asieves 3asuspended sediment1 aHasenmueller, Elizabeth A.1 aWhite, John R.1 aChambers, Lisa G.1 aConkle, Jeremy L.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 July 28, , no. 137 p.e57969-e57969dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/579693Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57969/sampling-sorting-characterizing-microplastics-aquatic-environments  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010100174300001600275520154900291592002801840650000801868650001901876650000901895650001501904650001701919650001601936650001101952650001701963650001201980650001001992650001602002653002102018653001502039653001902054653000902073653001302082653001602095700001902111700001702130773009802147856008602245852000902331655001202340IND60602851120221122115701.0180711e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060285112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStröhle, Jochen,10aChemical looping combustion of hard coal in a 1MWth pilot plant using ilmenite as oxygen carrier  ap. 288-294.  aThe application of chemical looping combustion (CLC) for capturing CO2 from coal-fired power plants has the potential of very low efficiency penalty and low CO2 avoidance costs compared with first generation CO2 capture technologies. One important step towards commercial application is the demonstration of the technology in autothermal operation in the scale of 1MWth fuel power. This study presents results of a test campaign in a 1MWth CLC plant with hard coal as fuel and ilmenite as oxygen carrier. The results of a six hours period with two hours of constant coal feeding of 0.5MWth are studied in detail. The fuel reactor was fluidized with steam and CO2, and the start-up propane burner was still in operation at minimum load. The overall air ratio in the fuel reactor was around 0.1. This indicates that the solids circulation was slightly too low to keep the fuel reactor temperature at 900°C. The measured gas concentrations at the fuel reactor exit show that it was possible to gasify coal and to convert the main part of the gasification products by the ilmenite. The oxygen demand was around 20%, which is in line with the experience from the Chalmers 100kWth test rig. The air reactor had to be heated by additional combustion of propane, most probably because the inventory of the air reactor was very low leading to low conversion rates of ilmenite. Hence, autothermal operation was not reached. Improved results can be expected by an increase of the solids inventory in the reactors and by an increase of solids circulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3agasification 3ainventories 3aoxygen 3apower plants 3apropane 3asteam 3atemperature 0aChemical looping 0aCombustion 0aCarbon capture 0aCoal 0aIlmenite 0aPilot plant1 aOrth, Matthias1 aEpple, Bernd0 tApplied energy.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 157 p.288-294dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016800166300001600334520143600350592002801786650002601814650002401840650001501864650002601879650001701905650002201922650002301944650001101967650002601978650001402004650002202018650001402040700002202054773010702076856008102183852000902264655001202273IND60519243320221120171334.0160423e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051924332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-016-2644-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Ian A.10aImpact of mining and industrial pollution on stream macroinvertebrates: importance of taxonomic resolution, water geochemistry and EPT indices for impact detection  ap. 103-115.  aThis study investigated freshwater macroinvertebrate communities in waterways contaminated by active and abandoned mining and industrial activities in order to ascertain any impact on freshwater ecosystems. We compared macroinvertebrate communities at the species, family and order levels of taxonomic resolution. We also collected water samples to compare ionic composition and metal concentrations from waste-affected and reference (non-affected) sites. In addition to assessing ecological impairment, the study also sought to determine whether the degree of sensitivity in detecting any impairment varied according to the taxonomic level of identification used. We calculated the biotic indices of EPT richness and taxonomic richness at the species, family and order levels, and performed multivariate analyses to measure differences in community structure at all three levels. We found significant differences in both biotic indices and macroinvertebrate community structure at each taxonomic level, indicating ecological impairment at waste-affected sites. We also concluded that the most appropriate taxonomic level for evaluating macroinvertebrates depends on the information required. In this study, the family level provided the clearest assessment of ecological impairment at waterways affected by mining and/or industrial wastes, and order-level data provided only a marginally less sensitive measure of this impairment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acommunity structure 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ageochemistry 3aindustrial wastes 3amacroinvertebrates 3amining 3amultivariate analysis 3apollution 3aspecies diversity 3awaterways1 aRyan, Michelle M.0 tHydrobiologia.g2016 June, v. 772, no. 1 p.103-115dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2644-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245014200195300001600337520172000353592002802073650001102101650001002112650004302122650001102165650001802176650001202194650000902206650005202215650001202267650002002279650005402299650003502353650002202388650005302410650001102463650003902474650003602513650000902549650002502558650003202583700001802615700001902633700002002652700001302672700001702685700001802702773010002720856004802820852000902868655001202877IND50060951720221119155442.0131017e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006095172DNAL7 a229555632pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-012-1492-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSondergaard, Claus Svane10aPrevascularization of self-organizing engineered heart tissue by human umbilical vein endothelial cells abrogates contractile performance  ap. 439-444.  aEstablishing vascularization is a critical obstacle to the generation of engineered heart tissue (EHT) of substantial thickness. Addition of endothelial cells to the formative stages of EHT has been demonstrated to result in prevascularization, or the formation of capillary-like structures. The detailed study of the effects of prevascularization on EHT contractile function is lacking. Here, we evaluated the functional impact of prevascularization by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in self-organizing EHT. EHT fibers were generated by the self-organization of neonatal rat cardiac cells on a fibrin hydrogel scaffold with or without HUVECs. Contractile function was measured and force–length relationship and rate of force production were assessed. Immunofluorescent studies were used to evaluate arrangement and distribution of HUVECs within the EHT fibers. RT-PCR was used to assess the transcript levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (Hif-1α). EHT with HUVECs manifested tubule-like structures at the periphery during fiber formation. After fiber formation, HUVECs were heterogeneously located throughout the EHT fiber and human CD31+ tubule-like structures were identified. The expression level of Hif-1α did not change with the addition of HUVECs. However, maximal force and rate of force generation were not improved in HUVECs containing EHT as compared to control EHT fibers. The addition of HUVECs may result in sparse microvascularization of EHT. However, this perceived benefit is overshadowed by a significant decrease in contractile function and highlights the need for perfused vascularization strategies in order to generate EHT that approaches clinically relevant dimensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3afibrin 3aheart 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3ahydrocolloids 3ahypoxia 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aCoronary Vesselsxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aHeartxphysiology 2aHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cellsxcytology 2aHumans 2aMyocardial Contractionxphysiology 2aNeovascularization, Physiologic 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTissue Engineeringxmethods1 aWitt, Russell1 aMathews, Grant1 aNajibi, Skender1 aLe, Lisa1 aClift, Tracy1 aSi, Ming-Sing0 tCell and tissue research.g2012 Dec., v. 350, no. 3 p.439-444dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-012-1492-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245010900165300001400274520079200288592002801080650001901108650001601127650001501143650002101158650001101179650001501190650001001205650002301215650001101238651002301249653002101272653001201293653001501305653001501320653001801335653001601353653002501369700002101394700001901415773011701434856007901551961001301630852000901643655001201652IND60129449620221120215018.0151124e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012944962DNAL7 a10.3956/2014-91.1.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandolt, Peter J.10aSeasonal response of Noctua pronuba Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to traps in Washington State  ap. 20-28.  aNoctua pronuba Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), the yellow underwing moth, was recently introduced into western North America. Blacklight traps at multiple sites in eastern Washington State indicate two broad periods of moth flight. A spring flight was evident in May and June, and a late season flight was evident from late August into October. Noctua pronuba moths were captured also in traps baited with acetic acid plus 3-methyl-1-butanol, but not in traps baited with acetic acid or 3-methyl-1-butanol alone. This chemical combination is thought to be a feeding attractant for many noctuid moths and may be useful for monitoring N. pronuba. The seasonal pattern of moths captured in traps baited with this chemical lure was similar to the pattern seen with blacklight traps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNoctua pronuba 3aacetic acid 3abait traps 3ablacklight traps 3aflight 3amonitoring 3amoths 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3aWashington (state) 0ayellow underwing 0acutworm 0aattractant 0ablacklight 0aflight period 0aacetic acid 0a3-methyl - 1-butanol1 aZack, Richard S.1 aRoberts, Diana0 tPan-Pacific entomologist.g2015 Mar., v. 91, no. 1 p.20-28dPacific Coast Entomological Societyx0031-06037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3956%2F2014-91.1.0203Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03855naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016500171300001500336520224400351592002802595650001002623650002202633650002502655650001302680650002102693650001302714650001202727650002002739650001802759650001302777650002202790650001102812650001502823650001402838650001502852650001902867650001502886650001202901651001002913653001802923653002502941653001502966653002102981653001803002700004903020700002703069700001903096773010303115856008603218852000903304655001203313IND60622951320221116173404.0210114e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062295132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsaeda, Takashi10aImpact of regulated water levels on willows (Salix subfragilis) at a flood-control dam, and the use of hydrogen peroxide as an indicator of environmental stress  ap. 96-102.  aPlants are subjected to various environmental stressors, both natural and artificial. Environmental stressors that lead to an excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may adversely affect physiology and well-being of organisms. The amount of ROS, therefore, could potentially be used to quantify environmental stresses in plants. In this study, the effect of changes in the water levels and elevation at which plants are located was examined in the drawdown zone of a flood control dam (Miharu dam), located in Fukushima in northern Japan. The Salix subfragilis willows are an important plant species in the reservoir as these plants are resistant to prolonged submerged conditions and provide the most suitable habitat for the growth and reproduction of many aquatic organisms. S. subfragilis growing in the drawdown zone exhibited high mortality rates from 2008 to 2016. Leaf samples of S. subfragilis were collected in the drawdown zone at different elevations shortly after drawdown (June), and several months after drawdown (August and October). The samples were taken under light exposure; additionally, dark-adapted (30 min) samples were collected in order to evaluate photosystem-induced ROS generation. The mortality rate of S. subfragilis trees was abnormally high over the previous years, particularly at higher elevated sites. Foliar H₂O₂ concentrations were significantly increased in samples collected at August and October samples, compared to June samples. Catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and guaiacol peroxidase activities were also increased, corresponding with the H₂O₂ content. No significant difference in H₂O₂ concentrations was found between samples from the lower edge of the drawdown zone and those collected at constantly inundated sites. The H₂O₂ concentration of light- and dark-treated samples indicated that there was no additional ROS accumulation due to photosynthesis. The results indicated that the high mortality of the trees was associated with long-term exposure to drought conditions due to the drawdown, although this was not confirmed by conventional monitoring. These findings support the use of H₂O₂ as an environmental stress indicator in vegetation management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix 3aaquatic organisms 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3achronic exposure 3adrawdown 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3aflood control 3ahabitats 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3avegetation 3awillows 3aJapan 0aDrawdown zone 0aEnvironmental stress 0aInundation 0aOxidative stress 0aSoil moisture1 aSenavirathna, Mudalige Don Hiranya Jayasanka1 aKrishna, Lekkala Vamsi1 aYoshida, Naoya0 tEcological engineering.g2019 Feb., v. 127 p.96-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245011800156300001800274520102600292650002501318650002101343650001901364650003001383650001501413650001701428650001101445650003201456650001601488650001801504650001401522700001801536700002701554700001701581700002001598700001701618773016101635856004001796852000901836655001201845IND4534851020221119212923.0150821e20140212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453485102DNAL7 a10.1021/jf405072e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Hyung Won10aRapid Identification of Cholinesterase Inhibitors from the Seedcases of Mangosteen Using an Enzyme Affinity Assay  ap. 1338-1343.  aEnzyme binding affinity has been recently introduced as a selective screening method to identify bioactive substances within complex mixtures. We used an assay which identified small molecule binders of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) using the following series of steps: incubation of enzyme with extract; centrifugation and filtration; identification of small molecule content in the flow through. The crude extract contained 10 peaks in the UPLC chromatogram. However, after incubation the enzyme, six peaks were reduced, indicating these compounds bound AChE. All these isolated compounds (2, 3, and 5â8) significantly inhibited human AChE with IC50s = 5.4â15.0 Î¼M and butyrylcholinsterase (IC50s = 0.7â11.0 Î¼M). All compounds exhibited reversible mixed kinetics. Consistent with the binding screen and fluorescence quenching, Î³-mangostin 6 had a much higher affinity for AChE than 9-hydroxycalabaxanthone 9. This validates this screening protocol as a rapid method to identify inhibitors of AChE. 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abinding capacity 3acentrifugation 3acholinesterase inhibitors 3afiltration 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amangosteens 3arapid methods 3ascreening1 aOh, Sei-Ryang1 aCurtis-Long, Marcus J.1 aLee, Ji-Hye,1 aSong, Hyuk-Hwan1 aPark, Ki Hun0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Feb. 12, v. 62, no. 6 p.1338-1343dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf405072e  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245020600163300001600369520079700385592002801182650002601210650001801236650001701254650002001271650002601291650001301317650002901330700001701359700002501376773010801401856007501509852000901584655001201593IND60529048120221116222120.0160717e20120103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052904812DNAL7 a10.1021/ac202361g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolland, Patrick T.10aComment on “Effect of Uncontrolled Factors in a Validated Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry Method Question Its Use as a Reference Method for Marine Toxins: Major Causes for Concern”  ap. 478-480.  aThis recent paper by Otero and co-workers presents some data from analysis of okadaic acid group toxins by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) using different instruments, operating parameters, and solvent conditions.

This paper reveals a lack of understanding of critical factors for the successful use of LC–MS methodology in general as well as some specific proficiency issues with the work reported on the three toxins. We show that there are problems with the conduct and reporting of the experiments, including possible injector carry-over and lack of quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) controls.

Astragalus species are used in Chinese traditional medicine as antiperspirant, antihypertensive, diuretic and tonic treatments and have been used for treatment of patients with leukemia and uterine cancers. The present study was aimed to investigate immunomodulatory effect of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) treatment on Aeromonas hydrophila-infected mice. The present data showed that APS-treatment ameliorated neutrophils phagocytic activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in intestinal tissues of infected mice. Moreover, APS treatment induced a highly significantly (P < 0.001) increase in the number of CD4⁺ T cells in the intestinal tissues and thymus, however, number of CD4⁺ T cells in the spleens of infected mice not significantly changed with APS treatment. On the other hand, APS-treatment caused a very highly significant (P < 0.001) decrease in the number of CD8⁺ T cells in the spleens and thymus of infected mice. In conclusion, the present data suggested that APS treatment reduced ROS production, downmodulated neutrophils activity, and increased CD4⁺/CD8⁺ T cells ratio in A. hydrophila-infected mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aaquatic environment 3acell-mediated immunity 3aimmunomodulators 3aintestines 3aleukemia 3amice 3aneutrophils 3apatients 3aphagocytosis 3apolysaccharides 3areactive oxygen species 3aspleen 3athymus gland 0aAeromonas hydrophila 0aAstragalus polysaccharides 0aPhagocytic index 0aCD4+/CD8+ T cells0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2014 Jan., v. 66 p.48-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2013.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245008400203300001600287506007600303520101600379592002801395506003701423650001701460650002501477650001701502650002001519650001901539650001401558650002801572650002101600650001401621650001701635650001801652650001601670650001901686700001501705700001701720700002401737700002001761773013001781856008201911852000901993655001202002IND60589022720221207075113.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058902272DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2940-x2doi7 aPMC57562162pmcid7 a293588232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Mei10aCaco-2 cell transport of purple sweet potato anthocyanins-phospholipids complex  ap. 304-312.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, the role of phospholipids in transepithelial transport and the impact on the antioxidant activity of purple sweet potato anthocyanins (PSPAs) was evaluated. PSPAs were purified by column chromatography, and then PSPAs-phospholipids complex (PSPAs-PC) was prepared. In antioxidant assay in vitro, PSPAs-PC exhibited potential antioxidant activity; meanwhile, it exhibited relatively higher stability in mimic gastrointestinal digestion conditions. The inhibitory effect of PSPAs-PC on the oxidation of soybean oil was significantly higher after 15 days storage. The presence of phospholipids increased the transepithelial transport of PSPAs; its apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) was higher, while its efflux ratio was lower than PSPAs. Based on the above results, it clearly displays the potential of phospholipids in the promotion of intestinal transport of PSPAs, and further studies are needed to explore the in-depth mechanism of the bioavailability promotion effect of phospholipids.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3achromatography 3adigestion 3agastrointestinal system 3ahuman cell lines 3aoxidation 3apermeability 3aphospholipids 3asoybean oil 3asweet potatoes1 aZhang, Xin1 aCao, Jinxuan1 aCheng, Hsiao-Chieh,1 aZhang, Zhicheng0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2018 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.304-312dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2940-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245010900176300001600285520171300301592002802014650001502042650001302057650001802070650001202088650001102100650001302111650002102124650002202145650001202167650001602179653002002195653003002215653002102245653000802266700002802274700002202302700003002324700006102354700002002415700002002435700006502455700006102520773013302581856009002714852000902804655001202813IND60635189520221122233831.0190801e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063518952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aT.P.

We measured in vitro ticarcillin-clavulanate adsorption to polyacrylonitrile (PAN) filters and the sieving coefficient using a well-described bench model of haemofiltration. The dose of ticarcillin-clavulanate was 60/2 mg or 180/3 mg, and 0 or 12 g albumin was added to the 1 L of circulating blood-crystalloid mixture to produce four different experimental conditions. The experiment was repeated four times under each condition. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) ticarcillin adsorption varied from 28 (27-30) mg to 85 (78-90) mg. Adsorption was increased when the dose of ticarcillin was higher (P<0.001), but was not affected by the addition of albumin. Median (IQR) adsorption of clavulanate ranged from 0.67 (0.55-0.75) mg to 1.8 (0.33-3.5) mg and was neither dose dependent (P = 0.505) nor significantly affected by the addition of albumin. Median (IQR) ticarcillin sieving coefficient ranged from 0.73 (0.67-0.75) to 0.99 (0.97-1.03). It was significantly higher with a higher dose of ticarcillin (P = 0.021) and without addition of albumin (P = 0.015). Median (IQR) clavulanate sieving coefficient ranged from 1.03 (1.00-2.24) to 2.0 (1.98-2.47). Clavulanate sieving coefficient was not significantly affected by dose or the addition of albumin.These data indicate that significant adsorption of both ticarcillin and clavulanate occurs in vitro; however, this requires confirmation by clinical pharmacokinetic studies. The sieving coefficient data may help guide appropriate dosing of critically ill patients receiving haemofiltration until more extensive clinical pharmacokinetic data are available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalbumins 3adose response 3afilters 3amodels 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3apolyacrylonitrile 3asieving 3aticarcillin 0aClavulanic acid 0aRenal replacement therapy 0aCritical illness 0aPAN1 aGuerra Valero, Yarmarly1 aChoi, Gordon Y.S.1 aOrdóñez Mejia, Jenny L.1 aWallis, Steven C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2392-98541 aJoynt, Gavin M.1 aLipman, Jeffrey1 aGomersall, Charles D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8494-80631 aRoberts, Jason A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6218-435X0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2019 Aug., v. 54, no. 2 p.261-264dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2019.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245015200215300001300367520124000380592002801620650002501648650001301673650001801686650001501704650001101719650003301730650000901763650001101772650001501783650002301798650002701821650002001848653001001868653001001878653003501888653003601923653002501959653001901984653002202003653002402025700002602049700001802075700001802093773010102111856008602212852000902298655001202307IND60622951420221116173619.0210114e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062295142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoezzibadi, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5078-957810aTemporal estimation of hydrodynamic parameter variability in stormwater constructed wetlands – The hysteresis effect during multi-rainfall events  ap. 1-10.  aConstructed wetland (CW) systems are increasingly implemented as appropriate water treatment facilities, the efficiency of which varies with time due to possible malfunctions such as clogging related to excessive loads of suspended solids or inadequate CW sizing. Numerical flow modeling was used to evaluate filtering performance and to improve the design of CWs. Such modeling usually involves the so-called van Genuchten-Mualem (vGM) soil hydrodynamic parameters which are difficult to measure. This paper focuses on the sensitivity of the model with respect to the vGM parameters revealing a predominant influence of the shape parameters and the saturated conductivity of the filter on the piezometric heads, during feeding and drainage. A simple, robust and low-cost inverse modeling approach, deterministic and stochastic, for the identification of the soil hydrodynamic properties from piezometric heads measured during successive storm events is also presented. The temporal variability of hydrodynamic parameters was assessed and analyzed with regards to modeling efficiency. Principal component analysis showed that the estimated hydrodynamic parameters from the feeding and drainage sub-periods were significantly different.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstructed wetlands 3adrainage 3ahydrodynamics 3ahysteresis 3amodels 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil 3astorms 3astormwater 3atemporal variation 3atotal suspended solids 3awater treatment 0a76S05 0a35Q35 0aStormwater constructed wetland 0aVan Genuchten-Mualem parameters 0aSensitivity analysis 0aInverse method 0aHysteresis effect 0aModeling efficiency1 aCharpentier, Isabelle1 aWanko, Adrien1 aMosé, Robert0 tEcological engineering.g2019 Feb., v. 127 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03865naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012500156300001600281500002000297520187800317592002802195596005902223596007202282596009002354650002602444650002702470650002702497650001802524650001902542650003502561650001802596650001302614650002402627650002802651650002002679650002002699650001202719650001302731650002102744650001702765650001802782650005302800650002002853650002502873650002402898650001202922650002102934700002002955700001802975700001902993700005503012773012603067856007303193852000903266655001203275IND60655577220221120045051.0190803e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065557722DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.132252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengnan10aPotential role of ALDH3A2 on the lipid and glucose metabolism regulated by (‐)‐hydroxycitric acid in chicken embryos  ap. 961-976.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to investigate the effect of (‐)‐hydroxycitric acid ((‐)‐HCA) on lipid and glucose metabolism, and further analyzed these actions whether associated with modulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A2 (ALDH3A2) expression in chicken embryos. Results showed that (‐)‐HCA decreased triglyceride content and lipid droplet counts, while these effects induced by (‐)‐HCA were reversed in chicken embryos pre‐transfected with sh4‐ALDH3A2. (‐)‐HCA decreased malic enzyme, acetyl‐CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and sterol regulatory element binding protein‐1c mRNA level, while increased carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A) and peroxisome proliferators‐activated receptor α (PPARα) mRNA level; and the action of (‐)‐HCA on lipid metabolism factors had completely eliminated in embryos pre‐transfected with sh4‐ALDH3A2. Chicken embryos pre‐transfected with sh4‐ALDH3A2 had eliminated the increasing of serum glucose and hepatic glycogen content induced by (‐)‐HCA. (‐)‐HCA decreased phosphofructokinase‐1 and increased G6P, fructose‐1,6‐bisphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate carboxylase mRNA level in chicken embryos. Similarly, the effect of (‐)‐HCA on these key enzyme mRNA level was reversed in embryos pre‐transfected with sh4‐ALDH3A2. Furthermore, (‐)‐HCA increased PPAR‐γ‐coactivator‐1α (PGC‐1α), PPARα, hepatic nuclear factor‐4A, PEPCK, and CPT1A protein level, and these actions of (‐)‐HCA disappeared in embryos pre‐transfected with sh4‐ALDH3A2. These results indicated that (‐)‐HCA reduced fat accumulation and accelerated gluconeogenesis via activation of PGC‐1α signaling pathway, and these effects of (‐)‐HCA might associate with the increasing of ALDH3A2 expression level in chicken embryos.  aPublisher supplied data  a31572483cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aJCQY201906cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  cPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD) 3a6-phosphofructokinase 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3ablood glucose 3acarboxy-lyases 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3achick embryos 3adroplets 3afatty-acid synthase 3afructose-bisphosphatase 3agene expression 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3alipid metabolism 3amalic enzyme 3amessenger RNA 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3aprotein content 3apyruvate carboxylase 3asignal transduction 3asterols 3atriacylglycerols1 aYang, Zhongmiao1 aZhang, Huihui1 aPeng, Mengling1 aMa, Haitian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6706-05800 tAnimal science journal =.g2019 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.961-976dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.132253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012200169300001400291520094200305592002801247650002601275650002801301650002601329650001301355650001301368650001401381650002701395653001901422653002201441653002401463653002501487700002801512700001801540700001801558773010001576856008501676852000901761655001201770IND60601499320221123035219.0180706e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060149932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2013.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Dongjun,10aChitosan–cinnamon beads enhance suppressive activity against Rhizoctonia solani and Meloidogyne incognita in vitro  ap. 44-47.  aA novel chitosan–cinnamon bead carrier was prepared in this study.

Kefiran is attractive as thickeners, stabilizers, emulsifiers, gelling agents and also has antimicrobial and antitumor activity. However, the production costs of kefiran are still high mainly due to high cost of carbon and nitrogen sources. This study aimed to produce kefiran and its co-product, lactic acid, from low-cost industrial byproducts. Among the sources tested, whey lactose (at 2% sugar concentration) and spent yeast cells hydrolysate (at 6 g-nitrogen/L) gave the highest kefiran of 480 ± 21 mg/L along with lactic acid of 20.1 ± 0.2 g/L. The combination of these two sources and initial pH were optimized through Response Surface Methodology. With the optimized medium, L. kefiranofaciens produced more kefiran and lactic acid up to 635 ± 7 mg/L and 32.9 ± 0.7 g/L, respectively. When the pH was controlled to alleviate the inhibition from acidic pH, L. kefiranofaciens could consume all sugars and produced kefiran and lactic acid up to 1693 ± 29 mg/L and 87.49 ± 0.23 g/L, respectively. Moreover, the fed-batch fermentation with intermittent adding of whey lactose improved kefiran and lactic acid productions up to 2514 ± 93 mg/L and 135 ± 1.75 g/L, respectively. These results indicate the promising approach to economically produce kefiran and lactic acid from low-cost nutrient sources.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus 3aantineoplastic activity 3abatch fermentation 3acarbon 3acoproducts 3aemulsifiers 3aexopolysaccharides 3agelation 3agelling agents 3ahydrolysates 3aindustrial byproducts 3akefir 3alactic acid 3alactose 3amountains 3anitrogen 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3astabilizers 3athickeners 3awhey 3ayeasts 3aRussia1 aSuksawang, Suwannee1 aYeesang, Jarucha1 aBoonsawang, Piyarat0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2018 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.331-340dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2943-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010100174300001400275520102200289592002801311650003001339650002101369650001801390650001601408650001501424650001301439650002201452650002201474650002001496650001601516650000901532650001201541650001601553650001401569650001601583650001701599650004401616650000901660650001401669653003001683653001401713653001101727653002001738653001501758700002001773700002101793700002501814773011001839856008501949852000902034655001202043IND60601499420221123035355.0180706e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060149942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2014.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIreland, Philip M.14aThe serine protease inhibitor Ecotin is required for full virulence of Burkholderia pseudomallei  ap. 55-58.  aBurkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram negative soil saprophyte that causes the disease melioidosis where clinical symptoms can vary from localised infection to pneumonia and septic shock. Ecotin is a potent periplasmic serine protease inhibitor first identified in Escherichia coli. Ecotin, although present in only a small subset of genera, can inhibit a broad range of serine proteases including those typically associated with the innate immune system such as neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. An Ecotin orthologue identified in B. pseudomallei was recombinantly expressed and found to inhibit elastase. To study the role of Ecotin in B. pseudomallei virulence an in-frame unmarked deletion mutant was created. Infection of a murine macrophages-like cell line revealed Ecotin was necessary for the early stages of colonisation allowing replication following cell entry. Attenuation of the Δeco mutant strain in the murine model of melioidosis further supported Ecotin as a virulence factor of B. pseudomallei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia pseudomallei 3aEscherichia coli 3aanimal models 3acathepsin G 3acell lines 3aelastase 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ainnate immunity 3amelioidosis 3amice 3amutants 3aneutrophils 3apneumonia 3asaprophytes 3aseptic shock 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asoil 3avirulence 0aBurkholderia pseudomallei 0aVirulence 0aEcotin 0aSerine protease 0aMacrophage1 aMarshall, Laura1 aNorville, Isobel1 aSarkar-Tyson, Mitali0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2014 Feb.,  Mar., v. 67-68 p.55-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2014.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245015000160500001900310520106400329592002801393650001101421650001701432650001201449651001201461700001801473700001901491700001701510773015801527856007501685852000901760655001201769IND60703117720221120175333.0200720e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070311772DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi90603402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Xiaohua 13aAn Approach for Filter Divergence Suppression in a Sequential Data Assimilation System and Its Application in Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMathematically describing the physical process of a sequential data assimilation system perfectly is difficult and inevitably results in errors in the assimilation model. Filter divergence is a common phenomenon because of model inaccuracies and affects the quality of the assimilation results in sequential data assimilation systems. In this study, an approach based on an L₁-norm constraint for filter-divergence suppression in sequential data assimilation systems was proposed. The method adjusts the weights of the state-simulated values and measurements based on new measurements using an L₁-norm constraint when filter divergence is about to occur. Results for simulation data and real-world traffic flow measurements collected from a sub-area of the highway between Leeds and Sheffield, England, showed that the proposed method produced a higher assimilation accuracy than the other filter-divergence suppression methods. This indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on the L₁-norm constraint for filter-divergence suppression.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aspatial data 3atraffic 3aEngland1 aWang, Runjie 1 aShi, Wenzhong 1 aLi, Zhiyuan 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 May 26, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90603403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014300171300001400314520132100328592002801649650002001677650001001697650003301707650001201740650001801752650001401770650003101784650001401815650001301829650002701842650001101869651000901880653001501889653001801904653001901922653002601941653000901967700002701976700001802003773011002021856008502131852000902216655001202225IND60601499520221123035411.0180706e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060149952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChehri, Khosrow10aMolecular phylogenetic and pathogenetic characterization of Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC), the cause of dry rot on potato in Iran  ap. 14-19.  aMembers of Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) are common pathogens of potato, causing dry rot in the west of Iran which involved Hamedan, Kermanshah, Eilam and Kurdistan provinces. Therefore, the objectives in this study were to isolate and identify disease-causing FSSC from infected potato tubers based on the morphological and molecular characteristics. Forty-five isolates of Fusarium were obtained from potato tubers collected from the wet market in different regions of the west of Iran and identified as FSSC through morphological characters. All of the isolates were evaluated for their pathogenicity on healthy potato tubers in the planthouse. The tubers rot symptoms were observed on the 21st day after inoculation of Fusarium isolates on the tubers tested. In the tubers inoculation tests, lesion sizes were quite variable; therefore, the measurement was done to compare the depth and width of lesion expansion among the isolates. Based on the sequence data from translation elongation factor (EF-lα) gene and internal transcript spacer (ITS) regions analysis, all of the selected FSSC isolates were divided into two major groups. This is the first report on molecular identification of FSSC strains isolated from potato tubers in Iran and Fusarium falciforme was reported for the first time in Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium solani 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amarkets 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3apotatoes 3atranslation (genetics) 3atubers 3aIran 0aMorphology 0aPathogenicity 0apotato dry rot 0aphylogenetic analysis 0aIran1 aGhasempour, Hamid Reza1 aKarimi, Naser0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2014 Feb.,  Mar., v. 67-68 p.14-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2014.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245007100158300001400229520105000243592002801293650002201321650002401343650001801367650002601385650001701411650001201428650001301440650002401453650001001477650001601487650002101503650001601524700002001540700002201560700002101582700002201603700002101625700002201646700002001668773011701688856007301805852000901878655001201887IND60129450320221122132302.0151126e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012945032DNAL7 a10.1645/12-24.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBichet, Coraline10aEpidemiology of Plasmodium relictum Infection in the House Sparrow  ap. 59-65.  aIn vertebrates, multiple host characteristics and environmental factors are known to influence infectious disease dynamics. Here, we investigated variability in prevalence and parasitemia of Plasmodium relictum in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) across a large number of rural and urban populations (n = 16). We found that prevalence was not predicted by any of the host traits investigated (age, sex, body mass, or wing length). However, parasitemia was significantly higher in females when compared to males and in 1-yr-olds as compared to older individuals. Neither prevalence nor parasitemia differed according to habitat type (urban vs. rural). These results suggest that inter-population variation in parasitemia depends on host intrinsic factors whereas variation in prevalence could be due to environmental differences between populations, such as climatic variables that might affect the abundance of vectors. This large-scale study gives us a better understanding of the key factors involved in the epidemiology of avian malaria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasser domesticus 3aPlasmodium relictum 3aavian malaria 3aenvironmental factors 3aepidemiology 3afemales 3ahabitats 3ainfectious diseases 3amales 3aparasitemia 3aurban population 3avertebrates1 aSorci, Gabriele1 aRobert, Alexandre1 aJulliard, Romain1 aLendvai, Ádám Z1 aChastel, Olivier1 aGarnier, Stephane1 aLoiseau, Claire0 tJournal of parasitology.g2014 Feb., v. 100, no. 1 p.59-65dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2F12-24.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003600155245021000191520171200401592002802113650002002141650002002161650002002181650000902201650001102210650001502221650001902236650001802255650001902273650001602292650002702308651001102335653000802346653000802354653002102362653001302383653002002396653001702416700002702433700003702460700002602497700002602523700003202549700002602581700003002607773009802637856009002735852000902825655001202834IND60648266820221121052943.0190705e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064826682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.1050522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Arruda, Rubiane Mendes Faria10aSpace-time analysis of the incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and prevalence of canine VL in a municipality of southeastern Brazil: Identification of priority areas for surveillance and control  aHuman and canine visceral leishmaniasis (HVL and CVL, respectively) represent serious public health issues in Brazil. The surveillance and control measures currently employed have had limited effect in impeding the territorial expansion of the disease and in reducing the number of cases. We have investigated the space-time distribution of HVL incidence rates and CVL prevalence in the coverage areas of the 148 primary healthcare units in Belo Horizonte (MG, Brazil) during a 6-year period in order to identify those that should be prioritized for disease control actions. Data were smoothed using the empirical Bayes method and analyzed by space-time scanning and application of univariate global Moran’s I index and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) statistics to identify spatial autocorrelations. Point data of CVL were analyzed using the Kernel method. Bivariate global Moran’s I and LISA techniques were employed to identify spatial correlations between HVL and CVL. Based on our results, we were able to formulate two proposals for establishing the prioritization of coverage areas, namely: (i) classification of maximum priority areas as identified by bivariate LISA for HVL and CVL, and (ii) combination of maximum priority areas with high priority areas as identified by univariate LISA for HVL. According to our proposals, 27 coverage areas in Belo Horizonte were categorized as maximum priority and a further 13 were classified as high priority. Our proposals, which are based on practical, feasible and inexpensive statistical tools, will contribute to a better understanding of VL distribution in urban settings and improving the efficiency of governmental control programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3acontrol methods 3adisease control 3adogs 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aprioritization 3apublic health 3aspace and time 3aurban areas 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aBrazil 0aHVL 0aCVL 0aSpatial analysis 0aZoonoses 0aRisk assessment 0aEpidemiology1 aCardoso, Diogo Tavares1 aTeixeira-Neto, Rafael Gonçalves1 aBarbosa, David Soeiro1 aFerraz, Ruan Krubniki1 aMorais, Maria Helena Franco1 aBelo, Vinícius Silva1 ada Silva, Eduardo Sérgio0 tActa tropica.g2019 Sept., v. 197 p.105052-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.1050523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01573naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245021300160300001600373520051300389592002800902650002000930650001800950650001200968650001200980650001000992651001101002700002201013700002301035773011901058856007301177852000901250655001201259IND60129450520221122132238.0151126e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012945052DNAL7 a10.1645/12-88.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimões, Raquel O.10aAdditional Data on the Synlophe of Stilestrongylus aculeata (Travassos, 1918) and Stilestrongylus eta (Travassos, 1937) (Heligmonellidae) Parasitic in Akodon montensis (Sigmodontinae) from the Atlantic Forest  ap. 151-153.  aAdditional data on the synlophe and morphological measurements are provided for the heligmonellids Stilestrongylus aculeata (Travassos, 1918) and Stilestrongylus eta (Travassos, 1937), collected from Akodon montensis Thomas, 1913, of the Atlantic Forest, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary fish oil intake on muscle atrophy and the expression of muscle atrophy markers induced by sciatic nerve denervation in mice. We performed histological and quantitative mRNA expression analysis of muscle atrophy markers in mice fed with fish oil with sciatic nerve denervation. Histological analysis indicated that dietary fish oil intake slightly prevented the decrease of muscle fiber diameter induced by denervation treatment. In addition, dietary fish oil intake suppressed the MuRF1 (tripartite motif‐containing 63) expression up‐regulated by denervation treatment, and this was due to decreased tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) production in skeletal muscle. We concluded that dietary fish oil intake suppressed MuRF1 expression by decreasing TNF‐α production during muscle atrophy induced by sciatic nerve denervation in mice.  aPublisher supplied data  a17K15272cJSPS KAKENHI  cKitasato University Research 3afish oils 3agene expression 3ahistology 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3amuscle fibers 3amuscular atrophy 3anerve tissue 3askeletal muscle 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aKobayashi, Chiaki1 aUchida, Naoyasu1 aOtsu, Shohei1 aTanio, Tatsuki1 aYokoyama, Issei1 aNagasao, Jun1 aArihara, Keizo0 tAnimal science journal =.g2019 Aug., v. 90, no. 8 p.1018-1025dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.132243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012700169300001400296520127000310592002801580650002601608650002001634650002901654650002701683650002001710650001101730650001901741650001801760650002101778650002001799650001901819650001801838650001901856650001701875650001101892650003601903653002601939653001101965653002701976653003502003653002002038653001102058700001702069700001902086700001402105700001602119700001502135700001602150700002002166700001902186773011002205856008502315852000902400655001202409IND60601499720221117165127.0180706e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060149972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2014.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhengkai10aThymol inhibits Staphylococcus aureus internalization into bovine mammary epithelial cells by inhibiting NF-κB activation  ap. 15-19.  aBovine mastitis is one of the most costly and prevalent diseases in the dairy industry and is characterised by inflammatory and infectious processes. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a Gram-positive organism, is a frequent cause of subclinical, chronic mastitis. Thymol, a monocyclic monoterpene compound isolated from Thymus vulgaris, has been reported to have antibacterial properties. However, the effect of thymol on S. aureus internalization into bovine mammary epithelial cells (bMEC) has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluated the effect of thymol on S. aureus internalization into bMEC, the expression of tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) and β-defensin (BNBD5), and the inhibition of NF-κB activation in bMEC infected with S. aureus. Our results showed that thymol (16–64 μg/ml) could reduce the internalization of S. aureus into bMEC and down-regulate the mRNA expression of TAP and BNBD5 in bMEC infected with S. aureus. In addition, thymol was found to inhibit S. aureus-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in bMEC and suppress S. aureus-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these results indicated that thymol inhibits S. aureus internalization into bMEC by inhibiting NF-κB activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aThymus vulgaris 3aantibacterial properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abovine mastitis 3acattle 3adairy industry 3adose response 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3amammary glands 3amessenger RNA 3amonoterpenoids 3anitric oxide 3athymol 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aThymol 0aAntimicrobial peptides 0aBovine mammary epithelial cell 0aBovine mastitis 0aNF-κB1 aZhou, Ershun1 aGuo, Changming1 aFu, Yunhe1 aYu, Yuqiang1 aLi, Yimeng1 aYao, Minjun1 aZhang, Naisheng1 aYang, Zhengtao0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2014 June,  July, v. 71-72 p.15-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2014.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245015200178300001600330520212000346592002802466650001702494650001302511650001802524650001502542650001802557650002102575650001302596650002602609650001802635650001102653650001802664650001502682650002602697650001402723650002702737653001302764653002902777653003102806653001602837653001802853700002402871700005802895773012002953856009003073852000903163655001203172IND60635190120221122131020.0190613e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063519012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmoriello, Tiziana10aVibrational spectroscopy as a green technology for predicting nutraceutical properties and antiradical potential of early-to-late apricot genotypes  ap. 156-166.  aVibrational spectroscopy is considered a green alternative to the traditional analytical methods for quantitative determination of antioxidants in agricultural products. In this study, the potential of NIR and MIR spectroscopy for the prediction of antioxidant compounds in seven early-to-late apricot genotypes from different locations was reported. NIR and MIR calibration models were developed using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) with cross-validation, and the performance of final models was evaluated using Rp2, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and relative predicted determinant (RPD). Five independent PLS models were developed, using both NIR and MIR spectra from 300 samples per year and their corresponding total phenols (TPs), total flavans (FLs), total carotenoids (TCs), antiradical capacity (AC) reference values, yielding coefficient on average always > 0.95. Very good models were obtained for TPs (Rp2 = 0.99, RMSEP = 0.73 g kg−1 GAE, RPD = 12.0; Rp2 = 0.99, RMSEP = 0.95 g kg−1 GAE, RPD = 9.9 for MIR and NIR models, respectively), and FLs (Rp2 = 0.99, RMSEP = 0.99 g kg−1 CAT, RPD = 8.5; Rp2 = 0.98, RMSEP = 1.10 g kg−1 CAT, RPD = 6.4, for MIR and NIR models, respectively). Besides, both MIR and NIR models for total carotenoids (TCs) quantification showed a satisfactorily predictive capability (Rp2 = 0.98, RMSEP = 0.01 g kg-1 β-carotene, RPD = 6.5; Rp2 = 0.95, RMSEP = 0.01 g kg-1 β-carotene, RPD = 4.5, for MIR and NIR models, respectively). Good model performances were also obtained for the prediction of antiradical potential of samples, developed herein for the first time on freeze-dried apricot samples. In general, ATR-MIR demonstrated advantages over NIR in predicting all nutraceutical parameters, whereas similar model performances were obtained for the antiradical potential tested versus ABTS+• using MIR and NIR spectral regions. Results reported in the present study suggest that vibrational spectroscopy, both in MIR and NIR range, is adequate to predict the nutraceutical properties of apricots for screening purposes quickly and sustainably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapricots 3abeta-carotene 3aflavonoids 3afreeze drying 3afunctional foods 3agenotype 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aleast squares 3amodels 3anormal values 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3ascreening 3asustainable technology 0aApricots 0aVibrational spectroscopy 0aGreen analytical chemistry 0aAntioxidant 0aFruit quality1 aCiccoritti, Roberto1 aCarbone, Katya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6382-77130 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2019 Sept., v. 155 p.156-166dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245009100202300001200293506007600305520132500381592002801706506003701734650002001771650002201791650004101813650001201854650001001866650004401876650002001920650002101940650001501961650001501976650001501991650001702006650001602023650001702039650001002056650001102066650000902077650001802086650001002104700001602114700002302130700001902153700001702172773010902189856008202298852000902380655001202389IND60573539720221207092300.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057353972DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-016-0567-72doi7 aPMC51251602pmcid7 a283303262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPallavi, 10aImpact assessment of silver nanoparticles on plant growth and soil bacterial diversity  ap. 254.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study was carried out to investigate the impact of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the growth of three different crop species, wheat (Triticum aestivum, var. UP2338), cowpea (Vigna sinensis, var. Pusa Komal), and Brassica (Brassica juncea, var. Pusa Jai Kisan), along with their impact on the rhizospheric bacterial diversity. Three different concentrations (0, 50 and 75 ppm) of AgNPs were applied through foliar spray. After harvesting, shoot and root parameters were compared, and it was observed that wheat was relatively unaffected by all AgNP treatments. The optimum growth promotion and increased root nodulation were observed at 50 ppm treatment in cowpea, while improved shoot parameters were recorded at 75 ppm in Brassica. To observe the impact of AgNPs on soil bacterial community, sampling was carried out from the rhizosphere of these crops at 20 and 40 days after the spraying of AgNPS. The bacterial diversity of these samples was analyzed by both cultural and molecular techniques (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). It is clearly evident from the results that application of AgNPs changes the soil bacterial diversity and this is further influenced by the plant species grown in that soil. Also, the functional bacterial diversity differed with different concentrations of AgNPs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica juncea 3aTriticum aestivum 3aVigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata 3acowpeas 3acrops 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afoliar spraying 3agrowth promotion 3aharvesting 3ananosilver 3anodulation 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3aroot systems 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3awheat1 aMehta, C.M.1 aSrivastava, Rashmi1 aArora, Sandeep1 aSharma, A.K.0 t3 Biotech.g2016 Dec., v. 6, no. 2 p.254-254dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-016-0567-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011700155300001600272500001500288520116900303592002801472650000901500650002901509650002801538650002201566650001501588650001201603650001101615650001501626650002101641653001401662700002101676700001701697700002201714700001501736700002501751773010801776856007501884852000901959655001201968IND60529048920221119221517.0160717e20120103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052904892DNAL7 a10.1021/ac202419u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xuefei10aCarbohydrate-Based Label-Free Detection of Escherichia coli ORN 178 Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy  ap. 241-246.  a2019-12-06  aA label-free biosensor for Escherichia coli (E. coli) ORN 178 based on faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was developed. α-Mannoside or β-galactoside was immobilized on a gold disk electrode using a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) via a spacer terminated in a thiol functionality. Impedance measurements (Nyquist plot) showed shifts due to the binding of E. coli ORN 178, which is specific for α-mannoside. No significant change in impedance was observed for E. coli ORN 208, which does not bind to α-mannoside. With increasing concentrations of E. coli ORN 178, electron-transfer resistance (Rₑₜ) increases before the sensor is saturated. After the Nyquist plot of E. coli/mixed SAM/gold electrode was modeled, a linear relationship between normalized Rₑₜ and the logarithmic value of E. coli concentrations was found in a range of bacterial concentration from 10² to 10³ CFU/mL. The combination of robust carbohydrate ligands with EIS provides a label-free, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, robust, and portable biosensing system that could potentially be used in a point-of-care or continuous environmental monitoring setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3aenvironmental monitoring 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrodes 3aligands 3athiols 3abiosensors 3aEscherichia coli 0aimpedance1 aKulkarni, Ashish1 aDoepke, Amos1 aHalsall, H.

The main steps are: introduction and tamping of ground coffee in a sealed chamber, introduction of pressurized air into the chamber, the introduction of hot water and a pre-infusion phase. It is substantially different to the usual brewing method used in bars: the driving force for the flow is the pressure difference between the interior and the exterior of the chamber (rather than pressurized hot water provided by a motor-driven pump); the extraction process is partially static; the pressure is higher than the traditional method; and the temperature of the extraction chamber can be controlled (in addition to the water temperature control found in the traditional method). The method has been tested with three chamber temperatures and two pressures. At all settings, espressos produced using this method have particularly high and persistent foam. Furthermore, changes in pressure cause changes in some physical parameters and the amount of key odorants in the headspace above the coffee. A benchmark comparison with the capsule method gives differences in several aromatic compounds and in almost all the physical parameters. In conclusion, the beverage produced by the CF method is clearly recognizable by a thick and very persistent foam layer, while the method appears more flexible than the traditional one as the characteristics of the EC can be adjusted as a function of brewing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaromatic compounds 3abeverages 3abrewing 3afoams 3aheadspace analysis 3aodor compounds 3awater temperature 0aCoffee brewing 0aEspresso 0aExtraction setting 0aFoam 0aFood quality 0aVolatile compounds1 aGuerrini, Lorenzo1 aSpinelli, Silvia1 aCalamai, Luca1 aSpugnoli, Paolo1 aIlly, Francesco1 aParenti, Alessandro0 tJournal of food engineering.g2015 Feb., v. 146 p.204-208dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2014.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013100172300001400303520141700317592002801734650001101762650002601773650001501799650001801814650002301832650002001855650002401875650001101899650001001910650001001920650001601930650002201946650001401968650001501982650001401997650001402011650002502025650002002050653001402070653001102084653002102095653002402116653002602140653002802166700001502194700001602209700002002225700001702245700001702262700001702279773011702296856009002413852000902503655001202512IND60635190220221122131026.0190529e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063519022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yunlong10aMelatonin decreases resistance to postharvest green mold on citrus fruit by scavenging defense-related reactive oxygen species  ap. 21-30.  aMelatonin, an important and conserved indoleamine compound, is involved in many plant physiological functions. Postharvest diseases caused by fungal pathogens lead to huge economic losses worldwide, but nothing is currently known about the role of melatonin in fruit resistance to postharvest diseases. Here, we report on the effect of exogenous melatonin treatment of citrus fruit to postharvest green mold caused by Penicillium digitatum (Pd). Melatonin had no obvious effect on Pd germination and growth, but melatonin treatment of citrus fruit significantly promoted disease phenotype of green mold. In addition, the content and associated enzyme activity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in citrus fruit was induced by Pd infection and H2O2 treatment of citrus fruit decreased disease phenotype of green mold. H2O2 content and associated enzyme activity in citrus fruit was declined after melatonin treatment. Transcriptome analysis identified a lot of differentially expressed genes from citrus upon melatonin treatment, which are mainly involved in cell wall, reactive oxygen species metabolism and plant defense. Our results indicate that melatonin decreases resistance to green mold on citrus fruit by scavenging defense-related reactive oxygen species, which provides significant insights into melatonin function in fruit resistance and also molecular mechanisms of fruit resistance to postharvest diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aPenicillium digitatum 3acell walls 3acitrus fruits 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3afinancial economics 3afruits 3afungi 3agenes 3agermination 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amelatonin 3ametabolism 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3apostharvest diseases 3atranscriptomics 0aMelatonin 0aCitrus 0aFruit resistance 0aPostharvest disease 0aPenicillium digitatum 0aReactive oxygen species1 aFan, Liqin1 aXia, Xuehan1 aWang, Zhongkang1 aYin, Youping1 aCheng, Yulin1 aLi, Zhengguo0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2019 July, v. 153 p.21-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245005600167300001300223520127900236592002801515650001501543650001601558650001201574650002401586650001801610650000901628650004401637650001501681650001201696653002701708653002001735653002101755653001301776653001601789700001701805700001601822773010101838856008401939852000902023655001202032IND60122909120221118035503.0150325e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012290912DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2014.9762822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuporini, P.10aCiliate pheromone structures and activity: a review  ap. 3-14.  aAs in animals and other multicellular organisms, protozoan ciliates communicate via diffusible signalling pheromones. These pheromones have been identified in the culture supernatant of various species. However, their isolation and definitive structural characterization have been achieved only in species of Blepharisma and Euplotes . With the exception of the two B. japonicum pheromones represented by a tryptophan-related molecule and a glycoprotein, all the other pheromones isolated from Euplotes species are proteins that vary in extension between 38 and 109 amino acids. They form species-specific families of structurally homologous members, in full accord with their multi-allelic determination at an apparently single genetic locus. The determination of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) solution structures of E. raikovi and E. nobilii pheromones has provided direct evidence that, although structurally unique, Euplotes pheromones adopt a common, species-specific three-helix folding. This close structural homology among members of the same family well accounts for the pheromone capacity to compete with one another in cell receptor binding reactions and elicit context-dependent, autocrine (growth-promoting) or paracrine (mating-inducing) cell responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3aamino acids 3aanimals 3aautocrine signaling 3aglycoproteins 3aloci 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apheromones 3azoology 0aWater-borne pheromones 0asignal proteins 0aprotist ciliates 0aEuplotes 0aBlepharisma1 aAlimenti, C.1 aVallesi, A.0 tItalian journal of zoology.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 82, no. 1 p.3-14dTaylor & Francisx1748-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2014.9762823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03929naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245017100154300001400325520217000339592002802509650001402537650002802551650001802579650001102597650002502608650001502633650000902648650001302657650001402670650001002684650001502694650001002709650003302719650001802752650001102770650001302781650001402794650001402808650001902822650001502841650002202856650002502878650001402903650001302917650001902930651001002949651001802959700001202977700001502989700001503004700002003019700001903039700002603058700001903084773011703103856007403220852000903294655001203303IND60129450920221122074726.0151126e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012945092DNAL7 a10.1645/13-235.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Su-Fen10aPhylogeography and Demographic History of Gotocotyla sawara (Monogenea: Gotocotylidae) on Japanese Spanish Mackerel (Scomberomorus niphonius) Along the Coast of China  ap. 85-92.  aRecent studies indicate that the northwestern Pacific Ocean is an ideal system in which to study and understand the roles of the Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations and ocean currents in shaping phylogeographic patterns of species, but most of these investigations have been concerned with vertebrates, and only a few have focused on invertebrates. In the present study, we examined the genetic population structure and historic demography of a platyhelminth species, Gotocotyla sawara (Monogenea, Gotocotylidae), a gill parasite of Japanese Spanish mackerel, Scomberomorus niphonius, along the coast of China. A fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene for 169 individuals and the internal transcribed spacers for 24 individuals were sequenced from specimens representing 8 populations of this parasite along the coast of China. High levels of COI haplotype diversity (0.9994) and nucleotide diversity (0.015805) were detected for G. sawara. Phylogenetic analysis revealed no phylogeographical pattern for G. sawara in the sample area. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed no significant differences at all hierarchical levels, and pairwise FST analysis demonstrated a high rate of gene flow of this parasite among different populations in coastal Chinese waters. Moreover, the exact test of differentiation supported the null hypothesis that G. sawara along the coast of China constitutes a panmictic population. Both neutrality tests and mismatch distribution revealed that G. sawara underwent population expansion in the late Pleistocene era. Recent range expansion after the last glacial maximum and insufficient time to attain migration-drift equilibrium may account in part for the lack of genetic structure in the geographic areas considered in this study. Dispersal of parasite eggs and larvae along ocean currents, coupled with the long-distance migrations of host fishes, could also be responsible for genetic homogeneity of this parasite. It is also possible that other hosts of this monogean, such as the ridged-eye flounder, Pleruonichthys cornutus, may contribute to the genetic mixing of Gotocotyla sawara populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonogenea 3aPleuronichthys cornutus 3aScomberomorus 3acoasts 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3ademography 3aeggs 3aflounder 3agene flow 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3amackerel 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3apopulation 3apopulation growth 3apopulation structure 3asea level 3avariance 3awater currents 3aChina 3aPacific Ocean1 aLi, Min1 aYan, Shuai1 aWang, Ming1 aYang, Chao-Ping1 aLun, Zhao-Rong1 aBrown, Christopher L.1 aYang, Ting-Bao0 tJournal of parasitology.g2014 Feb., v. 100, no. 1 p.85-92dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2F13-235.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001200188245011200200300001600312506007600328520110400404592002801508506003701536650002101573650003601594650001701630650002801647650001901675650001301694650001301707700001601720773013001736856008201866852000901948655001201957IND60589023520221207073830.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058902352DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2972-22doi7 aPMC57853882pmcid7 a293916272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXi, Jun10aHigh hydrostatic pressure (HHP) effects on antigenicity and structural properties of soybean β-conglycinin  ap. 630-637.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, the effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on antigenicity, free sulfhydryl group (SH) content, hydrophobicity (Ho), fluorescence intensity and circular dichroism data of soybean β-conglycinin was studied. The antigenicity of soybean β-conglycinin was decreased significantly at pressures 200–400 MPa. The antigenicity inhibition rate of β-conglycinin declined from 92.72 to 55.15%, after being treated at 400 MPa for 15 min. Results indicated that free sulphydryl (SH) groups and surface Ho of β-conglycinin were significantly increased at pressures 200–400 MPa and 5–15 min, whereas these properties decreased at the treatments above 400 MPa and 15 min. The maximum fluorescence intensity was noticed at 400 MPa and 15 min. The circular dichroism data analysis revealed that the amount of β-turns and unordered structure significantly increased, while the content of α-helix1 and β-strand1 noticeably decreased. These results provide evidence that HHP-induced the structural modification of β-conglycinin and could alter the antigenicity of β-conglycinin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta-conglycinin 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3asoybeans1 aHe, Mengxue0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2018 Feb., v. 55, no. 2 p.630-637dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2972-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012600167300001400293520185600307592002802163650001202191650002102203650001702224650002802241650001202269650001802281650001402299650002102313650001602334650001102350650000702361650001202368650001702380650001002397650002002407650002902427650001402456650001802470650001602488650002702504650002202531653004102553653002502594653002102619653001702640653001402657700001702671700002002688700001802708700001902726700002002745773010202765856008602867852000902953655001202962IND60635190420221122131006.0190425e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063519042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, A.K.10aConditioning effects of biodegradable superabsorbent polymer and vermi-products on media properties and growth of gerbera  ap. 23-30.  aWith the objective of identifying an ecologically sustainable substrate for commercial gerbera production, we conducted an experiment to assess the effects of super absorbent polymer and organic vermi-products on the physico-chemical properties of the growing media, and plant growth and flower yield in gerbera cv. Yosemite. CPV (Cocopeat: Perlite: Vermiculite) and soil amended with vermicompost (VC, 20%), Pusa hydrogel (PHG, 0.25%) and horn bio-manure (HBM, 1%) had significant positive effects on growth and flowering of gerbera. The lowest (0.29 ± 0.02 g cm−3) bulk density was recorded in CPV + PHG + HBM while the maximum (59.75 ± 0.63%) water holding capacity was observed in CPV + PHG + VC substrate. The maximum electric conductivity (0.99 ± 0.06 dS m−1) and pH (7.90 ± 0.04) were recorded in Soil + PHG + VC. Plants grown on CPV + PHG + VC media and sprayed with 20% of vermiwash produced the highest number of leaves during the entire period (31 ± 0.58), maximum leaf length (30.18 ± 0.18 cm) and width (8.30 ± 0.16 cm), maximum number of primary roots (42 ± 1.53), highest flowers per plant (19.67 ± 0.33), stalk length (41.08 ± 0.10 cm) and flower head diameter (10.11 ± 0.03 cm). Flowers produced on this medium also had an extended attractive appearance (20.33 ± 0.33 days) and longer vase life (14.33 ± 0.33 days). Water requirement of gerbera (litre/crop season) on CPV + PHG + VC medium, with or without Vermiwash spray was also considerably lower than other treatments. Overall results suggest that CPV amended with PHG and VC coupled with Vermiwash spray provide congenial conditions for gerbera plant growth and flower production while also simultaneously reducing irrigation water use considerably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGerbera 3abiodegradability 3abulk density 3aelectrical conductivity 3aflowers 3agrowing media 3ahydrogels 3airrigation water 3aleaf length 3aleaves 3apH 3aperlite 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asoil amendments 3asuper absorbent polymers 3avase life 3avermicomposts 3avermiculite 3awater holding capacity 3awater requirement 0aBiodegradable superabsorbent polymer 0aGrowth and flowering 0aMedia properties 0aVermicompost 0aVermiwash1 aSindhu, S.S.1 aSingh, Anshuman1 aKumar, Arvind1 aSingh, Anupama1 aChauhan, V.B.S.0 tEcological engineering.g2019 July, v. 132 p.23-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245007300210300001100283506007600294520132400370592002801694506003701722650002201759650001701781650001401798650003801812650001601850650002501866650001401891650001801905650001901923650001901942650000901961650001901970650003701989651001002026700002102036700002002057700002102077700005502098773010802153856008202261852000902343655001202352IND60590559420221207050306.0190128e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059055942DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-018-0927-52doi7 aPMC57786912pmcid7 a293578852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Mohamed A.10aHepatitis B infection and preeclampsia among pregnant Sudanese women  ap. 20.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Previous published studies have reported conflicting results of association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and preeclampsia. There was no published data on HBV and preeclampsia in Africa including Sudan. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between HBsAg seropositivity and preeclampsia. METHODS: A case –controls study (200 women in each arm) was conducted at Saad Abualila Maternity Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. The cases were women with preeclampsia and the controls were healthy pregnant women. Socio-demographic characteristics were gathered using questionnaire and HBsAg was investigated using an ELISA. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the cases and the controls in their age, parity, residence, education and blood groups. The majority of the cases were mild preeclampsia (159; 79.5%). In comparison with the controls, a significantly higher number of the cases were HBsAg seropositive [30 (15.0%) vs.12 (6.0%), P = 0.005]. In binary regression women with HBsAg seropositive were at higher risk of preeclampsia than women who were HBsAg seronegative (OR = 2.86, 95%, CI = 1.41–5.79, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: In the current study HBsAg seropositivity is associated with preeclampsia. Preventive measure should be implemented.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis B virus 3ablood groups 3aeducation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ahospitals 3apre-eclampsia 3apregnant women 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3aseroprevalence 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aSudan1 aSharif, Manal E.1 aRayis, Duria A.1 aNasr, Abubakr M.1 aAdam, Ishag1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5031-77410 tVirology journal.g2018 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.20-20dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-0927-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04260naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001500169245011500184300001600299520213600315592002802451650002302479650002702502650002502529650002902554650002502583650002602608650001102634650001702645650003102662650002102693650002702714650001202741650006802753650001102821650003402832650001102866650001502877650008102892650000902973650002502982650005103007650002203058650001703080653001703097653002403114653003103138653001303169653002103182653001403203653001103217700001703228700001603245700002003261700001803281700001703299700001303316700001703329700001603346773011803362856008503480852000903565655001203574IND50060563120221119175710.0190401e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006056312DNAL7 a232737772pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoll, M.D.13aAn eprinomectin extended-release injection formulation providing nematode control in cattle for up to 150 days  ap. 313-320.  aA series of 10 dose confirmation studies was conducted to evaluate the persistent activity of an extended-release injectable (ERI) formulation of eprinomectin against single point challenge infections of gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes of cattle. The formulation, selected based on the optimal combination of high nematode efficacy, appropriate plasma profile, and satisfactory tissue residue levels, includes 5% poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolic)acid (PLGA) and is designed to deliver eprinomectin at a dose of 1.0mg/kg bodyweight. Individual studies, included 16–30 cattle blocked based on pre-treatment bodyweight and randomly allocated to treatment with either ERI vehicle or saline (control), or the selected Eprinomectin ERI formulation. Treatments were administered once at a dose volume of 1mL/50kg bodyweight by subcutaneous injection in front of the shoulder. In each study, cattle were challenged with a combination of infective stages of gastrointestinal and/or pulmonary nematodes 100, 120 or 150 days after treatment and were processed for parasite recovery according to standard techniques 25–30 days after challenge. Based on parasite counts, Eprinomectin ERI (1mg eprinomectin/kg bodyweight) provided >90% efficacy (p<0.05) against challenge with Cooperia oncophora and Cooperia surnabada at 100 days after treatment; against challenge with Ostertagia ostertagi, Ostertagia lyrata, Ostertagia leptospicularis, Ostertagia circumcincta, Ostertagia trifurcata, Trichostrongylus axei, and Cooperia punctata at 120 days after treatment; and against challenge with Haemonchus contortus, Bunostomum phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum and Dictyocaulus viviparus at 150 days after treatment. Results of a study to evaluate eprinomectin plasma levels in cattle treated with the Eprinomectin ERI formulation reveal a characteristic second plasma concentration peak and a profile commensurate with the duration of efficacy. These results confirm that the Eprinomectin ERI formulation can provide high levels of parasite control against a range of nematodes of cattle for up to 5 months following a single treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCooperia oncophora 3aDictyocaulus viviparus 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aOesophagostomum radiatum 3aOstertagia ostertagi 3aTrichostrongylus axei 3acattle 3aeprinomectin 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3anematode control 3asubcutaneous injection 2aAnimals 2aAntinematodal Agentsxbloodxpharmacokineticsxtherapeutic use. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aFemale 2aInjections 2aIvermectinxanalogs & derivativesxbloodxpharmacokineticsxtherapeutic use. 2aMale 2aNematodaxphysiology 2aNematode Infectionsxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aRandom Allocation 2aTime Factors 0aEprinomectin 0aMacrocyclic lactone 0aExtended-release injection 0aEfficacy 0aChemoprophylaxis 0aNematodes 0aCattle1 aKunkle, B.N.1 aRoyer, G.C.1 aYazwinski, T.A.1 aBaggott, D.G.1 aWehner, T.A.1 aYoon, S.1 aCramer, L.G.1 aRehbein, S.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 192, no. 4 p.313-320dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003500113024001100148040001800159100002200177245020200199300001800401506017300419520169500592650004802287650001502335650000902350650001402359650001602373650001102389650001202400650001402412650001402426650003802440650001002478650001002488650001102498650002102509650001202530650001902542700002502561700002502586700002402611700001902635700002202654773013202676852000902808856011202817856008102929956009703010961000903107655001203116IND4474850120221122011215.0150109e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447485012DNAL7 a10113/601492hdl7 a10.2460/javma.243.11.16092doi8 ans6296  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattarai, Bikash10aComparison of calf weaning weight and associated economic variables between beef cows with and without serum antibodies against or isolation from feces of Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis  ap. 1609-1615.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aObjective-To compare calf weaning weight and associated economic variables for beef cows with serum antibodies against Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis (MAP) or from which MAP was isolated from feces with those for cows that were seronegative for antibodies against or culture negative for MAP. Design-Retrospective study. Animals-4,842 beef cows from 3 herds enrolled in the USDA National Johne's Disease Demonstration Herd Project. Procedures-Individual cow ELISA and culture results were obtained from the project database. During each parity evaluated for each cow, the 205-day adjusted weaning weight (AWW) of its calf was calculated. The AWW was compared between test-positive and test-negative cows by use of multilevel mixed-effect models. The median value for feeder calves from 2007 to 2011 was used to estimate the economic losses associated with MAP test-positive cows. Results-The AWW of calves from cows with strongly positive ELISA results was 21.48 kg (47.26 lb) less than that of calves from cows with negative ELISA results. The AWW of calves from cows classified as heavy or moderate MAP shedders was 58.51 kg (128.72 lb) and 40.81 kg (89.78 lb) less, respectively, than that of calves from MAP culture-negative cows. Associated economic losses were estimated as $57.49/calf for cows with strongly positive ELISA results and $156.60/calf and $109.23/calf for cows classified as heavy and moderate MAP shedders, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Calves from cows with MAP-positive test results had significantly lower AWWs than did calves from cows with MAP-negative test results, which translated into economic losses for MAP-infected beef herds. 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aantibodies 3abeef 3abeef cows 3ablood serum 3acalves 3acalving 3adatabases 3aeconomics 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3aherds 3amodels 3aparatuberculosis 3aweaning 3aweaning weight1 aFosgate, Geoffrey T.1 aOsterstock, Jason B.1 aFossler, Charles P.1 aPark, Seong C.1 aRoussel, Allen J.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 243, no. 11 p.1609-1615wJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/601493Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.11.16093Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/javma.243.11.1609.pdf  aUSDA 7aarticle03050naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245011700209300001400326520141200340592002801752650002201780650001301802650001201815650001101827650001501838650002701853650002601880650001501906650002701921650001301948650001501961650002401976650002002000650002402020650002302044650000902067653004602076653002302122653002402145653002502169653002302194700002902217700001902246700001902265700002302284700001602307773010202323856008602425852000902511655001202520IND60622952320221116173243.0210114e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062295232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaneiyan, Sina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6429-954810aInduced polarization as a monitoring tool for in-situ microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) processes  ap. 36-47.  aMicrobial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a promising soil stabilization method performed by stimulating soil microbes that are naturally occurring and ubiquitous in soil systems. The precipitated carbonate acts as a cementation agent to bind loose soil at grain to grain contacts. MICP has been extensively tested and proven in laboratory environments, as well as in limited field trials; however, long term field applications still remain challenging, partly due to quality control and monitoring issues. Induced polarization (IP), an established geophysical method in mineral exploration, is a prime candidate for MICP monitoring and characterization. This study presents the geophysical results of a 15-day field-scale MICP project. The MICP treatment involved the injection of molasses (carbon source for microbial proliferation) and urea in a Ca²⁺ rich aquifer. IP monitoring successfully delineated, spatially and temporally, the propagation of MICP in the treatment area, while common resistivity measurements failed to capture any MICP related changes. Reduced hydraulic conductivity in the treatment area versus untreated area, further supports that MICP has changed the physical properties of the subsurface. Furthermore, conventional geochemical monitoring as well as X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed carbonate precipitation in samples from discrete wells in the treatment area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaquifers 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3achemical precipitation 3afield experimentation 3ageophysics 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amolasses 3amonitoring 3aphysical properties 3aquality control 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil stabilization 3aurea 0aMicrobial induced carbonate precipitation 0aSoil stabilization 0aGeophysical methods 0aInduced polarization 0aGround improvement1 aNtarlagiannis, Dimitrios1 aOhan, Juliette1 aLee, Junghwoon1 aColwell, Frederick1 aBurns, Sue,0 tEcological engineering.g2019 Feb., v. 127 p.36-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245015200205300001000357500001100367506007600378520158100454592002802035596007502063596005002138506003702188650005602225650001002281650002202291650001302313650005002326650001802376650001902394650001002413650001302423651001002436700001802446700001202464700001802476700001902494773010602513856008202619852000902701655001202710IND60590559520221207050251.0190128e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059055952DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-017-0910-62doi7 aPMC57534752pmcid7 a293015472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zhenhua14aThe prevalent status and genetic diversity of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in China: a molecular epidemiological perspective  ap. 2.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been epidemic more than 30 years in America and 20 years in China. It is still one of the most important causative agents to the worldwide swine industry. Here, we systematically analyzed the prevalence status of PRRSV in China by a molecular epidemiological perspective. Now both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 are circulating and approximately more than 80% of pig farms are seropositive for PRRSV. For PRRSV-2, there are four lineages (lineage 1, lineage 3, lineage 5, lineage 8) circulating in the fields. Lineage 8 (CH-1a-like) and lineage 5 (BJ-4-like) appeared almost at the same time during 1995-1996. Notably, BJ-4 shares 99.6% and 99.8% identity with VR2332 and RespPRRS MLV, respectively. It means that lineage 5 is likely to be imported from America. Now highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) which was considered to be evolved from local diversity of lineage 8 strains is predominant with different variants. Lineage 3 appeared in 2010 which is mainly sporadic in south of China. Lineage 1, also known as NADC30-like strains in China, has been prevalent since 2013 and leads to PRRS pandemic again. For PRRSV-1, although sporadic at present, more than 9 provinces/regions have been reported. All the circulating strains belong to subtype I. It should be paid more attention since there are no vaccines available. Our analysis would help to deeply understand the prevalent status of PRRSV in China and provide useful information for prevention and control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS).  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0500709cNational Key Research and Development Progrom of China  aNo.CARS-36cChina Agriculture Research System0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3afarms 3agenetic variation 3apandemic 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apork industry 3aseroprevalence 3aswine 3avaccines 3aChina1 aChen, Xin-xin1 aLi, Rui1 aQiao, Songlin1 aZhang, Gaiping0 tVirology journal.g2018 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.2-2dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0910-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245010200212300001200314506007600326520176400402592002802166506003702194650001302231650001702244650002502261650001202286650001002298650001802308650001502326650003202341650001202373650002102385700002002406700001502426700002502441700001902466700002502485773009002510856008102600852000902681655001202690IND50074323020221207080824.0171110e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007432302DNAL7 a245633292pmid7 aPMC39682902pmcid7 a10.1007/s12263-014-0388-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStojkovic, Ivana A.14aThe PNPLA3 Ile148Met interacts with overweight and dietary intakes on fasting triglyceride levels  ap. 388.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Ile148Met (rs738409, G-allele) in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 gene (PNPLA3) associates with liver fat content and may lead to loss-of-function (hydrolysis) or gain-of-function (CoA-dependent lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase) defects. PNPLA3 is up-regulated by dietary carbohydrates, and interactions between rs738409 and carbohydrates, and sugar and ω6:ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio on hepatic fat accumulation have been reported. We examined interaction between rs738409 and overweight, and between rs738409 and dietary intakes (carbohydrates, sucrose and ω6:ω3-PUFA ratio), on fasting triglyceride levels. From the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study-Cardiovascular Cohort, 4,827 individuals without diabetes aged 58 ± 6 years, 2,346 with BMI ≤ 25 kg/m² and 2,478 with BMI > 25 kg/m², were included in cross-sectional analyses. Dietary data were collected by a modified diet history method. Overweight modified the association between rs738409 and fasting triglyceride levels (P ᵢₙₜₑᵣₐcₜᵢₒₙ = 0.003). G-allele associated with lower triglycerides only among overweight individuals (P = 0.01). Nominally, significant interaction on triglyceride levels was observed between rs738409 and sucrose among normal-weight individuals (P ᵢₙₜₑᵣₐcₜᵢₒₙ = 0.03). G-allele associated with lower triglycerides among overweight individuals in the lowest tertiles of carbohydrate and ω6:ω3-PUFA ratio (P = 0.04 and P = 0.001) and with higher triglycerides among normal-weight individuals in the highest tertile of sucrose (P = 0.001). We conclude that overweight and dietary sucrose may modify the association between rs738409 and fasting triglyceride levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiabetes 3adiet history 3adietary carbohydrate 3afasting 3agenes 3alipid content 3aoverweight 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asucrose 3atriacylglycerols1 aEricson, Ulrika1 aRukh, Gull1 aRiddestråle, Martin1 aRomeo, Stefano1 aOrho-Melander, Marju0 tGenes & nutrition.g2014 Mar., v. 9, no. 2 p.388-388dBioMed Centralx1555-89327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12263-014-0388-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005400111040001800165100002200183245008700205300001400292500001500306520126000321592002801581650001401609650001601623650001201639650001801651650001501669650001501684650001501699650001401714650002301728650001201751650001401763650001901777650001101796650001701807650002401824650001101848650001201859650002901871650001401900650001401914650001501928650001401943650002401957650002401981651001202005651001202017653001702029653002602046700002402072773009402096856010402190852000902294655001202303IND4398339020221120063122.0160325e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439833902DNAL7 a174894512pmid7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[37:AOIFDF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpiller, David A.10aAlteration of island food‐web dynamics following major disturbance by hurricanes  ap. 37-41.  a2019-12-04  aMajor abiotic disturbance can be an important factor influencing food‐web dynamics, particularly in areas impacted by the recent increase in hurricane activity. We present a unique set of data on key food‐web processes occurring on 10 small islands for three relatively calm years and then four subsequent years during which two hurricanes passed directly over the study site. Herbivory, as measured by leaf damage, was 3.2 times higher in the year after the first hurricane (2000) than in the previous year and was 1.7 times higher in the year after the second hurricane (2002) than in 2001. The effect of a top predator (the lizard, Anolis sagrei) on herbivory strengthened continuously after the first hurricane and overall was 2.4 times stronger during the disturbance period than before. Overall abundance of lizards was 30% lower during the disturbance period than before, and abundances of web spiders and hymenopteran parasitoids were 66% and 59% lower, respectively. We suggest that increased herbivory observed on all islands was caused, at least in part, by the overall reduction in predation by both lizards and arthropods, whereas magnification of the lizard effect on herbivory was caused by reduced compensatory predation by arthropods.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood webs 3aHymenoptera 3alizards 3aanimal stress 3aarthropods 3ahurricanes 3aherbivores 3apredators 3aConocarpus erectus 3aAraneae 3apredation 3aabiotic stress 3aAnolis 3aplant damage 3apopulation dynamics 3aleaves 2aAnimals 2aCombretaceaexphysiology 2aDisasters 2aEcosystem 2aFood Chain 2aGeography 2aLizardsxphysiology 2aPopulation Dynamics 3aBahamas 0aBahamas 0aCombretaceae 0atrophic relationships1 aSchoener, Thomas W.0 tEcology.g2007 Jan., v. 88, no. 1 p.37-41dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88%5B37:AOIFDF%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245008700214300001800301500001100319520180200330592002802132650001502160650002502175650001402200650003102214650001602245650001502261650001302276650002202289650001402311650001402325650001202339650000902351650002202360700007702382700008102459700007102540700007502611700006502686773012402751856008302875852000902958655001202967IND60729826520221121233629.0210731e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072982652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-06075-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Igor Lopes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9199-960310aTissue micro-RNAs associated with colorectal cancer prognosis: a systematic review  ap. 1853-1867.  aReview  aColorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease commonly diagnosed worldwide, with high mortality rates. Several studies demonstrate important associations between differential expression of micro-RNAs (miRs) and the prognosis of CRC. The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed tissue miRs associated with prognostic factors in CRC patients, through a systematic review of the Literature. Using the PubMed database, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, studies published in English evaluating miRs differentially expressed in tumor tissue and significantly associated with the prognostic aspects of CRC were selected. All the included studies used RT-PCR (Taqman or SYBR Green) for miR expression analysis and the period of publication was from 2009 to 2018. A total of 115 articles accomplished the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The studies investigated the expression of 100 different miRs associated with prognostic aspects in colorectal cancer patients. The most frequent oncogenic miRs investigated were miR-21, miR-181a, miR-182, miR-183, miR-210 and miR-224 and the hyperexpression of these miRs was associated with distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis and worse survival in patients with CRC. The most frequent tumor suppressor miRs were miR-126, miR-199b and miR-22 and the hypoexpression of these miRs was associated with distant metastasis, worse prognosis and a higher risk of disease relapse (worse disease-free survival). Specific tissue miRs are shown to be promising prognostic biomarkers in patients with CRC, given their strong association with the prognostic aspects of these tumors, however, new studies are necessary to establish the sensibility and specificity of the individual miRs in order to use them in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adatabases 3agene expression regulation 3alymph nodes 3ametastasis 3amicroRNA 3amolecular biology 3amortality 3aprognosis 3arelapse 3arisk 3asystematic review1 aPenna, Karlla Greick Batista Dias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6277-13431 ados Santos Carneiro, Megmar Aparecida1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0569-477X1 aLibera, Larisse Silva Dalla1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3437-74581 aRamos, Jéssica Enocencio Porto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7961-11511 aSaddi, Vera Aparecida1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9949-99880 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.1853-1867dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-06075-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245018100126300001600307506002800323520156000351592002801911506003701939650002301976650001701999650001802016650002902034650002002063650002502083650001702108650001502125650001802140650001602158650001402174650002602188650001802214650001602232653003902248700001302287700001902300700001802319700001502337700001802352700001602370773013402386852000902520655001202529IND60785490220221207094257.0150519e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078549022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchorn, T14aThe Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF-1) homologous in Hirudo medicinalis (medicinal leech) is involved in immune response during wound healing and graft rejection processes  ap. 129-141.  aResource is Open Access  aAllograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is a 17 kDa cytokine-inducible calcium-binding protein that in Vertebrates plays an important role in allografts immune response. Since its expression is mainly limited to the monocyte/macrophage lineage, it was recently suggested that it could play a key role during inflammatory responses, allograft rejection, as well as in the activation of macrophages. To clarify this point we have focused our research on the possible role of AIF-1 during the inflammatory response after injury in the leech Hirudo medicinalis (Annelida, Hirudinea). This invertebrate is an excellent animal model since the responses evoked during inflammation and tissue repair are clear and easily detectable and have a striking similarity with vertebrate responses. Moreover the analysis of an EST library from H. medicinalis CNS, revealed the presence of a gene, named Hmaif-1/alias Hmiba1, showing a high homology with vertebrate aif-1. Our data show that the related protein, named HmAIF-1, is constitutively expressed in unlesioned leeches and that dramatically increases 48 h after wounds and tissue transplants. Immunohistochemistry experiments, using a specific anti HmAIF-1 polyclonal antibody, shows that this factor is present in spread, CD68+ /CD45+ macrophage-like cells. A few days after experimental wounding of the body wall, the amount of these immunopositive cells increases at the lesion site. In conclusion here we propose that in leech HmAIF-1 factor is involved in inflammation events like its vertebrate counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHirudo medicinalis 3aallografting 3aanimal models 3acalcium-binding proteins 3agraft rejection 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3aintegument 3ainvertebrates 3amacrophages 3amonocytes 3apolyclonal antibodies 3atissue repair 3avertebrates 0aleech; CD45; AIF-1; wounds; grafts1 aF Drago21 aEguileor, M de1 aValvassori, R1 aJ Vizioli21 aTettamanti, G1 aGrimaldi, A0 tInvertebrate survival journal.g2015 May, v. 12 p.129-141dUniversity of Modena and Reggio EmiliawJournal:27775x1824-307X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013100164300001600295520065000311592002800961650001300989650001101002650001101013650001201024650001201036651001401048651001801062653001301080653001401093653001601107653001801123653001601141700001601157700001601173700001701189773010401206856008401310852000901394655001201403IND60122909820221118035413.0150325e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012290982DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2014.9940462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, G.14aThe coral killing sponge Chalinula nematifera (Porifera: Haplosclerida) along the eastern coast of Sulawesi Island (Indonesia)  ap. 143-148.  aChalinula nematifera (Porifera: Haplosclerida) is an encrusting sponge able to overgrow live corals.

To evaluate the immunogenicity of our construct, we assessed the humoral and cytokine responses induced by VLP2/6/7 in BALB/c mice immunized intra-peritoneally and intra-rectally. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Relative quantitative (RQ) Real-time PCR were used to evaluate the antibody (IgG and IgA) levels in serum and mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ in spleen cells, respectively. Our results showed that VLP2/6/7 is capable of intra-peritoneal (I.P.) and intra-rectal (I.R.) induction of serum IgG and IgA responses. IgA was detected in fecal samples of immunization groups by I.P. and I.R. routes. Interestingly, I.R. route induced higher IgA titer compared with I.P. route which was statistically significant. Moreover, mRNA levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ were significantly elevated in mice immunized intra-peritoneally with VLP2/6/7 compared to control group. As such, the mean change was 7.4 (P < 0.05) and 14.8 (P < 0.001) for IFN-γ and IL-6, respectively. Likewise, the same pattern was found when mice were immunized intra-rectally. Although elevated, the difference in the mean change for IL-10 was not statistically significant when compared to control group. Our findings indicated that VLPs constructed via a stable insect cell line are able to induce both humoral and cellular responses, a similar pattern as observed after immunization with live RVs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acell lines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3aimmunization 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainsects 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asplenocytes 3aviruses 0aAntibody 0aCytokine 0aVLP2/6/71 aJalilvand, Somayeh1 aMollaei-Kandelous, Yaghoub1 aShahmahmoodi, Shohreh1 aRezaei, Farhad1 aSalimi, Vahid1 aNejati, Ahmad1 aValidi, Majid1 aShoja, Zabihollah0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2014 Feb.,  Mar., v. 67-68 p.48-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2014.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245014000171300001600311500002000327520116900347592002801516650002301544650002501567650002301592650002701615650001001642650002701652650002001679650001401699650001301713650002801726650001401754650001701768650001201785650001501797650001101812650001501823700005701838700002001895700002801915700002901943773012401972856007902096852000902175655001202184IND60606763320221121223336.0180727e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060676332DNAL7 a10.1111/1748-5967.122842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

The present study shows variations in the activity of two detoxification enzymes, namely esterase and glutathione S‐transferase (GST), in H. armigera after exposure to different isolates of entomopathogenic fungi. After treatment of larvae with the different isolates (Day 0), samples were collected on three days (Days 3, 5 and 7) for enzyme analysis. High GST activity was found in samples of hemolymph, intestine and fat bodies of H. armigera following treatment with Beauveria bassiana (isolate Bb‐08), Metarhizium anisopliae (isolates Ma‐11.1 and Ma‐4.1), and Isaria fumosorosea (isolates If‐02 and If‐2.3). High esterase activity was recorded in samples of the intestine and fat bodies on various days after treatment, whereas increased esterase activity in hemolymph was noted only in samples from Day 5 after treatment with M. anisopliae (Ma‐4.1). The detection of high GST and esterase activity demonstrates the possibility of the development of resistance against these microbial control agents in H. armigera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aIsaria fumosorosea 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3acrops 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3afat body 3aglutathione transferase 3ahemolymph 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3aintestines 3alarvae 3avegetables1 aFreed, Shoaib1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5874-71801 aMuhammad, Saleh1 aAshraf, Muhammad Zubair1 aKhan, Muhammad Bismillah0 tEntomological research.g2018 July, v. 48, no. 4 p.279-287dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867074x1738-22977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1748-5967.122843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166300001600272520074800288592002801036650001401064650001201078650001501090700002001105700001801125700001601143700001801159700002901177773009701206856008101303990002301384852000901407655001201416IND60096378520221120151822.0141104e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009637852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Sun Young10aSolution-processable fullerene derivatives for organic photovoltaics and n-type thin-film transistors  ap. e44-e48.  aTwo solution-processable fullerene derivatives (C₆₀TH-Hx and C₆₀TH-Hx-a) were successfully synthesized for organic photovoltaics and n-type thin-film transistors. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) was observed in a layered structure of P3HT:C₆₀TH-Hx (PCE = 2.44%), which slightly exceeded that of P3HT:PCBM (PCE = 2.39%). We found a very low PCE for P3HT:C₆₀TH-Hx-a (∼0.14%) due to the poor solubility of C₆₀TH-Hx-a. In addition, n-type thin-film transistors were fabricated by solution-processing techniques. The measured values of electron mobility in the devices for PCBM, C₆₀TH-Hx, and C₆₀TH-Hx-a were 5.8 × 10⁻³, 2.5 × 10⁻², and 8.5 × 10⁻⁴ cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3afullerene 3aphysics 3asolubility1 aPark, Eun Young1 aKim, Tae-Dong1 aCho, Shinuk1 aPark, Jea-Gun1 aLee, K.-S.q(Kwang-Sup),0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 Mar., v. 11, no. 2S p.e44-e48dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.1213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle05045naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100001800162245017900180300001600359500014600375500002400521500001500545520296700560650002003527650002303547650001703570650002503587650001203612650001203624650001403636650001803650650001103668650002003679650001303699650002503712650001903737650001603756650002103772650002203793650002403815650002103839650002603860650002203886651001403908653002503922653002303947653001703970700001903987700001704006700001804023700001604041700001804057700001404075700001904089773009804108852000904206856007504215930003304290945002504323946001104348655001204359IND4422239120221118051235.0090622s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442223912DNAL7 a10.1071/EA082732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL200 0aL6001 aBarwick, S.A.10aGenetics of heifer performance in 'wet' and 'dry' seasons and their relationships with steer performance in two tropical beef genotypes [Erratum: 2009, v. 49, no. 8, p. 727.]  ap. 367-382.  aIn the special issue: Genetics and management to improve productivity in Australian beef herds / edited by Heather Burrow and Bill McKiernan.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe genetics of heifer performance in tropical 'wet' and 'dry' seasons, and relationships with steer performance, were studied in Brahman (BRAH) and Tropical Composite (TCOMP) (50% Bos indicus, African Sanga or other tropically adapted Bos taurus; 50% non-tropically adapted Bos taurus) cattle of northern Australia. Data were from 2159 heifers (1027 BRAH, 1132 TCOMP), representing 54 BRAH and 51 TCOMP sires. Heifers were assessed after post-weaning 'wet' (ENDWET) and 'dry' (ENDDRY) seasons. Steers were assessed post-weaning, at feedlot entry, over a 70-day feed test, and after ~120-day finishing. Measures studied in both heifers and steers were liveweight (LWT), scanned rump fat, rib fat and M. longissimus area (SEMA), body condition score (CS), hip height (HH), serum insulin-like growth factor-I concentration (IGF-I), and average daily gains (ADG). Additional steer measures were scanned intra-muscular fat %, flight time, and daily (DFI) and residual feed intake (RFI). Uni- and bivariate analyses were conducted for combined genotypes and for individual genotypes. Genotype means were predicted for a subset of data involving 34 BRAH and 26 TCOMP sires. A meta-analysis of genetic correlation estimates examined how these were related to the difference between measurement environments for specific traits. There were genotype differences at the level of means, variances and genetic correlations. BRAH heifers were significantly (P < 0.05) faster-growing in the 'wet' season, slower-growing in the 'dry' season, lighter at ENDDRY, and taller and fatter with greater CS and IGF-I at both ENDWET and ENDDRY. Heritabilities were generally in the 20 to 60% range for both genotypes. Phenotypic and genetic variances, and genetic correlations, were commonly lower for BRAH. Differences were often explained by the long period of tropical adaptation of B. indicus. Genetic correlations were high between corresponding measures at ENDWET and ENDDRY, positive between fat and muscle measures in TCOMP but negative in BRAH (mean of 13 estimates 0.50 and -0.19, respectively), and approximately zero between steer feedlot ADG and heifer ADG in BRAH. Numerous genetic correlations between heifers and steers differed substantially from unity, especially in BRAH, suggesting there may be scope to select differently in the sexes where that would aid the differing roles of heifers and steers in production. Genetic correlations declined as measurement environments became more different, the rates of decline (environment sensitivity) sometimes differing with genotype. Similar measures (LWT, HH and ADG; IGF-I at ENDWET in TCOMP) were genetically correlated with steer DFI in heifers as in steers. Heifer SEMA was genetically correlated with steer feedlot RFI in BRAH (0.75 ± 0.27 at ENDWET, 0.66 ± 0.24 at ENDDRY). Selection to reduce steer RFI would reduce SEMA in BRAH heifers but otherwise have only small effects on heifers before their first joining. 3aanimal behavior 3aseasonal variation 3aheritability 3aartificial selection 3aheifers 3ahybrids 3abeef cows 3acattle breeds 3asteers 3aliveweight gain 3agenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3abody condition 3abody weight 3agenetic variance 3abreed differences 3agenetic correlation 3abody composition 3aenvironmental factors 3agenetic variation 3aAustralia 0aresidual feed intake 0aanimal performance 0afood animals1 aJohnston, D.J.1 aBurrow, H.M.1 aHolroyd, R.G.1 aFordyce, G.1 aWolcott, M.L.1 aSim, W.D.1 aSullivan, M.T.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 5-6 p.367-382dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA082733Available from publisher's Web site  a20100105b20100205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03317naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245021400159300001800373500002400391520180900415650001102224650001402235650001502249650000902264650000902273650002602282650001502308650001402323650002202337650001202359650000902371650001802380650003102398650002002429650001202449650002402461700001802485700001502503700001702518700001802535700001802553700001602571700001602587700001802603773009902621852000902720856008202729655001202811IND4473808920221118051208.0131113s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447380892DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.74.8.11262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Jaesang10aEffects of peribulbar anesthesia (sub-Tenon injection of a local anesthetic) on akinesia of extraocular muscles, mydriasis, and intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in dogs undergoing phacoemulsification  ap. 1126-1132.  aIncludes references  aObjective-To evaluate the effects of peribulbar anesthesia (sub-Tenon injection of lidocaine hydrochloride) on akinesia of extraocular muscles, mydriasis, and intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in dogs undergoing phacoemulsification. Animals-14 Beagles with ophthalmically normal eyes. Procedures-A blinded randomized controlled trial was performed. Dogs were anesthetized and assigned to 2 treatments: concurrent sub-Tenon injection of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride solution (2 mL) and IV injection of saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (0.02 mL/kg; lidocaine group [n = 7]) or concurrent sub-Tenon injection of saline solution (2 mL) and IV injection of 0.2 mg of atracurium/kg (0.02 mL/kg; control group [7]). Pupils were dilated by topical application of a combined tropicamide and phenylephrine ophthalmic solution. Ten minutes after the injections, pupil diameter was measured and phacoemulsification was performed. End-tidal isoflurane concentration was used to evaluate intraoperative pain. Subjective pain scores were recorded during the postoperative period. Results-Akinesia was induced and maintained throughout the surgery in all eyes. Mean +/- SD pupil diameter was significantly greater in the lidocaine group (13.7 +/- 0.7 mm) than in the control group (12.2 +/- 0.8 mm). Isoflurane requirements were significantly lower in the lidocaine group than the control group. However, postoperative pain scores were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Sub-Tenon injection of lidocaine was an effective method for inducing akinesia of extraocular muscles, mydriasis, and intraoperative analgesia for phacoemulsification in dogs. Therefore, this could be another option for surgical field exposure and pain management during phacoemulsification in dogs. 3aBeagle 3aanalgesia 3aanesthesia 3adogs 3aeyes 3aintravenous injection 3aisoflurane 3alidocaine 3alocal anesthetics 3amuscles 3apain 3aphenylephrine 3arandomized clinical trials 3asodium chloride 3asurgery 3atopical application1 aJeong, Manbok1 aLee, Euiri1 aKim, Soohyun1 aPark, Sangwan1 aPark, Sungwon1 aKang, Sunmi1 aLee, Inhung1 aSeo, Kangmoon0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2013 Aug., v. 74, no. 8 p.1126-1132x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.74.8.11263Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03309naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245007700168300001600245500002400261520202200285650001902307650001502326650002502341650001502366650000902381650002202390650001202412650002202424650001202446650001302458650000902471650001302480650001702493650001202510650001502522650002002537700002802557700001802585700001702603700002402620773011502644852000902759856008302768655001202851IND4473809520221118051131.0131113s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447380952DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.243.3.3942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDePaula, Kristina M.10aArterial thrombosis after vehicular trauma and humeral fracture in a dog  ap. 394-398.  aIncludes references  aCase Description-A 3-year-old 19-kg (42-lb) spayed female mixed-breed dog was referred after being hit by a car. Injuries included pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusions, a full-thickness axillary skin wound, and a grade I transverse fracture of the midshaft of the right humerus. Following patient stabilization, open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture were performed. The dog had weight-bearing lameness at the time of discharge. Eight days after fracture repair, the dog was reevaluated for acute onset of signs of pain and non–weight-bearing lameness in the right forelimb. Clinical Findings-Physical examination findings in the right forelimb (knuckling and coolness, with absent digital pulses) were suggestive of a thrombus. Ultrasonography confirmed a right brachial artery thrombus with minimal blood flow to the affected limb. Treatment and Outcome-Unfractionated heparin was administered via continuous IV infusion for the first 36 hours of hospitalization. Clopidogrel administration was also started at this time. During hospitalization, rapid clinical improvement occurred, and the dog was discharged 48 hours after admission. The transition to outpatient therapy was achieved by discontinuation of the unfractionated heparin infusion at 36 hours and beginning SC administration of dalteparin. Outpatient treatment with dalteparin and clopidogrel was continued. Repeated physical examination and ultrasonography 5 weeks later revealed resolution of the thrombus and normal blood flow to the limb. Anticoagulant administration was discontinued at that time. Clinical Relevance-Thrombosis should be suspected in any dog with signs of acute pain after severe trauma or fracture repair, with or without concurrent lameness, that do not resolve with appropriate treatment. Restoration of blood flow to the affected limb after initiation of unfractionated heparin and clopidogrel administration followed by outpatient treatment with dalteparin and clopidogrel was achieved in this case. 3aanticoagulants 3ablood flow 3aclinical examination 3acontusions 3adogs 3afracture fixation 3aheparin 3ahumeral fractures 3ahumerus 3alameness 3apain 3apatients 3apneumothorax 3aspaying 3athrombosis 3aultrasonography1 adeLaforcade, Armelle M.1 aKing, Ryan G.1 aHughs, Holly1 aBoudrieau, Randy J.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 243, no. 3 p.394-398x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.3.3943Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02938naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144100001900153245013700172300001600309500002400325500001500349520150800364650001401872650001101886650002001897650001701917650001301934650001901947650001001966650003101976650002002007650001002027650001102037650002002048650001102068650002202079653001202101653001802113653001002131700001302141700001702154773009602171852000902267856007502276930003302351945002502384946001102409655001202420IND4422238620221118051239.0090622s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442223862DNAL7 a10.1071/EA082512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aL1001 aJacobson, C.L.10aNematode parasites and faecal soiling of sheep in lairage: evidence of widespread potential production losses for the sheep industry  ap. 326-332.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDiarrhoea (scouring) and subsequent faecal soiling of fleece are important economic and welfare issues for the sheep industry. Nematode worm infections are commonly implicated as a cause of scouring. This study aimed to investigate the extent of strongyle parasite infections, and identify any association with faecal worm egg count (WEC) and scouring in sheep from winter rainfall environments in Western Australia consigned to an abattoir. Faeces were collected from sheep with evidence of scouring and normal sheep (firm faecal pellets and no evidence of fresh diarrhoea on breech). A total of 4430 sheep from 113 lines of lambs (<12 months old), 10 lines of yearlings (12-24 months old) and 235 lines of adult sheep (>24 months old) were sampled between September and January. Mean WEC in lamb lines was 1525 eggs per gram (epg) of faeces with mean WEC >1000 epg in 42% of lines and >2000 in 22% of lines. Mean WEC in adult lines was 486 epg, with 13% lines having mean WEC >1000 epg. There was a trend (P = 0.099) to higher WEC in scouring lambs (2289 epg) compared with normal lambs (1523 epg). The scouring adult sheep had lower WEC (417 epg) compared with normal adults (482 epg, P = 0.021). The findings suggest that large strongyle infections were common in lambs consigned for slaughter. The low WEC in scouring adult sheep was consistent with the suggestion that a hypersensitivity to ingested nematode larvae, rather than large worm burdens, may be responsible for scouring in mature sheep. 3ayearlings 3afleece 3aslaughterhouses 3aStrongylidae 3adiarrhea 3aanimal welfare 3afeces 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3afecal egg count 3alambs 3alarvae 3aeconomic impact 3aadults 3adisease incidence 0alairage 0aadult animals 0asheep1 aBell, K.1 aBesier, R.B.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 4 p.326-332dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA082513Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03483naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100001700171245017200188300001400360500002400374500001500398520189200413650002102305650001402326650001902340650001302359650002502372650002802397650001502425650001002440650001802450650001202468650002002480650002502500650001802525650002402543650002302567650002002590653001702610653002002627700001802647700001702665773009402682852000902776856007502785930003302860945002502893946001102918655001202929IND4422235420221118051322.0090622s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442223542DNAL7 a10.1071/EA081622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aR100 0aR300 0aL6001 aAmerah, A.M.10aInfluence of wheat hardness and xylanase supplementation on the performance, energy utilisation, digestive tract development and digesta parameters of broiler starters  ap. 71-78.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to examine the influence of wheat hardness and xylanase supplementation on the performance, energy utilisation, digestive tract development and digesta parameters of broilers fed wheat-based diets. The experimental design was a 2x2 factorial arrangement of treatments evaluating wheat hardness (soft or hard) with or without xylanase supplementation. Two diets based on soft or hard wheat were formulated. Whole wheat (200g/kg) from the same wheat batch replaced ground wheat before cold-pelleting of each diet. Each diet was fed ad libitum to six pens of eight male broilers each from day 1 to 21 posthatch. The distribution of particle size differed between diets, with the hard wheat diet having 32.7% of particles greater than 1mm in size compared with 18.7% in the soft wheat diet. Interactions (P<0.05) were observed between wheat hardness and enzyme supplementation for weight gain, feed intake, feed per gain and nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolisable energy (AMEn). Enzyme supplementation increased (P<0.05) weight gain in the soft wheat-based diet but not in the hard wheat diet. Enzyme supplementation also increased (P<0.05) feed intake in the soft wheat-based diet, but reduced (P<0.05) intake in the hard wheat diet. Feed per gain and AMEn were improved (P<0.05) by enzyme supplementation in the hard wheat-based diet, while no enzyme effect was observed in the soft wheat diet. Feeding the hard wheat-based diet increased (P<0.05) the relative gizzard weight, and this was associated with a general increase in finer particles in the proximal intestinal digesta when compared with those present in the diet. These results suggest that the response of broilers to xylanase supplementation is influenced by wheat hardness and that wheat hardness may be an important criterion to consider when choosing for whole wheat inclusion in broiler diets. 3abroiler chickens 3axylanases 3afeed additives 3ahardness 3anutrient utilization 3agastrointestinal system 3abiomarkers 3awheat 3aparticle size 3adigesta 3afeed processing 3ametabolizable energy 3adigestibility 3adietary supplements 3aanimal performance 3abroiler feeding 0afeed quality 0anutritive value1 aRavindran, V.1 aLentle, R.G.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 1 p.71-78dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA081623Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/07/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02835naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144100001600153245010400169300001600273500002400289520143800313650001101751650001201762650001001774650001301784650002001797650001301817650002301830650002101853650001701874650001801891650002301909650001001932650001301942650001001955650001201965650002501977650001802002650001202020700001802032700001802050773009602068852000902164856007502173930003302248945002502281946001102306655001202317IND4422236120221118051153.0090622s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442223612DNAL7 a10.1071/EA073872doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL5001 aJacob, R.H.10aRepletion of glycogen in muscle is preceded by repletion of glycogen in the liver of Merino hoggets  ap. 131-138.  aIncludes references  aAn experiment was conducted using 105 Merino hoggets to measure the change in tissue glycogen concentration over a 48-h period following an exercise regime. The exercise regime consisted of a 2-km run repeated four times with a 15-min break between each run. After exercise the hoggets were split into treatment groups and fed three different levels (fasting, maintenance and three times maintenance) of the same ration. A subset of each group of hoggets was killed at -24, 0, 12, 24 and 48 h from the time of exercise and samples taken from the liver, skin, rumen, duodenum, colon, kidney, M. semimembranosus, M. semitendinosus, M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum, M. psoas major, M. triceps brachii and M. subscapularis. Exercise caused a reduction in glycogen concentration in the liver and all muscles but not in the kidney, skin, duodenum, or colon tissues. After exercise the most significant changes in glycogen concentration were in the liver, muscle and skin. Metabolisable energy intake influenced the change in the liver and muscle tissue but not in the skin. It was concluded that glycogen concentration increased in liver before muscle and that this effect may contribute to the slower rate of glycogen concentration in muscle for ruminants compared with monogastric animals. Skin may also compete with muscle for glucose during the repletion phase in Merino sheep but the exact nature of this effect remains uncertain. 3aMerino 3ahoggets 3aliver 3aglycogen 3askeletal muscle 3aexercise 3atemporal variation 3afeed deprivation 3afeed rations 3afeeding level 3aepidermis (animal) 3arumen 3aduodenum 3acolon 3akidneys 3ametabolizable energy 3aenergy intake 3aglucose1 aGardner, G.E.1 aPethick, D.W.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 2 p.131-138dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA073873Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle04361naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100002100171245012200192300001600314500002400330500001500354520236800369650001802737650001902755650001202774650001602786650001202802650001302814650001302827650002002840650001102860650001902871650002102890650001202911650001402923650003202937650001602969650002102985650001403006650002003020650001503040650003203055651001503087653003203102653001603134653002203150653001703172653001103189700001703200700001803217700001903235700002003254700001903274700002003293700001803313700002303331700002403354773009603378852000903474856007503483930003303558945002503591946001103616655001203627IND4422236920221118051152.0090622s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442223692DNAL7 a10.1071/EA072252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL100 0aE200 0aL6001 aFordyce, Geoffry12aA systems evaluation of high-input management using fortified molasses for beef production in Australia's dry tropics  ap. 177-191.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe potential of beef producers to profitably produce 500-kg steers at 2.5 years of age in northern Australia's dry tropics to meet specifications of high-value markets, using a high-input management (HIM) system was examined. HIM included targeted high levels of fortified molasses supplementation, short seasonal mating and the use of growth promotants. Using herds of 300-400 females plus steer progeny at three sites, HIM was compared at a business level to prevailing best-practice, strategic low-input management (SLIM) in which there is a relatively low usage of energy concentrates to supplement pasture intake. The data presented for each breeding-age cohort within management system at each site includes: annual pregnancy rates (range: 14-99%), time of conception, mortalities (range: 0-10%), progeny losses between confirmed pregnancy and weaning (range: 0-29%), and weaning rates (range: 14-92%) over the 2-year observation. Annual changes in weight and relative net worth were calculated for all breeding and non-breeding cohorts. Reasons for outcomes are discussed. Compared with SLIM herds, both weaning weights and annual growth were greater-than-or-equal30 kg higher, enabling 86-100% of HIM steers to exceed 500 kg at 2.5 years of age. Very few contemporary SLIM steers reached this target. HIM was most profitably applied to steers. Where HIM was able to achieve high pregnancy rates in yearlings, its application was recommended in females. Well managed, appropriate HIM systems increased profits by around $15/adult equivalent at prevailing beef and supplement prices. However, a 20% supplement price rise without a commensurate increase in values for young slaughter steers would generally eliminate this advantage. This study demonstrated the complexity of profitable application of research outcomes to commercial business, even when component research suggests that specific strategies may increase growth and reproductive efficiency and/or be more profitable. Because of the higher level of management required, higher costs and returns, and higher susceptibility to market changes and disease, HIM systems should only be applied after SLIM systems are well developed. To increase profitability, any strategy must ultimately either increase steer growth and sale values and/or enable a shift to high pregnancy rates in yearling heifers. 3aprofitability 3acattle feeding 3agrazing 3abeef cattle 3aheifers 3amolasses 3apastures 3aliveweight gain 3asteers 3aweaning weight 3afeed supplements 3aweaning 3apregnancy 3agood agricultural practices 3afeed intake 3acommodity prices 3amortality 3anutritive value 3aconception 3aintensive livestock farming 3aQueensland 0ahigh-input animal husbandry 0abody weight 0aeconomic analysis 0afood animals 0aprices1 aCoates, Ruth1 aDebney, Megan1 aHaselton, Stan1 aRebgetz, Robert1 aLaing, Alan R.1 aCooper, Neil J.1 aHall, Rebecca1 aHolmes, William E.1 aDoogan, Vivienne J.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 3 p.177-191dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA072253Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/09/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03369naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100001700171245023300188300001600421500002400437500001500461520162100476650000902097650002102106650001802127650002002145650001302165650001702178650001002195650000902205650001302214650001702227650002202244650002002266650001602286650001402302650002102316650001602337650001002353651001402363653002502377700001802402700001702420700001402437700002302451700001502474700001702489773009602506852000902602856007502611930003302686945002502719946001102744655001202755IND4422236420221118051342.0090622s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442223642DNAL7 a10.1071/EA082102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aW000 0aL100 0aL6001 aHansen, C.F.12aA chemical analysis of samples of crude glycerol from the production of biodiesel in Australia, and the effects of feeding crude glycerol to growing-finishing pigs on performance, plasma metabolites and meat quality at slaughter  ap. 154-161.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aims of this study were to: (i) determine the chemical composition of 11 samples of crude glycerol collected from seven Australian biodiesel manufacturers; and (ii) examine the effects of increasing levels of crude glycerol fed to growing-finishing pigs on performance, plasma metabolites and meat quality at slaughter. Chemical composition of crude glycerol samples varied considerably; glycerol content ranged between 38 and 96%, with some samples containing up to 29% ash and 14% methanol. One of these samples (76.1% glycerol, 1.83% methanol) was then fed to 64 female pigs (50.9 ± 5.55 kg; mean ± s.d.) allocated to one of five dietary treatments (0, 4, 8, 12 and 16% crude glycerol) until they reached 105 kg liveweight. There were no statistical differences in performance indices with increasing levels of added glycerol, although there was an unexpectedly high variation between treatments. Blood glycerol levels were unaffected by diet in week two of the experiment, but increased linearly (P < 0.001) with increasing levels of dietary glycerol before slaughter. The inclusion of crude glycerol did not influence any meat quality parameters at slaughter (P > 0.05). Diets containing added crude glycerol were less dusty after mixing, but diets that contained 8, 12 and 16% glycerol all formed a firm aggregate within 24 h of mixing that presented some feeding difficulties. This might restrict inclusion of glycerol in mash diets to dietary levels less than 8%. Furthermore, levels of residues such as methanol and ash should be monitored to prevent excessive amounts of these compounds in pig diets. 3apork 3aplant byproducts 3aswine feeding 3ablood chemistry 3amethanol 3afood animals 3afeeds 3amash 3aglycerol 3ameat quality 3awaste utilization 3aliveweight gain 3aash content 3abiodiesel 3afeed supplements 3ametabolites 3aswine 3aAustralia 0achemical composition1 aHernandez, A.1 aMullan, B.P.1 aMoore, K.1 aTrezona-Murray, M.1 aKing, R.H.1 aPluske, J.R.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 2 p.154-161dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA082103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02877naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245016700169300001800336500002400354520160500378650001601983650001901999650002002018650000902038650001302047650001402060650002102074650001502095650002502110650002002135650001502155650001502170650000902185650001402194650001002208700001902218700002402237773011702261852000902378856006802387655001202455IND50085223320221118051148.0131115s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008522332DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.243.9.13022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoenig, Margarethe10aEvaluation of routine hematology profile results and fructosamine, thyroxine, insulin, and proinsulin concentrations in lean, overweight, obese, and diabetic cats  ap. 1302-1309.  aIncludes references  aObjective-To compare results of hematologic testing in nondiabetic and diabetic cats to identify possible indicators of alterations in long-term glucose control. Design-Cross-sectional study. Animals-117 client-owned cats (76 nondiabetic cats [25 with normal body condition, 27 overweight, and 24 obese] and 41 naïve [n = 21] and treated [20] diabetic cats). Procedures-Signalment and medical history, including data on feeding practices, were collected. A body condition score was assigned, and feline body mass index was calculated. Complete blood counts and serum biochemical analyses, including determination of fructosamine, thyroxine, insulin, and proinsulin concentrations, were performed. Urine samples were obtained and analyzed. Results-Glucose and fructosamine concentrations were significantly higher in the naïve and treated diabetic cats than in the nondiabetic cats. Insulin and proinsulin concentrations were highest in the obese cats but had great individual variation. Few other variables were significantly different among cat groups. Most cats, even when obese or diabetic, had unlimited access to food. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggested that cats at risk of developing diabetes (ie, overweight and obese cats) could not be distinguished from cats with a normal body condition on the basis of results of isolated hematologic testing. A longitudinal study is indicated to follow nondiabetic cats over a period of several years to identify those that eventually develop diabetes. Findings also suggested that dietary education of cat owners might be inadequate. 3ablood serum 3abody condition 3abody mass index 3acats 3adiabetes 3aeducation 3aglycemic control 3ahematology 3alongitudinal studies 3amedical history 3aoverweight 3aproinsulin 3arisk 3athyroxine 3aurine1 aTraas, Anne M.1 aSchaeffer, David J.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 243, no. 9 p.1302-1309x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.9.13023electronic resource 7aarticle03866naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001100112245008900123300001400212500012100226500002400347520228200371650001702653650001502670650001702685650001902702650001102721650001902732650002102751650001202772650002002784650001102804650001602815650002402831650002002855650001002875650001702885650001802902650001302920650001102933650002202944650002302966650001102989650001703000650001903017650001003036650002203046650001503068651001403083700001403097773012103111852000903232856007103241655001203312IND50085224020221118051329.0131115s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008522402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, J.10aImpact of climate change on food security and proposed solutions for the modern city  ap. 41-52.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Soilless Cultivation, held May 22 - May 25, 2012, Shanghai, China.  aIncludes references  aFood security is achieved "when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life" (FAO). The maintenance of food security is an increasing challenge for modern cities where natural resources (especially arable land) are limited. One key food resource of mankind is vegetable that contains most of the essential components of human nutrition. However, fresh vegetables are perishable and cannot be stocked. To secure reliable vegetable supplies, modern cities such as Singapore need to increase local vegetable production to a certain level of self-sufficiency since erratic climatic conditions can affect the production via traditional methods. Thus urban farming through the adoption of the enabling powers of technology can offer a solution. We have used novel aeroponics technology to produce fresh vegetables in Singapore since 1997. This innovative system allows production of all vegetables, all year round by simply cooling the roots while the aerial parts grow under tropical ambient environments. While it is not possible for arable land to be expanded horizontally, an urban farming system could increase production area through vertical extensions. Vertical stacking of troughs is constrained by the weight factor of the troughs. This could however be resolved through the lightweight aeroponic system. Furthermore, crop management techniques on aeroponic can further enhance crop growth and this could also boost productivity beyond that achieved even by more efficient use of land area. For instance, efficient delivery of the nutrient solution, introduction of higher levels of CO2 to root-zone and mitigate the level of growth inhibitor such as ethylene within the aeroponic system can increase crop growth rate, further enhancing farming efficiency. We could also adopt newly developed light sources such as LEDs for vertical aeroponic farming system to promote uniform plant growth while saving energy. Improving the utilisation of available land via novel engineering and plant physiological solutions, will offer an efficient model of a vertical farm suitable for large scale vegetable production in the modern city. 3aaerial parts 3aaeroponics 3aarable soils 3acarbon dioxide 3acities 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acooling 3acrop management 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aethylene inhibitors 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afood choices 3afood security 3aland use 3amodels 3anatural resources 3anutrient solutions 3apeople 3aplant growth 3araw vegetables 3aroots 3avegetable growing 3avegetables 3aSingapore1 aLee, S.K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Aug., , no. 1004 p.41-52dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1004/1004_3.htm3electronic resource 7aarticle01385naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245004500127300001400172520067900186650001100865650001000876650002200886653001300908653001800921653001000939653001400949773007700963852000901040939003301049946001301082655001201095IND9207529820221118051215.0921211e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920752982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLain, T.E.10aPerformance of nailed-bolted connections  ap. 70-72.  aNailed-bolted and bolted-only connections between 2 by 6 and 4 by 6 treated southern pine lumber were tested in tension to assess any increase in bolted connection performance due to nailing. Test connections included both 1/2- and 3/4-inch bolts alone and in combination with four 20d common wire nails (0.192-in. diameter). Nailing significantly increased bolted joint strength but not joint stiffness. This increase varied with bolt size, joint orientation, and point of interest on the load-deformation curve. Using a consistent safety criterion, only two-thirds of the installed nails effectively contribute to the design strength of the test nailed-bolted connections. 3alumber 3aPinus 3atimber connectors 0astrength 0abolted joints 0anails 0astiffness0 tForest products journal.g1992 , v. 42, no. 7/8 p.70-72x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03265naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245012700165300001600292500002400308500001500332520182900347650001702176650001502193650001502208650002402223650001302247650001302260650001102273650001302284650001602297650001902313650001602332650001202348650000902360650001802369650001402387650002002401650002002421650001302441650002602454650001402480653001702494700001802511700002102529773011702550852000902667856008302676655001202759IND4473810220221118051158.0131113s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447381022DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.243.6.8512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReineke, Erica L.10aEvaluation of an oral electrolyte solution for treatment of mild to moderate dehydration in dogs with hemorrhagic diarrhea  ap. 851-857.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aObjective-To determine the safety and efficacy of an electrolyte solution for oral administration (OES) for the correction of mild to moderate dehydration associated with hemorrhagic diarrhea in dogs. Design-Nonrandomized, noncontrolled clinical trial. Animals-20 dogs that had hemorrhagic diarrhea with < 3 episodes of vomiting. Procedures-All dogs underwent testing for parvovirus infection, were given maropitant citrate to control emesis, and were offered an OES. Intravenous crystalloid fluid administration was performed when dogs refused the OES or had vomiting, a 5% increase in PCV, 5% decrease in body weight, serum creatinine or BUN concentration higher than at admission, or clinically important alterations in blood electrolyte or serum glucose concentrations. Results-13 (65%) dogs voluntarily consumed the OES; 7 (35%) dogs refused the OES and received a balanced electrolyte solution IV instead. All 13 dogs in the OES group consumed the solution ≤ 5 hours after hospital admission. Eight and 16 hours after admission, PCV and serum total protein and BUN concentrations were significantly lower than at hospital admission in the OES group, whereas no significant changes were identified in venous blood pH, base excess, and concentrations of sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, ionized magnesium, and lactate. The cost of treatment was significantly less for the OES group than for the IV treated group. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Rehydration therapy with an OES was effective and safe in dogs with mild to moderate dehydration associated with hemorrhagic diarrhea. Potential benefits of this treatment approach for gastroenteritis in dogs, compared with traditional IV fluid administration, include lower owner-related veterinary costs and decreased staff time associated with treatment. 3aelectrolytes 3aionization 3acreatinine 3aoral administration 3ablood pH 3adiarrhea 3asodium 3acitrates 3ablood serum 3ablood proteins 3abody weight 3acalcium 3adogs 3ablood glucose 3apotassium 3aclinical trials 3agastroenteritis 3avomiting 3aintravenous injection 3amagnesium 0atherapeutics1 aWalton, Karie1 aOtto, Cynthia M.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 243, no. 6 p.851-857x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.6.8513Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02759naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245008100165300001600246500002400262520168700286650001001973650001601983650000901999650002302008650000902031650001602040650001202056650001102068650001802079650001402097700002002111700002202131700002302153773011702176852000902293856008302302655001202385IND4473810420221118051247.0131113s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447381042DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.243.6.8632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBristow, Poppy C.10aUse of vacuum-assisted closure to maintain viability of a skin flap in a dog  ap. 863-868.  aIncludes references  aCase Description-A 4-year-old sexually intact male Labrador Retriever-Poodle mix was admitted to the hospital for treatment of a wound in the left thoracic region. The wound had been debrided and primary closure had been performed by the referring veterinarian 4 days previously. Clinical Findings-The dog had a 20-cm-long wound covered by a large flap of skin that extended caudally from the scapula over the left side of the thorax. A 3-cm defect was evident at the cranioventral aspect of the wound, from which purulent material was being discharged. The skin flap was necrotic, and the skin surrounding the flap was bruised. Signs of pain were elicited when the wound and surrounding region were palpated. Other findings, including those of thoracic radiography, were unremarkable. Treatment and Outcome-The wound was debrided, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) was initiated for 3 days until a healthy bed of granulation tissue developed. A reconstructive procedure was performed with a rotation flap 3 days after VAC dressing removal. The VAC process was reinitiated 2 days following reconstruction because of an apparent failing of the skin flap viability. After 5 days of VAC, the flap had markedly improved in color and consistency and VAC was discontinued. Successful healing of the flap occurred without the need for debridement or additional intervention. Clinical Relevance-Use of VAC led to a good overall outcome for the dog, with complete healing achieved. Additional evaluation of this technique for salvaging failing skin flaps is warranted in dogs, particularly considering that no reliable method for flap salvage in veterinary species has been reported to date. 3acolor 3adebridement 3adogs 3agranulation tissue 3apain 3aradiography 3ascapula 3athorax 3aveterinarians 3aviability1 aPerry, Karen L.1 aHalfacree, Zoe J.1 aLipscomb, Vicky J.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 243, no. 6 p.863-868x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.6.8633Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02263naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245008100158300001600239500002400255520104300279650002701322650001901349650003601368650002501404650001401429650001401443650002201457650001101479650001901490650000901509650002601518650001201544650001201556650002101568651001001589700001801599700001301617700001601630773009301646852000901739856008101748655001201829IND4473811320221118051146.0131114s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447381132DNAL7 a10.4454/JPP.V95I2.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheikh, M.A.10aEffect of bhendi yellow vein mosaic virus on yield components of okra plants  ap. 385-389.  aIncludes references  aAn extensive survey in okra fields was carried out in September-October 2010 and in April-May 2011 and plants were found to be infected by a virus disease. Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) is commonly known in India as bhendi. The effect of virus on some plant characteristics was determined. There was significant variation in the above and below ground components between diseased and healthy plants. Diseased plant height was reduced by 24%, the number of fruits by 32%, fruit length by 31%, stem girth by 16%, root length by 50% and fruit malformation was also observed in diseased plants. Bhendi yellow vein mosaic virus (BYVMV) was identified in 86% of all affected samples by a locally produced BYVMV antiserum in DAS-ELISA assays. Transmission studies revealed that the whitefly Bemisia tabaci is associated with the disease. Disease incidence also varied in different growing seasons. The reduction in yield components incurred by virus infection emphasizes its damaging potential on currently grown okra cultivars in western India. 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aBemisia tabaci 3aBhendi yellow vein mosaic virus 3aabnormal development 3aantiserum 3acultivars 3adisease incidence 3afruits 3agrowing season 3aokra 3aplant characteristics 3asurveys 3aviruses 3ayield components 3aIndia1 aSafiuddin, S.1 aKhan, Z.1 aMahmood, I.0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2013, v. 95, no. 2 p.385-389dEdizioni ETSx1125-46537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4454/JPP.V95I2.0093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02587naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100002200183245005800205300001400263500002400277500001500301520094000316650001101256650001901267650001201286650000901298650001001307650002401317650001501341650001601356650001501372650001601387650001201403650003301415650003401448650000901482650001101491650001101502650000901513650003201522650001601554650003001570653002401600653001301624700001901637700002001656700002501676700002301701773008501724852000901809856008601818930003301904945002501937946001101962655001201973IND4422316520221118050848.0090626e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442231652DNAL7 a187001812pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL3001 aDöring, Dorothea10aFear-related behaviour of dogs in veterinary practice  ap. 38-43.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo investigate further the occurrence of fear-related behaviour in dogs in veterinary practice and to evaluate associated factors, 135 dogs were observed under practice conditions within the framework of a standardised test examination and the owners interviewed using a questionnaire. Most dogs exhibited fear reactions, particularly on the examination table, with 78.5% (106/135) categorised as 'fearful' based on their behaviour. Unlike weight and castration, age, gender and previous experience were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with fearful behaviour. Male dogs were significantly less 'fearful' than females and animals under <2 years were significantly less 'fearful' compared with older dogs. Those with only positive previous experiences in veterinary surgeries were significantly less 'fearful' than dogs that had a previous negative experience. Fear-related behaviour in veterinary practice is an issue of importance. 3aweight 3aquestionnaires 3afemales 3adogs 3amales 3aveterinary medicine 3acastration 3afearfulness 3aanimal age 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aDogsxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aFear 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Factors 2aVeterinariansxpsychology 0aprevious experience 0abehavior1 aRoscher, Anita1 aScheipl, Fabian1 aKüchenhoff, Helmut.1 aErhard, Michael H.0 tVeterinary journal.g2009 Oct., v. 182, no. 1 p.38-43dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.05.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/07/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02934naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002400189245013500213300001600348500002400364520093100388650000901319650001701328650001601345650002001361650001901381650001201400650001101412650001501423650001701438650001701455650002101472650001201493650005401505650002601559650000901585650003801594650005201632650000901684653003701693653002001730653004001750653002701790653002201817653003001839653003301869653002101902700001901923700002301942700001701965700002801982773010202010852000902112856009202121930003302213945002502246946001302271655001202284IND4422330520221118050949.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442233052DNAL7 a195730662pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00535.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL8401 aBrockman, Daniel J.10aPartial Right Ventriculectomy Using the Incised Patch Technique to Treat Double Chambered Right Ventricle and Chylothorax in a Cat  ap. 631-635.  aIncludes references  aTo report successful surgical treatment of double chambered right ventricle (DCRV) in a cat. Clinical report. Cat with DCRV. DCRV was diagnosed in a 5-month-old male Maine Coon cat using echocardiography and angiocardiography. At 2 years, despite medical therapy, chylothorax developed. A section of the right ventricular free wall that spanned the fibromuscular obstruction was excised under total venous inflow occlusion (TVIO) using the incised pericardial patch technique. Short-term recovery was complicated by return of chylothorax but this resolved after thoracocentesis and diuretic therapy. Three years after surgery, the cat is free of clinical signs and no longer on any medical therapy. Partial right ventriculectomy can be performed under TVIO through an incised pericardial patch. DCRV in cat can be successfully treated by partial right ventriculectomy performed under TVIO through an incised pericardial patch. 3acats 3acat diseases 3achylothorax 3aheart ventricle 3aheart diseases 3asurgery 3abreeds 3ablood flow 3adrug therapy 3acase studies 3aechocardiography 2aAnimals 2aCardiac Surgical Proceduresxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCat Diseasesxsurgery 2aCats 2aChylothoraxxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aHeart Defects, Congenitalxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aMale 0adouble chambered right ventricle 0aventriculectomy 0aincised pericardial patch technique 0aMaine Coon (cat breed) 0aangiocardiography 0afibromuscular obstruction 0atotal venus inflow occlusion 0adiuretic therapy1 aBORER, KATE E.1 aBaines, Stephen J.1 aHughes, Dez.1 aLuis Fuentes, Virginia.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2009 July, v. 38, no. 5 p.631-635dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00535.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/07/30  aOther US 7aarticle02666naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002500189245012100214300001600335500002400351520115200375650001201527650001001539650001901549650002201568650001601590650001001606650001201616650003301628650002501661650002601686650000901712650003401721650004201755650002401797650002601821653003101847700002001878773010201898852000902000856009202009930003302101945002502134946001302159655001202172IND4422330920221118051029.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442233092DNAL7 a195730702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2009.00553.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL8411 aARONSOHN, MICHAEL G.10aUnilateral Uniplanar External Skeletal Fixation for Isolated Diaphyseal Tibial Fractures in Skeletally Immature Dogs  ap. 654-658.  aIncludes references  aTo report and evaluate use of external skeletal fixation (ESF) for repair of isolated (fibula intact) diaphyseal tibia fractures in skeletally immature dogs.

Eighteen dogs with screening results 0/1, 1/0, or one or both elbows graded as borderline were studied. The radiographs were evaluated according to International Elbow Working Group guidelines and compared with CT images. A fragmented medial coronoid process was seen in five joints, and remaining 31 joints were considered free of dysplasia based on CT images. In radiographs, height of the radiopaque area on the anconeal process was 0-2.7 mm in dysplastic and 0-3.0 mm in other joints. Sensitivity of this sign as dysplasia indicator was 40% and specificity 29%. All dysplastic joints and three of the other joints had blurring of the cranial edge of the medial coronoid process. Subtrochlear sclerosis was seen in four dysplastic joints and in three other joints. Both changes were significant indicators of dysplasia (P<0.001). Sensitivity and specificity of these phenomena as dysplasia indicators were 80% and 90%, respectively. We conclude that the radiopaque area on the anconeal process might not always be osteophyte formation in Belgian shepherds and should not be used as the sole criterion for dysplasia. Blurring of the medial coronoid process cranial edge and ulnar trochlear notch sclerosis are reliable signs of elbow dysplasia and may be beneficial in screening protocols. 3adisease diagnosis 3aimage analysis 3aradiography 3amorphogenesis 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aaccuracy 3avalidity 3abone formation 3asclerosis 3adisease severity 3aabnormal development 3aelbows 3acomputed tomography 3aosteoarthritis 3adisease course 3adog breeds 2aAnimals 2aArthrographyxveterinary 2aDog Diseasesxradiography. 2aDogs 2aForelimbxradiography. 2aJoint Diseasesxradiographyxveterinary. 2aJoints 2aTomography, X-Ray Computedxveterinary 0aBelgian Shepherd Dog (dog breed) 0aelbow dysplasia 0aosterophytes 0aosteophytosis 0aetiology 0acoronoid process 0ajoint diseases1 aMÖLSÄ, SARI1 aLIMAN, ANNIE1 aLAITINEN-VAPAAVUORI, OUTI1 aSNELLMAN, MARJATTA0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2009 , v. 50, no. 4 p.364-369dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01551.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01551.x  a20090924b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/09/10  aOther US 7aarticle03111naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171072001700188100002100205245007900226300001600305500002400321520123600345650001101581650001101592650001201603650001901615650003101634650000901665650002601674650001501700650001901715650001401734650001801748650001301766650001301779650002201792650001201814650001901826650003201845650003201877650004301909650003301952650002101985653001902006653002002025700002402045700001802069700001802087700002202105773013102127852000902258856009202267856005502359930003302414945002502447946001302472655001202485IND4422340120221118050910.0090626e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442234012DNAL7 a196976042pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01555.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using a 0.3 T unit, the laryngeal and pharyngeal regions was imaged in two horses. The protocol consisted of sagittal and transverse T2-weighted (T2w) fast spin echo, transverse T1-weighted (T1w) spin echo, and dorsal high-resolution T1w gradient echo (both pre- and postcontrast enhancement) sequences. Euthanasia was performed at the end of the imaging procedure. Macroscopic anatomy of the cadaver sections were compared with the MR images in transverse, midsagittal, and parasagittal planes. There was good differentiation of anatomic structures, including soft tissues. The laryngeal cartilages, hyoid apparatus, and upper airway muscle groups with their attachments could be clearly identified. However, it was not always possible to delineate individual muscles in each plane. Most useful were both T2w and T1w transverse sequences. Intravenous application of contrast medium was helpful to identify blood vessels. The MR images corresponded with the macroscopic anatomy of cadaver sections. 3ahorses 3alarynx 3apharynx 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3adyes 3aintravenous injection 3aanesthesia 3amuscle tissues 3acartilage 3ablood vessels 3avalidity 3aaccuracy 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aContrast Media 2aHorsesxanatomy & histology 2aLarynxxanatomy & histology 2aMagnetic Resonance Imagingxveterinary 2aPharynxxanatomy & histology 2aReference Values 0acontrast media 0ahyoid apparatus1 aKIRCHER, PATRICK R.1 aKONAR, MARTIN1 aLang, Johann.1 aTESSIER, CAROLINE0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2009 , v. 50, no. 4 p.392-397dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01555.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01555.x  a20090924b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle02604naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245002800130300002000158500002400178520173400202650002601936650001701962650001501979650001001994650001402004650001502018650001102033650001302044700002302057773011802080852000902198856008302207655001202290IND4473553720221118050954.0131108s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447355372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReeds, Peter J.10aGlutamine and the Bowel  ap. 2505S-2508S.  aIncludes references  aSince the pioneering work of Windmueller and Spaeth, the importance of glutamine to the support of intestinal mucosal metabolic function has become generally accepted. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying this role still remain obscure. This paper explores a number of questions: 1) Is glutamine essential for intestinal function? 2) To what extent does this relate to its intermediary metabolism? 3) What is the importance of glutamine as a biosynthetic precursor? 4) Is glutamine supplementation of the nutrient mixture presented to patients of any metabolic or clinical benefit? As a result of this exploratory exercise, the following general conclusions were reached: 1) Much suggestive biochemical and physiologic evidence exists that implies that glutamine, especially systemic glutamine, supports the function of the intestinal mucosal system. 2) Despite the extensive metabolism of this amino acid by the intestinal tissues, most evidence suggests that if glutamine does play a physiologic role in the bowel, it is not compellingly related to its intermediary metabolism. 3) There is, on the other hand, evidence that the mucosal cells not only utilize extracellular glutamine but synthesize the amino acid. Given that inhibition of glutamine synthesis inhibits both proliferation and differentiation of mucosal cell cultures, this suggests some more subtle regulatory role. This notion is supported by the demonstration that glutamine will activate a number of genes associated with cell cycle progression in the mucosa. 4) Despite the accumulated evidence, the mechanisms underlying glutamine’s function and the question whether glutamine supplementation uniformly benefits mucosal health remain equivocal at best. 3aamino acid metabolism 3acell culture 3acell cycle 3agenes 3aglutamine 3aintestines 3amucosa 3apatients1 aBurrin, Douglas G.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Sept., v. 131, no. 9S p.2505S-2508SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/9.toc3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03178naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100002400183245015200207300001600359500002400375500001500399520150900414650002301923650001801946650002301964650002201987650001802009650002502027650001102052650002202063650002002085650000902105650001902114650002702133650002002160650001102180650002402191653002402215653002302239700001502262700001802277700002202295700002102317773011002338852000902448856009602457930003302553945002502586946001302611655001202624IND4422362420221118050928.0090626e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442236242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL600 0aL2001 aKershaw-Young, C.M.14aThe mRNA expression of prostaglandin E receptors EP₂ and EP₄ and the changes in glycosaminoglycans in the sheep cervix during the estrous cycle  ap. 251-261.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTranscervical artificial insemination in sheep is limited by the inability to completely penetrate the cervix with an inseminating pipette. Penetration is partially enhanced at estrus due to a degree of cervical relaxation, which is probably regulated by cervical prostaglandin synthesis and extracellular matrix remodeling. Prostaglandin E₂ acts via prostaglandin E receptors EP₁ to EP₄, and EP₂ and EP₄ stimulate smooth muscle relaxation and glycosaminoglycan synthesis. This study investigated the expression of EP₂ and EP₄ mRNA and glycosaminoglycans in the sheep cervix during the estrous cycle. Sheep cervices were collected prior to, during, and after the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and during the luteal phase. The mRNA expression of EP₂ and EP₄ was determined by in situ hybridization, glycosaminoglycan composition was assessed by Alcian blue staining, and hyaluronan concentration was investigated by ELISA. The expression of EP₂ mRNA was greatest prior to the LH surge (P =0.02), although EP₂ and EP₄ were expressed throughout the estrous cycle. Hyaluronan was the predominant glycosaminoglycan, and hyaluronan content increased prior to the LH surge (P <0.05). Cervical EP₂ mRNA expression changed throughout the estrous cycle and was greatest prior to the LH surge.

The presence of a tumor produces great changes in host glutamine metabolism in such a way that host nitrogen metabolism is accommodated to the tumor-enhanced requirements of glutamine. To be used, glutamine must be transported into tumor mitochondria. Thus, an overview of the role of glutamine in cancer requires not only a discussion of host and tumor glutamine metabolism, but also its circulation and transport. Because glutamine depletion has adverse effects for the host, the effect of glutamine supplementation in the tumor-bearing state should also be studied. This communication reviews the state of knowledge of glutamine and cancer, including potential therapeutic implications. 3aadverse effects 3aglutamine 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Sept., v. 131, no. 9S p.2539S-2542SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/9.toc3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02520naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245004600132300002000178500002400198520132600222650001501548650002301563650002001586650002101606650001101627650002001638650002601658650001401684650001601698650001601714650001401730650001401744650001901758650001301777700002401790700002801814700001901842700002701861773011801888852000902006856008302015655001202098IND4473554720221118051108.0131108s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447355472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoelens, Petra G.10aGlutamine Alimentation in Catabolic State  ap. 2569S-2577S.  aIncludes references  aGlutamine should be reclassified as a conditionally essential amino acid in the catabolic state because the body’s glutamine expenditures exceed synthesis and low glutamine levels in plasma are associated with poor clinical outcome. After severe stress, several amino acids are mobilized from muscle tissue to supply energy and substrate to the host. Glutamine is one of the most important amino acids that provide this function. Glutamine acts as the preferred respiratory fuel for lymphocytes, hepatocytes and intestinal mucosal cells and is metabolized in the gut to citrulline, ammonium and other amino acids. Low concentrations of glutamine in plasma reflect reduced stores in muscle and this reduced availability of glutamine in the catabolic state seems to correlate with increased morbidity and mortality. Adding glutamine to the nutrition of clinical patients, enterally or parenterally, may reduce morbidity. Several excellent clinical trials have been performed to prove efficacy and feasibility of the use of glutamine supplementation in parenteral and enteral nutrition. The increased intake of glutamine has resulted in lower septic morbidity in certain critically ill patient populations. This review will focus on the efficacy and the importance of glutamine supplementation in diverse catabolic states. 3acitrulline 3aclinical nutrition 3aclinical trials 3adigestive system 3aenergy 3aenteral feeding 3aessential amino acids 3aglutamine 3ahepatocytes 3alymphocytes 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amuscle tissues 3apatients1 aNijveldt, Robert J.1 aHoudijk, Alexander P.J.1 aMeijer, Sybren1 aLeeuwen, Paul A.M. van0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Sept., v. 131, no. 9S p.2569S-2577SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/9.toc3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01627naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008700129300002000216500002400236520070800260650002800968650001600996650001101012650002601023650002001049650001301069650001101082700002101093773011801114852000901232856008401241655001201325IND4473555320221118050931.0131108s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447355532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiron, Mathieu10aRegulation of Translation via TOR Signaling: Insights from Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 2988S-2993S.  aIncludes references  aThe target of rapamycin (TOR) proteins are large protein kinases evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human.

Under such conditions, TOR blocks the transmission of growth-promoting signals from extracellular stimuli. Recent data obtained by genetic studies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate the importance of both insulin-like signaling and TOR signaling in promoting growth. Importantly, these studies identified a major downstream target of TOR and insulin-like signaling as the translational machinery. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3afruit flies 3ahumans 3anutrient availability 3aprotein kinases 3aproteins 3ayeasts1 aSonenberg, Nahum0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Nov., v. 131, no. 11S p.2988S-2993SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/11.toc3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01985naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245007000135300002000205500002400225520089500249650001401144650001301158650001301171650001101184650001401195650000901209650002101218650001901239650001901258650001601277650001701293650001401310650001401324650001101338650001001349700001701359773011801376852000901494856008401503655001201587IND4473555520221118051023.0131108s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447355552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeville, Margaret C.10aPhysiology and Endocrine Changes Underlying Human Lactogenesis II  ap. 3005S-3008S.  aIncludes references  aLactogenesis stage II, the onset of copious milk secretion, takes place during the first 4 d postpartum in women and involves a carefully programmed set of changes in milk composition and volume. The evidence is summarized that progesterone withdrawal at parturition provides the trigger for lactogenesis in the presence of high plasma concentrations of prolactin and adequate plasma concentrations of cortisol. Although the process is generally robust, delayed lactogenesis does occur with stressful deliveries and in poorly controlled diabetes. Failure of early removal of colostrum from the breast is associated with high milk sodium and poor prognosis for successful lactation in many women. We speculate that this problem may result from accumulation of a substance in the mammary alveolus that inhibits lactogenesis, even in the face of appropriate hormonal changes after parturition. 3acolostrum 3acortisol 3adiabetes 3ahumans 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk secretion 3amilk synthesis 3aparturition 3aprogesterone 3aprognosis 3aprolactin 3asodium 3awomen1 aMorton, Jane0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Nov., v. 131, no. 11S p.3005S-3008SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/11.toc3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03309naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138072000900156072000900165100001200174245015700186300001600343500002400359520173900383650002002122650001002142650002702152650002402179650001702203650001402220650003302234650002702267650001102294650002202305650002702327650001902354650002002373650001802393650002202411650001502433650001602448653004002464700001302504773011002517852000902627856009602636930003302732945002502765946001302790655001202803IND4422361520221118051049.0090626e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442236152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL2101 aRaz, T.10aEfficiency of superovulation and in vivo embryo production in eFSH-treated donor mares after estrus synchronization with progesterone and estradiol-17β  ap. 169-178.  aIncludes references  aReliable methods of regulating estrus and stimulating superovulations in equine embryo transfer programs are desirable. Our objectives were to investigate the efficacy of a progesterone and estradiol-17β (P&E) estrus synchronization regimen in mares with and without subsequent equine follicle-stimulating hormone (eFSH) treatment and to examine the effects of eFSH on folliculogenesis and embryo production. Cycling mares were treated with P&E daily for 10 d. On the final P&E treatment day, prostaglandin F₂α was administered, and mares were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (n=20 mares/group). In both groups, mares were examined daily by transrectal ultrasonography. In the eFSH group, twice-daily eFSH treatments were initiated at follicle diameter 20 to 25mm and ceased at follicle >=35mm; human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) was administered after 36h. In the control group, eFSH treatments were not given, but hCG was administered at follicle >=35mm. Mares were inseminated with fresh semen, and embryo recovery attempts were performed 8 d postovulation. Synchrony of ovulations within each group appeared to be similar. Six mares in the eFSH group failed to ovulate. The eFSH treatment resulted in higher (P<0.05) numbers of preovulatory follicles and ovulations; however, embryo recovery rate did not increase (eFSH 1.0±0.4 vs. control 0.95±0.1 embryos/recovery attempt), and embryo per ovulation rate was significantly lower (36% vs. 73%). The eFSH-treated mares had significantly higher frequency of nonovulatory follicles (28% vs. 0) and higher periovulatory serum concentrations of estradiol-17β. Based on our findings, combined P&E and eFSH regimens cannot be recommended for cycling donor mares. 3aembryo transfer 3amares 3aestrus synchronization 3ahormonal regulation 3aprogesterone 3aestradiol 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aphysiological response 3aestrus 3aovarian follicles 3afollicular development 3asuperovulation 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryogenesis 3ahormone secretion 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 0aequine follicle-stimulating hormone1 aCard, C.0 tTheriogenology.g2009 July 15, v. 72, no. 2 p.169-178dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.02.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle04011naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002200158245010600180300001400286500002400300520274700324650001603071650001903087650001703106650001303123650001503136650001003151651001203161653001803173653002203191700002003213700002203233700001803255700002303273700002203296773009203318852000903410856008903419930003303508945002503541946001103566655001203577IND4422361020221118051032.0090626e20090630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442236102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2001 aStotler, Randy L.10aHydrogeochemistry of groundwaters in and below the base of thick permafrost at Lupin, Nunavut, Canada  ap. 80-95.  aIncludes references  aShield fluids are commonly understood to evolve through water-rock interaction. However, fluids may also concentrate during ice formation. Very little is currently known about groundwater conditions beneath thick permafrost in crystalline environments. This paper evaluates three possible Shield fluid evolution pathways at a crystalline Shield location currently under 500+ meters of permafrost, including surfical cryogenic concentration of seawater, in situ cryogenic concentration and water-rock interaction. A primary goal of this study was to further scientific understanding of permafrost and its role in influencing deep flow system evolution, fluid movement and chemical evolution of waters in crystalline rocks. Precipitation, surface, permafrost and subpermafrost water samples were collected, as well as dissolved and free gas samples, fracture fillings and matrix fluid samples to characterize the site. Investigations of groundwater conditions beneath thick permafrost provides valuable information which can be applied to safety assessment of deep, underground nuclear waste repositories, effects of long-term mining in permafrost areas and understanding analogues to potential life-bearing zones on Mars. The study was conducted in the Lupin gold mine in Nunavut, Canada, located within the zone of continuous permafrost. Through-taliks beneath large lakes in the area provided potential hydraulic connections through the permafrost. Na-Cl and Na-Cl-SO₄ type permafrost waters were contaminated by mining activities, affecting the chloride and nitrate concentrations. High nitrate concentrations (423-2630mgL⁻¹) were attributed to remnants of blasting. High sulfate concentrations in the permafrost (578-5000mgL⁻¹) were attributed to naturally occurring and mining enhanced sulfide oxidation. Mine dewatering created an artificial hydraulic gradient, resulting in methane hydrate dissociation at depth. Less contaminated basal waters had medium sulfate concentrations and were Ca-Na dominated, similar to deeper subpermafrost waters. Subpermafrost waters had a wide range of salinities (2.6-40gL⁻¹). It was unclear from this investigation what impact talik waters would have on deep groundwaters in undisturbed environments. In situ cryogenic concentration due to ice and methane hydrate formation may have concentrated the remaining fluids, however there was no evidence that infiltration of cryogenically concentrated seawater occurred since the last glacial maximum. Matrix waters were dilute and unable to affect groundwater salinity. Fracture infillings were scarce, but calcite fluid inclusion microthermometry indicated a large range in salinities, potentially an additional source of salinity to the system. 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3ageochemistry 3aaquifers 3apermafrost 3arocks 3aNunavut 0aShield fluids 0acrystalline rocks1 aFrape, Shaun K.1 aRuskeeniemi, Timo1 aAhonen, Lasse1 aOnstott, Tullis C.1 aHobbs, Monique Y.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 June 30, v. 373, no. 1-2 p.80-95dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.04.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090707b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/07/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03145naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012200128300001800250500002400268520168700292650002001979650002501999650001602024650002102040650002502061650000902086650001002095650001102105650001502116650002402131650002102155650002302176650001002199650002802209650001802237650000902255650001902264650001602283650003102299650002102330650001402351650001002365700001702375700001702392700002202409773011502431852000902546856008402555655001202639IND4473559620221118051221.0131108s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447355962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoa, Pei-Min10aOxidized Frying Oil Up-Regulates Hepatic Acyl-CoA Oxidase and Cytochrome P450 4 A1 Genes in Rats and Activates PPARα  ap. 3166-3174.  aIncludes references  aOxidized LDL (oxLDL) and its component hydroxy fatty acids were shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor α (PPARα) and γ (PPARγ). To test the hypothesis that lipid oxidation products in oxidized frying oil (OFO) can activate PPARα and up-regulate its target genes, a feeding experiment and a transactivation experiment were conducted. Based on a 2 × 2 factorial design, four groups of Sprague-Dawley male weanling rats were fed diets containing either high (20 g/100 g, HO and HF) or low (5 g/100 g, LO and LF) levels of oxidized frying soybean oil (HO and LO) or fresh soybean oil (HF and LF) for 6 wk. The OFO sample was prepared by frying wheat dough sheets in soybean oil at 205 ± 5°C for 24 h. OFO dose dependently and significantly increased (P < 0.05) mRNA of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and cytochrome P450 4A1(CYP4A1) in liver of rats. Dietary OFO also dose dependently increased liver microsomal CYP4A protein (P < 0.05). The activity of hepatic ACO of the HO group was sixfold that of the HF group (P < 0.05). Plasma total lipids, liver triglycerides, cholesterol and total lipids were reduced in rats fed the LO and HO diets (P < 0.05). Through the ligand binding domain of PPARα, the hydrolyzed OFO enhanced the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reporter gene to a significantly greater extent (P < 0.05) than the hydrolyzed fresh soybean oil in a transactivation assay using a clone of CHO K1 cells stably expressing Gal4-PPARα chimeric receptor and UAS4-ALP reporter. The results support our hypothesis that dietary OFO, by activating PPARα, up-regulates the expression of PPARα downstream genes and alters lipid metabolism in rats. 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acholesterol 3acytochrome P-450 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adiet 3adough 3afrying 3afrying oil 3ahydroxy fatty acids 3alipid metabolism 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3amessenger RNA 3arats 3areporter genes 3asoybean oil 3atranscriptional activation 3atriacylglycerols 3aweanlings 3awheat1 aChao, Che-Yi1 aLin, Fu-Jung1 aHuang, Ching-jang0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Dec., v. 131, no. 12 p.3166-3174dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://jn.nutrition.org/content/131/12.toc3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03605naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245009400186300001800280500002400298500001500322520161400337650002501951650001801976650001301994650002202007650000902029650001702038650001402055650000902069650002502078650002402103650002102127650001002148650002502158650002002183650002402203650002602227650003802253650002702291650002502318650002802343650003102371650002102402650001402423650005302437650002202490650003202512650002302544650003102567650002202598650002302620653004302643700001702686700001702703700001702720700001802737773012402755852000902879856005502888655001202943IND4444465720221118051033.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444446572DNAL7 a209776592pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00982.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xin10aGenome‐Wide Analysis of WOX Gene Family in Rice, Sorghum, Maize, Arabidopsis and Poplar  ap. 1016-1026.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWUSCHEL‐related homeobox (WOX) genes form a large gene family specifically expressed in plants. They are known to play important roles in regulating the development of plant tissues and organs by determining cell fate. Recent available whole genome sequences allow us to do more comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the WOX genes in plants. In the present study, we identified 11 and 21 WOXs from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and maize (Zea mays), respectively. The 72 WOX genes from rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum, maize, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) were grouped into three well supported clades with nine subgroups according to the amino acid sequences of their homodomains. Their phylogenetic relationship was also supported by the observation of the motifs outside the homodomain. We observed the variation of duplication events among the nine sub‐groups between monocots and eudicots, for instance, more gene duplication events of WOXs within subgroup A for monocots, while, less for dicots in this subgroup. Furthermore, we observed the conserved intron/exon structural patterns of WOX genes in rice, sorghum and Arabidopsis. In addition, WUS (Wuschel)‐box and EAR (the ERF‐associated amphiphilic repression)‐like motif were observed to be conserved among several WOX subgroups in these five plants. Comparative analysis of expression patterns of WOX genes in rice and Arabidopsis suggest that the WOX genes play conserved and various roles in plants. This work provides insights into the evolution of the WOX gene family and is useful for future research. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant tissues 3aZea mays 3aplant development 3arice 3aOryza sativa 3aphylogeny 3acorn 3aamino acid sequences 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3agene duplication 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aSorghum bicolor 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aLikelihood Functions 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Familyxgenetics 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPopulusxgenetics 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSorghumxgenetics 2aZea maysxgenetics 0aPopulus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa1 aRenjiejushi.1 aLiu, Jianhua1 aYin, Jinyuan1 aZhang, Dabing0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2010 Nov., v. 52, no. 11 p.1016-1026dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00982.x 7aarticle03796naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245011100164300001800275500002400293500001500317520218700332650001002519650001602529650001602545650001502561650001202576650000902588650001202597650001202609650001702621650001802638650002102656650001702677650002802694650002702722650001502749650001602764650001202780650001702792650001002809650002202819650001302841650002402854650003702878650001002915650001402925653001702939700001502956700001502971700002002986700002203006773011403028852000903142856005503151655001203206IND4461175420221118051133.0110805e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446117542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00437.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOU, HU10aInhibition of melanogenic activity by gelatin and polypeptides from pacific cod skin in b16 melanoma cells  ap. 1099-1116.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGelatin extracted from Pacific cod skin was hydrolysed with serials of protease. Then, the effects of gelatin and polypeptides on melanogenesis and antioxidant were assessed using B16 melanoma cell and reactive oxygen species scavenging ability. Polypeptides showed better scavenging properties on superoxide anions and hydroxyl radical in vitro than gelatin. PEP1 (2-6 kDa) exhibited the highest inhibition of melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity without affecting cell growth. PEP1 (100 µg/mL) significantly reduced the melanin content to 60.5% of control and tyrosinase activity to 51.7% of control, respectively (P < 0.01). In addition, the cyclic AMP levels was decreased evidently, and intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio were enhanced remarkably in a dose-dependent manner treated by PEP1, which expected to play a crucial role in the regulation of melanogenesis. Treatment with PEP1 at 100 µg/mL, GSH levels increased 16.6-fold and GSSG contents were reduced to 38.8% of control. Therefore, PEP1 can be used as a potential antimelanogenesis substance. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Gelatin is an important functional biopolymer that has a very broad application in many industrial fields, such as food, cosmetics, materials, pharmacy and photography. Although the properties of gelatin from fish skin are different from those from mammals and avian species, fish skin gelatin has the advantages of utilizing highly abundant fish offal, and avoiding bovine spongiform encephalopathy concerns. Protease hydrolysis of gelatin has been shown to produce biologically active peptides that inhibited angiotensin I converting enzyme and linoleic acid peroxidation. Recently, we confirmed that gelatin hydrolysates exhibited better scavenging properties and inhibition of melanogenic activity. Presently, a global market demand has developed for skin-lightening agents as “vanity” cosmeceutical products, because lighter skin color is preferred by some dark-skinned individuals in many countries and races. Thus, it appears that gelatin hydrolysate could be an economical source of antioxidant and antimelanogenesis peptides that may be produced in large quantities at relatively low cost. 3afoods 3acell growth 3abiopolymers 3acyclic AMP 3amelanin 3afish 3amammals 3agelatin 3apolypeptides 3alinoleic acid 3asuperoxide anion 3aperoxidation 3aindustrial applications 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3ahydrolysis 3aphotography 3amarkets 3ahydrolysates 3araces 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amelanoma 3aGadus macrocephalus 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3acolor 3acosmetics 0aantioxidants1 aZhao, Xue.1 aLI, BAFANG1 aZhang, Zhaohui.1 aZHUANG, YONGLIANG0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2011 Aug., v. 35, no. 4 p.1099-1116dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4514.2010.00437.x 7aarticle03983naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001600165245014800181300001600329500002400345520170300369650002302072650001702095650001302112650001802125650002802143650001802171650001602189650002802205650001402233650002402247650001602271650001702287650001702304650001802321650000802339650002002347650000902367650001102376650001402387650005502401650005102456650002402507650003802531650003502569650004002604650002802644650002102672650007002693650001102763650002402774650000902798650002302807650001902830650002702849650002002876650002102896650001602917700002102933700002002954700001902974700001202993700001903005700002203024773013303046852000903179856004903188655001203237IND4456991920221118051016.0110422e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445699192DNAL7 a215151222pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2011.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMah, Eunice10aVitamin C Status Is Related to Proinflammatory Responses and Impaired Vascular Endothelial Function in Healthy, College-Aged Lean and Obese Men  ap. 737-743.  aIncludes references  aVitamin C supplementation has been suggested to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. However, no studies have examined the relationship between vitamin C status and vascular dysfunction in lean and obese individuals in the absence of supplementation. We examined whether vascular function is interrelated with vitamin C status and inflammation in healthy, college-aged lean and obese men with no history of dietary supplementation. A cross-sectional study was conducted during winter 2008 in lean and obese men aged 21±3 years (n=8/group). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured to determine vascular endothelial function. Plasma antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and thiols), inflammatory proteins (C-reactive protein [CRP], myeloperoxidase [MPO], and cytokines), and cellular adhesion molecules were measured. Participants also completed 3-day food records on the days preceding their vascular testing. Group differences were evaluated by t tests, and correlation coefficients were determined by linear regression. FMD was 21% lower (P<0.05) in obese men. They also had 51% lower vitamin C intakes and 38% lower plasma vitamin C concentrations. Obese men had greater plasma concentrations of CRP, MPO, inflammatory cytokines, and cellular adhesion molecules. Participants' CRP and MPO were each inversely related (P<0.05) to FMD (r=−0.528 and −0.625) and plasma vitamin C (r=−0.646 and −0.701). These data suggest that low vitamin C status is associated with proinflammatory responses and impaired vascular function in lean and obese men. Additional study is warranted to determine whether improving dietary vitamin C intakes from food attenuate vascular dysfunction. 3aC-reactive protein 3aantioxidants 3aarteries 3aascorbic acid 3acardiovascular diseases 3acell adhesion 3acorrelation 3across-sectional studies 3acytokines 3adietary supplements 3afood intake 3afood records 3ainflammation 3alinear models 3amen 3amyeloperoxidase 3arisk 3athiols 3avitamin E 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aAscorbic Acidxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aBlood Flow Velocity 2aBrachial Arteryxultrasonography. 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCell Adhesion Moleculesxmetabolism 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aCytokinesxblood 2aEndothelium, Vascularxdrug effectsxphysiologyxphysiopathology. 2aHumans 2aInflammationxblood 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aObesityxblood 2aPeroxidasexmetabolism 2aThinnessxblood 2aVitamin Exblood 2aYoung Adult1 aMatos, Manuel D.1 aKawiecki, Diana1 aBallard, Kevin1 aGuo, Yi1 aVolek, Jeff S.1 aBruno, Richard S.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2011 May, v. 111, no. 5 p.737-743dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2011.02.003 7aarticle01523naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006600165300001400231500002400245520063200269650001400901650001200915650002200927650001300949700002200962700002100984700002201005700002601027773009901053852000901152856004801161655001201209IND4435234420221118051001.0100409e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443523442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-010-9524-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkmanov, R.

It is being increasingly used by ecologists to address diverse questions that often focus on applied conservation issues and may incorporate local knowledge with biological data from more conventional research and monitoring. We characterize how LEK has been used in the ecological and conservation literature over the last 25 years by broadly examining 360 journals and by evaluating 12 prominent ecological and conservation journals in greater detail. Over this period, the use of LEK has increased considerably, although only 0.01% of papers in the broad and 0.42% of those in the more detailed evaluation incorporated LEK. Despite this increase, LEK-based publications remain nearly absent from the more established theoretical literature and are largely restricted to more recent and arguably less prestigious applied and interdisciplinary journals. Most LEK studies used interviews, but generally failed to actively include community members in the research process. Changes to the research and publishing process that include local people and address these shortcomings and the broader issues of power and influence in the sciences are critical to the successful utilization of LEK. These changes are necessary for the appropriate depiction of these knowledge systems and to ensure that local knowledge holders will continue participating in ecological research aimed at conservation. 3aecologists 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3amonitoring1 aMcLachlan, Stéphane M.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2008 Dec., v. 17, no. 14 p.3501-3512dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9445-x 7aarticle03389naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245010400187300001600291500002400307520145000331650001201781650001301793650001201806650001501818650001401833650001001847650001001857650003101867650001301898650001601911650001801927650001801945650001301963650002101976650001401997650001902011650002002030650001202050650002902062650002802091650001402119650002102133650002502154650002502179650003402204650003102238650002902269650003102298650000902329650002402338650001202362651001802374651001102392700001902403700002302422700002402445700002202469700002802491700003002519773008502549852000902634856004802643655001202691IND4434265920100501100639.0100319e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443426592DNAL7 a200245852pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-009-1533-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero, Gustavo Q.10aNitrogen fluxes from treefrogs to tank epiphytic bromeliads: an isotopic and physiological approach  ap. 941-949.  aIncludes references  aDiverse invertebrate and vertebrate species live in association with plants of the large Neotropical family Bromeliaceae. Although previous studies have assumed that debris of associated organisms improves plant nutrition, so far little evidence supports this assumption. In this study we used isotopic (¹⁵N) and physiological methods to investigate if the treefrog Scinax hayii, which uses the tank epiphytic bromeliad Vriesea bituminosa as a diurnal shelter, contributes to host plant nutrition. In the field, bromeliads with frogs had higher stable N isotopic composition (δ¹⁵N) values than those without frogs. Similar results were obtained from a controlled greenhouse experiment. Linear mixing models showed that frog feces and dead termites used to simulate insects that eventually fall inside the bromeliad tank contributed, respectively, 27.7% (±0.07 SE) and 49.6% (±0.50 SE) of the total N of V. bituminosa. Net photosynthetic rate was higher in plants that received feces and termites than in controls; however, this effect was only detected in the rainy, but not in the dry season. These results demonstrate for the first time that vertebrates contribute to bromeliad nutrition, and that this benefit is seasonally restricted. Since amphibian-bromeliad associations occur in diverse habitats in South and Central America, this mechanism for deriving nutrients may be important in bromeliad systems throughout the Neotropics. 3aHylidae 3aIsoptera 3aVriesea 3adry season 3aepiphytes 3afeces 3afrogs 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3ainvertebrates 3alinear models 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant nutrition 2aAnimals 2aBromeliaceaexphysiology 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aEcosystem 2aFecesxchemistry 2aIsopteraxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Isotopesxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRain 2aRanidaexphysiology 2aSeasons 3aSouth America 0aBrazil1 aNomura, Fausto1 aGonçalves, Ana Z.1 aDias, Natacha Y.

At slow cooling rate, CPO TAG sequentially crystallise in apparently two different lamellar structures with double-chain length of 41.9 Å and a triple-chain length of 62.8Å stackings of β' type, which are correlated to two main exothermic peaks at 26 and 8 °C, respectively. While a time-dependent slow β'[rightward arrow]β irreversible transition is observed even at low temperature, it only affects a few percent of the TAG population. Subsequent heating at 1 °C/min showed no structural rearrangements of the crystalline forms observed before final melting, indicating that the main moiety of the system is close to equilibrium. Crystallisation at 0.4 °C/min has shown the formation of many additional structures, some of which are evanescent. An unexpected finding was the vicinity of the two lines corresponding to the two 2L (bilayered) structures and the isosbestic point located at 4.42 Å. Only careful analysis allowed the separation of both lines, the coexistence of which was related to the epitaxy/eutectic phenomenon, as evidenced by the simultaneous appearance of the 3L (trilayered) stackings at the same time of the second burst of the 2L stacking and the observation of the isosbestic point. The coexistence of β and β' forms even at high temperature demonstrates that the whole system is not in a two-phase domain but rather in a three-phase one (β + β' + liquid) in which all TAG molecules could not fit into a single β' structure. This is likely related with the granular phase separations observed in margarine. 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aequipment 3aheat treatment 3amargarine 3amelting 3amelting point 3apalm oils 3atemperature1 aKamarudin, Zukarinah1 aLesieur, Pierre1 aMarangoni, Alejandro1 aBourgaux, Claudie1 aOllivon, Michel0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2007 Apr., v. 109, no. 4 p.410-421dWiley-VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.200600249 7aarticle03119naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100002200192245011900214300001600333500002400349500001500373520103900388650002301427650001001450650001301460650002801473650002501501650002001526650002801546650001201574650001901586650001601605650003001621650001501651650002201666650001201688650006501700650005801765650002501823650000901848650002801857650001501885650006201900650002401962653002401986653002602010653002702036653001502063700002102078700002402099700002002123700002302143773011502166852000902281856008602290930003302376945002502409946001102434655001202445IND4422263620221118051125.0090623e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442226362DNAL7 a193288532pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL001 0aL6001 aKelleher, Erin S.10aProteomic analysis of Drosophila mojavensis male accessory glands suggests novel classes of seminal fluid proteins  ap. 366-371.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFruit-flies of the genus Drosophila are characterized by overwhelming variation in fertilization traits such as copulatory plug formation, sperm storage organ use, and nutritional ejaculatory donation. Despite extensive research on the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster, little is known about the molecular underpinnings of these interspecific differences. This study employs a proteomic approach to pin-point candidate seminal fluid proteins in Drosophila mojavensis, a cactophilic fruit-fly that exhibits divergent reproductive biology when compared to D. melanogaster. We identify several classes of candidate seminal fluid proteins not previously documented in the D. melanogaster male ejaculate, including metabolic enzymes, nutrient transport proteins, and clotting factors. Conversely, we also define 29 SFPs that are conserved despite >40 million years of Drosophila evolution. We discuss our results in terms of universal processes in insect reproduction, as well as the specialized reproductive biology of D. mojavensis. 3atransport proteins 3asemen 3aproteome 3ainterspecific variation 3aaccessory sex glands 3ainsect proteins 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aenzymes 3abioinformatics 3afruit flies 3ablood coagulation factors 3aproteomics 3amolecular biology 2aAnimals 2aDrosophilaxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProteomics 2aSeminal Plasma Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpecies Specificity 0aspecies differences 0aDrosophila mojavensis 0aseminal fluid proteins 0aDrosophila1 aWatts, Thomas D.1 aLaFlamme, Brooke A.1 aHaynes, Paul A.1 aMarkow, Therese A.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2009 , v. 39, no. 5-6 p.366-371dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.03.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/07/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02898naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002700175245016500202300001400367500002400381500001500405520132700420650001901747650002601766650001701792650002801809650003001837650001601867650001301883650003401896650001301930650001401943650002701957651001101984653001301995700001902008700002502027700002002052700001602072700001702088773010702105852000902212856008802221930003302309945002502342946001302367655001202380IND4422264220221118051000.0090623e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442226422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL200 0aL0011 aTsagkarakou, Anastasia10aMolecular diagnostics for detecting pyrethroid and organophosphate resistance mutations in the Q biotype of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)  ap. 49-54.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPyrethroid and organophosphate resistance-associated mutations have been recently reported in the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), a major pest of protected and outdoor crops worldwide. Here, we developed simple PCR-agarose gel visualization based assays for reliably monitoring the L925I and T929V pyrethroid resistance mutations in the B. tabaci para-type voltage gated sodium channel and the iAChE F331W organophosphate resistance mutation in the acetylcholinesterase enzyme ace1. PCR-RFLP assays were developed for detecting the L925I and the F331W resistance mutations. A highly specific PASA was developed for detecting the T929V mutation. The molecular diagnostic tools were used to monitor the frequency of the resistance mutations in a large number of field caught Q biotype B. tabaci from Crete (Greece), where both organophosphates and pyrethroids are extensively used. The F331W mutation was fixed in all field individuals examined. The pyrethroid resistance mutations were detected in high frequencies: 0.38 and 0.54 for L925I and T929V, respectively. The simple diagnostics are accurate and robust, to be used alongside classical bioassays to prevent ineffective insecticide applications, and for early identification of the spreading of resistant Q biotype populations into new regions around the globe. 3aBemisia tabaci 3adiagnostic techniques 3ainsect pests 3apyrethroid insecticides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aplant pests 3amutation 3aorganophosphorus insecticides 3abiotypes 3abioassays 3ainsecticide resistance 3aGreece 0agenotype1 aNikou, Dimitra1 aRoditakis, Emmanouil1 aSharvit, Michal1 aMorin, Shai1 aVontas, John0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2009 , v. 94, no. 2-3 p.49-54dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.03.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090625b20090703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/06/25  aOther US 7aarticle02537naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100002200193245012700215300001400342500002400356520098500380650002201365650001101387650001701398650001601415650002201431650001701453650002801470650002401498650002301522650001201545650002501557650001401582650001401596700002401610700002901634700002001663700002501683700002401708773010701732852000901839856008801848930003301936945002501969946001301994655001202007IND4422264720221118051112.0090623e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442226472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL810 0aL210 0aL001 0aL6001 aAdamski, Zbigniew10aEffects of sublethal concentrations of fenitrothion on beet armyworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) development and reproduction  ap. 73-78.  aIncludes references  aWe present data on the effects of various concentrations of the organophosphorus insecticide, fenitrothion, on development, reproduction and eggshell structure of Spodoptera exigua. The insecticide did not change the male/female ratio in tested populations. The pesticide-exposed larvae were significantly smaller than the controls and their pupation was delayed. These changes were not proportionally concentration-dependent. After imaginal molting experimental females laid significantly fewer eggs than controls. This effect was the same whether one or both members of a mating pair were exposed to fenitrothion during the larval stage. In the egg stage the insecticide caused serious malformations of the eggshell. The exposure caused other types of clearly abnormal development of eggs: two micropylar regions were noticed. Hence, even a low concentration of fenitrothion in the diet can lead to serious disturbances in reproduction and thus possibly at the population level. 3aSpodoptera exigua 3alarvae 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3asublethal effects 3afenitrothion 3areproductive toxicology 3ainsect reproduction 3ainsect development 3achorion 3aabnormal development 3amortality 3asex ratio1 aMachalska, Karolina1 aChorostkowska, Katarzyna1 aNiewadzi, Marta1 aZiemnicki, Kazimierz1 aHirsch, Helmut V.B.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2009 , v. 94, no. 2-3 p.73-78dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090625b20090703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/06/25  aOther US 7aarticle02917naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245010200127300001600229500012100245500002400366520164000390650002202030650001702052650001402069650001502083650001002098650001402108650002202122650001002144650001602154650001502170650001602185650001602201650001702217650002102234651002802255700002002283773012302303852000902426856007202435655001202507IND50085224820221118051142.0131115s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008522482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolter, A.10aEffect of drought stress on the productivity of ivy treated with Rhizobacterium Bacillus Subtilis  ap. 107-113.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Soilless Cultivation, held May 22 - May 25, 2012, Shanghai, China.  aIncludes references  aFor the purpose of year-round benefits the use of evergreens in façade greenery is very attractive. Living walls, soilless façade greenery systems, aroused market interest mainly during the last five years. The living walls usually work as hydroponics, with a luxury providing of water. But there are a few reasons to limit the provided amount of water. Unlimited water access for the plant causes worse tolerance to cases of irrigation damage. Technical or human failure often induces drought stress. Regions of cold continental climate e.g., Central Europe require high winter hardiness. For those reasons a tolerant individual of evergreen plant is needed. Ivy, although being a Mediterranean species, is the best known evergreen climbing plant with adequate frost hardiness. Therefore, in the absence of other suitable plant species, it should be the aim, to harden ivy plants by promoting the plants' own adaptation strategies, so that they can withstand abiotic stress. This work examines the degree to which Hedera helix 'Woerner' can be influenced with regard to drought tolerance; H. helix 'Woerner' is considered to show particularly more hardiness than other cultivars. Several researchers (Dipmka et al., 2009; Bochow et al., 2001) viewed bacterially mediated plant tolerance to abiotic stress in different crops. Based on Bochow’s experience on Bacillus subtilis, this inoculant shall be tested in various concentrations to prove the hypothesis that it has a significant positive effect on the drought tolerance of H. helix 'Woerner'. It is suggested that there are reliable positive effects especially on root growth. 3aBacillus subtilis 3aHedera helix 3aRhizobium 3acold zones 3acrops 3acultivars 3adrought tolerance 3afrost 3ahydroponics 3airrigation 3aresearchers 3aroot growth 3awater stress 3awinter hardiness 3aCentral European region1 aSchroeder, F.G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Aug., , no. 1004 p.107-113dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1004/1004_11.htm3electronic resource 7aarticle02554naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245016600130300001600296500012100312500002400433520131800457650001301775650001601788650001001804650001101814650002101825650002301846650001401869650000701883650001901890650001701909700001301926700001901939700001801958773012301976852000902099856007202108655001202180IND50085225320221118051110.0131115s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008522532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dairong10aInfluence of nutrient formula, concentration and PH on the growth of dracaena cambodiana hydrocultured in glass container and optimizing for nutrition supplement  ap. 143-150.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Soilless Cultivation, held May 22 - May 25, 2012, Shanghai, China.  aIncludes references  aTropical plants Dracaena cambodiana were hydrocultured in a glass container to evaluate the supplement of nutrients for plant growth in hydroculture during the production and ornament application periods. The experiments was arranged in an orthogonal design of 3 factors and 3 level treatments with Yamazaki nutrient solution for experiment, Hoagland’s solution and Knop’s solution in half, standard and 1.5 times strong standard concentration as well pH value 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5 respectively. Plant height, root length, leaf length, new leaf number and root activity were measured on the initial day and 90th day. The change of nutrient concentration has the strongest effect on plant growth, leaf photosynthesis rate and root activity of the plant hydrocultured in the solution with range analysis value 1.36 for plant height increment and 8.78 for root activity, followed by nutrient formula and pH. The solution of pH 5.5 was the best for new leaf number and plant height, but leaf grew vigorously with highest chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis as pH 6.5. Optimal combinations of the nutrition supplement for this plant hydro-culture in container are Yamazaki’s nutrient solution for experiment with standard concentration and pH 5.5-6.5 of solution based the integrated evaluation of the growth. 3aDracaena 3achlorophyll 3aglass 3aleaves 3anutrient content 3anutrient solutions 3anutrients 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth1 aLiu, Fei1 aLiao, Feixiong1 aLiu, Xiaorong0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Aug., , no. 1004 p.143-150dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1004/1004_16.htm3electronic resource 7aarticle02997naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001700184245019800201300001400399500002400413520161600437650002002053650001702073650001002090650002202100650001402122650002002136650002702156650001402183650001302197650002702210651002102237700001802258773010702276852000902383856008802392930003302480945002502513946001302538655001202551IND4422265020221118051010.0090623e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442226502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL200 0aL001 0aL6001 aGacar, Ferda10aPartial base sequence analysis of MdαE7 gene and ali-esterase enzyme activities in field collected populations of house fly (Musca domestica L.) from Mediterranean and Aegean Regions of Turkey  ap. 86-92.  aIncludes references  aIn housefly (Musca domestica L.) the product of αE7 gene, a member of the esterase cluster, probably plays a role in the detoxification of xenobiotic esters. In this study, the housefly samples were collected from farms and garbage disposal sites of 16 provinces in the Aegean and Mediterranean Regions of Turkey. After isolating the genomic DNA, MdαE7 gene was amplified, isolated and sequenced, from the beginning of exon 3 to the middle of exon 4. In addition to this, ali-esterase enzyme activities in these samples were assayed by using methylthiobutyrate as a substrate. In the Aegean Region, among the studied samples 46.8% of them have Gly137-Ser251 combinations, diagnostic for malathion resistance, 21.8% of them have Asp137-Trp251 combinations, characteristic diazinon resistance and 3.1% of them OP susceptible Gly137-Trp251 combinations. In the Mediterranean Region, 59.3% of the samples have the specific diazinon resistance, 15.6% of them have the diagnostic malathion resistance, and 12.5% of them have the diagnostic sensitive combinations. A high level of the ali-esterase enzyme activity (142.7 ± 4.3 nmol/min/mg) was detected for WHO strain. However, the enzyme activities for the other samples, having the malathion and diazinon resistance phenotypes, differed between the range of 31.4 ± 3.5 nmol/min/mg to 136.8 ± 36.8 nmol/min/mg. Our results indicate that the differences in frequency and distribution of the alleles in these two regions might be depending on the different insecticide usage strategies. The pest management strategies for these two regions must be evaluated again. 3aMusca domestica 3ainsect pests 3agenes 3asequence analysis 3aesterases 3aenzyme activity 3ainsecticide resistance 3amalathion 3adiazinon 3ageographical variation 3aTurkey (country)1 aTaskin, Vatan0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2009 , v. 94, no. 2-3 p.86-92dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.04.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090625b20090703c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/06/25  aOther US 7aarticle02491naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001300112245011200125300001600237500012100253500002400374520121700398650002001615650001201635650002001647650001401667650002301681650000901704650001101713650001401724650001701738650001401755650001001769650001401779650002001793650001001813700001401823700001601837700001201853773012301865852000901988856007201997655001202069IND50085225820221118051029.0131115s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008522582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, H.10aEffects of iso-osmotic Ca(No3)2 and NaCl stress on ionic contents in different organs of cucumber seedlings  ap. 181-188.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Soilless Cultivation, held May 22 - May 25, 2012, Shanghai, China.  aIncludes references  aA hydroponic experiment was applied to investigate the effects of iso-osmotic Ca(NO3)2 and NaCl stresses on content and distribution of mineral in cucumber seedlings (Cucumis sativus L. 'Jinchun No.2'). The results showed that under NaCl stress (84 mmol/L) K+ and Mg2+ contents decreased significantly while Na+ content increased significantly in roots, stems and leaves, the Ca2+ content decreased in leaves while accumulated substantially in roots and stems. But under Ca(NO3)2 (56 mmol/L) stress, Ca2+ content increased while K+ and Mg2+ contents decreased in the roots, stems and leaves, and the decreased degree of Mg2+ content was greater than that of K+ content. In terms of trace elements, NaCl stress aggravated the accumulation of Fe2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ in roots, while inhibited the absorption of Mn2+ in roots; Ca(NO3)2 stress promoted the accumulation of Mn2+ and Zn2+ in roots but inhibited Cu2+ absorption. These results suggested that plant growth was inhibited by NaCl stress through increasing the Na+ content and decreasing the K+, Ca2+ contents of leaves, while isotonic Ca(NO3)2 stress inhibited plant growth mainly through increasing the Ca2+ content and decreasing the Mg2+ content of leaves. 3aCucumis sativus 3acalcium 3acalcium nitrate 3acucumbers 3agrowth retardation 3airon 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3astems1 aGuo, S.R.1 aZhang, Z.X.1 aSun, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Aug., , no. 1004 p.181-188dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1004/1004_21.htm3electronic resource 7aarticle03125naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100001600192245008400208300001600292500002400308500001500332520114200347650001801489650001601507650001401523650001101537650001001548650002601558650002301584650002001607650002001627650001601647650001301663650001701676650001201693650002201705650001601727650001201743650002101755650003301776650001101809650001601820650003001836650003001866650000901896650004401905650002401949650003001973653002402003653002302027700001702050700001402067700001802081700001602099700002102115773011502136852000902251856008602260930003302346945002502379946001102404655001202415IND4422262520221118050922.0090623e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442226252DNAL7 a191504062pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL003 0aL6001 aZha, Xingfu10aDosage analysis of Z chromosome genes using microarray in silkworm, Bombyx mori  ap. 315-321.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn many organisms, dosage compensation is needed to equalize sex-chromosome gene expression in males and females. Several genes on silkworm Z chromosome were previously detected to show a higher expression level in males and lacked dosage compensation. Whether silkworm lacks global dosage compensation still remains poorly known. Here, we analyzed male:female (M:F) ratios of expression of chromosome-wide Z-linked genes in the silkworm using microarray data. The expression levels of genes on Z chromosome in each tissue were significantly higher in males compared to females, which indicates no global dosage compensation in silkworm. Interestingly, we also found some genes with no bias (M:F ratio: 0.8-1.2) on the Z chromosome. Comparison of male-biased (M:F ratio more than 1.5) and unbiased genes indicated that the two sets of the genes have functional differences. Analysis of gene expression by sex showed that M:F ratios were, to some extent, associated with their expression levels. These results provide useful clues to further understanding roles of dosage of Z chromosome and some Z-linked sexual differences in silkworms. 3amessenger RNA 3asex linkage 3asilkworms 3agenome 3amales 3amicroarray technology 3agender differences 3ainsect genetics 3agene expression 3aBombyx mori 3agenomics 3aZ chromosome 3afemales 3asexual dimorphism 3agene dosage 2aAnimals 2aBombyxxgenetics 2aDosage Compensation, Genetic 2aFemale 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aInsect Proteinsxgenetics 2aMale 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aSex Characteristics 2aSex Chromosomesxgenetics 0adosage compensation 0amolecular genetics1 aXia, Qingyou1 aDuan, Jun1 aWang, Chunyun1 aHe, Ningjia1 aXiang, Zhonghuai0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2009 , v. 39, no. 5-6 p.315-321dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.12.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/07/21  aNon-US 7aarticle01263naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010400124300001800228520042300246650002100669650002300690650002300713650002100736650002400757650001300781700001800794773008300812852000900895930003300904945001300937946001100950655001200961IND2196738820221118051202.0990129e19980813enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219673882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehta, S.10aBeneficial participation of the polymer: improvement in polymer-supported oligosaccharide synthesis  ap. 5907-5910.  aThe reagent combination scandium(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate and acetic anhydride efficiently cleaves oligosaccharides bound to the polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer-support via the dioxyxylene (DOX) linker.

In many insects and mites, life span is shorter for multiple-mated females than for single-mated females, and is shorter under poor prey conditions than under ample prey conditions. We previously showed that the postoviposition period of multiple-mated females was 40% shorter than that of single-mated females, but that it was never shorter than 30 days. Here we focused on the effect of prey abundance on the postoviposition period. We examined three groups of multiple-mated females: mites that were fed ample prey (group I), mites that were subjected to repeated cycles of 2 days of fasting followed by 2 days of ample prey (group II), and mites that were subjected to repeated cycles of 4 days of fasting followed by 2 days of ample prey (group III). The postoviposition periods of groups II and III were 90% shorter than that of group I. Also the total adult longevity was significantly shorter in groups II and III than in group I. Total egg production in group III was about half that in groups I and II, although the oviposition periods in groups II and III were significantly longer than that in group I. These results suggest that the prolonged postoviposition period in single-mated females of the Spical strain may only appear under laboratory conditions, without multiple mating or starvation. 3aNeoseiulus californicus 3aadults 3aegg production 3afasting 3afemales 3afoods 3ainsects 3alongevity 3amites 3aoviposition 3astarvation 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aLongevityxphysiology 2aMale 2aMitesxphysiology 2aOviposition 2aTime Factors1 aTsuchiya, Akiko0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2009 Mar., v. 47, no. 3 p.249-256dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-008-9215-1 7aarticle02830naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245015400169300001600323500002400339520159200363650001001955650001201965650001801977650002301995650001402018650002202032650002702054650001902081650001202100650002702112650001802139650000902157650002702166700002102193700002302214700002902237773009702266852000902363856004802372655001202420IND4432519920221118045656.0100205e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443251992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-009-0245-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, Robert Andrew10aCharacterisation and inheritance of nuclear microsatellite loci for use in population studies of the allotetraploid Salix alba-Salix fragilis complex  ap. 247-258.  aIncludes references  aWe present nine polymorphic di- and tri-nucleotide repeat nuclear microsatellite markers selected specifically for their use in high throughput studies concerning the dioecious allotetraploid Salix alba-Salix fragilis willow complex. These taxa and their hybrids are difficult to discriminate using morphological characters. Thus, multiplex reactions were developed for these microsatellite loci and their effectiveness to distinguish individuals, especially hybrids, and their inheritance patterns in controlled crosses were determined. All loci displayed disomic-monogenic inheritance which allowed for the genotype data to be analysed as for a diploid organism. The nine loci produced a total of 67 alleles (mean, 7.4 alleles per locus; range, 3-11 alleles) in a reference panel of 57 individuals from two germplasm collections and natural populations. Gene diversity values (as measured by the expected heterozygosity) ranged from 0.000-0.820. A total of 53 distinct multilocus genotypes were observed, and ordination analysis revealed three separate clusters corresponding to S. alba, S. fragilis and hybrids. The microsatellite loci described here will be used in population genetic studies to investigate genetic variation, gene flow, levels of hybridisation and the extent of introgression in natural populations of the S. alba-S. fragilis complex. They are also useful for clonal identification, conservation and sustainable management of germplasm collections, genetic mapping and the selection of individuals and/or certification of controlled crosses for breeding programmes. 3aSalix 3aalleles 3acertification 3achromosome mapping 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm conservation 3aheterozygosity 3ahybrids 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats1 aHarris, Sarah L.1 aKarp, A.q(Angela)1 aBarker, Jacqueline H.

The independent variables were salinity, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and nitrite nitrogen (NO₂-N). The TAN experiments were conducted at 18 and 10 ppt salinity, and the NO₂-N test was conducted at 10 ppt salinity. Combined TAN and NO₂ tests were also conducted at 10 ppt salinity. The 48-h lethal concentration (LC₅₀) values for TAN at 18 ppt salinity, TAN at 10 ppt salinity, and NO₂-N at 10 ppt were observed to be 42.92, 39.72 (2.26 and 2.09 mg/L unionized ammonia-N), and 153.75 mg/L, respectively. When NO₂-N was adjusted to the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) level and TAN concentrations were varied, synergistic effects were observed, with a 48-h LC₅₀ calculated to be 28.2 mg/L TAN (1.49 mg/L unionized ammonia-N). However, when the ammonia level was adjusted to the LOEC and nitrite was varied, antagonistic effects were observed with a 48-h LC₅₀ calculated to be 163.3 mg/L NO₂-N. This study demonstrated that the combined toxic effects of ammonia and nitrite need to be considered when developing standard operating procedures for shrimp culture. 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aacute toxicity 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3apH 3asalinity 3ashrimp culture 3astandard operating procedures1 aBoardman, GregoryD.1 aKuhn, DavidD.1 aFlick, GeorgeJ.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2010 June, v. 41, no. 3 p.438-446dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2010.00385.x 7aarticle02653naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002800135245012400163300001600287500002400303520149400327650002201821650001301843650001601856650003901872650001101911650001301922650001501935650000901950650001201959650001201971650001601983700001601999700002102015700001702036700002602053700002402079773009302103852000902196856003802205655001202243IND4441164920221118045412.0100813s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444116492DNAL7 a10.1071/CP101312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberhard, Friederike S.10aChromosome composition of an F₂ Triticum aestivum × T. turgidum spp. durum cross analysed by DArT markers and MCFISH  ap. 619-624.  aIncludes references  aThis study has employed multicolour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (MCFISH) and Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers to determine the segregation of parental A, B and D genome material into the progeny of a cross between a hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var. 2-49) and a tetraploid durum wheat [T. turgidum L. spp. durum (Desf.) var. Bellaroi]. In the F₂ progeny from a 2-49/Bellaroi cross, 82 out of 83 F₂ plants investigated with DArT analysis carried some D genome material, principally as entire chromosomes, while 40 plants included at least one complete copy of all seven D genome chromosomes. Twelve plants containing partial D chromosomes were identified. MCFISH analysis of 26 additional F₂ plants of the same cross showed that all 26 plants contained varying amounts of D genome material of which three carried single A-D translocations. In addition two telocentric D genome chromosomes were detected. The D genome content of each line and the breakpoint positions of the three A-D translocations were confirmed with DArT marker analysis. Overall results indicate a random recombination of A and B genome loci from the hexaploid female parent and the tetraploid male parent in this F₂ population and a significant retention of the maternal D genome material. This study illustrates that the combined application of the MCFISH and DArT techniques provides a powerful approach for the analysis of crosses between cereal genotypes of different ploidy. 3aTriticum aestivum 3acrossing 3adurum wheat 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenome 3agenotype 3ahexaploidy 3aloci 3aparents 3aprogeny 3atetraploidy1 aZhang, Peng1 aLehmensiek, Anke1 aHare, Ray A.1 aSimpfendorfer, Steven1 aSutherland, Mark W.0 tCrop & pasture science.g2010, v. 61, no. 8 p.619-624dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP10131 7aarticle02205naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245007800210300001600288506007600304520087300380506003701253650002601290650001201316650001601328650001801344650002001362650001201382650001001394650001401404650001901418650001401437650001601451700001801467700002301485773011801508852000901626856009201635930003301727946001101760655001201771IND4407213520221207114833.0080627e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440721352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2008.04.0052doi7 aPMC25565522pmcid7 a184900662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEksi, Saliha10aSex- and stage-specific reporter gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum  ap. 148-151.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFor malaria transmission, Plasmodium parasites must successfully complete gametocytogenesis in the vertebrate host. Differentiation into mature male or female Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes takes 9-12 days as the parasites pass through five distinct morphologic stages (I-V). To evaluate the signals controlling the initiation of stage- and/or sex-specific expression, reporter constructs containing the 5'-flanking regions (FR) of seven genes with distinct expression patterns through gametogenesis were developed. The regulatory information present in the 5'-FR of each selected gene was found to be sufficient to drive appropriate sex- and stage-specific reporter gene expression. The transformed parasite lines also provide in vivo markers to identify gametocytes at specific stages, including a subpopulation of schizonts that express early gametocyte markers.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3afemales 3agametocytes 3agametogenesis 3agene expression 3amalaria 3amales 3aparasites 3areporter genes 3aschizonts 3avertebrates1 aSuri, Amreena1 aWilliamson, Kim C.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2008 Aug., v. 160, no. 2 p.148-151dAmsterdam: Elsevierx0166-68517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2008.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080627b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02506naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001300154245013000167300001600297500011000313520128900423650001101712650001501723650001401738650001401752650001801766650001601784650001701800650000901817650001701826650002101843650001701864650002501881700001701906773014501923856005502068852000902123655001202132IND60566710320221118045515.0170412e20160825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056671032DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1139.972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdak, N.10aEffects of different growing systems and cultivars on plant growth, fruit quality and yield of strawberry in soilless culture  ap. 565-570.  aPaper presented at the III Balkan Symposium on Fruit Growing held September 16-18, 2015, Belgrade, Serbia  aIn Turkey, along with the conventional method of strawberry production, soilless culture is also in practice intensively, especially along the Mediterranean coastal area. Short day cultivars are grown in soilless culture not only for early harvesting and obtaining higher productivity inside greenhouses, but also number of plants per unit area is increased by using different growing systems. In this research, effect of soilless production systems under different types of greenhouses on plant growth, yield and fruit quality were evaluated. Three cultivars of strawberry 'Camarosa', 'Candonga', and 'Rubygem' were grown with three different systems: conventional soilless system in plastic high tunnel (CSS), single shelf system (SSS) and double shelf systems (DSS) in modern construction greenhouses. Coco peat was used as a substrate in horizontal bag cultures. Results revealed that, modern greenhouse applications were advantageous with respect to the first flowering and harvest dates, but yield plant-1 did not differ significantly among the treatments. There were differences between the treatments for fruit quality traits (fruit weight and soluble solids). 'Rubygem' was found superior with respect to soluble solids content, whereas 'Candonga' had the largest fruit size. 3acoasts 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3agreenhouses 3aharvest date 3apeat 3aplant growth 3asoilless culture 3astrawberries 3atotal soluble solids1 aGozlekci, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Aug. 25, , no. 1139 p.565-570dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1139.97  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001600158245015800174300001600332500002400348500001500372520199600387650001502383650002102398650002602419650002302445650002302468650001602491650001602507650001502523650002202538650001602560653001902576653002702595653001202622653002202634653002902656700002502685700002002710700001502730700001802745773009402763852000902857856008902866930003302955945002502988946001103013655001203024IND4383723220221118045714.0060918e20060430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438372322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.07.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aVerhoef, A.14aThe diurnal course of soil moisture as measured by various dielectric sensors: Effects of soil temperature and the implications for evaporation estimates  ap. 147-162.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSoil moisture content, θ, of a bare and vegetated UK gravelly sandy loam soil (in situ and repacked in small lysimeters) was measured using various dielectric instruments (single-sensor ThetaProbes, multi-sensor Profile Probes, and Aquaflex Sensors), at depths ranging between 0.03 and 1 m, during the summers of 2001 (in situ soil) and 2002 (mini-lysimeters). Half-hourly values of evaporation, E, were calculated from diurnal changes in total soil profile water content, using the soil water balance equation. For the bare soil field, Profile Probes and ML2x ThetaProbes indicated a diurnal course of θ that did not concur with typical soil physical observations: surface layer soil moisture content increased from early morning until about midday, after which θ declined, generally until the early evening. The unexpected course of θ was positively correlated to soil temperature, Ts, also at deeper depths. Aquaflex and ML1 ThetaProbe (older models) outputs, however, reflected common observations: θ increased slightly during the night (capillary rise) and decreased from the morning until late afternoon (as a result of evaporation). For the vegetated plot, the spurious diurnal θ fluctuations were less obvious, because canopy shading resulted in lower amplitudes of Ts. The unrealistic θ profiles measured for the bare and vegetated field sites caused diurnal estimates of E to attain downward daytime and upward night-time values. In the mini-lysimeters, at medium to high moisture contents, θ values measured by (ML2x) ThetaProbes followed a relatively realistic course, and predictions of E from diurnal changes in vertically integrated θ generally compared well with lysimeter estimates of E. However, time courses of θ and E became comparable to those observed for the field plots when the soil in the lysimeters reached relatively low values of θ. Attempts to correct measured θ for fluctuations in Ts revealed that no generally applicable formula could be derived. 3aestimation 3asoil temperature 3adielectric properties 3asoil water content 3acapacitance probes 3acapacitance 3aevaporation 3asoil water 3adiurnal variation 3ameasurement 0asurface layers 0adielectric instruments 0asensors 0adielectric probes 0asoil dielectric constant1 aFernandez-Galvez, J.1 aDiaz-Espejo, A.1 aMain, B.E.1 aEl-Bishti, M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 Apr. 30, v. 321, no. 1-4 p.147-162dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.07.0393Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02941naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001800167245009900185300001600284500002400300500001500324520142600339650002201765650001701787650002001804650001801824650002101842650002201863650002201885650001701907650001901924650001601943650002001959650002201979651001102001653002502012653002402037653002602061653002602087653002902113700002002142773009402162852000902256856008902265930003302354945002502387946001102412655001202423IND4383724020221118045548.0060918e20060430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438372402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aFairley, J.P.10aImaging lateral groundwater flow in the shallow subsurface using stochastic temperature fields  ap. 276-285.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAlthough temperature has often been used as an indication of vertical groundwater movement, its usefulness for identifying horizontal fluid flow has been limited by the difficulty of obtaining sufficient data to draw defensible conclusions. Here we use stochastic simulation to develop a high-resolution image of fluid temperatures in the shallow subsurface at Borax Lake, Oregon. The temperature field inferred from the geostatistical simulations clearly shows geothermal fluids discharging from a group of fault-controlled hydrothermal springs, moving laterally through the subsurface, and mixing with shallow subsurface flow originating from nearby Borax Lake. This interpretation of the data is supported by independent geochemical and isotopic evidence, which show a simple mixing trend between Borax Lake water and discharge from the thermal springs. It is generally agreed that stochastic simulation can be a useful tool for extracting information from complex and/or noisy data and, although not appropriate in all situations, geostatistical analysis may provide good definition of flow paths in the shallow subsurface. Although stochastic imaging techniques are well known in problems involving transport of species, e.g. delineation of contaminant plumes from soil gas survey data, we are unaware of previous applications to the transport of thermal energy for the purpose of inferring shallow groundwater flow. 3asimulation models 3ageochemistry 3asprings (water) 3ageostatistics 3agroundwater flow 3awater temperature 3aspatial variation 3ahydrogeology 3ahydrochemistry 3agroundwater 3asubsurface flow 3ahydrologic models 3aOregon 0ahydrothermal springs 0amathematical models 0ahorizontal fluid flow 0astochastic simulation 0alateral groundwater flow1 aNicholson, K.N.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 Apr. 30, v. 321, no. 1-4 p.276-285dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.08.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03221naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001500158245013800173300001600311500002400327500001500351520182600366650002202192650002302214650002902237650002302266650002602289650001202315650001902327650002202346650001502368651001002383653001902393653001602412653003002428653002402458700002002482773009402502852000902596856008902605930003302694945002502727946001102752655001202763IND4383724320221118045608.0060918e20060430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438372432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aD'Urso, G.12aA semi-empirical approach for surface soil water content estimation from radar data without a-priori information on surface roughness  ap. 297-310.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, the spatial distribution of soil water content in an agricultural area of 30 km2 in Southern Italy has been estimated by using high-resolution space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar data. Multi-polarised SAR images acquired during the SIR-C mission in April 1994 have been analysed by using the semi-empirical surface backscattering model derived by Oh, Y., Sarabandi K., Ulaby F.T., 1992. An empirical model and an inversion technique for radar scattering from bare soil surface. IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sensing, 30(2), 370381. A site-specific calibration procedure of the cited model has been proposed to derive soil dielectric constant values without a-priori information on the surface roughness by using ground measurements on a regular grid in two bare-soil fields. The calibrated model applied to L-band data reproduced quite satisfactorily the spatial variability of the soil dielectric constant in the two fields. Diversely, C-band data gave poor results. Successively, the calibrated Oh's model was applied to estimate the soil dielectric constant in bare soil and low vegetation fields of the entire irrigation district, where the output of a distributed simulation model of soil water balance were available. From the comparison between the Oh's backscattering model and the soil water balance model, it was confirmed that, under bare soil conditions, the values of soil water content near the soil surface estimated from SIR-C L-band data differ by ±20% from the simulated ones. Furthermore, as expected, the presence of a fractional vegetation cover, even if small, reduced the sensitivity of radar backscattering to soil moisture. The results of this study confirmed that L-band SAR data represent a minimum requirement for possible assimilation schemes in regional hydrological modelling. 3asurface roughness 3aagricultural soils 3asynthetic aperture radar 3asoil water content 3adielectric properties 3atopsoil 3aremote sensing 3aspatial variation 3avegetation 3aItaly 0asurface layers 0aL-band data 0aradar backscattering data 0adielectric constant1 aMinacapilli, M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 Apr. 30, v. 321, no. 1-4 p.297-310dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.08.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20070821b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02612naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001600176245006300192300001600255500002400271520139200295650001501687650000901702650001401711650002901725650002101754650001901775650001201794650001801806650001501824650002301839651001201862700001501874700001601889773009401905852000901999856008902008930003302097945002502130946001102155655001202166IND4383724420221118045706.0060918e20060430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438372442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aP200 0aM5001 aWorrall, F.14aThe rate of and controls upon DOC loss in a peat catchment  ap. 311-325.  aIncludes references  aThis study uses detailed monitoring of a peat catchment to estimate the amount of DOC loss within a stream. The study compares DOC concentrations and specific absorbances (absorbance at 400 nm per concentration of DOC) of shallow and deep soil waters with those at the catchment outlet. The mass balance between source and outlet is assessed by two methods: a simple method based upon a conservative tracer, and one based upon a principal component analysis using multiple tracers. The single tracer method suggests an average removal of 20% while the principal component approach suggests 32% removal. The rate of removal varies between 0.03 and 23 mg C/day. On an annual basis the removal amounts to between 45.8 and 85 ton C/year, equivalent to an areal loss of between 4 and 7.4 g C/m2/year. The change in specific absorbance, at 400 nm, shows that the DOC is sourced from shallow soil water (10 cm) and not from the deep soil water (50 cm). There is consistent increase in specific absorbance through the catchment. The rate of removal is zero-order with respect to DOC concentration but shows significant decrease with increasing specific absorbance and stream residence time. The study shows that by accounting for the loss of DOC within the streams of the catchment, the catchment is close to balance with respect to carbon and is a smaller carbon sink than previously estimated. 3awatersheds 3apeat 3apeatlands 3adissolved organic carbon 3alosses from soil 3ahydrochemistry 3astreams 3asurface water 3asoil water 3aseasonal variation 3aEngland1 aBurt, T.P.1 aAdamson, J.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 Apr. 30, v. 321, no. 1-4 p.311-325dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.08.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/20  aNon-US 7aarticle04631naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163072000900181100001700190245017500207300001800382500002400400500001500424506007600439520174900515506003702264650000902301650003202310650001702342650003302359650001802392650002202410650003702432650001002469650002002479650002302499650002102522650002802543650002302571650002402594650003302618650001802651650002902669650003102698650002102729650002102750650002802771650002102799650001302820650002402833650001102857650002502868650001402893650001402907650003302921650003402954650002602988650002403014650004203038653001403080653001403094653001403108653001603122653002803138653002503166653001403191700002003205700001603225700001603241700001603257700001803273700002003291700002403311700001903335773013403354852000903488856008003497856006903577930003303646945002503679946001303704655001203717IND4383702120221207124818.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438370212DNAL7 a169572482pmid7 aPMC15636212pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00511-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8321 aZou, Li-fang10aElucidation of the hrp Clusters of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola That Control the Hypersensitive Response in Nonhost Tobacco and Pathogenicity in Susceptible Host Rice  ap. 6212-6224.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola, the cause of bacterial leaf streak in rice, possesses clusters of hrp genes that determine its ability to elicit a hypersensitive response (HR) in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in host rice. A 27-kb region of the genome of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (RS105) was identified and sequenced, revealing 10 hrp, 9 hrc (hrp conserved), and 8 hpa (hrp-associated) genes and 7 regulatory plant-inducible promoter boxes. While the region from hpa2 to hpaB and the hrpF operon resembled the corresponding genes of other xanthomonads, the hpaB-hrpF region incorporated an hrpE3 gene that was not present in X. oryzae pv. oryzae. We found that an hrpF mutant had lost the ability to elicit the HR in tobacco and pathogenicity in adult rice plants but still caused water-soaking symptoms in rice seedlings and that Hpa1 is an HR elicitor in nonhost tobacco whose expression is controlled by an hrp regulator, HrpX. Using an Hrp phenotype complementation test, we identified a small hrp cluster containing the hrpG and hrpX regulatory genes, which is separated from the core hrp cluster. In addition, we identified a gene, prhA (plant-regulated hrp), that played a key role in the Hrp phenotype of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola but was neither in the core hrp cluster nor in the hrp regulatory cluster. A prhA mutant failed to reduce the HR in tobacco and pathogenicity in rice but caused water-soaking symptoms in rice. This is the first report that X. oryzae pv. oryzicola possesses three separate DNA regions for HR induction in nonhost tobacco and pathogenicity in host rice, which will provide a fundamental base to understand pathogenicity determinants of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola compared with those of X. oryzae pv. oryzae.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arice 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aOryza sativa 3abacterial diseases of plants 3apathogenicity 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola 3agenes 3afoliar diseases 3adisease resistance 3apromoter regions 3ahypersensitive response 3adefense mechanisms 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenes, Regulator 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aMutation 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aOperon 2aOryzaxmicrobiology. 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobaccoxmicrobiology 2aVirulencexgenetics 2aXanthomonasxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 0ahrpX gene 0ahrp genes 0ahrpG gene 0aleaf streak 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0aprhA gene1 aWang, Xing-ping1 aXiang, Yong1 aZhang, Bing1 aLi, Yu-Rong1 aXiao, You-lun1 aWang, Jin-sheng1 aWalmsley, Adrian R.1 aChen, Gong-you0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.6212-6224dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00511-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20061107b20061202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle04581naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163072000900181100002000190245015000210300001800360500002400378500001500402506007600417520163700493506003702130650001202167650001802179650003002197650002402227650002602251650002402277650001902301650001502320650001302335650001002348650002502358650001402383650002202397650002402419650001302443650006202456650003402518650001702552650001202569650002302581650001402604650001702618650002102635650002802656650005302684650002402737650001402761650002902775650003402804650002202838650004502860650002402905653001602929653001402945653005502959653002803014653002203042700002203064700002503086700001903111700002103130700002203151700002003173700002403193700002203217700002303239700001903262700002303281773013403304852000903438856008003447856006903527930003303596945002503629946001303654655001203667IND4383702920221207124935.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438370292DNAL7 a169572562pmid7 aPMC15636072pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00246-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aBrodie, Eoin L.10aApplication of a High-Density Oligonucleotide Microarray Approach To Study Bacterial Population Dynamics during Uranium Reduction and Reoxidation  ap. 6288-6298.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReduction of soluble uranium U(VI) to less-soluble uranium U(IV) is a promising approach to minimize migration from contaminated aquifers. It is generally assumed that, under constant reducing conditions, U(IV) is stable and immobile; however, in a previous study, we documented reoxidation of U(IV) under continuous reducing conditions (Wan et al., Environ. Sci. Technol. 2005, 39:6162-6169). To determine if changes in microbial community composition were a factor in U(IV) reoxidation, we employed a high-density phylogenetic DNA microarray (16S microarray) containing 500,000 probes to monitor changes in bacterial populations during this remediation process. Comparison of the 16S microarray with clone libraries demonstrated successful detection and classification of most clone groups. Analysis of the most dynamic groups of 16S rRNA gene amplicons detected by the 16S microarray identified five clusters of bacterial subfamilies responding in a similar manner. This approach demonstrated that amplicons of known metal-reducing bacteria such as Geothrix fermentans (confirmed by quantitative PCR) and those within the Geobacteraceae were abundant during U(VI) reduction and did not decline during the U(IV) reoxidation phase. Significantly, it appears that the observed reoxidation of uranium under reducing conditions occurred despite elevated microbial activity and the consistent presence of metal-reducing bacteria. High-density phylogenetic microarrays constitute a powerful tool, enabling the detection and monitoring of a substantial portion of the microbial population in a routine, accurate, and reproducible manner.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3auranium 3aribosomal RNA 3agroundwater contamination 3acommunity structure 3amicroarray technology 3aGeothrix fermentans 3abioremediation 3aDNA probes 3aaquifers 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxidation 3aDesulfuromonaceae 3apopulation dynamics 3abacteria 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiodiversity 2aBiomass 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEcosystem 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysisxmethods 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutants, Radioactivexmetabolism 2aUraniumxmetabolism 0areoxidation 0areduction 0ahigh-density oligonucleotide microarray technology 0amolecular sequence data 0acommunity ecology1 aDeSantis, Todd Z.1 aJoyner, Dominique C.1 aBaek, Seung M.1 aLarsen, Joern T.1 aAndersen, Gary L.1 aHazen, Terry C.1 aRichardson, Paul M.1 aHerman, Donald J.1 aTokunaga, Tetsu K.1 aWan, Jiamin M.1 aFirestone, Mary K.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.6288-6298dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00246-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20061107b20061202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle02888naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163072000900181072000900190100001800199245019600217300001800413500002400431506007600455520047000531506003701001650002401038650002501062650001901087650002201106650002801128650002301156650001401179650003201193650002801225650002301253650001901276650003401295650001201329650004101341650003701382650001901419650005101438650002501489650002401514650007501538650009201613653002501705653001801730700001901748700002001767700002301787700002201810700001901832773013401851852000901985856008001994856006902074930003302143945002502176946001302201655001202214IND4383704920221207102049.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438370492DNAL7 a169572762pmid7 aPMC15636372pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00753-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aM0011 aDefoirdt, Tom10aQuorum Sensing-Disrupting Brominated Furanones Protect the Gnotobiotic Brine Shrimp Artemia franciscana from Pathogenic Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio campbellii, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus Isolates  ap. 6419-6423.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAutoinducer 2 (AI-2) quorum sensing was shown before to regulate the virulence of Vibrio harveyi towards the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana.

In this study, we have tested four solid media (Herrold's egg yolk medium [HEYM] with sodium pyruvate and mycobactin [HEYMm-SP], HEYM with mycobactin and without sodium pyruvate [HEYMm], Middlebrook 7H11 with mycobactin [Mm], and Löwenstein-Jensen with mycobactin [LJm]) for isolation of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains in 319 tissue samples from cattle herds and goat flocks. We have shown that each of the two main groups of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (type II and type I/III) has different requirements for growth in the culture media studied. The recommended solid media for isolation of type I/III strains are LJm and Mm, since the combination of both media allowed the recovery of all these strains. The most widespread culture medium, HEYM, is not suitable for the isolation of this group of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains. Regarding the type II strains, HEYMm-SP was the medium where more strains were isolated, but the other three media are also needed in order to recover all type II strains. The incubation period is also related to the strain type. In conclusion, because the type of strain cannot be known in advance of culture, coupled with the fact that cattle and goats can be infected with both groups of strains, we recommend the use of the four solid media and the prolongation of the incubation period to more than 6 months to detect paratuberculous herds/flocks and to determine the true prevalence of the infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adisease detection 3acell culture 3acattle 3agoats 3astrain differences 3aculture media 3aparatuberculosis 3apathogen identification 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aBacteriological Techniques 2aCattlexmicrobiology 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aCulture Media 2aGoat Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aGoatsxmicrobiology 2aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aParatuberculosisxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpecies Specificity 0astrains 0aisolation1 aAlvarez, Julio.1 aRomero, Beatriz1 aBezos, Javier1 aCastellanos, Elena1 aAranaz, Alicia1 aMateos, Ana1 aDomínguez, Lucas0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.5927-5932dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00451-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3electronic resource  a20061103b20061202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle03083naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100002000147245006500167300001800232500002400250520144900274650001501723650002601738650002001764650002201784650002301806650001801829650002101847650001201868650003401880650002701914650001301941650001601954650001101970650001501981650001401996650002602010650000902036650003902045650004602084650001902130650002002149650001302169650001402182650002402196651001202220700001502232700002002247700001302267773012102280852000902401930003302410945002502443946001302468655001202481IND4383675820221118045712.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438367582DNAL7 a169600852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL8321 aSørensen, A.C.10aUdder Health Shows Inbreeding Depression in Danish Holsteins  ap. 4077-4082.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this study was to estimate inbreeding depression for udder health using records on mastitis incidence and somatic cell count (SCC). Data were selected based on a pedigree completeness index so that inbreeding coefficients were reliable. Average inbreeding was 3.3%. The presence or absence of mastitis was considered in first (CM1), second (CM2), and third (CM3) lactations, and was recorded as a binary trait. Somatic cell count was also included and analyzed on the log scale. A minimum of 140,000 cows with records were included per trait. Linear sire models were used and (co)variance components were estimated. Linear and curvilinear effects of the coefficient of inbreeding were included. Inbreeding significantly affected all traits investigated. Three traits, CM1, CM3, and SCC, showed a nonlinear relationship between phenotype and inbreeding coefficient. A cow with 5% inbreeding compared with a cow with 2% inbreeding had a higher SCC and a higher incidence of mastitis. The SCC increased by 1,500 cells/mL in first lactation and the incidence of mastitis increased by 1.08, 0.55, and 0.98% in first, second, and third lactation, respectively. The corresponding reduction in net return from these traits over 3 lactations amounted to US$11.00 under Danish production circumstances. These results are a step on the way to estimating the total cost of inbreeding depression to determine an acceptable rate of inbreeding. 3adairy cows 3ainbreeding depression 3abovine mastitis 3adisease incidence 3asomatic cell count 3alinear models 3alactation number 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aDairying 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aInbreeding 2aIncidence 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMale 2aMammary Glands, Animalxphysiology 2aMastitis, Bovinexepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aMilkxcytology 2aModels, Genetic 2aPedigree 2aPhenotype 2aRegression Analysis 3aDenmark1 aMadsen, P.1 aSørensen, M.K.1 aBerg, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Oct., v. 89, no. 10 p.4077-4082dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/10/11  aOther US 7aarticle02898naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001700147245014100164300001800305500002400323520147100347650001501818650001401833650002001847650002601867650002301893650001201916650003401928650001301962650001101975650002401986650002402010650002002034650001402054650003202068650002202100650001702122651001002139651001002149700001602159700001602175773012102191852000902312930003302321945002502354946001302379655001202392IND4383675520221118045532.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438367552DNAL7 a169600822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aX1001 aTerawaki, Y.10aDevelopment of a Survival Model with Piecewise Weibull Baselines for the Analysis of Length of Productive Life of Holstein Cows in Japan  ap. 4058-4065.  aIncludes references  aA total of 100,000 records of Holstein dairy cows in Hokkaido, Japan, were used to study the current characteristics of their length of productive life, to build up a suitable model for genetic survival analysis, and to apply the piecewise Weibull baseline model. The data for this analysis only included records of cows belonging to herds in which more than 60% of cows had type score. Compared with other studies, the proportions of cows with only 1 or 2 calvings were low (24 and 46%, respectively), indicating a very low culling rate in first or second parity in Hokkaido. The median length of productive life was about 1,250 d (3 yr and 5 mo). Four different definitions of stages of lactation were studied. The best fit of the data was obtained when stages of lactation were chosen with cutpoints at 0, 60, 250, and 350 d after calving. Whatever the definition of stages of lactation, the piecewise Weibull baseline model was better than a unique baseline model. The estimated shape Weibull parameters ρ for the different parity x stage of lactation combinations varied greatly (1.0 to 5.0). The estimated hazard functions based on the piecewise Weibull baseline model were smooth and reflected the important changes in observed hazard within lactation. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the development of a genetic model for sire evaluation and to genetic improvement of length of productive life of Holstein cattle in Hokkaido, Japan. 3adairy cows 3alongevity 3alactation stage 3aparity (reproduction) 3astatistical models 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDairying 2aFemale 2aLactationxgenetics 2aLongevityxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aPregnancy 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTime Factors 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aKatsumi, T.1 aDucrocq, V.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Oct., v. 89, no. 10 p.4058-4065dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/10/10  aOther US 7aarticle02425naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245015200173300001800325500002400343500001500367520120500382650001801587650002701605650002701632650001601659650003001675650002501705650001601730650002401746653002701770700001401797700001901811700001901830773009901849852000901948856009401957655001202051IND4475283420221118045525.0131231s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447528342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08782.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerruzzi, M.G.10aAntioxidant and Antimutagenic Activity of Dietary Chlorophyll Derivatives Determined by Radical Scavenging and Bacterial Reverse Mutagenesis Assays  ap. 2589-2595.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aIn vitro antioxidant and antimutagenic activity of dietary chlorophyll derivatives was assessed. Antioxidant activity was determined by the ability of each compound to scavenge the long-lived free radicals 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS+). Antimutagenic activity was assayed with a modified microscreen bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and benzo[a]pyrene as the tester strain and mutagen respectively. Derivatives of chlorophyll a were found to be more effective radical quenchers than those of chlorophyll b. Furthermore, metal-free derivatives such as chlorins, pheophytins, and pyropheophytins exhibited significantly lower antiradical capacity than metallo-derivatives such as Mg-chlorophylls, Zn-pheophytins, Zn-pyropheophytins, Cu-pheophytina, andCu-chlorophyllins. Both metal-free and metallo-chlorophyll derivatives demonstrated similar dose-dependent inhibitory activity against B[a]P induced mutagenesis. These results demonstrate that dietary chlorophyll derivatives prevalent in both fresh and processed foods and dietary supplements have antioxidant and antimutagenic activities. 3afree radicals 3aantimutagenic activity 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3amutagenesis 3aminimally processed foods 3aantioxidant activity 3achlorophyll 3adietary supplements 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aBöhm, V.1 aCourtney, P.D.1 aSchwartz, S.J.0 tJournal of food science.g2002 Sept., v. 67, no. 7 p.2589-2595dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08782.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03843naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100002200138245011700160300001600277500002400293500001500317520155600332650001901888650001601907650001701923650003701940650002301977650002102000650001202021650001002033650002202043650002802065650002002093650002502113650002102138650001602159650001202175650002002187650002002207650001502227650001002242650002002252650002502272650002802297650002302325650001102348650001902359650001102378650001602389650002302405650003702428650001502465650001502480650005502495650001702550650002602567650003802593650005502631651001002686651002502696653001602721653001502737700002502752773012902777852000902906856008702915930003303002945002503035946001303060655001203073IND4383632120221118045534.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438363212DNAL7 a169601792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aSubramanian, S.V.10aPatterns, distribution, and determinants of under- and overnutrition: a population-based study of women in India  ap. 633-640.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Little systematic evidence exists for the relation between socioeconomic position and nutritional status in countries experiencing the simultaneous presence of under- and overnutrition. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the socioeconomic distribution of nutritional status in India and whether state-level macroeconomic factors modify the relation between socioeconomic position and nutritional status. DESIGN: Our analysis was based on a nationally representative sample of 77 220 women from India, with multiple categories of body mass index (BMI; in kg/m²) as the outcome, namely, <18.5 (underweight), 23-24.9 (pre-overweight), 25-29.9 (overweight), or >=30 (obese), with 18.5-22.9 as the reference category. RESULTS: In adjusted models, being underweight was inversely related to socioeconomic position, whereas socioeconomic position was positively related to being pre-overweight, overweight, and obese, and the socioeconomic gradient was most marked for obesity. State-level measures of affluence did not modify the positive association between socioeconomic position and categories of overweight. The risk of underweight was lower in affluent states, but this was seen mainly in women of high socioeconomic position. CONCLUSIONS: Undernutrition and overnutrition are epidemics of the impoverished and the affluent, respectively, in India, and this association is consistent at the individual and ecologic levels. Policies should focus on the complex patterns of social distribution of both under- and overnutrition in the Indian context. 3amacroeconomics 3acorrelation 3amalnutrition 3asociodemographic characteristics 3anutritional status 3ahousehold income 3apoverty 3awomen 3aideal body weight 3apopulation distribution 3arisk assessment 3asocioeconomic status 3anational surveys 3aunderweight 3aobesity 3ahuman nutrition 3abody mass index 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aConfidence Intervals 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEducational Status 2aFemale 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Status 2aObesityxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aOdds Ratio 2aPrevalence 2aRural Healthxstatistics & numerical dataxtrends. 2aSocial Class 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aThinnessxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aUrban Healthxstatistics & numerical dataxtrends. 3aIndia 0aIndiaxepidemiology. 0abody weight 0aoverweight1 aDavey Smith, George.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2006 Sept., v. 84, no. 3 p.633-640dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070606b20070702c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/05/13  aOther US 7aarticle02612naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001700180245008500197300001600282500002400298500001500322520094800337650002201285650001901307650001901326650000901345650001001354650001601364650002301380650001401403650001501417650002001432650001201452650001701464650002501481650001801506650001201524651001901536653002601555653003401581653001401615653002901629653001501658700001401673700001401687700001601701700001601717773011901733852000901852856009201861930003301953945002501986946001102011655001202022IND4383648620221118045528.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438364862DNAL7 a197548092pmid7 a10.1111/j.1476-5829.2006.00100.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aPolton, G.A.10aBreed, gender and neutering status of British dogs with anal sac gland carcinoma  ap. 125-131.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study details the breed, gender and neutering status of a large cohort of British canine patients suffering from histologically confirmed anal sac gland carcinoma. Estimates of the relative risk for the development of this disease attributable to these factors are calculated. To reduce the impact of sampling errors, cases were selected from veterinary histopathology laboratories rather than referral hospital databases, and multiple estimates of the general British canine population were used. The weaknesses of the statistical assumptions made are discussed. There was no evidence to support a gender predisposition for the development of this condition. English cocker spaniels are significantly over-represented, with a mean relative risk estimate of 7.3. The mean relative risk estimate associated with being neutered was 1.4; the effect of neutering appeared to be more significant in male dogs compared with that in female dogs. 3abreed differences 3aCocker Spaniel 3acohort studies 3adogs 3amales 3aanal glands 3agender differences 3acarcinoma 3acastration 3arisk assessment 3aspaying 3ainflammation 3aanimal communication 3arelative risk 3afemales 3aUnited Kingdom 0areference populations 0aapocrine gland adenocarcinoma 0aneoplasia 0aanal sac gland carcinoma 0adog breeds1 aMowat, V.1 aLee, H.C.1 aMckee, K.A.1 aScase, T.J.0 tVeterinary and comparative oncology.g2006 Sept., v. 4, no. 3 p.125-131dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1476-58107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5829.2006.00100.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/29  aNon-US 7aarticle04183naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001800156245013400174300001600308500002400324500001500348520169800363650001802061650001302079650003402092650001602126650001102142650001602153650001002169650002002179650000802199650001902207650002002226650002002246650002002266650002802286650001302314650001602327650002502343650002402368650001802392650001002410650002102420650002502441650003302466650002802499650002002527650002802547650003002575650002502605650001102630650001902641650001102660650001802671650000902689650001602698650003202714650002002746650001202766653002102778653001702799653002502816653002602841653001802867700001502885700001702900700002202917700002302939700002402962700002302986773012903009852000903138856008703147930003303234945002503267946001303292655001203305IND4383632320140723000000.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438363232DNAL7 a169601802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT200 0aX1001 aLau, Cathrine10aAssociation between dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, and body mass index in the Inter99 study: is underreporting a problem?  ap. 641-645.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: The few studies examining the potential associations between glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and body mass index (BMI) have provided no clear pictures. Underreporting of energy intake may be one explanation for this. OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations between GI, GL, and BMI by focusing on the confounding factor of total energy intake and the effect of exclusion of low energy reporters (LERs). DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of 6334 subjects aged 30-60 y. Dietary intake was estimated from a food-frequency questionnaire. GI and GL were estimated by using white bread as the reference food. Underreporting of energy intake was assessed as reported energy intake divided by basal metabolic rate (EI/BMR); LERs were defined as those having an EI/BMR < 1.14. Univariate and multiple linear regression models were used to test for associations between GI, GL, and BMI. The confounders were sex, age, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, and energy intake. All analyses were conducted on 1) the entire population and 2) a subsample excluding LERs. RESULTS: In the univariate analyses of the entire population, GL was inversely associated with BMI. No association was observed for GI. After full adjustment (including energy intake), both GI and GL were positively associated with BMI. When LERs were excluded, GL was positively associated with BMI in all analyses, and GI was positively associated with BMI in the multiple analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We showed a positive association between GI, GL, and BMI. Energy adjustment and the exclusion of LERs significantly affected the results of the analysis; thus, we stress the importance of energy adjustment. 3aenergy intake 3avalidity 3afood frequency questionnaires 3adiet recall 3aadults 3acorrelation 3awomen 3adata collection 3amen 3aglycemic index 3aglycemic effect 3ahuman nutrition 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3aaccuracy 3afood intake 3abasal metabolic rate 3aexperimental design 3adata analysis 2aAdult 2aAlcohol Drinking 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBasal Metabolismxphysiology 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aGlycemic Index 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSelf Disclosure 2aSmoking 0aresearch methods 0adiet history 0astatistical analysis 0adiet study techniques 0aInter99 Study1 aToft, Ulla1 aTetens, Inge1 aRichelsen, Bjørn1 aJørgensen, Torben1 aBorch-Johnsen, Knut1 aGlümer, Charlotte0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2006 Sept., v. 84, no. 3 p.641-645dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070606b20070702c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/05/13  aOther US 7aarticle03099naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002100189245013900210300001600349500002400365520148200389650003101871650000901902650001501911650001701926650002001943650001001963650002201973650003101995650005202026650001502078650001902093650002302112653001902135653001302154653000802167653001002175653002802185653000902213700001302222700001802235700001502253773011902268852000902387856009202396930003302488945002502521946001102546655001202557IND4383649520221118045608.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438364952DNAL7 a197548132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1476-5829.2006.00105.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL8401 aDeInnocentes, P.10aExpression and sequence of canine SIRT2 and p53 genes in canine mammary tumour cells - effects on downstream targets Wip1 and p21/Cip1  ap. 161-177.  aIncludes references  aWe have characterized gene dysfunction in a cellular model of spontaneous canine mammary cancer by investigating specific gene defects in SIRT2 and p53 genes for comparative studies among canine tumour-derived cell lines. These genes and their downstream targets are involved in regulating gene silencing, cell cycle progression and prevention of senescence and apoptosis. Canine SIR2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplicons were most homologous to human SIRT2 and revealed detectable transcripts in all cell lines. Canine SIRT2 contained non-conserved amino acid substitutions, representing mutations or allelic differences and interspecies differences. Sequence differences between individuals in p53 and SIRT2 were found in two cell lines including a stop codon in p53 and substitutions of conserved cysteine residues in the Zn²⁺-binding motif in SIRT2. Mutations in SIRT2 were coincident with expression of the p53 modulator, Wip1; a failure to activate p21/Cip1 and extended G2/M phase. A third cell line appeared to function normally in these two pathways and likely possesses other defects in proliferation-control genes. This data identify potentially important defects in pathways regulated by p53 and SIRT2 that modulate cell proliferation and integrate development, apoptosis and proliferative lifespan. These genes offer promising therapeutic targets, contributing to the transformed/immortalized phenotype in spontaneous canine mammary cancer. 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3adogs 3acell cycle 3adog diseases 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3agene expression regulation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3acell lines 3aadenocarcinoma 3acell proliferation 0amammary cancer 0ap21/Cip1 0ap53 0aSIRT2 0atumour suppressor genes 0aWip11 aLi, L.X.1 aSanchez, R.L.1 aBird, R.C.0 tVeterinary and comparative oncology.g2006 Sept., v. 4, no. 3 p.161-177dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1476-58107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5829.2006.00105.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02820naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100001800138245010100156300001800257500002400275520100200299650001901301650003101320650002001351650000901371650002201380650004501402650002501447650003001472650003601502650002701538650004001565650005801605650003901663650004001702650002201742650003901764650002301803650007801826650005801904651001401962651001401976700001701990700002102007700001602028700002102044773012102065852000902186930003302195945002502228946001302253655001202266IND4383672620221118045627.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438367262DNAL7 a169600532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1211 aQuiberoni, A.10aDiversity of Streptococcus thermophilus Phages in a Large-Production Cheese Factory in Argentina  ap. 3791-3799.  aIncludes references  aPhage infections still represent a serious risk to the dairy industry, in which Streptococcus thermophilus is used in starter cultures for the manufacture of yogurt and cheese. The goal of the present study was to analyze the biodiversity of the virulent S. thermophilus phage population in one Argentinean cheese plant. Ten distinct S. thermophilus phages were isolated from cheese whey samples collected in a 2-mo survey. They were then characterized by their morphology, host range, and restriction patterns. These phages were also classified within the 2 main groups of S. thermophilus phages (cos- and pac-type) using a newly adapted multiplex PCR method. Six phages were classified as cos-type phages, whereas the 4 others belonged to the pac-type group. This study illustrates the phage diversity that can be found in one factory that rotates several cultures of S. thermophilus. Limiting the number of starter cultures is likely to reduce phage biodiversity within a fermentation facility. 3abacteriophages 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3acheese starters 3awhey 3agenetic variation 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3anucleotide sequences 2aCapsid Proteinsxgenetics 2aCheesexmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aDeoxyribonuclease EcoRIxmetabolism 2aDeoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specificxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aFood-Processing Industryxstandards 2aGenetic Variation 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSequence Alignment 2aStreptococcus Phagesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aStreptococcus thermophilusxultrastructurexvirology. 3aArgentina 0aArgentina1 aTremblay, D.1 aAckermann, H.-W.1 aMoineau, S.1 aReinheimer, J.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Oct., v. 89, no. 10 p.3791-3799dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/10/06  aOther US 7aarticle03491naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001700147245013000164300001800294500002400312520186100336650001902197650002502216650002002241650001102261650001402272650001602286650002102302650002102323650002502344650002602369650004702395650002502442650002202467650003102489650002902520650003302549650002502582650002202607650001002629650001702639700002002656700002002676700002002696700002002716773012102736852000902857930003302866945002502899946001302924655001202937IND4383672220221118045603.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438367222DNAL7 a169600492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ5011 aHannon, J.A.10aProduction of Ingredient-Type Cheddar Cheese with Accelerated Flavor Development by Addition of Enzyme-Modified Cheese Powder  ap. 3749-3762.  aIncludes references  aFast-ripened Cheddar cheeses for ingredient purposes were produced by addition of a dried enzyme-modified cheese (EMC; 0.25 and 1 g/100 g of milled curd) at the salting stage during a standard Cheddar cheese-making procedure. Populations of starter and nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), levels of proteolysis and lipolysis, volatile analysis, and flavor development (by quantitative descriptive sensory analysis) were monitored over a 6-mo ripening period. Levels of free AA and free fatty acids were elevated in the experimental cheeses on d 1 because of inclusion of the EMC. Counts of NSLAB were also elevated in the experimental cheeses compared with the control cheese from the start of ripening. Levels of free AA were slightly elevated in the experimental cheeses at 1, 2, and 4 mo, but significantly greater accumulations were detected by 6 mo of ripening, with His, Leu, and glutamate reflecting the greatest increases. Levels of long-chain free fatty acids increased up to 2 mo, indicating an initial stimulation of lipolysis, but had decreased by 6 mo, indicating greater catabolism, probably caused by NSLAB and increased starter lysis. Principal component analysis of the volatile compounds showed few differences in the aroma profiles among the cheeses up to 4 mo of ripening, but a large separation of the cheeses supplemented with EMC relative to the control was observed by 6 mo. Sensory analysis of the cheeses with added EMC showed an acceleration of 2 mo in flavor development compared with the control cheese with the addition of 1 g/100 g of EMC developing a flavor profile at 4 mo similar to the control cheese at 6 mo of ripening. However, atypical Cheddar flavors developed on prolonged storage. This study shows the potential of adding EMC during Cheddar production to produce a fast-ripened ingredient-type Cheddar cheese. 3aCheddar cheese 3aaccelerated ripening 3acheese ripening 3aflavor 3alipolysis 3aproteolysis 3afree amino acids 3afree fatty acids 3alactic acid bacteria 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aCheesexanalysisxmicrobiologyxstandards. 2aChymosinxmetabolism 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFood Technologyxmethods 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aTaste 2aTime Factors1 aKilcawley, K.N.1 aWilkinson, M.G.1 aDelahunty, C.M.1 aBeresford, T.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2006 Oct., v. 89, no. 10 p.3749-3762dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/10/06  aOther US 7aarticle04223naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100002200147245010900169300001600278500002400294500001500318520164000333650001701973650001801990650001602008650002002024650001702044650001002061650002002071650001902091650003202110650001902142650001802161650001302179650001302192650001802205650001602223650001602239650002302255650002502278650002302303650002502326650001802351650001002369650002202379650006302401650001902464650004802483650003002531650003402561650002102595650001102616650002302627650001102650650002602661650002502687650000902712650002902721650002302750650002402773650002802797653001802825653002402843653002802867700002002895700002602915700002002941700001802961700002102979700002203000700002703022773012903049852000903178856008703187930003303274945002503307946001303332655001203345IND4383629320221118045654.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438362932DNAL7 a169601652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aT3001 aTrabulsi, Jillian10aEnergy balance and the accuracy of reported energy intake in preadolescent children with cystic fibrosis  ap. 523-530.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Suboptimal growth and nutritional status are common among children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and pancreatic insufficiency (PI). A better understanding of energy balance is required to improve prevention and treatment of malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize energy balance and the reporting accuracy of dietary intake in children with CF by evaluating the relations between energy intake (EI), energy expenditure (EE), fecal energy loss, nutritional status, and growth. DESIGN: The subjects were participants of a 24-mo prospective study of children 6-10 y of age with CF and PI. EE, EI, fecal energy loss, and anthropometric measures were obtained at baseline and at 24 mo. RESULTS: The children (n = 69) had suboptimal growth at baseline (x ± SD: weight-for-age z score, -0.53 ± 1.19; adjusted height-for-age z score, -0.67 ± 1.06; body mass index z score, -0.29 ± 1.12), and these variables remained suboptimal at 24 mo. The median ratios of EI to EE at baseline and 24 mo were 1.15 and 1.18, respectively, which decreased to 1.09 and 1.10, respectively, when adjusted for fecal energy loss (EI₋FL:EE). At baseline, 7% of subjects were underreporters, 64% were accurate reporters, and 23% were overreporters of energy intake; the percentages were similar at 24 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Although EI₋FL:EE ratios were higher than expected at both baseline and 24 mo, this cohort showed only age-appropriate weight gain. Self-reported dietary intake data at the individual level should be interpreted with caution, and weight gain velocity may serve as an objective measure of long-term energy balance. 3amalnutrition 3aenergy intake 3adiet recall 3achild nutrition 3achild growth 3afeces 3acystic fibrosis 3ahuman diseases 3aanthropometric measurements 3acohort studies 3ahealth status 3achildren 3aaccuracy 3alipid content 3afood intake 3aweight gain 3anutritional status 3anutritional adequacy 3aenergy expenditure 3alongitudinal studies 2aAnthropometry 2aChild 2aChild Development 2aChild Nutrition Disordersxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aCohort Studies 2aCystic Fibrosisxcomplicationsxmetabolism. 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aGrowthxphysiology 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aNutritional Requirements 2aNutritional Status 2aProspective Studies 2aWeight Gainxphysiology 0acomplications 0apancreatic diseases 0aepidemiological studies1 aSchall, Joan I.1 aIttenbach, Richard F.1 aOlsen, Irene E.1 aYudkoff, Marc1 aDaikhin, Yevgeny1 aZemel, Babette S.1 aStallings, Virginia A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2006 Sept., v. 84, no. 3 p.523-530dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.ajcn.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070606b20070702c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/05/11  aOther US 7aarticle04117naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100002300156245012000179300001600299500002400315500001500339520170300354650001002057650001302067650002102080650001602101650001502117650001602132650002202148650001702170650002602187650001702213650002602230650003302256650002702289650002002316650001102336650001302347650001602360650002402376650002302400650001002423650002602433650004902459650003302508650002002541650001102561650001102572650001802583650004502601650000902646650002602655650002302681650003002704650003302734650002402767650002202791650003602813650002102849653002602870653001602896700002202912700002602934700002002960700002302980773012903003852000903132856008703141930003303228945002503261946001303286655001203299IND4383629520221118045456.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438362952DNAL7 a169601662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT200 0aX1001 aWalsh, Marianne C.10aEffect of acute dietary standardization on the urinary, plasma, and salivary metabolomic profiles of healthy humans  ap. 531-539.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Metabolomics in human nutrition research is faced with the challenge that changes in metabolic profiles resulting from diet may be difficult to differentiate from normal physiologic variation. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the extent of intra- and interindividual variation in normal human metabolic profiles and investigated the effect of standardizing diet on reducing variation. DESIGN: Urine, plasma, and saliva were collected from 30 healthy volunteers (23 females, 7 males) on 4 separate mornings. For visits 1 and 2, free food choice was permitted on the day before biofluid collection. Food choice on the day before visit 3 was intended to mimic that for visit 2, and all foods were standardized on the day before visit 4. Samples were analyzed by using ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy followed by multivariate data analysis. RESULTS: Intra- and interindividual variations were considerable for each biofluid. Visual inspection of the principal components analysis scores plots indicated a reduction in interindividual variation in urine, but not in plasma or saliva, after the standard diet. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis indicated time-dependent changes in urinary and salivary samples, mainly resulting from creatinine in urine and acetate in saliva. The predictive power of each model to classify the samples as either night or morning was 85% for urine and 75% for saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Urine represented a sensitive metabolic profile that reflected acute dietary intake, whereas plasma and saliva did not. Future metabolomics studies should consider recent dietary intake and time of sample collection as a means of reducing normal physiologic variation. 3aurine 3avalidity 3ahuman physiology 3acorrelation 3abiomarkers 3areliability 3ametabolic studies 3ablood plasma 3amultivariate analysis 3ametabolomics 3aquantitative analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3aphysiological response 3ahuman nutrition 3asaliva 3aaccuracy 3afood intake 3aexperimental design 3aexperimental diets 2aAdult 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aBlood Chemical Analysisxmethodsxstandards. 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aDietxstandards 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIndividuality 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aMale 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aObserver Variation 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aReference Standards 2aSalivaxchemistry 2aUrinalysisxmethodsxstandards. 2aUrinexchemistry 0adiet study techniques 0abody fluids1 aBrennan, Lorraine1 aMalthouse, J.

However, no data are available as to whether these are achievable. The purpose of this study was to determine whether renal inpatient meals can meet the standards set by the RNG. A prospective 10-day weighed food analysis of hospital meals provided to renal patients was undertaken. Two sample meals were analysed at each mealtime to include (1) the most energy dense choice and (2) the most frequent patient choice (FPC). Energy dense choice meals achieved the standard for protein provision on 90% of days, but provided too little energy on 100% of days (for men) and on 30% of days (for women). Although daily standards for potassium were met on 70% of days, those for sodium and phosphate were exceeded. FPC meals met the daily standards for potassium, sodium and phosphate on at least 80% of days, but provided too little protein on 40% of days and too little energy on 100% of days (for men and women). The majority of hospital meals fail to meet the RNG standards. Problems exist in providing sufficient energy and protein whilst restricting sodium, potassium and phosphate. 3anutrient intake 3anutrient content 3afood choices 3asodium phosphate 3amen 3awomen 3ahospital food service 3aenergy density 3agender differences 3adietary minerals 3apotassium 3apatients 3afood composition 3akidney diseases 3aprotein content 3amineral content 3ameals (menu) 2aDiet Records 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Service, Hospitalxstandards 2aHumans 2aKidney Diseasesxdiet therapy 2aMale 2aNutritional Requirements 2aNutritive Value 2aPhosphatesxadministration & dosage 2aPotassium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aProspective Studies 2aSodium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 0aenergy content 0ainpatients1 aHartley, G.H.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2006 Oct., v. 19, no. 5 p.369-374dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2006.00713.x3electronic resource  a20070103b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/11/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03092naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002300180245008800203300001600291500002400307520098600331650001201317650002001329650001901349650002501368650001701393650002801410650002301438650003201461650001601493650001601509650001401525650002201539650001801561650003001579650004501609650002201654650002201676650002101698650001201719650004801731650005701779650005201836650004601888650002601934650002301960651001101983653003201994700002102026700002302047700002302070700002202093700002002115700002302135773010602158852000902264856007602273930003302349945002502382946001102407655001202418IND4383622020221118045511.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438362202DNAL7 a169618172pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3164.2006.00535.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8311 aArabatzis, Michael10aRapid detection of Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii in rabbit skin specimens by PCR-RFLP  ap. 322-326.  aIncludes references  aThree commercial rabbit farms independently reported suspected dermatophyte infections during 2004. Cultures confirmed that the infection was caused by the zoophilic Tricophyton mentagrophytes, while mating studies and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1/4 polymerase chain reaction products, directly amplified from skin lesions and from pure culture isolates, established its Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii lineage. Subsequently, the corresponding DdeI restriction profiles of the ITS1/4 PCR products matched one of the two published T. mentagrophytes complex profiles. Sequence analysis of the published ITS sequences predicted distinct DdeI restriction sites for Arthroderma benhamiae and A. vanbreuseghemii, while all DdeI-generated restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the rabbit isolates were identical to those of A. vanbreuseghemii. The proposed procedure can be used for rapid dermatophyte detection and presumptive T. mentagrophytes identification. 3arabbits 3arabbit diseases 3adermatomycoses 3akeratinophilic fungi 3acase studies 3apathogen identification 3amicrobial genetics 3aTrichophyton mentagrophytes 3ateleomorphs 3aArthroderma 3aphylogeny 3adisease detection 3arapid methods 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease diagnosis 3acommercial farms 2aAnimals 2aArthrodermataceaexisolation & purification 2aDermatomycosesxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRabbitsxmicrobiology 2aSkinxmicrobiology 3aGreece 0aArthroderma vanbreuseghemii1 aXylouri, Eftihia1 aFrangiadaki, Irene1 aTzimogianni, Aleka1 aMilioni, Afroditi1 aArsenis, George1 aVelegraki, Aristea0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2006 Oct., v. 17, no. 5 p.322-326dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0959-44937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2006.00535.x3electronic resource  a20070314b20070402c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/02/20  aNon-US 7aarticle01579naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245005800172300001800230500002400248520071800272650002000990650000901010650001001019650000701029650001201036700001901048700001401067773009301081852000901174856009401183655001201277IND4475432320221118045541.0140107s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447543232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08694.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrews, L.S.10aSucrose Degradation Under Model Processing Conditions  ap. 1621-1624.  aIncludes references  aDuring raw and refined sugars processing, chemical changes occur that affect yield and end product color.

Putrescine-treated fruits (both damaged and nondamaged) showed different physiological behavior than controls. Color change, weight loss, ethylene emission, and respiration rate were reduced in putrescine-treated fruits. The most remarkable effect of the mechanical damage was the significant increase in spermidine concentrations found after the compression in control apricots, which could be considered as a physiological marker of mechanical damage. 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aapricots 3acolor 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afruits 3amechanical damage 3aputrescine 3ashelf life 3aweight loss1 aSerrano, M.1 aCarbonell, A.1 aBurgos-Briceño, L.1 aRiquelme, F.1 aValero, D.0 tJournal of food science.g2002 , v. 67, no. 5 p.1706-1712dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08710.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01994naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001100154245011500165300001800280500002400298520083800322650001401160650001401174650002301188650001701211650001301228650001301241650001201254650001101266650002501277650001501302650000701317650002101324650001201345700001801357700002001375773009801395852000901493856009401502655001201596IND4475440920221118045349.0140107s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447544092DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08841.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Z.10aEffects of Fruit Size on Fresh Cucumber Composition and the Chemical and Physical Consequences of Fermentation  ap. 2934-2939.  aIncludes references  aThe composition of pickling cucumbers varied with fruit size, which affected buffer capacity, sugar utilization, terminal pH, and texture of the fermented fruit. We found that as cucumber size increased (from less than 27 to 51 mm in dia), malic acid, pH, buffer capacity, and dry matter content decreased, and glucose and fructose contents increased. Fruit firmness and bloater damage were greater in large than in small, fermented, whole cucumbers. Blanching (75 °C, 30 s) had little effect on the fermentation and prevention of bloater formation in finished products, regardless of fruit sizes. It was demonstrated that cucumber juice can serve as a model system for studying the metabolic, but not the physical (texture, bloater damage), consequences of lactic acid bacteria chosen as starter cultures for cucumber fermentation. 3ablanching 3acucumbers 3adry matter content 3afermentation 3afirmness 3afructose 3aglucose 3ajuices 3alactic acid bacteria 3amalic acid 3apH 3astarter cultures 3atexture1 aFleming, H.P.1 aMcFeeters, R.F.0 tJournal of food science.g2002 Oct., v. 67, no. 8 p.2934-2939dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08841.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02048naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245010400171300001800275500002400293520087300317650002101190650001001211650001001221650002401231650001301255650001301268650001601281650001301297650001601310650002101326650002701347700001701374700001901391700001901410700002001429773009801449852000901547856009401556655001201650IND4475440720221118045351.0140107s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447544072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08839.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhatib, K.A.10aCharacterization and Functional Properties of Soy β-Conglycinin and Glycinin of Selected Genotypes  ap. 2923-2929.  aIncludes references  aThe principal soy storage proteins, β-conglycinin and glycinin, may provide valuable functionality as food ingredients.

Beta -amylase Alleles in which an Amino Acid Substitution Determines Beta -amylase Isoenzyme Type and the Level of Free Beta-amylase  ap. 39-50.  aIncludes references  aThe three beta -amylase genes (Bmy1, 2 and 3) in cultivated barley were mapped to chromosomes 4HL, 2HL And 4HL respectively using RFLP analysis. No recombinants between Bmy1 andBmy3 were detected among 264 DH lines. Polymorphism of the Sd1 and Sd2 isoenzymes of beta -amylase co-segregated with the Bmy loci on chromosome 4HL in a doubled-haploid population of the cross Chebec (Sd2)×Harrington (Sd1). This locus also explained 90·5% of the variation in the level of free enzyme between the two parents. Two cDNAs ofbeta -amylase were isolated by RT-PCR from the developing grains of Harrington (Sd1) and Galleon (Sd2). Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences identified three amino-acid substitutions between the Sd2 and Sd1 forms of beta -amylase (Arg115 – Cys, Asp165 – Glu, and Val430 – Ala). Three allele-specific PCR primer pairs based on the three amino acid substitutions were used to amplify the beta -amylase genes in genomic DNA of sixteen barley cultivars/lines. Only the Arg115(Sd2)/Cys(Sd1) substitution was consistent with the isoenzyme form. This amino acid replacement reduced the pI of the Sd1 beta -amylase consistent with the fact that the Sd2 form is more basic than the Sd1 form when separated by IEF. The mutation from Arg115 to Cys in the Sd1 form also provides one more -SH group to form S-S-bridges. As bound beta -amylase is linked to the insoluble proteins of the endosperm and its inhibitor via disulphide bridges this could explain the higher level of binding exhibited by Sd1 vs Sd2. Thus a single amino acid substitution determines both the isoenzyme type and beta -amylase binding. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aalleles 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acid substitution 3abarley 3abeta-amylase 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3adisulfide bonds 3aendosperm 3aisozymes 3aloci 3aparents 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aLangridge, P.1 aZhang, X.Q.1 aEckstein, P.E.1 aRossnagel, B.G.1 aLance, R.C.M.1 aLefol, E.B.1 aLu, M.Y.1 aHarvey, B.L.1 aScoles, G.J.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2002 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.39-50dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jcrs.2001.03983Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01810naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245012200171300001800293500002400311520079500335650001001130650001201140650001101152650001101163650001801174650000901192650001201201650002301213700001801236700001701254773009801271852000901369856009401378655001201472IND4475441620221118045402.0140107s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447544162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08848.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoligné, I.10aEffects of Salting, Drying, Cooking, and Smoking Operations on Volatile Compound Formation and Color Patterns in Pork  ap. 2976-2986.  aIncludes references  aThe traditional small-scale production of boucané, a cured smoked pork-belly product from Réunion, involves several unit operations that are performed in a single step.

These characateristics are the 3 main criteria of boucané's quality. Mass transfer, color, and volatile compounds were measured, analyzed, and compared in 4 products. Results indicated that a major quantity of volatile compounds detected in the processed meat were derived from the smoking process. Color variations were mainly explained by muscle pigment modification due to the cooking process, and by the input of volatile compounds of smoke. 3acolor 3acooking 3adrying 3aflavor 3amass transfer 3apork 3asalting 3avolatile compounds1 aCollignan, A.1 aTrystram, G.0 tJournal of food science.g2002 Oct., v. 67, no. 8 p.2976-2986dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08848.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01837naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245011700171300001800288500002400306520077800330650002101108650002201129650001001151650001201161650002101173650001501194651001101209651001801220700001601238700002001254700001601274773009401290852000901384856009401393655001201487IND4475436320221118045521.0140107s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447543632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08733.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirotani, H.10aDemonstration of Indicator Microorganisms on Surface of Vegetables on the Market in the United States and Mexico  ap. 1847-1850.  aIncludes references  aPresence of indicator microorganisms of fecal pollution on the surface of vegetables sold in retail markets is demonstrated.

Conventional delivery systems include chipping or grinding of harvest residues (comminution) at the landing or a satellite yard in the forest and transporting the material with chip trucks to a power facility. To address some of the challenges of conventional methods of transporting biomass in steep terrain, chip van manufacturers have been making trailer modifications to increase vehicle maneuverability on forest roads. To evaluate the proper van configurations for implementing a successful biomass transportation system, planners should understand the limitations of the various chip van options. We present guidelines for designing new roads and evaluating existing road systems for chip truck access to forest residuals, as well as some practical field assessment procedures to evaluate accessibility on existing roads. 3atopography 3atrailers 3aslash 3atrucks 3anontimber forest products 3aland transportation 3awood chips 3aguidelines 3aequipment design 3amaneuverability 3abiofuels 3agrinding 3aforest roads 3abiomass 0aengineering 0atransportation 0aslope 0aharvest residuals1 aWimer, Jeff1 aCostales, Forrest1 aWing, Michael G.0 tWestern journal of applied forestry.g2010 July, v. 25, no. 3 p.144-153x0885-60957nnas  aDNAL  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/26  aOther US 7aarticle01774naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245010100171300001800272500002400290520069800314650002301012650002001035650002101055650003201076650001801108650001301126650001801139650000901157650002501166700001701191700001601208773009701224852000901321856009401330655001201424IND4475073920221118045455.0131227s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447507392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2003.tb09655.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoultani, S.10aWhey Protein Isolate and Glyco-macropeptide Recovery from Whey Using Ion Exchange Chromatography  ap. 1389-1395.  aIncludes references  aCation exchange was used to recover whey protein isolate (WPI) from sweet whey, and the effluent was fed to an anion exchanger to recover glycomacropeptide (GMP).

A cold-sensitive mariner-based transposon mutant of L. monocytogenes F2365 was found to harbor a single insertion in LMOf2365_1746, encoding a putative RNA helicase, and earlier shown by other investigators to be induced during 4°C growth of L. monocytogenes. The mutant had normal growth at 37°C but completely failed to grow at either 4 or 10°C, and had impaired growth and reduced swarming on soft agar at 25°C. However, the mutation had no discernible influence on the ability of the bacteria to tolerate repeated freezing and thawing after growth at either 25 or 37°C. The findings suggest that the transposon insertion in the putative helicase gene, in spite of the severely cold-sensitive phenotype that accompanies it, does not affect the ability of the bacteria to cope with cold-related stresses encountered during repeated freezing and thawing. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aRNA helicases 3aagar 3abacteria 3acold tolerance 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3agenes 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3atemperature 3athawing 3atransposons1 aKathariou, S.0 tJournal of food protection.g2010 Aug., v. 73, no. 8 p.1474-1479dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-73.8.1474  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245006100172300001800233520114100251650001701392650000801409650001601417650001601433650001601449650001501465650001801480650001001498650001001508650001001518650001901528650001401547650003001561650001801591650001301609650001201622700002001634700002501654700001701679700001601696700001901712700002101731773017301752856005001925852000901975655001201984IND60572319320221118044139.0170717e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057231932DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X-73.8.14862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakayama, Motokazu12aA Rapid Method for Identifying Byssochlamys and Hamigera  ap. 1486-1492.  aHeat-resistant fungi, genera Byssochlamys, Talaromyces, Neosartorya, and Hamigera, contribute significantly to the spoilage of heat-processed acidic foods, due to the formation of heat-resistant ascospores. Here, we first evaluated the differences in the β-tubulin gene between Byssochlamys and Hamigera and developed specific primers to identify the Byssochlamys species fulva, nivea, and spectabilis, and Hamigera. Using primers designed for B. fulva and B. nivea (B1F/1R), specific PCR products were detected for B. fulva and B. nivea, as well as B. langunculariae and B. zollerniae, two closely related species. Similarly, the Pae4F/4R-1 and H2F/2R primers produced specific PCR products for B. spectabilis and Hamigera, respectively. Using these three primer sets, strains involved in acidic food spoilage and environmental contamination were not detected. The detection limits of all primer sets were 1 ng of DNA by PCR and 10 pg of DNA by nested PCR. Each PCR assay was specific, even if the sample was contaminated 1,000-fold by other fungal DNA. Thus, this method has proved to possess an extremely high degree of specificity. 3aByssochlamys 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aNeosartorya 3aTalaromyces 3aascospores 3afood spoilage 3afoods 3afungi 3agenes 3aheat tolerance 3apollution 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3aspoilage 3atubulin1 aHosoya, Kouichi1 aMatsuzawa, Tetsuhiro1 aHiro, Yusuke1 aSako, Ayumi1 aTokuda, Hajime1 aYaguchi, Takashi0 tJournal of food protection.g2010 Aug., v. 73, no. 8 p.1486-1492dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-73.8.1486  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245009900193300001800292520127400310650001301584650000901597650001201606650005601618650003201674650002501706650007401731650001101805650000901816650000901825650001901834650001801853650004701871650001301918650009301931650003402024650004902058653003302107653001802140653002202158653002202180700002102202700002102223700002102244700002102265700002302286700002102309700002502330773012602355852000902481856009202490930003302582946001302615655001202628IND4441967520221118044427.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444196752DNAL7 a206265582pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06889.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKäenmäki, Mikko10aQuantitative role of COMT in dopamine clearance in the prefrontal cortex of freely moving mice  ap. 1745-1755.  aJ. Neurochem. (2010) 114, 1745-1755. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays an active role in the metabolism of dopamine (DA) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Because of low levels of dopamine transporter (DAT), it is proposed that the majority of released DA is taken up by either norepinephrine transporter (NET) and subsequently metabolized by monoamine oxidize (MAO) or by uptake₂ (to glial cells and post-synaptic neurons) and metabolized by COMT. However, a comprehensive in vivo study of rating the mechanisms involved in DA clearance in the PFC has not been done. Here, we employ two types of microdialysis to study these pathways using DAT, NET and MAO blockers in conscious mice, with or without Comt gene disruption. In quantitative no-net-flux microdialysis, DA levels were increased by 60% in the PFC of COMT-knockout (ko) mice, but not in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. In conventional microdialysis studies, we showed that selective NET and MAO inhibition increased DA levels in the PFC of wild-type mice by two- to fourfold, an effect that was still doubled in COMT-ko mice. Inhibition of DAT had no effect on DA levels in either genotype. Therefore, we conclude that in the mouse, PFC COMT contributes about one half of the total DA clearance. 3adopamine 3amice 2aAnimals 2aCatechol O-Methyltransferasexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCorpus Striatumxmetabolism 2aDopaminexmetabolism 2aDopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitors 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Knockout 2aMicrodialysis 2aMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aMutation 2aNorepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aNucleus Accumbensxmetabolism 2aPrefrontal Cortexxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0acatechol-O-methyltransferase 0amicrodialysis 0aprefrontal cortex 0auptake inhibition1 aTammimäki, Anne1 aMyöhänen, Timo1 aPakarinen, Kaisa1 aAmberg, Carolina1 aKarayiorgou, Maria1 aGogos, Joseph A.1 aMännistö, Pekka T.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 Sept., v. 114, no. 6 p.1745-1755dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06889.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03022naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245013200168300001400300520192700314650001302241650001602254653001702270653001502287653001402302653001802316653003202334700001502366700001602381700001302397773011502410852000902525856009202534930003302626946001302659655001202672IND4441981520221118044343.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444198152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2010.00708.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöhler, J.10aGiant dwarfs: discovery of a radiation of large-bodied 'stump-toed frogs' from karstic cave environments of northern Madagascar  ap. 21-38.  aThe endemic Malagasy microhylid genus Stumpffia usually comprises small-bodied terrestrial frogs with snout-vent lengths of 16 mm or less, with some miniaturized species as small as 10 mm in their adult stage, and only two described species reaching over 20 mm in snout-vent length. Previous studies have provided evidence for parallel miniaturization in Malagasy microhylids, with several species and candidate species previously assigned to Stumpffia probably belonging to other, still undescribed genera. Here, conversely, we report on the discovery of four new species of microhylids from northern Madagascar, of which two are larger than all previously known Stumpffia, but all clearly belong to this genus based on molecular phylogenetic relationships. All four species have fully developed digits, are closely related and occur in karstic limestone environments, with most specimens collected in caves, a habitat formerly unknown for cophylines. This newly discovered radiation of large-bodied and supposedly cave-dwelling Stumpffia contains one species from Nosy Hara, one from Ankarana, one from Ampombofofo and one from Montagne des Français, respectively. In the latter species, specimens can reach up to 28 mm snout-vent length. These new species are genetically differentiated from each other by 3.8-8.6% pairwise divergence in the 16S rRNA gene and furthermore by differences in coloration, extension of terminal finger discs, relative eye diameter and relative head width. We discuss the status of Stumpffia madagascariensis Mocquard, 1895 and consider it a valid species referable to one of the two small-bodied species identified from Montagne d'Ambre National Park. Furthermore, our results support that cophylines are highly microendemic and we provide support for a miniaturized ancestor of the large-bodied species described here, thus demonstrating that miniaturization is evolutionarily reversible. 3aAmphibia 3anew species 0aMicrohylidae 0aCophylinae 0aStumpffia 0amicroendemism 0areversal of miniaturization1 aVences, M.1 aD'Cruze, N.1 aGlaw, F.0 tJournal of zoology.g2010 Sept., v. 282, no. 1 p.21-38dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2010.00708.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03014naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245016200168300001800330520151800348650002701866650001601893650001301909650001601922650001301938650001201951650001901963650002201982650002402004650001302028650001402041650001102055650000902066650001402075650001502089650003202104653001002136653001102146653002602157653001402183653001102197700001302208700001602221700002002237700001302257773011402270852000902384856009202393946001102485655001202496IND4441997020221118044224.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444199702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07770.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zongwei10aExpression and secretion of interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-10 by hypoxia- and serum-deprivation-stimulated mesenchymal stem cells  ap. 3688-3698.  aTo understand the potential paracrine roles of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), the expression and secretion of these factors by rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells stimulated by hypoxia (4% oxygen) and serum deprivation (hypoxia/SD) were investigated. We found that hypoxia/SD induced nuclear factor kappa Bp65-dependent IL-1β and TNF-α transcription. Furthermore, hypoxia/SD stimulated the translation of pro-IL-1β and its processing to mature IL-1β, although the translation of TNF-α was unchanged. Unexpectedly, the release of IL-1β and TNF-α from hypoxia/SD-stimulated mesenchymal cells was undetectable unless ATP or lipopolysaccharide was present. This result suggests that IL-1β and TNF-α are not responsible for the paracrine effects of mesenchymal cells under ischaemic conditions. We also found that hypoxia/SD induced the transcription and secretion of IL-10, which were significantly enhanced by lipopolysaccharide and the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. Moreover, both the conditioned medium from hypoxia/SD-stimulated mesenchymal cells (MSC-CM) and IL-10 efficiently inhibited cardiac fibroblast proliferation and collagen expression in vitro, suggesting that mesenchymal cell-secreted IL-10 prevents cardiac fibrosis in a paracrine manner under ischaemic conditions. Taken together, these findings may improve understanding of the cellu-lar and molecular basis of the anti-inflammatory and paracrine effects of mesenchymal cells. 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ablood serum 3acollagen 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3ahypoxia 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alipopolysaccharides 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aoxygen 3arats 3asecretion 3astem cells 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aIL-10 0aIL-1β 0amesenchymal stem cell 0aparacrine 0aTNF-α1 aWei, Hua1 aDeng, Linzi1 aCong, Xiangfeng1 aChen, Xi0 tFEBS journal.g2010 Sept., v. 277, no. 18 p.3688-3698dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07770.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03237naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245022600189300001600415520145200431650001901883650002301902650001601925650003101941650001201972650002801984650003202012650003602044650002402080650006902104650000902173650000902182650002302191650001602214650003102230650008002261653001802341653002402359653002802383700001802411700001402429700001502443773012802458852000902586856009202595930003302687946001102720655001202731IND4441991820221118044225.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444199182DNAL7 a209200392pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01243.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaldrop, M.A.10aIntranasal delivery of mouse [D-Leu-4]-OB3, a synthetic peptide amide with leptin-like activity, improves energy balance, glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and bone formation in leptin-resistant C57BLK/6-m db/db mice  ap. 871-875.  aBackground: We have recently shown that intranasal administration of mouse [D-Leu-4]-OB3 reconstituted in Intravail® to male Swiss Webster mice resulted in significantly higher uptake and bioavailability when compared with commonly used injection methods of delivery. Aim and Methods: In this study, we examined the effects of intranasal delivery of mouse [D-Leu-4]-OB3 in Intravail® on energy balance, glucose regulation, insulin secretion and serum levels of osteocalcin, a specific and sensitive marker of bone formation. Genetically obese C57BLK/6-m db/db mice were allowed food and water ad libitum and given either Intravail® alone or mouse [D-Leu-4]-OB3 in Intravail® for 14 days by intranasal instillation. Results: Mouse [D-Leu-4]-OB3 reduced body weight gain, daily food intake, daily water intake and serum glucose by 11.5, 2.2, 4.0 and 61.9%, respectively. Serum insulin levels in db/db mice given mouse [D-Leu-4]-OB3 were approximately threefold lower than those in mice receiving Intravail® alone. Mouse [D-Leu-4]-OB3 elevated serum osteocalcin in db/db mice by 28.7% over Intravail® treated control mice. Conclusions: The results of our study indicate that intranasal delivery of biologically active mouse [D-Leu-4]-OB3 in Intravail® is feasible and has significant effects on regulating body weight gain, food and water intake, serum glucose, insulin sensitivity and bone formation in leptin-resistant C57BLK/6-m db/db mice. 3aenergy balance 3ainsulin resistance 3aosteocalcin 2aAdministration, Intranasal 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effects 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aInsulinxsecretion. 2aLeptinxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Obese 2aOsteogenesisxdrug effects 2aPeptide Fragmentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 0abone turnover 0aintranasal delivery 0aleptin-related peptides1 aLeinung, M.C.1 aLee, D.W.1 aGrasso, P.0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2010 Oct., v. 12, no. 10 p.871-875dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01243.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03737naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245019500194300001800389520160500407650001602012650002202028650004602050650001202096650002902108650001502137650003202152650002002184650003802204650000902242650005502251650003902306650004902345650004402394650005202438650003002490650000902520650001702529650005802546650004102604653001202645653002002657653003602677653002102713653002502734700001802759700002402777700002702801700001602828700001802844773012602862852000902988856009202997930003303089946001303122655001203135IND4441967920221118044206.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444196792DNAL7 a206265612pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06896.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIczkiewicz, Joanna14aThe RGD-containing peptide fragment of osteopontin protects tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells against toxic insult in primary ventral mesencephalic cultures and in the rat substantia nigra  ap. 1792-1804.  aJ. Neurochem. (2010) 114, 1792-1804. We have previously shown that the multi-functional phosphoprotein osteopontin (OPN) is present in the substantia nigra (SN) and that its mRNA and protein expression are up-regulated following toxic insult. We now report the effects of the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-containing peptide fragment of OPN and OPN inactivation on the survival of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurones in primary rat ventral mesencephalic (VM) cultures and in SN in the rat. Treatment of VM cultures with the fragment of OPN containing the RGD integrin binding domain did not decrease TH positive cell number, but instead the peptide fragment protected against cell loss induced by both MPP⁺ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Incorporation of an OPN antibody into VM cultures caused a concentration-dependent loss of TH positive neurones. The OPN antibody also exacerbated MPP⁺- and LPS-induced cell loss at all concentrations tested. In the rat, administration of the RGD-containing peptide fragment of OPN protected TH positive neurones against a mechanically-induced lesion and against 6-hydroxydopamine- and LPS-induced cell loss. The protection against 6-hydroxydopamine toxicity was confirmed in a separate study using stereological analysis. By contrast, stereotaxic injection of the OPN antibody into the SN resulted in a loss of TH positive cells. These results suggest that OPN may be necessary for the survival of TH positive cells in SN but through the RGD-containing peptide fragment may also have neuroprotective properties relevant to Parkinson's disease. 3aosteopontin 3aParkinson disease 2a1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridiniumxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxpharmacology 2aCell Count 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMesencephalonxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aNeurogliaxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aNeuronsxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aOligopeptidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aOsteopontinxchemistryximmunologyxphysiology. 2aOxidopaminexpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSubstantia Nigraxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aTyrosine 3-Monooxygenasexmetabolism 0agliosis 0aneuroprotection 0aRGD-containing peptide fragment 0asubstantia nigra 0atyrosine hydroxylase1 aBroom, Lauren1 aCooper, Jonathan D.1 aWong, Andrew Ming Sham1 aRose, Sarah1 aJenner, Peter0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 Sept., v. 114, no. 6 p.1792-1804dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06896.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02546naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011600174300001600290520091500306650001901221650001001240650002201250650001201272650001501284650001101299650001401310650001001324650001801334650001901352650001301371650000901384650001401393650004301407650000901450650001701459650001401476650001101490651001901501653001701520653003201537653001401569653002401583653001901607700001801626700001801644700001501662700001701677700001701694773011201711852000901823856009201832930003301924946001101957655001201968IND4441971420221118044219.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444197142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02311.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan de Wouw, A.P.10aDetermining frequencies of avirulent alleles in airborne Leptosphaeria maculans inoculum using quantitative PCR  ap. 809-818.  aPhoma stem canker (blackleg disease) of Brassica napus (oilseed rape, canola) is caused by the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans. Frequencies of avirulent alleles for loci where virulence can be associated with gene deletion (AvrLm1 and AvrLm6) were determined in samples of L. maculans airborne ascospore inoculum using quantitative PCR. The accuracy, reproducibility and limitations of detection were determined. Changes in the frequency of avirulent alleles were determined for the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 growing seasons for winter oilseed rape in the UK. The frequency of AvrLm1 remained small (between 9% and 16%), whilst the frequency of AvrLm6 fluctuated between 35% and 66%. Estimation of frequencies of avirulent alleles in airborne pathogen inoculum gives an efficient and unbiased method to assess the potential of crop cultivars with corresponding resistance genes being at risk of disease. 3aBrassica napus 3aPhoma 3aPlenodomus lingam 3aalleles 3aascospores 3acanola 3acultivars 3afungi 3agene deletion 3agrowing season 3ainoculum 3aloci 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3astem cankers 3avirulence 3awinter 3aUnited Kingdom 0aair sampling 0aairborne ascospore inoculum 0aAvr genes 0adisease forecasting 0aeffector genes1 aStonard, J.F.1 aHowlett, B.J.1 aWest, J.S.1 aFitt, B.D.L.1 aAtkins, S.D.0 tPlant pathology.g2010 Oct., v. 59, no. 5 p.809-818dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02311.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03147naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245016200190300001400352520119700366650001901563650001501582650001901597650001101616650002501627650001801652650001201670650002101682650001301703650001001716650001301726650002901739650001501768650001301783650001501796650001401811650001101825650001201836650001401848650003801862650002301900650002701923650002501950650002101975650004001996650001402036650002302050650001402073653001802087653001902105653002502124700001902149700002202168700001802190700002102208773011102229852000902340856009202349930003302441946001102474655001202485IND4441970920221118044215.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444197092DNAL7 a206189082pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03345.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichel, Gurvan10aCentral and storage carbon metabolism of the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus: insights into the origin and evolution of storage carbohydrates in Eukaryotes  ap. 67-81.  aBrown algae exhibit a unique carbon (C) storage metabolism. The photoassimilate d-fructose 6-phosphate is not used to produce sucrose but is converted into d-mannitol. These seaweeds also store C as β-1,3-glucan (laminarin), thus markedly departing from most living organisms, which use α-1,4-glucans (glycogen or starch). Using a combination of bioinformatic and phylogenetic approaches, we identified the candidate genes for the enzymes involved in C storage in the genome of the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus and traced their evolutionary origins. Ectocarpus possesses a complete set of enzymes for synthesis of mannitol, laminarin and trehalose. By contrast, the pathways for sucrose, starch and glycogen are completely absent. The synthesis of β-1,3-glucans appears to be a very ancient eukaryotic pathway. Brown algae inherited the trehalose pathway from the red algal progenitor of phaeoplasts, while the mannitol pathway was acquired by lateral gene transfer from Actinobacteria. The starch metabolism of the red algal endosymbiont was entirely lost in the ancestor of Stramenopiles. In light of these novel findings we question the validity of the 'Chromalveolate hypothesis'. 3aActinobacteria 3aEctocarpus 3abioinformatics 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aendosymbionts 3aenzymes 3aeukaryotic cells 3afructose 3agenes 3aglycogen 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amacroalgae 3amannitol 3ametabolism 3aphylogeny 3astarch 3asucrose 3atrehalose 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxgenetics 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Cyclexgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenomexgenetics 2aPhaeophytaxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aSymbiosis 0aβ-1,3-glucan 0aChromalveolate 0aEukaryotic evolution1 aTonon, Thierry1 aScornet, Delphine1 aCock, J.
