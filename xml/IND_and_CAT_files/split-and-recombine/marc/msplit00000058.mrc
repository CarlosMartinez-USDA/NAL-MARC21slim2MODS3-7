They can be easily functionalized for drug delivery functions, demonstrating great potential for both imaging and therapeutic applications. Here we developed new pH-responsive theranostic core–shell–corona nanoparticles consisting of superparamagentic Fe3O4 core that displays high T2 relaxivity, bovine serum albumin (BSA) shell that binds anticancer drug, doxorubicin (Dox) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) corona that increases stability and biocompatibility. The nanoparticles were produced by adsorption of the BSA shell onto the Fe3O4 core followed by crosslinking of the protein layer and subsequent grafting of the PEG corona using monoamino-terminated PEG via carbodiimide chemistry. The hydrodynamic diameter, zeta-potential, composition and T2 relaxivity of the resulting nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, thermogravimetric analysis and T2-relaxometry. Nanoparticles were shown to absorb Dox molecules, possibly through a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The loading capacity (LC) of the nanoparticles was 8wt.%. The Dox loaded nanoparticles release the drug at a higher rate at pH 5.5 compared to pH 7.4 and display similar cytotoxicity against C6 and HEK293 cells as the free Dox.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiocompatibility 3abovine serum albumin 3acolloids 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aimage analysis 3alight scattering 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aDoxorubicin 0aDrug delivery 0aAnticancer therapy 0aMRI-contrast agents1 aAbakumov, M.1 aGrinenko, N.1 aAbakumov, A.1 aSkorikov, A.1 aMironova, E.1 aDavydova, G.1 aMajouga, A.G.1 aNukolova, N.1 aKabanov, A.1 aChekhonin, V.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 136 p.1073-1080dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008700170520185100257592002802108650002102136650001202157650001302169650001802182650000902200650001102209650000902220650002102229650001702250650001702267650001902284651001902303653001602322653001702338653001902355653002502374653002402399653002002423700002302443700001602466700002102482700002302503700002602526700002002552700002202572700001902594700001702613700002402630773010702654856008602761852000902847655001202856IND60706614520221120163408.0201202e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070661452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1059942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHylkema, Alwin10aFish assemblages of three common artificial reef designs during early colonization  aIn this study, we compared the early fish colonization of three types of artificial reefs deployed in the coastal waters of Saba and St Eustatius in the Caribbean: reef balls®, layered cakes and piles of locally obtained basaltic rock. As an indicator of performance, three fish assemblage parameters (abundance, biomass, species richness) were measured using underwater visual censuses at 11 months post-deployment and 4 months after restoration from hurricane damage. All artificial reef plots showed higher values for fish abundance, biomass and species richness than control plots covered by bare sand, which shows that artificial reefs can locally enhance the fish assemblage. However, the effect differed among artificial reef plots. Fish abundance was 3.8 times higher on the layered cake plots compared to the reef ball plots, while fish biomass was 4.6 times higher. Rock pile plots had intermediate values. Species richness did not differ significantly among different artificial reef plots. Three-dimensional modelling revealed that layered cakes had a smaller gross volume, shelter volume and total surface area than reef balls. The availability of multiple small shelters in the layered cake design appeared to be more relevant than other physical parameters, as the layered cake plots had higher fish abundance than the reef balls plots. We concluded that on Saba and St. Eustatius, layered cake plots performed better than reef ball plots after one year of colonization. Rock pile plots, made of local volcanic rock, showed an intermediate performance, and were 4–10 times cheaper to construct. If observed differences are consistent with other locations and persist during further colonization, current efforts to deploy reef balls could better be allocated to deploy artificial reef structures with a higher shelter density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial reefs 3abiomass 3acensuses 3acoastal water 3afish 3amodels 3asand 3aspecies richness 3astorm damage 3asurface area 3avolcanic rocks 3aSint Eustatius 0aReef ball® 0aLayered cake 0aFish abundance 0aShelter availability 0aHabitat restoration 0aArtificial reef1 aDebrot, Adolphe O.1 aOsinga, R.,1 aBron, Patrick S.1 aHeesink, Daniel B.1 aIzioka, Ayumi Kuramae1 aReid, Callum B.1 aRippen, Jorien C.1 aTreibitz, Tali1 aYuval, Matan1 aMurk, Albertinka J.0 tEcological engineering.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 157 p.105994-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1059943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010200171300001600273520180500289592002802094650001702122650001702139650001802156650001802174650001102192650001202203650000902215650001502224650002402239650001102263650000902274650001902283650001602302650003102318650001402349650001002363650001302373650001902386650001802405651000902423653002002432653001002452653000902462653001502471653000902486700006002495700001702555700002802572700002302600773008602623856008502709852000902794655001202803IND60561229720221119181004.0190403e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056122972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2017.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTazikeh, Hossein10aSoil-parent material relationship in a mountainous arid area of Kopet Dagh basin, North East Iran  ap. 252-267.  aThe effects of parent rock types on soil evolution in arid areas were studied in a sequence of soils, derived from different lithologies in the Kopet Dagh basin (Northeastern Iran) using micromorphology, clay mineralogy, magnetic susceptibility and physico-chemical properties. The selected parent rocks and associated soils were shale (Haplocalcids), claystone (Haplotorrerts), gypsiferous marl (Haplogypsids), limestones (Haplocalcids and Torriorthents), siltstone and sandstones (Torriorthents). The results showed that the properties and development of soils were mainly affected by grain size and mineralogy of parent materials. Soil magnetic susceptibility (χlf) variations were attributed to the types of parent material and pedogenic processes. Redistribution of calcite and gypsum in soil profiles and natural and pedogenic formation of ferrimagnetic minerals were responsible for χlf variations. The soils clay mineral origins were found to be mainly of inheritance from parent materials. Smectite was the dominant clay mineral of the most soils.Based on the micromorphological index of soil evolution (MISECA), the soils studied were categorized into weakly developed Orthents, weakly to moderately developed Aridisols (Gypsids and Calcids) and moderately developed soils including Calcids and Torrerts. The degree of microstructure development, alteration of weatherable minerals and calcitic features were the most important criteria influencing assessment of soil development degree by MISECA index. The vertic features were only observed in soils of claystone in which there were considerable amounts of clay and smectite. High amounts of gypsum and low smectite content were mainly responsible for the lack of vertic behavior in other fine grained soils derived from shale and marl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaplocalcids 3aHaplogypsids 3aHaplotorrerts 3aTorriorthents 3abasins 3acalcite 3aclay 3aclay soils 3afine-textured soils 3agypsum 3amarl 3amicrostructure 3aparent rock 3aphysicochemical properties 3asandstone 3ashale 3asmectite 3asoil formation 3asoil profiles 3aIran 0aParent material 0aSoils 0aArid 0aKopet Dagh 0aIran1 aKhormali, Farhad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6805-73431 aAmini, Arash1 aMotlagh, Mojtaba Barani1 aAyoubi, Shamsollah0 tCatena.g2017 May, v. 152 p.252-267dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002900137245010000166300001200266520201800278592002802296650001602324650001202340650001002352650000902362650001102371650001402382650001502396650001702411650001402428650001602442650001202458650002202470650000902492650001602501700001702517700001802534773009202552856003802644852000902682655001202691IND50061720420221119082021.0130320s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006172042DNAL7 a10.1071/AN113502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Wettere, W.

A total of 1079 Large White/Landrace sows (parities 2–9 at mating) were used in a 2 by 2 by 2 factorial design to determine the effects of two levels of betaine supplementation (0 versus 3 g added betaine/kg feed), two levels of folic acid plus vitamin B12 supplementation (0 versus 20 mg/kg folic acid plus 150 µg/kg vitamin B12) during gestation, and two parity groups (parity 2 and 3 versus parity 4 and greater) on litter size and pregnancy outcomes. The number of sows returning to oestrus post-insemination, as well as the number of early (<Day 30) and late (>Day 30) pregnancy losses were recorded. At farrowing, the total number of piglets born, the number of piglets born alive and dead, as well as the number of mummified fetuses were recorded. Pre-prandial blood samples were collected from a subset of 20 sows/treatment on Days 3, 30 and 107 of gestation to analyse homocysteine. The incidence of early pregnancy loss was reduced (P < 0.001) by folic acid plus vitamin B12 supplementation (0.03 versus 0.07). There was a significant interaction between parity at mating (parities 2 and 3 versus parity 4 and greater) and the addition of betaine or folic acid plus vitamin B12 to the gestation diet on litter size. Litter size was higher (0.5 piglets; P < 0.05) for betaine supplemented, compared with unsupplemented, parity 4 plus sows. Folic acid plus vitamin B12-supplemented parity 2 and 3 sows gave birth to more (P < 0.05) piglets than all other treatment groups. Folic acid plus vitamin B12 supplementation decreased (P < 0.001) plasma homocysteine concentration by 2.2 and 2.8 μM, respectively, on Days 3 and 107 of gestation. However, betaine supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) homocysteine on Day 3 only. Overall, folic acid plus vitamin B12 supplementation decreased incidences of early pregnancy failure and increased litter size in early parity sows, while betaine increased litter size in older parity sows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3abetaine 3ablood 3adiet 3aestrus 3afarrowing 3afolic acid 3ahomocysteine 3alandraces 3alitter size 3apiglets 3apregnancy outcome 3asows 3avitamin B121 aSmits, R.

Specific and economic methodologies for HPV typing are crucial in cancer diagnosis and further disease control. However, routine assays based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or DNA-chip hybridization are either incapable of offering detailed subtype information or involve tedious open-tube operations with the risk of cross-contamination from PCR amplicons. Herein, we proposed a multiplex visualized closed-tube PCR (Multi-Vision) for HPV typing. Using gold nanoparticle probes (AuNPs) as a color change indicator combined with a Hamming distance 2 coding scheme, 13 high-risk HPVs and two subtypes associated with high-incidence benign lesions were successfully typed by performing six closed-tube PCRs. The assay demonstrates high specificity with no cross-reaction among different subtypes under several artificial sample concentrations (from 10⁰ to 10³ copies per reaction) and enables highly sensitive detection of as low as 0.5 copies/μL. Further, 105 clinical samples were successfully analyzed using our method with a high concordance rate of 99.05% (104/105) compared to a HPV typing kit. The inconsistent sample was confirmed by sequencing to be consistent with the typing results determined by our method, indicating that Multi-Vision could be a useful tool for HPV detection, especially in resource-limited regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA microarrays 3aanalytical chemistry 3acolor 3across contamination 3across reaction 3adeath 3adisease control 3ahybridization 3ananogold 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aSheng, Nan1 aWang, Runyuan1 aLiang, Shuo1 aWang, Chen1 aBai, Xue1 aZhou, Guohua1 aZou, Bingjie1 aSong, Qinxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3452-63960 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 23, v. 93, no. 13 p.5529-5536dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c000353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016600173300001600339500001500355520220200370592002802572650001002600650002402610650001002634650001702644650001702661650001202678650001602690650002002706650002002726650001402746650001302760650001202773650001502785650002202800650001802822650001502840650001902855650001502874650002102889650002402910650001702934650001202951651000902963653003502972653001103007653002803018653002203046653002103068653002203089773008603111856008503197852000903282655001203291IND60561229920221119180643.0190403e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056122992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2017.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVahedi, Ali Asghar10aMonitoring soil carbon pool in the Hyrcanian coastal plain forest of Iran: Artificial neural network application in comparison with developing traditional models  ap. 182-189.  a2019-12-06  aIran is categorized under Low Forest Cover Countries and the Nour Forest Park is the largest coastal plain forest in the country. As forest soils contain higher carbon than plant biomass and play a key role in the global carbon cycle, this study aimed to assess highly accurately usable models for monitoring soil organic carbon (SOC) based on plant- species diversity in the forest. For measuring plant-species diversity indices and taking soil samples at two depths (0–20 and 20–40cm), a total of 75 plots based on a randomized complete block (RCB) design which included three naturally different stand types were outlined in the forest. Traditional models based on multiple linear regression and curve estimation regression analyses, and artificial neural network (ANN) type of multi-layer perception on the basis of back-propagation training algorithm were used for predicting the SOC. According to the Pearson's correlation, the traditional functions and ANN models including Abundance and evenness (J′) of herbs layer, and dominance (D) of trees layer, Abundance andJ′of herbs layer in turns were developed for predicting the SOC in the soil top and subsoil layer. The findings showed that the power-law models based on validation parameters among the traditional models were the best predictors for SOC in the different soil layers. Designing the topology of each model in the ANN on the basis of training algorithm and testing data set indicated that the best architectures in the optimum models in turns were composed of one hidden layer with 15 neurons including tangent sigmoid function (A3) for predicting the SOC in the soil organic layer, and two hidden layers with 35 neurons in each layer including the same function (A6) for predicting the subsoil (mineral) layer. Also, the optimum models in the ANN including A3 (R2=0.87,RMSE%=8.17) and A6 (R2=0.93,RMSE%=3.73), in comparison with the traditional models, predicted the SOC with a higher accuracy. Since the optimum models in the ANN predicted the response values with the highest accuracy and without major concerns for statistical issues and uncertainty, the ANN technique is suggested for monitoring SOC in the forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aherbs 3asoil organic carbon 3atrees 3acarbon sinks 3aforest soils 3aforests 3auncertainty 3aneural networks 3adata collection 3aphytomass 3atopology 3aneurons 3amonitoring 3aspecies diversity 3asoil sampling 3aalgorithms 3acoastal plains 3aprediction 3aorganic horizons 3aregression analysis 3acarbon cycle 3atopsoil 3aIran 0aArtificial intelligence system 0acarbon 0aPlant species diversity 0aRegression models 0aNour Forest Park 0aSoil carbon stock0 tCatena.g2017 May, v. 152 p.182-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007100140245010100211300001600312500001900328500002000347520199800367592002802365596007402393650001002467650001202477650001102489650001802500650001102518650000902529650001502538650001302553650001402566650002802580651001302608700002402621773012602645856007402771852000902845655001202854IND60720131620221123042819.0201209e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072013162DNAL7 a10.1111/avsc.125042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakeman, R.

Which habitats are sensitive to management changes? LOCATION: Mosaic of open upland habitats, including Agrostis–Festucaand Nardus grasslands, Carex and Molinia mires, bracken and wet heath, southern Highlands of Scotland, UK. METHODS: Four grazing treatments were started in 2002: (a) Continued grazing at 0.9 ewe/ha (control); (2) High — 2.7 ewe/ha; (c) Mixed — partial substitution of sheep by cattle; and (d) None. Vegetation was sampled at 25 permanently marked locations per plot every three years. Analysis assessed how grazing affected community‐weighted means of selected traits at the whole plot level and community level. RESULTS: Whole plot level changes in trait means were negligible apart from a small reduction in height in the High and Mixed treatments and a shift to earlier flowering in the High treatment. At the community level, increased grazing generally led to a reduction in canopy height and earlier flowering. Both increased and reduced grazing reduced leaf dry matter content (LDMC) in the most preferred community, Agrostis–Festucagrassland, but reduced grazing increased LDMC in the least preferred community, wet heath. Cattle grazing reduced LDMC in both Agrostis–Festucagrassland and wet heath and reduced height in bracken. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant changes in grazing there were only small changes in trait means over 15 years. The most preferred communities were less sensitive to grazing removal than expected; few species present can take advantage of reduced grazing. The least preferred communities were more sensitive to grazing removal than expected; they still contain species capable of exploiting this. The presence of more preferred communities in each plot meant increased grazing has less impact on communities of moderate and low preference. Cattle impacts were highest in the communities most sensitive to trampling, bracken and wet heath.  aPublisher supplied data  aWP1.3cRural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division 3aCarex 3aMolinia 3aNardus 3acanopy height 3acattle 3aewes 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3aleaf dry matter content 3aScotland1 aFielding, Debbie A.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2020 Oct., v. 23, no. 4 p.539-550dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58701x1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.125043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011100177300001400288520155000302592002801852650001501880650001301895650001701908650001301925650002001938650002201958650003001980650002102010653001002031653003002041653002702071653004402098653003802142653002102180653001602201653001902217653002202236700002902258700002202287700005602309773010402365856008702469852000902556655001202565IND60553137920221118022907.0180830e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055313792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Roux, Anabel-Lise10aKinetics characterization of c-Src binding to lipid membranes: Switching from labile to persistent binding  ap. 17-25.  aCell signaling by the c-Src proto-oncogen requires the attachment of the protein to the inner side of the plasma membrane through the myristoylated N-terminal region, known as the SH4 domain. Additional binding regions of lower affinity are located in the neighbor intrinsically disordered Unique domain and the structured SH3 domain. Here we present a surface plasmon resonance study of the binding of a myristoylated protein including the SH4, Unique and SH3 domains of c-Src to immobilized liposomes. Two distinct binding processes were observed: a fast and a slow one. The second process lead to a persistently bound form (PB) with a slower binding and a much slower dissociation rate than the first one. The association and dissociation of the PB form could be detected using an anti-SH4 antibody. The kinetic analysis revealed that binding of the PB form follows a second order rate law suggesting that it involves the formation of c-Src dimers on the membrane surface. A kinetically equivalent PB form is observed in a myristoylated peptide containing only the SH4 domain but not in a construct including the three domains but with a 12-carbon lauroyl substituent instead of the 14-carbon myristoyl group. The PB form is observed with neutral lipids but its population increases when the immobilized liposomes contain negatively charged lipids. We suggest that the PB form may represent the active signaling form of c-Src while the labile form provides the capacity for fast 2D search of the target signaling site on the membrane surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3acolloids 3adissociation 3akinetics 3aplasma membrane 3apopulation growth 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atriacylglycerols 0ac-Src 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aMyristoylated proteins 0aIntrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) 0aProtein dimerization on membranes 0aAntibody capture 0aSH4 domains 0aCell signaling 0ac-Src trafficking1 aBusquets, Maria Antònia1 aSagués, Francesc1 aPons, Miquel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0586-83220 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 138 p.17-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01647naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245011800196300001800314520054700332592002800879650002700907650002200934650001200956650001300968650002200981650001701003650001101020700001701031700001801048700001801066773014201084856007401226852000901300655001201309IND60642395020221117104820.0190507e20160316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064239502DNAL7 a10.1039/c5tb02628h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWuThese authors have equal contributions., Zhisheng10aN-dots as a photoluminescent probe for the rapid and selective detection of Hg²⁺ and Ag⁺ in aqueous solution  ap. 2086-2089.  aGreen fluorescent nitrogen-rich quantum dots (N-dots) have been synthesized under mild conditions (50 °C in methanol) and applied as a turn-off chemosensor for the rapid and selective detection of Hg²⁺ and Ag⁺ in aqueous solutions.

Two Finnish provenances, northern and southern, as well as German and Hungarian provenances were included. Timing of tracheid formation and differentiation, and tracheid dimensions were determined from periodically extracted microcores. The aim was to determine the differences between the years and provenances in the timing of the xylogenesis and in the xylem characteristics. Year-to-year variation was high both in timing of tracheid formation and xylem characteristics, while between-provenance differences were small. The onset of tracheid formation varied from early May to late June in different trees in different years. The onset of tracheid formation was not closely related to the annual variations of temperature sum. In all the years, daily temperatures exceeded the threshold +5°C for several weeks before the onset of tracheid formation. The highest tracheid formation rate occurred after the summer solstice in all years and generally coincided with the highest daily temperatures during the growing season. Tracheid production ceased early in 2006 due to a mid-summer drought. Cell differentiation continued late in autumn as non-mature tracheids were still observed around mid-September. No clear differences between the provenances in the timing of tracheid formation were observed, although the Finnish provenances tended to initiate tracheid formation slightly earlier than the other provenances. The tree-ring widths of the Finnish provenances were also wider, while tracheid diameter of the German provenance was slightly smaller. Our results indicate that between-tree variation in the timing of wood formation is high compared with the latitude effect of seed source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aautumn 3acell differentiation 3adrought 3agrowing season 3alatitude 3aprovenance 3asummer 3atemperature 3atracheids 3atrees 3awood 3aFinland1 aReza, Mehedi1 aJyske, Tuula1 aMäkinen, Harri1 aNöjd, Pekka0 tTrees.g2012 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.543-555dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-011-0616-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007200140245013900212300001600351500001900367500002000386520204600406592002802452596004602480650002602526650002702552650001102579650001902590650002402609650001102633650001202644650001502656651001102671700007102682700006602753700007002819773012602889856007403015852000903089655001203098IND60720131820221123043750.0201209e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072013182DNAL7 a10.1111/avsc.125082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZermeño‐Hernández, Isela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3180-413810aImpact of adjacent land use on the ecological condition of riparian habitats: The relation between condition and vegetation properties  ap. 610-621.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQUESTIONS: The ecological condition of riparian habitats has been negatively altered by human activities and land‐use changes. The aims of this study were to evaluate: (a) how adjacent land use affects the ecological condition of riparian habitats; and (b) whether the ecological condition relates to riparian vegetation properties (i.e., structure, diversity, and species composition). LOCATION: Watershed of the Duero River, in the state of Michoacán, Mexico. METHODS: Sampling sites were established along the Duero River riverbank by considering three different land uses (i.e., native forest, agriculture, and urban). At each site, we assessed the ecological condition of riparian habitats with a riparian condition index (RCI) composed of six subindices, with 17 indicators. Using a survey of woody plants (DBH ≥ 2.5 cm) in 12 different 0.1‐ha sites, we assessed vegetation properties. RESULTS: According to the RCI, 76% of the studied riparian habitats had a very poor ecological condition, and only one site scored an excellent condition. The values of all subindices as well as the RCI were significantly greater in the forest than in the agricultural or urban land uses. The significant relationships between the RCI and its components (subindices) with vegetation properties were all positive and explained between 22% and 73% of the variation in structural and diversity attributes, and between 48% and 66% in floristic composition. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows how human land‐use activities affect the ecological condition of riparian habitats and hence riparian forests. Overall, the RCI had a high predictive power for the vegetation properties of riparian forests. This information is critical for programs involved in the management, conservation, and ecological restoration of riparian habitats. Low‐cost and time‐efficient indices, such as the RCI, facilitate ecological condition assessments of riparian habitats not only by scientists but also by previously trained land managers and the general public.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Estatal de la Fresa de Michoacán 3abotanical composition 3aecological restoration 3ahumans 3ariparian areas 3ariparian vegetation 3arivers 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3aMexico1 aBenítez‐Malvido, Julieta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6180-16511 aSuazo‐Ortuño, Ireri1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9893-56291 aMéndez‐Toribio, Moisés1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8568-80720 tApplied vegetation science.g2020 Oct., v. 23, no. 4 p.610-621dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58701x1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.125083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245019200173520153200365592002801897650004401925650001601969650002201985650001302007650001702020650001902037650001902056650000702075650001902082650001502101650002802116650002002144650001302164650001302177650001502190653001402205653000902219653001702228653002002245700005702265700001902322700002002341700002002361700002102381700002002402700006102422700001902483773009102502856009002593852000902683655001202692IND60751828620221119231146.0220307e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075182862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1323312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Noor S.10aEnhanced solar light photocatalytic performance of Fe-ZnO in the presence of H2O2, S2O82−, and HSO5− for degradation of chlorpyrifos from agricultural wastes: Toxicities investigation  aThis study reported Fe doped zinc oxide (Fe-ZnO) synthesis to degrade chlorpyrifos (CPY), a highly toxic organophosphate pesticide and important sources of agricultural wastes. Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic analyses showed successful formation of the Fe-ZnO with highly crystalline and amorphous nature. Water collected from agricultural wastes were treated with Fe-ZnO and the results showed 67% degradation of CPY by Fe-ZnO versus 39% by ZnO at 140 min treatment time. Detail mechanism involving reactive oxygen species production from solar light activated Fe-ZnO and their role in degradation of CPY was assessed. Use of H₂O₂, peroxydisulfate (S₂O₈²⁻) and peroxymonosulfate (HSO₅⁻) with Fe-ZnO under solar irradiation promoted removal of CPY. The peroxides yielded hydroxyl (OH) and sulfate radical (▪) under solar irradiation mediated by Fe-ZnO. Effects of several parameters including concentration of pollutant and oxidants, pH, co-existing ions, and presence of natural organic matter on CPY degradation were studied. Among peroxides, HSO₅⁻ revealed to provide better performance. The prepared Fe-ZnO showed high reusability and greater mineralization of CPY. The GC-MS analysis showed degradation of CPY resulted into several transformation products (TPs). Toxicity analysis of CPY as well as its TPs was performed and the formation of non-toxic acetate imply greater capability of the treatment technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetates 3achlorpyrifos 3amineralization 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3areactive oxygen species 3asolar radiation 3asulfates 3atoxicity 3azinc oxide 0aPeroxides 0aIron 0aEcotoxicties 0aWaste treatment1 aIqbal, Jibran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0140-26611 aSayed, Murtaza1 aGhfar, Ayman A.1 aKhan, Javed Ali1 aKhan, Zia Ul Haq1 aMurtaza, Behzad1 aBoczkaj, Grzegorz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5874-75911 aJamil, Farrukh0 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 287 p.132331-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1323313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008100168300001800249520110700267592002801374650001701402650001601419650001601435650001701451650001301468650000901481650001801490650001801508653001401526653002401540653002001564653002001584653002801604700001701632700001501649700005801664773011001722856008601832852000901918655001201927IND60553138320221118022828.0170713e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055313832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Jianjun10aEffect of particle size in a colloidal hydrogel scaffold for 3D cell culture  ap. 1139-1147.  aThe in situ-forming colloidal hydrogels from the thermal gelation of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel dispersions have been exploited for 3D cell culture. The properties of the hydrogel scaffold need to be tuned to further improve its performance. In addition, cellular uptake of the microgel particles need to be reduced to avoid their potential undesired influence. For these purposes we systematically examined the effect of microgel particle size on the hydrogel scaffold. It was found that gel properties could be tuned via changing particle size. Increasing particle size reduces the gel strength and its syneresis degree, both of which are favorable for cell growth. Meanwhile increasing particle size could also reduce significantly the cellular uptake of the microgel particles. Microgel with a size of ∼162nm shows the highest cellular uptake, beyond which cellular uptake decreases with increasing particle size. Hydrogel scaffold from 300nm microgel, with suitable physical properties and reduced cellular uptake, were successfully used for multicellular spheroid generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell culture 3acell growth 3adispersions 3agel strength 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3aparticle size 0aMicrogels 0aColloidal hydrogels 0aCellular uptake 0a3D cell culture 0aMulticellular spheroids1 aZhao, Yening1 aGuan, Ying1 aZhang, Yongjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1079-41370 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 136 p.1139-1147dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012900161300001600290500001500306520165800321592002801979650002202007650001802029650001802047650001002065650001402075650001002089650002102099650002502120650002602145650002602171650002302197650002202220650001702242650001502259650002402274650001502298650001802313650002602331650001202357650001702369650001302386653001002399700001902409700001902428700001702447700001702464700001702481700001702498700001802515773012002533856008102653852000902734655001202743IND60132876520221120191624.0150513e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013287652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-015-1842-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Nan10aSediment prokaryote communities in different sites of eutrophic Lake Taihu and their interactions with environmental factors  ap. 883-896.  a2019-12-04  aTo investigate the temporal variation of the sediment prokaryote communities and their relation with the rapid increase of algae population in Taihu, a shallow eutrophic freshwater Lake, water and surface sediments were sampled from seven sites in different stages of algal bloom. The physicochemical characterization revealed positive correlations among the nutrient (N, P) parameters in the water and sediments, as well as TN/TP ratio 30.79 in average in water and 0.13 in sediments, demonstrating that P content was the limit factor for bloom in Taihu and sediment was an important nutrient resource for the water body. T-RFLP analysis of 16S rRNA genes revealed a diversity decrease of sediment prokaryotic communities along the bloom. The bacterial communities in sediments were more sensitive and shaped by the temporal changes, while archaea were more sensitive to the trophic level. The pyrosequencing data showed clear spatial and temporal changes in diversity of sediment bacteria. Betaproteobacteria was the most abundant group in all the samples, following by Delta-, Gama- and Alpha-proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi etc. At the genus level, Thiobacillus and Sulfuricurvum were the most dominant groups in the sediments, and the increase of Thiobacillus abundance in February might be used as bioindicator for the subsequent bloom. In addition, NO₃⁻-N was evidenced to be the main factor to regulate the bacterial community structure in the sediments. These results offered some novel and important data for the evaluation and predict the algal bloom in Taihu and can be reference for other shallow fresh water lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribosomal RNA 3aAcidobacteria 3agenes 3asediments 3alakes 3anitrate nitrogen 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3atrophic relationships 3atemporal variation 3asequence analysis 3aalgal blooms 3afreshwater 3acommunity structure 3abody water 3abiotechnology 3aenvironmental factors 3aArchaea 3aThiobacillus 3abacteria 0aAlgae1 aYang, Jin-Shui1 aQu, Jiang-Hang1 aLi, Haifeng,1 aLiu, Wei-Jie1 aLi, Bao-Zhen1 aWang, En Tao1 aYuan, Hong-Li0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2015 June, v. 31, no. 6 p.883-896dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1842-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002300138245006100161300001600222520097600238592002801214650000801242650004301250650002301293650001301316650001201329650001001341650002001351650002201371650001001393650004001403651001501443700001901458700002101477700002001498700002501518773010701543856007401650852000901724655001201733IND4473332320221120110409.0160903e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447333232DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027721562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumbusch, Lars O.10aEfficient protocols for CAPS-based mapping inArabidopsis  ap. 137-149.  aPositional cloning continues to be an essential method for gene identification and characterisation. The introduction of PCR-based techniques such as Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), Simple Sequence Length Polymorphisms (SSLP) and Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequences (CAPS) has greatly increased the efficiency of gene mapping in arabidopsis. To develop the CAPS marker approach further, we have altered several critical mapping parameters. Efficiency was improved by using a small volume of dry seed for DNA extraction instead of the commonly used vegetative tissue. Reproducibility of PCR reactions was enhanced by faster and reduced protocols for PCR and restriction enzyme digestion and optimisation of PCR conditions for over 50 CAPS primer pairs. Finally, the density of genetic markers was increased by providing polymorphic information for all CAPS markers in arabidopsis ecotypes Wassilewskija (Ws), Columbia (Col) and Cape Verde Islands (Cvi).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3achromosome mapping 3aecotypes 3aenzymes 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3amolecular cloning 3aseeds 3asimple sequence length polymorphism 3aCape Verde1 aSundal, Ina K.1 aHughes, D.

Herein, a nonenzymatic electrochemical sensor with ratiometric signal output was developed for an in vivo analysis of O₂•– in the rat brain. Diphenylphosphonate-2-naphthol ester (ND) was designed and synthesized as a specific recognition molecule for the selective determination of O₂•–. An anodic peak ascribed to the oxidation of 2-naphthol was generated via the nucleophilic substitution between ND and O₂•– and was increased with the increasing concentration of O₂•–. Meanwhile, the inner reference of methylene blue (MB) was co-assembled at the electrode surface to enhance the determination accuracy of O₂•–. The anodic peak current ratio between 2-naphthol and MB exhibited a good linear relationship with the concentration of O₂•– from 2 to 200 μM. Because of the stable molecule character of ND and its specific reaction with O₂•–, the developed electrochemical sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity toward various potential interferences in the brain and good stability even after storage for 7 days. Accordingly, the present electrochemical sensor with high selectivity, high stability, and high accuracy was successfully exploited in monitoring the levels of O₂•– in the rat brain and that of the diabetic model followed by cerebral ischemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-naphthol 3aLewis bases 3aanalytical chemistry 3abrain 3aelectrodes 3aischemia 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3aoxidation 3arats 3asensors (equipment) 3asuperoxide anion1 aZhang, Limin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9866-08291 aDai, Liyi1 aWang, Yuanyuan1 aTian, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8850-03490 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 24, v. 93, no. 13 p.5570-5576dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c001513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245007400200300001600274500001900290500002000309520229300329592002802622596005402650650002002704650002102724650001902745651001902764651001802783651001602801700006502817700005802882700006002940700006603000700005903066773012603125856007403251852000903325655001203334IND60720132020221123043700.0201209e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072013202DNAL7 a10.1111/avsc.125102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTichý, Lubomír1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8400-774110aOptimal transformation of species cover for vegetation classification  ap. 710-717.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: Vegetation‐plot sampling usually involves estimating species cover. For classifying plots to vegetation types, covers are often transformed to decrease the effect of dominant species. However, it remains unclear which transformation is optimal. We suggest that for vegetation classification, optimal is such transformation that contributes to creating clusters of plots in an unsupervised classification that are most similar to the widely accepted vegetation types, e.g., phytosociological associations. Here our aim is to find and recommend such optimal transformation by testing a range of transformation options against the national vegetation classifications of three European countries. LOCATION: Czech Republic, The Netherlands, Great Britain. METHODS: Three national datasets of vegetation plots with species cover information, classified to associations or community types of the respective national vegetation classification systems, were analysed. From each dataset, multiple subsets of plots were selected randomly, each subset representing a vegetation‐plot table containing several similar associations/community types. Species cover values in these subsets were subjected to various transformations (power transformation, logarithmic transformation and pseudo‐species cut levels). Then each subset was classified by an agglomerative classification method (beta‐flexible clustering with different beta values), and the classification was compared with the units of the national vegetation classification using the adjusted Rand index. RESULTS: Power transformations of percentage covers with an exponent between 0.3 and 0.6 produced the best match between the unsupervised classifications and the national vegetation classifications. This result did not depend on the classification method used. A similar degree of matching was achieved with some cut levels of pseudo‐species and with logarithmic transformation of percentage cover. CONCLUSIONS: If an unsupervised classification of vegetation plots aims at defining vegetation types that are close to the phytosociological associations accepted in national vegetation classifications, the best transformation is close to the square‐root of percentage cover (i.e., power transformation with exponent 0.5).  aPublisher supplied data  a19‐28491XcGrantová Agentura České Republiky 3adata collection 3adominant species 3aphytosociology 3aCzech Republic 3aGreat Britain 3aNetherlands1 aHennekens, Stephan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1221-03231 aNovák, Pavel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3758-57571 aRodwell, John S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7790-30891 aSchaminée, Joop H.

Mushroom weight loss, firmness, total soluble solids, total sugar, reducing sugar, ascorbic acid, and microbial and sensory quality were measured. Mushroom coated with gum arabic+natamycin (GANA) maintained tissue firmness and showed reduction in microbial counts from yeasts and moulds compared with the control. In addition, GANA coating also delayed changes in the soluble solids concentration, total sugar and ascorbic acid. Sensory evaluation proved the efficacy of GANA coating by maintaining the overall quality of shiitake mushroom during the storage period. The efficiency was better than that of GA or NA treatment alone. Our study suggests that GANA has the potential to improve the quality of shiitake mushroom and extend its shelf-life up to 16d.  aPublisher supplied data 3anatamycin 3ashelf life 3asensory evaluation 3acoatings 3areducing sugars 3atotal soluble solids 3amicrobiological quality 3ayeasts 3agum arabic 3astorage time 3aLentinula edodes 3afirmness 3amushrooms 3aweight loss 3aascorbic acid 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFood Storage 2aFungixdrug effects 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aGum Arabicxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aNatamycinxpharmacology 2aShiitake Mushroomsxchemistry 2aTaste 2aVegetablesxchemistryxmicrobiology. 0aPostharvest quality 0aGum arabic 0aMicrobiological quality 0aNatamycin 0asoluble solids 0aShiitake mushroom1 aFeng, Lifang1 aZheng, Xiaolin1 aLi, Jianrong0 tFood chemistry.g2013 June 01, v. 138, no. 2-3 p.1992-1997dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.11.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007800162300001600240520113300256592002801389650002501417650001701442650002501459650002301484650002201507650001201529651001101541651001001552651001801562773011801580856004801698852000901746655001201755IND50071559020221118110100.0140103e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007155902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-013-9469-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoki, Misa10aMotivations for organic farming in tourist regions: a case study in Nepal  ap. 181-193.  aAn increasing number of individuals and businesses involved in the tourism industry have begun activities related to organic farming and organic agro-products not only in Europe and North America but also in developing countries in Asia. Both organic farming and rural tourism are considered important to socially and economically sustainable rural development. The influences on the establishment of or conversion to organic farming have been much discussed in Europe but not in developing countries. This study focuses on Nepal, where small-scale organic farming occurs in tourism areas, and qualitatively reveals the motivations for organic farming and other factors related to its adoption. It was found that the reasons for introducing organic farming practices varied with the timing of their adoption. Additionally, the kinds of organic-related activities adopted varied depending on how the individual adopter first encountered the term “organic farming.” However, all individuals involved in organic farming shared some common motivations, such as desires for personal health, quality produce and rural development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3adeveloping countries 3aorganic production 3arural development 3atourism 3aEurope 3aNepal 3aNorth America0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2014 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.181-193dSpringer-Verlagx1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-013-9469-6  aDNAL 7aarticle04946naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100005400193245014100247300001600388506007600404506003100480520237600511592002802887596006902915596008302984596008803067596006403155596003503219506003703254650002303291650001103314650002103325650002703346650001603373650001803389650002003407650002603427650001603453650002603469650002303495650001903518650001703537650001303554650001503567650001503582650002003597650002403617650003303641650002303674650001003697653002203707653001803729653002003747653003003767653002903797653003403826700002303860700001503883700005703898700001503955700006203970773010904032856008604141852000904227655001204236IND60645424720221207074647.0190916e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064542472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.05.0172chorus7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lidong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5420-260X10aPhysical, biochemical, and microbial controls on amino sugar accumulation in soils under long-term cover cropping and no-tillage farming  ap. 369-378.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aUnderstanding the processes controlling amino sugar accumulation in soil is essential for predicting the contribution of microbial residues to soil organic matter (SOM). The accumulation of amino sugars in soil is affected by multiple factors. Seldom are those factors examined together. We measured amino sugar concentration, extracellular enzyme activity, microbial respiration rate, and soil aggregate composition in an agricultural soil under 33-years of conservation management. The accumulation patterns of different amino sugars under the effects of no-tillage farming and cover cropping were compared and contrasted. The relative importance of physical, biochemical, and microbial controls of amino sugar accumulation was quantified using structural equation modelling. Our results show that although different types of amino sugars exhibited similar accumulation patterns in soil, their stabilization mechanisms might vary as demonstrated by structural equation models. The structural equation models indicate that macroaggregates had the largest total effect (0.59, P < 0.05) on muramic acid, and microbial respiration rate and wheat cover crops had large total effects (0.50 and −0.48 respectively, P < 0.05) on glucosamine. These results suggest that physical protection of soil aggregates played a critical role in muramic acid stabilization in soil, while microbial activity and nutrient condition were more critical for glucosamine. We also observed 24%–35% of decreases in soil amino sugars when nitrogen (N) was scarce and carbon (C) was excessive, concomitant with increases of extracellular enzyme activities. These results may support the theoretical model of microbial N mining. Structural equation model indicates that β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) had a negative effect on total amino sugars (−0.41, P < 0.05) and soil N had a negative effect on NAG (−0.27, P < 0.05). These results suggest that amino sugars can be decomposed by NAG as an alternative N source for microbes when readily available N was low. Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) had a positive total effect on total amino sugars and a negative total effect on NAG (0.26 and −0.26 respectively, P < 0.05). This indicates that decomposition of amino acids by LAP may be a preferred strategy prior to decomposition of amino sugars by NAG to meet N requisition.  aPublisher supplied data  cChina Scholarship Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004543  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  cUniversity of Tennesseedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007135  cChinese Government Scholarship0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural soils 3acarbon 3acell respiration 3aconservation practices 3acover crops 3acrop rotation 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3aglucosamine 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3amicrobial activity 3amicroorganisms 3amuramic acid 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3aprediction 3asoil aggregates 3asoil organic matter 3astructural equation modeling 3atheoretical models 3awheat 0aSoil amino sugars 0aSoil nitrogen 0aSoil aggregates 0aMicrobial nitrogen mining 0aConservation agriculture 0aStructural equation modelling1 aWilson, Candace B.1 aHe, Hongbo1 aZhang, Xudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7386-12481 aZhou, Feng1 aSchaeffer, Sean M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9684-29520 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2019 Aug., v. 135 p.369-378dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010800169300001600277520107300293592002801366650000901394650002301403650001801426650001301444650001901457650001201476650001401488653001801502653002701520653002601547653002501573653003301598700002501631700001501656700002301671700001701694773013501711856008701846852000901933655001201942IND60790487520221123014426.0220830e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079048752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.08.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuwei10aMulti-scale structures and physicochemical properties of waxy starches from different botanical origins  ap. 692-702.  aThe multi-scale structures and physicochemical relationships of three different types of waxy starches (maize, tapioca, and potato) were investigated. The maize and tapioca starches exhibited A-type crystalline polymorph compared to potato starch (B-type). The WMS showed higher amorphous content (5.56 %) than other waxy starches. The WTS exhibited a low tendency of retrogradation with its high fₐ (DP 6–12) and low fb₃ (DP ≥ 37) proportion of chains. Double helix content of WPS was observed highest with a high pasting viscosity (952.3 BU). Low fₐ (DP 6–12) and high fb₃ (DP ≥ 37) chain proportions of the WPS retrograded easily. The compactness of the semi-crystalline aggregation structure influenced the retrogradation properties of waxy starches with a positive correlation. Furthermore, the peak viscosity of pastes was correlated with the proportion of fb₃ (DP ≥ 37) chains, mass fractal dimension, and double helix content. The results provide guidance to design the application of waxy starches in the production of clean-labels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3afractal dimensions 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3aretrogradation 3atapioca 3aviscosity 0aWaxy starches 0aMulti-scale structures 0aFunctional properties 0aCorrelation analysis 0aPhysicochemical relationship1 aJunejo, Shahid Ahmed1 aZhang, Bin1 aFuehrer, Bernhard,1 aHuang, Qiang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 220 p.692-702dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.08.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009600176300001800272520102800290592002801318650002301346650002501369650001901394650002301413650001601436650002501452650001101477650002601488650001501514650001501529650001001544653001901554653002001573653002501593653002601618700002401644700002001668700002801688700002101716700002701737700001901764700002801783773013901811856008501950852000902035655001202044IND60238407720221117232758.0150618e20150917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023840772DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2014.10011412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aḤussain, Ṣābir,10aAbiotic and Biotic Processes Governing the Fate of Phenylurea Herbicides in Soils: A Review  ap. 1947-1998.  aPhenylurea herbicides are world widely used for controlling the development of various broad leaf weeds in cereal crops. Despite their agronomic interest, these herbicides are of environmental concern because they are often detected at concentrations above the threshold concentration imposed by legislation in soil and water worldwide. Understanding the fate of these pollutants is as such of major importance and has been the subject of many scientific studies in the last decades. This review article presents an overview of the abiotic and biotic processes governing the environmental fate of phenylurea herbicides after their application to agricultural fields. More precisely, it highlights the pivotal role of biodegradation in natural attenuation of pesticides in agricultural soils. The recent advances in the microbial aspects of their degradation in the field as well as in pure cultures are presented including metabolic pathways, processes, and factors that control the biodegradation of phenylurea herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3abiochemical pathways 3abiodegradation 3aenvironmental fate 3agrain crops 3alaws and regulations 3aleaves 3aphenylurea herbicides 3apollutants 3asoil water 3aweeds 0abiodegradation 0adegrading genes 0adegradation pathways 0aphenylurea herbicides1 aArshad, Muḥammad,1 aSpringael, Dirk1 aSøRensen, Sebastian R.1 aBending, Gary D.1 aDevers-Lamrani, Marion1 aMaqbool, Zahid1 aMartin-Laurent, Fabrice0 tCritical reviews in environmental science and technology.g2015 Sept. 17, v. 45, no. 18 p.1947-1998dTaylor & Francisx1547-65377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2014.10011413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003200188245006300220300001000283506007600293520205000369592002802419506003702447650002702484650001602511650001202527650001802539650001802557650001802575650002302593650001802616650001702634650000902651650001402660650001302674650002302687650002202710650000902732650001102741650002102752650002702773700002102800773014102821856008102962852000903043655001203052IND60606740920221207092029.0180727e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060674092DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-015-0068-92doi7 aPMC43418672pmcid7 a257226582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez Reñón, Cristian13aAn assessment of the nutritional intake of soccer referees  ap. 8.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: The present study aims to analyze the eating habits and attitudes of a group of soccer referees and linesmen. METHOD: A nutritional study was undertaken of thirty-five soccer referees (aged between 18 and 50) refereeing at different levels, from the Spanish national third division down to the provincial second division. Through the use of a 3-day food diary and 24-hour recall, this study analyzed the intake and distribution of macro- and micro-nutrients and of dietary fiber consumed on different types of day (normal, training, and match days). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in calorie intake related to the three types of day (normal, training, and match days). This was true both of overall amounts (2371.1 kcal, 2479.7 kcal, and 2368.4 kcal, respectively) and amounts per unit of body weight (32.4 kcal/kg, 33.9 kcal/kg, and 32.4 kcal/kg, respectively). In respect of macro-nutrient intake, more specifically carbohydrates, the subjects consumed a diet with an insufficient amount of carbohydrates: 279 g, as against the 371 g (REC1) or 540 g (REC2) recommended according to physical activity levels. Slight increases were observed on game days, but were not statistically significant. Consideration of micro-nutrients showed that the quantities of three vitamins (B6, B12, and C) consumed were above the recommended amounts. However, this was not an issue, since the figures related to water-soluble vitamins. Finally, the amounts of minerals (Ca, Mg, and Fe) and fiber consumed were close to recommended values, regardless of the type of day being considered. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the group of referees investigated consumed a diet that did not have sufficient calories from carbohydrates, in view of their occupation. This poor nutritional status might interfere with the development of their sporting performance and ultimately increase the risk of injury. This implies a need to design and implement a diet and to introduce educational programs on nutrition for these sportspeople.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aattitudes and opinions 3abody weight 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3adietary fiber 3aeating habits 3aeducation programs 3aenergy intake 3afood records 3airon 3amagnesium 3aminerals 3anutritional status 3aphysical activity 3arisk 3asports 3asports nutrition 3awater-soluble vitamins1 aCollado, Pilar S0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2015 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.8-8dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-015-0068-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001800163245010400181300001600285520077200301536011401073592002801187650002801215650002101243650001201264650001601276650001401292650001601306650001001322650001601332650001301348650001401361650001701375650001201392650001701404650003901421650003501460650005701495650001101552651001001563653002601573653003101599653002801630653002001658700003001678700002101708700002301729700002001752700002301772773013201795856008101927852000902008655001202017IND4464880520221119081838.0181016e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446488052DNAL7 a225291382pmid7 a10.1177/10406387124428812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBollo, Enrico10aEndogenous lipid (cholesterol) pneumonia in three captive Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica)  ap. 618-620.  aDuring the years 2009–2011, 7 Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), aged between 2 and 14 years, from the Safaripark of Pombia were referred for necropsy to the Department of Animal Pathology of the University of Turin (Italy).

The findings were consistent with endogenous lipid pneumonia, which was considered an incidental finding of no clinical significance.  aThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera tigris altaica 3aanimal pathology 3aanimals 3acholesterol 3acytoplasm 3agiant cells 3alungs 3amacrophages 3anecropsy 3apneumonia 3auniversities 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Zoo 2aCholesterolxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aHistocytochemistryxveterinary 2aPneumonia, Lipidxmetabolismxpathologyxveterinary. 2aTigers 3aItaly 0aCholesterol pneumonia 0aendogenous lipid pneumonia 0aPanthera tigris altaica 0aSiberian tigers1 aScaglione, Frine Eleonora1 aChiappino, Laura1 aSereno, Alessandra1 aTriberti, Orfeo1 aSchröder, Cathrin0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 24, no. 3 p.618-620dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387124428813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245015000160300002000310520091500330592002801245650001501273650001401288650002401302650001801326650001401344650002301358650001101381650002401392650001601416650002201432650001101454650001901465650002001484700001701504700001701521773012101538856007501659852000901734655001201743IND60550068420221117160528.0160909e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055006842DNAL7 a10.1021/jo401445j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamanta, Suvendu10aPhotocatalysis by 3,6-Disubstituted-s-Tetrazine: Visible-Light Driven Metal-Free Green Synthesis of 2-Substituted Benzimidazole and Benzothiazole  ap. 11184-11193.  as-Tetrazine based molecules were prepared for visible-light-driven organic transformations. The 3,6-di(pyridin-2-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (pytz) derivative shows visible light absorption and reversible one-electron reduction behavior. In the presence of pytz and aerial oxygen, aldehyde reacts with o-phenylenediamine or o-aminothiophenol under visible light irradiation at ambient temperature to produce corresponding 2-substituted benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles, respectively. Pytz catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic activity for alkyl, aryl, organo-metallic substituted aldehydes and reducing sugar. The reaction yield is high for both the electron-donating and electron withdrawing substituents in aromatic aldehydes. The use of a metal-free catalyst and visible light energy, along with the mild reaction conditions, makes this reaction an environmentally benign and energy-saving chemical process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaldehydes 3aambient temperature 3abenzimidazole 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3airradiation 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3areducing sugars1 aDas, Sudipto1 aBiswas, Papu0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 78, no. 22 p.11184-11193dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo401445j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008700168520145900255592002801714650001001742650002201752650001201774650001501786650001401801650002401815650002201839650001601861650001301877650001901890650001901909650003101928650001301959650003701972650001002009653001502019653003402034653002402068653002002092700001502112700001402127700002102141700001802162700001502180700001602195700001202211700001602223700005502239773011702294856008602411852000902497655001202506IND60706615620221123031917.0210415e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070661562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1128402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Beibei10aProperties of Natural Luffa Vine as potential reinforcement for biomass composites  aThe exploration of luffa vine (LV) in the polymer composites field can contribute to the development of lightweight composites and expand their use in new wide scale applications. In this study, the physical and chemical properties and the microstructure of the LV fibers were investigated by various techniques. The results of LV density and microscopic characteristics indicated that this crop is a lightweight (with density mainly concentrated in 0.30–0.45 g cm⁻³) natural fiber with a porous structure (the ratio of wall to lumen: 0.2–0.3). Transmission electron microscopy and nanoindentation analyses showed that the secondary wall of the LV sclerenchyma cell is made up of two layers with spiral thickening and exhibiting a high nanoindentation modulus (7.8–10.4 GPa) and a high nanoindentation hardness (0.40–0.58 GPa). The chemical composition and X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the LV has high lignin content (20–25%) and a relatively high relative crystallinity index of cellulose, which are conducive to increase the hardness of the LV fiber. Moreover, microscopic characteristics analysis also revealed that the LV fiber cells have a relatively high aspect ratio (30.3), there are pit pairs on the LV fiber cell walls, and the core fiber cells of the LV have relatively high flexibility coefficient (0.8), which are beneficial to increase the processability of composite materials with the LV fibers as reinforcement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuffa 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiomass 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acomposite materials 3acrystal structure 3afiber cells 3ahardness 3alignin content 3amicrostructure 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avines 0aLuffa vine 0aMorphological characteristics 0aCell wall structure 0aNanoindentation1 aCheng, Dao1 aGuo, Yong1 aZhai, Shengcheng1 aWang, Chenxin1 aXu, Runmin1 aGuo, Junkui1 aLv, Yan1 aShi, Lanlan1 aChen, Yuxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5566-26050 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 155 p.112840-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1128403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014300157300002000300520053500320592002800855650002300883650001800906650001600924650002200940650002200962650001200984700002800996700002401024700002201048700002201070700002901092773012101121856007501242852000901317655001201326IND60550068520171220000000.0160909e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055006852DNAL7 a10.1021/jo40146452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarber, Elisa10aSilicon Acceleration of a Tandem Alkene Isomerization/Electrocyclic Ring-opening of 2-Methyleneoxetanes to α,β-Unsaturated Methylketones  ap. 11213-11220.  aThe first rearrangement of 2-methyleneoxetanes to α,β-unsaturated methylketones is reported.

Autoigniting, in-cylinder pressure traces are acquired under standard research octane number (RON) conditions. Equivalent, non-autoignitiing traces are obtained by adding a small amount of tetraethyl lead (TEL) to each fuel to suppress knock, and these are used to calibrate a two-zone engine model of autoignition. The simulated autoignition timing of the PRFs without ethanol, TRFs without ethanol, and ethanol/PRF and ethanol/TRF blends are then compared to those measured in the engine. These results suggest that the incorporation of residual NO significantly improves the agreement between simulations and experiment for all cases with no or low ethanol content. Ethanol also appears to suppress the low-temperature activity of n-heptane. Both of these results are consistent with previous, more fundamental studies. However, close agreement between the simulated and measured autoignition timing across all fuel blends is not observed. Thus, the modeling does not comprehensively explain the significant synergism and antagonism observed in a recent study of the octane numbers of these fuels (Foong, T. M.; Morganti, K. J.; Brear, M. J.; da Silva, G.; Yang, Y.; Dryer, F. L. The octane numbers of ethanol blended with gasoline and its surrogates. Fuel 2014, 115, 727−739, DOI: 10.1016/j.fuel.2013.07.105), demonstrating that further research is required. These results also contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting the importance of NO chemistry, which should be included in kinetic simulations that attempt to model autoignition and knock in real engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aethanol 3agasoline 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aoctane 3asynergism 3atoluene1 aBrear, Michael J.1 aMorganti, Kai J.1 ada Silva, Gabriel1 aYang, Yi1 aDryer, F.

The effect of ejection on overall scramjet performance is studied by taking the integration of measures including numerical simulation and stream thrust analysis. Results indicate that the critical backpressure is significantly increased as the ejection total pressure increased, thereby increasing the compression capacity and efficiency, and decreasing the irreversible losses of shock wave and viscous dissipation. For the ejection total pressure of Pt,eje = 2.40–4.00 × 10⁶ Pa, the critical backpressure ratio is quantitatively increased by 1.18–11.8% along with the utilization of ejection mass flow rate of about 88.0–100% overall mass flow rate of methane fuel gas, and simultaneously the total pressure ratio, kinetic efficiency is also increased by 7.32–13.1%, and 1.63–2.96%, respectively, while the dimensionless entropy increase is decreased by 14.5–26.8%. On this basis, the specific thrust, specific impulse, and total efficiency is increased by 2.84–4.69%, 2.80–4.68%, and 2.87–4.70%, respectively, which re-emphasizes that the boundary-layer ejection is an available fluid control method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aentropy 3afuels 3amass flow 3amathematical models 3amethane 3avapors 0aThermodynamics 0aFlow control 0aInlet unstart 0aEjection 0aOverall performance1 aCao, Ruifeng1 aHuang, Hongyan1 aQin, Jiang1 aYu, Daren0 tEnergy.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 121 p.318-330dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.12.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04399naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245019200158300001800350520256500368592002802933650001302961650002102974650001902995650001103014650001903025650001603044650001203060650001503072650000903087650002003096650003803116650001203154650001403166650001803180650001303198650001103211650001403222650001403236650001303250650003203263653001403295653002203309653003603331653001103367653001303378700001503391700001403406700001603420700001503436700001603451700001403467700001703481700001803498700001603516773015303532856007903685852000903764655001203773IND60530865120221117215939.0190318e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053086512DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-101312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, M.10aLongitudinal changes in adipose tissue of dairy cows from late pregnancy to lactation. Part 1: The adipokines apelin and resistin and their relationship to receptors linked with lipolysis  ap. 1549-1559.  aThe transition from pregnancy to lactation is characterized by major changes in glucose and adipose tissue metabolism. Anti- and prolipolytic pathways mediated via the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors 1 (HCAR1) and 2 (HCAR2) and tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1 (TNFR1), as well as the adipokines apelin and resistin, are likely involved in regulating these processes. This study aimed to determine the mRNA abundance of the aforementioned receptors in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, to characterize the adipokine concentrations in serum, and to test the effects of feeding diets with either high or low portions of concentrate and a concomitant niacin supplementation from late gestation to early lactation. Twenty pluriparous German Holstein cows were all kept on the same silage-based diet until d 42 antepartum, when they were allocated to 2 feeding groups: until d 1 antepartum, 10 animals each were assigned to either a high-concentrate (60:40 concentrate-to-roughage ratio) or a low-concentrate diet (30:70). Both groups were further subdivided into a control and a niacin group, the latter receiving 24g/d of nicotinic acid from d −42 until 24. From d 1 to 24 postpartum, the concentrate portion was increased from 30 to 50% for all cows. Biopsies of subcutaneous (SCAT) and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RPAT) were taken at d −42, 1, 21, and 100 relative to parturition. Blood samples were drawn along with the biopsies and on d −14, 3, 7, 14, and 42. The concentrations of the adipokines apelin and resistin in serum were measured via ELISA. The mRNA of the 3 receptors in AT was quantified as well as the protein abundance of HCAR2 by Western blot. The feeding regimen did not affect the variables examined. The concentrations of apelin remained fairly constant during the observation period, whereas the resistin concentrations increased toward parturition and decreased to precalving levels within 1 wk after calving. The mRNA abundance of HCAR1, HCAR2, and TNFR1 changed in SCAT and RPAT during the considered time period. For the HCAR2 protein, time-dependent changes were restricted to SCAT. The mRNA abundance of all receptors was greater in RPAT than in SCAT. The tissue-specific correlations observed between the receptors point to a link between these factors and may indicate different regulatory roles in the respective tissues. This study provides insight into the complex metabolic adaptations during the transition period and supports a differential regulation of lipolysis among SCAT and RPAT in dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aWestern blotting 3aadipose tissue 3abiopsy 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adiet 3aearly lactation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aglucose 3alipolysis 3amessenger RNA 3anecrosis 3aniacin 3apregnancy 3areceptors 3aresistin 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0adairy cow 0atransition period 0ahydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 0aapelin 0aresistin1 aLocher, L.1 aHuber, K.1 aKenéz, Á.1 aRehage, J.1 aTienken, R.1 aMeyer, U.1 aDänicke, S.1 aSauerwein, H.1 aMielenz, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.1549-1559dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-101313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245013100185300001600316520119300332592002801525650002901553650002601582650001501608650001801623650003801641650001601679650005001695650001301745650003001758650001801788651001101806651001101817773009901828856004801927852000901975655001201984IND4475154220221119194205.0120416e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447515422DNAL7 a223503682pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-012-9816-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWibeck, Victoria10aImages of Environmental Management: Competing Metaphors in Focus Group Discussions of Swedish Environmental Quality Objectives  ap. 776-787.  aIn managing environmental problems, several countries have chosen the management by objectives (MBO) approach. This paper investigates how focus group participants from the Swedish environmental administration used metaphors to describe the mode of organization needed to attain environmental objectives. Such analysis can shed light on how an MBO system is perceived by actors and how it works in practice. Although the Swedish government intended to stimulate broad-based cooperation among many actors, participants often saw themselves as located at a certain “level,” i.e., “higher” or “lower,” in the MBO system—that is, their conceptions corresponded to a traditional, hierarchical interpretation of MBO. Prepositions such as “in” and “out” contributed to feelings of inclusion and exclusion on the part of MBO actors. However, horizontal metaphors merged with vertical ones, indicating ongoing competition for the right to interpret how the system of environmental objectives should best be managed. The paper concludes that any organization applying MBO could benefit from discussing alternate ways of talking and thinking about its constituent “levels.”  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental quality 3aobjectives 2aCommunication 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxprevention & control 2aMetaphor 2aOrganizational Objectives 2aPolicy Making 3aSweden 0aSweden0 tEnvironmental management.g2012 Apr., v. 49, no. 4 p.776-787dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-9816-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012800169520129200297592002801589650004401617650002201661650002001683650001101703650002401714650002201738650004401760650001401804650001601818650002201834653002101856653001301877653002701890653002201917653002201939700001401961700001201975700001401987700001602001700001602017700001402033773011402047856008602161852000902247655001202256IND60757230920221117235153.0220531e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075723092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1277832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Tianhang10aDegradation of urea-formaldehyde resin residues by a hydrothermal oxidation method into recyclable small molecular organics  aUrea-formaldehyde (UF) resin residues and the related product wastes as organic hazardous wastes are difficult to be biodegraded or recycled. In this research, a hydrothermal oxidation method using hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) solution has been developed for the degradation and recycling of UF resin residues. The effects of solution concentration, temperature, and time on the degradation efficiency and products of UF resin residues were studied. Under optimal conditions, i.e., 140 °C and 5 wt% H₂O₂ solution, over 75% of UF resin residues was degraded after 3 h. The degradation efficiency is much higher than that of the traditional hydrothermal treatment or acid hydrolysis method. In addition, results from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed that H₂O₂ solution degrades UF resin residues to low molecular compounds, such as alcohols, methylal, and amides. This research provides a novel and high-efficient hydrothermal oxidization process for the degradation of UF resin residues, which might be a promising environmentally friendly and low-cost method for the disposal and recycling of industrial UF resin residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid hydrolysis 3aamides 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3atemperature 3aurea formaldehyde 0aHazardous wastes 0aUF resin 0aHydrothermal treatment 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aHarmless disposal1 aWang, Yan1 aWu, Nan1 aQing, Yan1 aLi, Xingong1 aWu, Yiqiang1 aLiu, Ming0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 426 p.127783-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1277833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01138naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245006900160300001800229520023000247592002800477650002200505650002300527650002300550650001800573700002800591700001900619773012900638856007200767852000900839655001200848IND60657274620221119072302.0190816e20020726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065727462DNAL7 a10.1039/b205220m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerdov, Stanislav12aA rapid method of synthesizing the layered titanosilicate JDF-L1  ap. 1786-1787.  aA rapid procedure for synthesis of highly crystalline and pure samples of JDF-L1 without using organics as reactants or templates is described and indexation of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of this phase is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3arapid methods1 aKostov-Kytin, Vladislav1 aPetrov, Ognyan0 tChemical communications.g2002 July 26, , no. 16 p.1786-1787dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b205220m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013200174300001600306520144400322592002801766650001401794650002501808650001401833650002701847650001401874650001901888650001301907650001201920650001301932651001901945653002501964653002301989653001902012653001902031653002602050700001802076700001802094700002602112773010302138856008602241852000902327655001202336IND60563831820221119185303.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056383182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasconcelos, Joana10aFecundity regulation strategy of the blue jack mackerel, Trachurus picturatus (Bowdich, 1825), off Madeira Island (NE Atlantic)  ap. 150-156.  aThis contribution intends to verify the type of fecundity regulation of the blue jack mackerel. For this purpose, the oocyte development process was analysed. A total of 158 ovaries were sampled between January 2009 and April 2010 from purse-seiners operating in the Madeira Island waters, NE Atlantic Ocean. Histological analysis and visual image analysis system were used to study the four main criteria applied for fecundity type determination: (1) presence of a hiatus between pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes; (2) number of standing stock of advanced vitellogenic oocytes over the spawning season; (3) mean size of standing stock of advanced vitellogenic oocytes over the spawning season; and (4) the incidence of atresia over the spawning season. The analysis of the oocytes size frequency distribution showed that no distinct hiatus could be observed between pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes during the spawning season. Considering the whole spawning period but the last month that was poorly sampled, the number of standing stock of advanced vitellogenic oocytes showed no decrease trend along the spawning season, the mean diameter of cortical alveoli oocytes and of the advanced stock of vitellogenic oocytes did not increase over the spawning season and the relative intensity of atresia was always high throughout this period. These findings suggest the blue jack mackerel displays an indeterminate fecundity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrachurus 3aabnormal development 3afecundity 3afrequency distribution 3ahistology 3aimage analysis 3amackerel 3aoocytes 3aspawning 3aAtlantic Ocean 0aTrachurus picturatus 0ablue jack mackerel 0afecundity type 0aMadeira Island 0aNortheastern Atlantic1 aFaria, Graça1 aFreitas, Rita1 aGordo, Leonel Serrano0 tFisheries research.g2017 June, v. 190 p.150-156dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011000168520125900278592002801537650001401565650002301579650001101602650001401613650001401627653002001641653001501661653002201676653001901698700001701717700001401734700001501748773011401763856008601877852000901963655001201972IND60757231020221117235459.0220531e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075723102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1277842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Huiwang10aUnveiling the role of cobalt species in the Co/N-C catalysts-induced peroxymonosulfate activation process  aIn this study, three Co/N-C catalysts were prepared by pyrolysis of bimetallic zeolitic imidazole frameworks with different Co/Zn ratio, and the critical active Co species in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation was investigated. The three catalysts had distinct cobalt species but similar N configuration and graphitization degree. The Co species were distributed as single atoms (Co SAs) at a Co/Zn molar ratio of 1:8, while Co nanoclusters (Co NCs) and Co nanoparticles (NPs) would be formed with further increase in Co content. The degradation efficiency of BPA did not show correlation with the increasing of Co content in catalyst. Based on the catalytic performance comparison and reactive species detection, Co SAs was identified as active sites, which could interact with PMS to generate ¹O₂ via path of PMS→HOO*→O*→¹O₂. However, the role of NCs and NPs in directly activating PMS was negligible. In addition, the increase of Co content in Co/N-C catalyst would result in mass cobalt leaching, which enhanced the BPA degradation via homogeneous catalytic reactions with Coᴵⱽ as reactive species. It is an effective way to design the Co/N-C catalyst with high catalytic activity and stability via regulating the formation of Co SAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3aimidazole 3apyrolysis 0aCo/N-C catalyst 0aCo species 0aPeroxymonosulfate 0aSinglet oxygen1 aZhou, Wenjun1 aWang, Wei1 aLiu, Zhiqi0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 426 p.127784-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1277843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245005700159300002000216520128500236592002801521650001301549650001201562650002201574650001301596650001401609650001301623650001101636650001401647653003301661653001601694653002701710653003901737700001901776700001801795700001301813700001701826773012601843856008001969852000902049655001202058IND60565934320170710000000.0170329e20170329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056593432DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b163432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetaxa, C.10aInfrared Plasmonics with Conductive Ternary Nitrides  ap. 10825-10834.  aConductive transition metal nitrides are emerging as promising alternative plasmonic materials that are refractory and CMOS-compatible. In this work, we show that ternary transition metal nitrides of the B1 structure and consisting of a combination of group-IVb transition metal, such as Ti or Zr, and group III (Sc, Y, Al) or group II (Mg, Ca) elements can have tunable plasmonic activity in the infrared range in contrast to Ta-based ternary nitrides, which exhibit plasmonic performance in the visible and UV ranges. We consider the intrinsic quality factors of surface plasmon polariton for the ternary nitrides, and we calculate the dispersion of surface plasmon polariton and the field enhancement at the vicinity of nitride/silica interfaces. Based on these calculations, it is shown that among these nitrides the most promising are TiₓSc₁–ₓN and TiₓMg₁–ₓN. In particular, TiₓSc₁–ₓN can have plasmonic activity in the usual telecom bands at 850, 1300, and 1550 nm. Still, these nitrides exhibit substantial electronic losses mostly due to fine crystalline grains that deteriorate the plasmonic field enhancement. This unequivocally calls for improved growth processes that would enable the fabrication of such ternary nitrides of high crystallinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3amagnesium 3anitrides 3asilica 3azirconium 0a1.

There is some information about the phenotypic effects of phytopathogenic bacteria on their insect vectors; however, there are no published reports of the molecular mechanisms underlying phytopathogenic bacteria–insect vector interaction. In order to investigate the effects of CLs infection on B. cockerelli, transcriptomic analyses of CLs-infected and uninfected adult psyllids that were reared on potato were performed. De novo assembly of cDNA sequences generated 136,518 and 109,983 contigs for infected and uninfected insect libraries with an average contig length of 514 bp. BlastX analysis against the NCBI-nr database revealed that 33.33 % had significant matches. Gene ontology data illustrated that the majority of the expressed psyllid genes are involved in metabolic process, biological regulation, binding and catalytic activity. The psyllid transcriptome had an abundance of genes such as vitellogenin, heat shock protein, ejaculatory bulb-specific protein, ferritin, and cytochrome oxidase. Notably absent in the psyllid transcriptome were innate immunity genes induced in response to Gram-negative bacteria (IMD pathway). Several functionally diverse contigs related to symbiotic bacteria including the primary endosymbiont Carsonella ruddii, Wolbachia, and CLs in the psyllid transcriptome were identified. A total of 247 contigs showed differential expression in response to CLs infection including immune and stress-related genes and vitellogenins. Expression analyses of selected psyllid genes were performed on psyllids that were exclusively reared on potato (host of the insects used for RNAseq) and psyllids exclusively reared on tomato (alternative host of psyllids). These genes showed similar expression patterns irrespective of the host plant on which the psyllids were reared, which suggests that host–plant association may not modulate expression of these genes. Our findings suggest that the impact of CLs on psyllid transcriptome was to a large extent on genes involved in metabolic processes and to a small extent on immune and stress response genes. This study is the first description of transcriptomic changes in an insect vector in response to infection with a naturally occurring bacterial plant pathogen. Data from this study provide new sequence and gene expression resources for functional genomics of potato psyllids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactericera cockerelli 3aCandidatus Liberibacter 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aWolbachia 3aadults 3acatalytic activity 3acomplementary DNA 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adatabases 3aferritin 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheat shock proteins 3ahost plants 3aimmunity 3ainsect vectors 3anucleotide sequences 3apests 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apotatoes 3astress response 3atomatoes 3atranscriptome 3azebra chip disease1 aLevy, Julien1 aTamborindeguy, Cecilia0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2012 Oct., v. 287, no. 10 p.803-817dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-012-0713-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245007700217300001600294520170100310592002802011650000902039650001602048650001702064650002002081650001102101650001302112650001502125650001702140650001702157650001502174650001402189650001902203650001502222653001702237653001702254653002102271653001802292653002702310653002402337700006102361700002002422700001902442700002002461700002602481773011902507856008302626852000902709655001202718IND60792124720221120043722.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079212472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2022.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLivingstone, Katherine M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9682-754110aPrecision nutrition: A review of current approaches and future endeavors  ap. 253-264.  aPrecision and personalized nutrition approaches aim to leverage human variability to design tailored dietary interventions to improve health. With an extensive range of technological advances and opportunities for integrative precision nutrition, a review of current and future global trends is needed. The purpose of this review paper is to synthesize and critically appraise the latest developments, potential applications and future research needs in the field of precision nutrition. Selected examples of international studies that implement nutritional genetic, epigenetics, genomics, metabolomics and metagenomics approaches will be reviewed. Precision nutrition integrates genetic, metagenomic, metabolomic, physiopathological, behavioral and sociocultural cues to understand metabolism and human wellbeing and implement health actions. Such wide-ranging measures require advances in 1) high-throughput multi-omics techniques, and 2) integrative big data systems. Over recent decades, research in the fields of nutritional genetic, epigenetics, genomics, metabolomics and metagenomics has accelerated exponentially. These approaches provide deep genotypic and phenotypic insights into human variability in response to diet, which has informed a new era of personalized and precision nutrition interventions. Moreover, advances in big data and machine learning have paved the way for integrated precision nutrition applications across research, industry and healthcare. This review will consider each of these areas in turn, such that the outcomes of this research will assist with understanding the latest developments and future consolidation trends in the field of precision nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3aepigenetics 3afood science 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3aindustry 3ametabolism 3ametabolomics 3ametagenomics 3amultiomics 3aphenotype 3asocial welfare 3atechnology 0aMetabolomics 0aMetagenomics 0aNutriepigenetics 0aNutrigenomics 0aPersonalized nutrition 0aPrecision nutrition1 aRamos-Lopez, Omar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2505-15551 aPérusse, Louis1 aKato, Hisanori1 aOrdovas, J.

Consequences on thermal, mechanical, and water sorption and diffusion properties  ap. 811-824.  aIn this work, three ionic liquids (ILs) differing by the length of the alkyl chain linked to their cation were incorporated in a Pebax® copolymer matrix through a solvent cast process for composition from 0 to 70 wt % IL. The copolymer/IL miscibility was investigated via IR Spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The three ILs dissolved in the copolymer soft phase for ILs content below 30 wt % whereas they formed segregated dispersed domains at higher loadings. The plasticizing effect of the ILs was examined through DSC and thermomechanical analyses. In the range of IL amount from 0 to 30 wt %, no significant differences were observed in the thermomechanical properties as a function of the IL structure. At higher IL content, the films based on 1‐ethyl‐methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate sustained better properties. All films exhibited a good thermal stability up to 300 °C. The water sorption isotherms were modeled with GAB equation and both the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the sorption mechanism were investigated. A non‐monotonic evolution of the GAB parameters and diffusion coefficient as a function of the IL content was evidenced. Moreover, different behaviors were observed as a function of the IL nature and structuration within the copolymer matrix. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym.

The exciplex formed at the organic heterojunction interface of 4,4′,4″-tris(N-3-methyphenyl-N-phenyl-amino) triphenylamine and 9,10-bis(2′-naphthyl) anthracene (ADN) is used to sensitize the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) process on the ADN molecules. This results in a turn-on voltage (2.2 V) of the blue emission from the OLED below the bandgap (2.9 eV). From the transient electroluminescence measurement, blue emission totally came from the TTA process without direct recombination on the ADN molecules. The blue singlet exciton from the TTA process can be quenched by energy transfer to the exciplex, as revealed by transient photoluminescence measurements. This can be prevented by blocking the energy transfer path and improving the radiative recombination rate of blue emission. With the insertion of the “triplet diffusion and singlet blocking (TDSB)” layer and the incorporation of the dopant material, an ESTTA-OLED with external quantum efficiency of 5.1% was achieved, which consists of yellow and blue emission coming from the exciplex and ESTTA process, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthracenes 3achemical elements 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aenergy transfer 3aphotoluminescence 3aquantum mechanics 0aTriplet−triplet annihilation 0aexciplex 0aorganic light-emitting diode 0aenergy transfer 0aupconversion1 aEasley, Connor J.1 aChen, Chia-Hsun1 aTseng, Po-Chen1 aLee, Ming-Zer1 aSher, Pin-Hao1 aWang, Juen-Kai1 aChiu, Tien-Lung1 aLin, Jifeng,1 aBardeen, Christopher J.1 aLee, Jiun-Haw0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 29, v. 9, no. 12 p.10963-10970dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b163973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01215naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245013400164300001800298520021700316592002800533650002300561650002100584650000900605650001200614700002400626700002900650700002300679773013000702856007200832852000900904655001200913IND60657274820221119072204.0190816e20020912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065727482DNAL7 a10.1039/b205233d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Christopher B.10aFormation of a [1 + 1] metallomacrocycle from a heterotritopic ligand containing two terpy and one bipy metal-binding domains  ap. 2068-2069.  aReaction of the heterotritopic ligand L, which contains one bipy and two terpy metal-binding domains linked by a flexible spacer with iron(ii) chloride results in the formation of a [1 + 1] metallomacrocycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aferrous chloride 3airon 3aligands1 aConstable, Edwin C.1 aHousecroft, Catherine E.1 aKariuki, Benson M.0 tChemical communications.g2002 Sept. 12, , no. 18 p.2068-2069dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b205233d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245016300163300001800326520150700344592002801851650002001879650001901899650001501918650002001933650001301953650001501966650001701981650002201998650001002020650001502030650002002045650001202065650001402077650003002091650001402121650002302135650000902158651001002167653002002177653002602197653001802223653002402241653001702265700001602282700001502298700001802313700002202331700001302353773015302366856007902519852000902598655001202607IND60530865320221117215857.0190318e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053086532DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-101472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhihong10aDetection of viable enterotoxin-producing Bacillus cereus and analysis of toxigenicity from ready-to-eat foods and infant formula milk powder by multiplex PCR  ap. 1047-1055.  aBacillus cereus is responsible for several outbreaks of foodborne diseases due to its emetic toxin and enterotoxin. Enterotoxins, cytotoxin K (CytK), nonhemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe), and hemolysin BL (Hbl), have been recorded in several diarrheal cases due to food poisoning from B. cereus. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid and accurate method that combines multiplex PCR with propidium monoazide to selectively detect viable cells of enterotoxin-producing B. cereus in milk powder, noodles, and rice, and investigate the distribution of enterotoxins in 62 strains of B. cereus in Jiangxi province, China. The specificity of primers of 3 enterotoxins (i.e., cytK, nheA, and hblD) of B. cereus was verified by inclusivity and exclusivity tests using single PCR. Upon optimization of multiplex PCR conditions, it was found that the detection limit of viable cells was 102 cfu/mL of B. cereus in pure culture. By enrichment for 3 or 4 h and propidium monoazide pretreatment, a protocol for detection of viable cells as low as 2.2×101 cfu/g in spiked food (e.g., milk powder, noodles, and rice) was established and proved valid even under the interference of non-Bacillus cereus at as high as 105 cfu/g. Moreover, the protocol based on multiplex PCR for detection was applied for the analysis of distribution of toxin gene of B. cereus, and the results showed a regional feature for toxin gene distribution, indicating that potential toxigenicity of B. cereus should be evaluated further.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3acell viability 3acytotoxins 3adetection limit 3adiarrhea 3adried milk 3aenterotoxins 3afoodborne illness 3agenes 3ahemolysins 3ainfant formulas 3anoodles 3apoisoning 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apropidium 3aready-to-eat foods 3arice 3aChina 0aBacillus cereus 0aenterotoxin-producing 0amultiplex PCR 0apropidium monoazide 0atoxigenicity1 aFeng, Lixia1 aXu, Hengyi1 aLiu, Chengwei1 aShah, Nagendra P.1 aWei, Hua0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.1047-1055dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-101473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009300173300001600266520133500282592002801617650002001645650003801665650002601703650001001729650001801739650002601757650001101783650001801794650001501812650001601827700001901843700001901862773009901881856008501980990002302065852000902088655001202097IND60099963120221119041749.0141105e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009996312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElkordy, Amal Ali10aIn situ controlled crystallization as a tool to improve the dissolution of Glibenclamide  ap. 118-120.  aFor pharmaceutical purpose, micro-sized drugs are needed for many delivery systems, such as pulmonary and oral drug delivery systems. Many strategies have been employed to reduce the particle size of poorly water soluble drugs. Microcrystals could be produced by controlled association of drug in order to obtain naturally grown particles. The aim of this work was to increase the aqueous solubility and dissolution of Glibenclamide. The in situ controlled crystallization process was conducted in the presence of the non-ionic surfactants, Cremophor RH40 and Solutol HS-15 (0.75 and 1.5%, w/v), as protective stabilizing agents against agglomeration. In addition, these surfactants inhibit P-glycoprotein that reduces intestinal absorption of Glibenclamide by efflux transportation. Crystal shape was changed and particle size was reduced by about 15-folds, compared to control untreated drug. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) results indicated no interaction between the drug and the stabilizer. Microcrystals showed marked increase in the drug dissolution, Solutol HS-15 at 1.5% (w/v) concentration showing the highest dissolution efficiency. It could be concluded that in situ controlled crystallization using surfactants are promising method to improve dissolution of Glibeclamide as a model poorly water soluble drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aglibenclamide 3aintestinal absorption 3amodels 3aparticle size 3asolubility 3asurfactants1 aJatto, Ayobami1 aEssa, Ebtessam0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 May 30, v. 428, no. 1-2 p.118-120dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.02.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008600165500001900251520143500270592002801705650002601733650002601759650001801785650001601803650001201819650001001831650001701841650002001858650001901878650001701897650001801914650003001932650001101962650002201973650001301995700002002008700002002028700001902048700001902067773011802086856007702204852000902281655001202290IND60738733520221120051301.0210524e20210512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073873352DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100510722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahoro, Patience 10aProtective Effect of Gochujang on Inflammation in a DSS-Induced Colitis Rat Model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGochujang is a traditional Korean fermented soy-based spicy paste made of meju (fermented soybean), red pepper powder, glutinous rice, and salt. This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of Gochujang containing salt in DSS-induced colitis. Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were partitioned into five groups: normal control, DSS control, DSS + salt, DSS + mesalamine, and DSS + Gochujang groups. They were tested for 14 days. Gochujang improved the disease activity index (DAI), colon weight/length ratio, and colon histomorphology, with outcomes similar to results of mesalamine administration. Moreover, Gochujang decreased the serum levels of IL-1β and IL-6 and inhibited TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β mRNA expression in the colon. Gochujang downregulated the expression of iNOS and COX-2 and decreased the activation of NF-κB in the colon. Gochujang induced significant modulation in gut microbiota by significantly increasing the number of Akkermansia muciniphila while decreasing the numbers of Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus sciuri. However, compared with the DSS group, the salt group did not significantly change the symptoms of colitis or cytokine levels in serum and colon. Moreover, the salt group significantly decreased the gut microflora diversity. Gochujang mitigated DSS-induced colitis in rats by modulating inflammatory factors and the composition of gut microflora, unlike the intake of salt alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aStaphylococcus sciuri 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3acolitis 3acolon 3afermentation 3agene expression 3aglutinous rice 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apepper 3aprotective effect 3asoybeans1 aMoon, Hye-Jung 1 aYang, Hee-Jong 1 aKim, Kyung-Ah 1 aCha, Youn-Soo 0 tFoods.g2021 May 12, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100510723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245009200167300002200259520125400281592002801535650001301563650001801576650001101594650001301605650002101618650001901639650001301658700002501671700002101696773012701717856007401844852000901918655001201927IND60641357120221116164248.0190505e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064135712DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra23308b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlnajrani, Mohammed N.10aAlpha and beta diimine cobalt complexes in isoprene polymerization: a comparative study  ap. 113803-113814.  aTwo cobalt complexes, the α-diimine complex 1,2-bis[(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imino]acenaphthene-cobalt(ii) dibromide (A) and the β-diimine complex 2,4-bis[(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imino]pentane-cobalt(ii) dibromide (B) were synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analysis, electrospray MS and single crystal X-ray diffraction. These complexes were then assessed as pre-catalysts of the polymerization of isoprene in chlorobenzene using diethylaluminiumchloride (DEAC) as co-catalyst at 35 °C. While the aryl substituents were identical in each case, the β-diimine complex B was over 100-fold more active (Rₚ = 1.17 × 10⁻³ M s⁻¹) than α-diimine complex A (Rₚ = 1.07 × 10⁻⁵ M s⁻¹). A produced polyisoprene with molecular weight (Mₙ = 2.1 × 10⁵ g mol⁻¹) double that achieved with B. The polymers produced by both A and B were predominantly cis-1,4 enchained (80%) with 3,4 regioerrors (20%). For B, this 1,4 : 3,4 selectivity ratio was not influenced by aluminium alkyl reagent (ethylaluminiumsesquichloride (EASC), or DEAC) whereas for A, where EASC co-catalyst was used, a 1,4-trans-rich (61%) polyisoprene was obtained. Moreover, increasing Al mole ratio decreased the activity for B but increased it for A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3achlorobenzene 3acobalt 3aisoprene 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aAlshmimri, Sultan A.1 aAlsager, Omar A.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Dec. 05, v. 6, no. 114 p.113803-113814dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra23308b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002100169245010400190300001600294520175200310592002802062653002802090653002202118653002102140653001402161653002702175653002702202653001402229700002102243773007902264856011702343852000902460655001202469IND60130634020221122211933.0151127e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013063402DNAL7 a10.1642/0004-8038(2005)122[0922:BCAFRO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattley, Phil F.10aBody composition and flight ranges of bar-tailed godwits (limosa lapponica baueri) from new zealand  ap. 922-937.  aBody composition analysis was performed on 37 Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica baueri) that had been illegally shot during migratory fueling in northern New Zealand in March 1992. Adults (n == 35) were heavy (442––721 g), with fat loads of 30––45% of body mass. Two first-year males had only 5.4% and 8.9% fat, respectively, and had 13% less lean (fat-free dry) tissue than the average adult male. Males and females scaled along the same size axes, with little overlap between the sexes (females were larger). Larger birds carried more fat, but fat loads did not differ systematically with size (and, therefore, sex). Fatter birds (after accounting for body size) had larger flight muscle and lung masses, implying premigratory hypertrophy. Males that were not in body molt were fatter, but less colorful, than molting birds. They were also longer-winged and had larger testes but smaller intestines and salt glands, which suggests that they may belong to a subpopulation with a different fueling and molt strategy. Comparison between L. l. baueri and a smaller subspecies (L. l. taymyrensis) indicated that although the two subspecies scaled along the same lean mass-size axes, L. l. baueri deposited much more fat for their body size (1.7 ×× more than the equivalent-sized L. l. taymyrensis). On the basis of estimated travel costs for L. l. taymyrensis, predicted flight ranges for L. l. baueri ranged from 6,000 to 8,600 km, depending on whether wind assistance is assumed. That suggests that direct flights from New Zealand to southeastern or eastern Asia are possible (e.g. Philippines, 7,200 km; Japan, 8,700; South Korea, 9,100 km).Composition Corporelle et Distance de Vol chez Limosa lapponica baueri de Nouvelle-Zéélande  aPublisher supplied data 0aannual cycle energetics 0aBar-tailed Godwit 0aLimosa lapponica 0amigration 0aphenotypic flexibility 0asexual size dimorphism 0ashorebird1 aPiersma, Theunis0 tAuk.g2005 July, v. 122, no. 3 p.922-937dEstes & Lauriatx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1642%2F0004-8038%282005%29122%5B0922%3ABCAFRO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007500159300001600234520199600250592002802246650001402274650001702288650001302305650001502318650002002333650001402353650001002367650003502377650002602412650002302438650000902461651001402470651001802484700002602502700002302528773011302551856007402664852000902738655001202747IND60515291020221121184454.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051529102DNAL7 a10.1111/cobi.126122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarding, Gemma10aDevelopments in amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction programs  ap. 340-349.  aCaptive breeding and reintroduction remain high profile but controversial conservation interventions. It is important to understand how such programs develop and respond to strategic conservation initiatives. We analyzed the contribution to conservation made by amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction since the launch of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (ACAP) in 2007. We assembled data on amphibian captive breeding and reintroduction from a variety of sources including the Amphibian Ark database and the IUCN Red List. We also carried out systematic searches of Web of Science, JSTOR, and Google Scholar for relevant literature. Relative to data collected from 1966 to 2006, the number of species involved in captive breeding and reintroduction projects increased by 57% in the 7 years since release of the ACAP. However, there have been relatively few new reintroductions over this period; most programs have focused on securing captive‐assurance populations (i.e., species taken into captivity as a precaution against extinctions in the wild) and conservation‐related research. There has been a shift to a broader representation of frogs, salamanders, and caecilians within programs and an increasing emphasis on threatened species. There has been a relative increase of species in programs from Central and South America and the Caribbean, where amphibian biodiversity is high. About half of the programs involve zoos and aquaria with a similar proportion represented in specialist facilities run by governmental or nongovernmental agencies. Despite successful reintroduction often being regarded as the ultimate milestone for such programs, the irreversibility of many current threats to amphibians may make this an impractical goal. Instead, research on captive assurance populations may be needed to develop imaginative solutions to enable amphibians to survive alongside current, emerging, and future threats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquariums 3abiodiversity 3abreeding 3acaecilians 3acaptive animals 3adatabases 3afrogs 3anatural resources conservation 3asalamanders and newts 3athreatened species 3azoos 3aCaribbean 3aSouth America1 aGriffiths, Richard A.1 aPavajeau, Lissette0 tConservation biology.g2016 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.340-349dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.126123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245004900176300001400225520144900239592002801688650001501716650001601731650001501747650002901762650002401791650001901815650001001834650002601844650001401870650001901884650001801903651001201921653002501933653002701958653002401985653002902009653002302038653001602061653001402077700001902091773012902110856008502239852000902324655001202333IND60560743420221121054648.0170105e20161230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056074342DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2016.12320962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, Charles C.10aPotassium Dynamics in US Coastal Plain Soils  ap. 54-63.  aPotassium (K) deficiency in crops in southern US Coastal Plain soils has been documented since the l880s. Long-term soil fertility studies such as Alabama’s “Cullars Rotation” experiment (circa 1911) have been conducted with K since 1911. Other Alabama long-term experiments on several Coastal Plain and related Hapludults, Paleudults, and Kandiudults also contain K variable treatments which have been monitored since 1929. Soil test data from these long-term experiments have allowed us to answer some practical questions regarding K dynamics in Coastal Plain soils. Potassium movement through the soil profile is dependent on the soil’s cation exchange capacity (CEC) but relative accumulation is greater in the plow layer regardless of soil CEC. While subsoil K testing may be useful for identifying situations where subsoil K has been depleted, this extra effort and expense is not necessary for most cropping situations. A crop will remove most of its K from the plow layer if it is present in sufficient quantity based on soil test. Crop depletion of plow-layer K to the point where yield may be reduced is gradual and may take 10–15 years or more depending upon soil CEC and initial soil K concentration. Depletion is most rapid in low CEC soils as would be expected. However, soil test K can vary considerably during the course of a crop season with the lowest soil test K concentrations occurring immediately after harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHapludults 3aKandiudults 3aPaleudults 3acation exchange capacity 3acoastal plain soils 3acoastal plains 3acrops 3along term experiments 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3asoil profiles 3aAlabama 0aLong-term experiment 0apotassium accumulation 0aPotassium depletion 0apotassium mineralization 0apotassium movement 0asoil test K 0asubsoil K1 aHuluka, Gobena0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2016 Dec. 30, v. 47, no. sup1 p.54-63dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2016.12320963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009300170300001400263520188500277592002802162650002402190650001302214650001702227650001402244650002502258650001102283650001202294650001502306650001202321650001502333651001802348651001502366653002202381653001702403653002102420653002002441653001402461700002102475700002302496700002202519773010102541856008602642852000902728655001202737IND60563832020221119185340.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056383202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotwicki, Stan10aSelectivity ratio: A useful tool for comparing size selectivity of multiple survey gears  ap. 76-86.  aSelectivity studies have found applications in a wide range of topics within fishery science, such as fishery management, stock assessment, and ecological process studies. However, obtaining selectivity functions can often be a difficult and costly endeavor. Because of this difficulty, many studies are limited to the comparison of catch from two fishing gears, where relative differences in catch efficiency are often presented in the form of catch comparison rate or catch ratio. Studies of these rates are well known to often improve commercial fisheries, which benefit from highly selective gears. However, utility of these statistics for the purposes of fisheries surveys and stock assessment is not very well understood. In this study we adapted methods previously used for catch ratio to obtain length-dependent selectivity ratio function for two survey gears. Selectivity ratio can be obtained when area-swept or volume-swept fish density estimates are available from both gears. In other cases it is possible to obtain relative selectivity ratio. We present a general approach to obtain selectivity ratio in survey gear comparison studies and model it using three alternative techniques (linear and smooth mixed effect, and beta-regression). We use crossvalidation to choose between alternative models. We present examples of practical application of selectivity ratio with three case studies: a comparison of fine-and large mesh bottom trawls used in Arctic surveys, a study testing an assumption of non-selectivity of the Nephrops bottom trawl for snow crab in the Bering Sea, and a comparison of two survey midwater trawls for pollock in the Bering Sea. We show that selectivity ratio statistics can be used as a generalization of selectivity studies, where one gear is non-selective, as well as in catch comparison studies where selectivity of both gears is unknown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChionoecetes opilio 3aNephrops 3acase studies 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3amodels 3apollock 3astatistics 3asurveys 3atrawl nets 3aArctic region 3aBering Sea 0aSelectivity ratio 0aTrawl survey 0aCatch comparison 0aWalleye pollock 0aSnow crab1 aLauth, Robert R.1 aWilliams, Kresimir1 aGoodman, Scott E.0 tFisheries research.g2017 July, v. 191 p.76-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245013400165520157900299592002801878650002101906650001501927650002401942650001201966650002001978650002501998650001102023650002402034650002102058650001302079650001102092653003202103653001902135653001502154653002302169653002202192700001602214700001402230700001902244773009802263856008702361852000902448655001202457IND60645532120221119031751.0190529e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064553212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1133902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yi12aA proportional–integral (PI) law based variable speed technology for temperature control in indirect evaporative cooling system  aThe operation of indirect evaporative cooler (IEC) largely depends on the ambient temperature and humidity. To maintain stable indoor temperature, proper controller is essential. On-off control is a mature and stable control method used on constant speed fans. However, large fluctuation of indoor temperature can be observed because of limited control precision. To achieve better thermal comfort, a proportional–integral (PI) law based variable speed technology is proposed for accurate temperature control in an IEC system. This technology had been proved highly effective in central air-conditioning systems and direct expansion air-conditioners in terms of control precision and energy saving, but its techno-economic feasibility in IEC has not been investigated. In this study, annual dynamic simulation has been conducted to an IEC system based on the IEC model and control algorithm. Results show that indoor temperature can be controlled within ±0.5 °C around the setting point for 81.9% of time, while it is only 30.5% under on-off control. The PI based controller is well adapted to cooling loads in all seasons with good control precision, fast response speed and small overshoots. Response time of PI control is only 10 min in a disturbance rejection test, which is much shorter than 30 min under the on-off control. Annually, IEC with variable speed fans consume 50.0% less energy than that of on-off fans. At last, economic analysis shows that this technology is economically feasible only when the power of primary air fan is larger than 1.75 kW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aalgorithms 3aambient temperature 3acooling 3acooling systems 3aeconomic feasibility 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3afans (equipment) 3ahumidity 3amodels 0aIndirect evaporative cooler 0aVariable speed 0aPI control 0aEnergy consumption 0aEconomic analysis1 aYan, Huaxia1 aLuo, Yimo1 aYang, Hongxing0 tApplied energy.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 251 p.113390-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1133903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245016300177520182900340592002802169650001602197650002502213650001702238650001502255650001002270650001302280650002002293650002002313650002802333650002302361650001002384650002002394650001802414650001502432650001702447650003902464650001302503653002002516653002002536653001302556653002502569653002802594700002402622700002202646773011402668856008602782852000902868655001202877IND60757231420221117235547.0220531e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075723142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1277892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRangasamy, Basuvannan10aEvaluation of antioxidant response and Na+-K+-ATPase activity in zebrafish exposed to polyethylene microplastics: Shedding light on a physiological adaptation  aAlthough the toxicity of microplastics has already been demonstrated in different animal models, our knowledge about the response of freshwater fish to this pollutant is still limited. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the impact of exposure of zebrafish adults (Danio rerio) to environmentally relevant concentrations of polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) (5 and 50 µg/L) and at different times of exposure (10 and 20 days). Initially, scanning electron microscope image illustrated size and format of the particle and FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of PE-MPs in the gastrointestinal tract of fish (at both concentrations tested). Subsequently, an alteration of oxidative and antioxidant responses was evaluated in the liver and brain. The results showed that catalase (CAT) activity, in liver, was significantly decreased, as was glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) activity (on the 10th experimental day). However, after 20 days of exposure, we observed a concentration-dependent increase in GST activity in liver of the animals exposed to PE-MPs. Furthermore, the lipid peroxidation (LPO) level was significantly increased by exposure to MPs, especially in the brain, after 20 days of exposure. The increase in Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase activity in the animals' gills was correlated with the increased production of malondialdehyde (MDA), which suggests the existence of a compensatory mechanism in which the high activity of this enzyme would be necessary to regulate the loss of ions caused by the increase in the processes of LPO, which has never been previously demonstrated. Thus, our study sheds light on a new physiological adaptation to deal with the oxidative effects of PE-MPs, in addition to supporting the future use of the assessment of Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity as a biomarker of the toxicity of these pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3acatalase 3adigestive tract 3afreshwater fish 3aglutathione transferase 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3amicroplastics 3apollutants 3apolyethylene 3asodium-potassium-exchanging ATPase 3atoxicity 0afreshwater fish 0amicropollutants 0aplastics 0aantioxidant response 0aphysiological mechanism1 aMalafaia, Guilherme1 aMaheswaran, Rajan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 426 p.127789-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1277893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008500158300002200243520082400265592002801089650001601117650002101133650001501154650001901169650001401188650001701202650001601219700002101235700001801256700001901274773012701293856007401420852000901494655001201503IND60641357320221116164022.0190505e20161209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064135732DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra23318j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, Mahebub10aElectrochemical supercapacitor based on double perovskite Y₂NiMnO₆ nanowires  ap. 114722-114726.  aThe present work unveils the electrochemical properties of a newly emerging multiferroic material, double perovskite Y₂NiMnO₆, as an active material for the positive electrode of electrochemical supercapacitors.

R.14aThe Surface Potential of the Water–Vapor Interface from Classical Simulations  ap. 9114-9122.  aThe electrochemical surface potential across the water–vapor interface provides a measure of the orientation of water molecules at the interface. However, the large discrepancies between surface potentials calculated from ab initio (AI) and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate that what is being calculated may be relevant to different test probes. Although a method for extracting the electrochemical surface potential from AIMD simulations has been given, methods for MD simulations have not been clarified. Here, two methods for extracting the surface potential relevant to electrochemical measurements from MD simulations are presented. This potential is shown to be almost entirely due to the dipole contribution. In addition, the molecular origin of the dipole contribution is explored by using different potential energy functions for water. The results here show that the dipole contribution arises mainly from distortions in the hydration shell of the full hydrogen bonded waters on the liquid side of the interface, which is determined by the charge distribution of the water model. Disturbingly, the potential varies by 0.4 eV depending on the model. Although there is still no consensus on what that charge distribution should be, recent results indicate that it contains both a large quadrupole and negative charge out of the molecular plane, i.e., three-dimensional (3D) charge. Water models with 3D charge give the least distortion of the hydration shell and the best agreement with experimental surface potentials, although there is still uncertainty in the experimental values.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3auncertainty 3awater vapor1 aIchiye, Toshiko0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 July 23, v. 119, no. 29 p.9114-9122dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp508878v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245010600159300001800265500001400283520111700297592002801414650002401442650002701466650002101493650003501514650001101549650001801560650001301578650001801591650001201609650002101621650000701642650001201649650001101661650002501672650001401697653003101711653001701742653002601759700001801785700001801803773018501821856007502006852000902081655001202090IND60691768720221118105327.0200502e19980101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069176872DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.62.22112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKIM, Yong-Tae10aPurification and Characterization of Cu, Zn Superoxide Dismutase from Ark Shell Scapharca broughtonii  ap. 2211-2216.  aNAL-light  aA superoxide dismutase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from the muscular tissue of the ark shell, Scapharca broughtonii, by ammonium sulfate fractionation, and consecutive column chromatographies using DEAE-Sephadex and Sephadex G-100. This enzyme has a molecular weight of 71,700 and is composed of two identical subunits of M ᵣ 35,800, which are joined by noncovalent interactions. The purified enzyme was stable over the range of pH 5.0-10.0 at 4°C for 24 h and at temperatures below 45°C. Cyanide at 0.1 and 1 mM inhibited the activity of the superoxide dismutase 56 and 100%, but 5 mM azide caused 8% inhibition. The optical spectrum of this enzyme had a maximum at 265 nm, and the amino acid composition of the enzyme was similar to that of the other Cu, Zn superoxide dismutases except for the contents of threonine, serine, proline, and leucine. Atomic absorption spectroscopy showed that this enzyme has approximately 2 atoms of Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺ per mole of enzyme. These results indicate that the purified enzyme from ark shell, Scapharca broughtonii, is a Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnadara broughtonii 3aamino acid composition 3aammonium sulfate 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aazides 3abiotechnology 3acyanides 3afractionation 3aleucine 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aproline 3aserine 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athreonine 0aCu/Zn superoxide dismutase 0acytochrome c 0aScapharca broughtonii1 aPARK, Sun-Joo1 aKim, Se-Kwon,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g1998 Jan. 1, v. 62, no. 11 p.2211-2216dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.62.22113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245014500192300001600337520220800353592002802561653002302589653001802612653003102630653001202661653001402673700002502687700002202712700002202734700002002756700002502776700001802801700002302819700002402842773007902866856011702945852000903062655001203071IND60130634220221122211852.0151127e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013063422DNAL7 a10.1642/0004-8038(2005)122[0949:POTMAP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulikova, Irina V.10aPhylogeography of the mallard (anas platyrhynchos): hybridization, dispersal, and lineage sorting contribute to complex geographic structure  ap. 949-965.  aPopulation genetic variation in Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos; n == 152) from Western Russia, North Asia, the Aleutian Islands, and mainland Alaska was investigated using 667 base pairs of the 5′′-end of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. DNA sequencing revealed two clades that correspond to Avise et al.’’s (1990) group A and B mtDNA haplotypes. Group A haplotypes (80.3%) were wide- spread in all localities from Western Russia to Alaska. Group B haplotypes (19.7%), by contrast, were found primarily in mainland Alaska, where they occurred at high frequency (77.4%), but they also occurred at low frequencies (declining east to west) in the Aleutian Islands (11.8%) and the Primorye region of North Asia (4.4%). Group B haplotypes were not observed in Western Russia or elsewhere in North Asia outside Primorye. Consequently, Mallards exhibited substantial genetic structure between Old World and New World (ΦΦST == 0.4112––0.4956) but possessed little genetic structure within the Old World continental area (ΦΦST == 0.0018). Nonetheless, when only group A haplotypes were included in the analysis, Mallards from the Aleutian Islands differed (albeit with low levels of divergence) from each of the other three sampled regions in the Old World and New World (ΦΦST == 0.0728––0.1461, P < 0.05). Mallards inhabit the Aleutian Islands year-round, so these insular populations may be isolated from Asian and North American populations that occur in the Aleutian Islands only during migration. Overall weak phylogeographic structure and low genetic differentiation within Asia, and between Asia and North America when only group A haplotypes were evaluated, is probably explained by large long-term population sizes and significant intra-continental dispersal. The coexistence and nonrandom distribution of two divergent mtDNA haplotype lineages in Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, and the Primorye region of North Asia, but not in Western Russia or elsewhere in North Asia, is consistent with historical and contemporary hybridization and incomplete sorting of A and B mtDNA haplotype lineages in Mallards and closely related species inhabiting the Old World and New World.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAnas platyrhynchos 0ahybridization 0aincomplete lineage sorting 0aMallard 0aparaphyly1 aDrovetski, Sergei V.1 aGibson, Daniel D.1 aHarrigan, Ryan J.1 aRohwer, Sievert1 aSorenson, Michael D.1 aWinker, Kevin1 aZhuravlev, Yuri N.1 aMcCracken, Kevin G.0 tAuk.g2005 July, v. 122, no. 3 p.949-965dEstes & Lauriatx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1642%2F0004-8038%282005%29122%5B0949%3APOTMAP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011000177300001400287520167100301592002801972650002102000650001202021650001302033650001202046650002802058650001702086650002602103650001302129650001402142650001902156650001902175650001102194650002002205650001802225650001802243651001402261651001702275653002002292653002102312653002402333653001702357653001702374653002402391653001602415700002502431700002702456700002502483773012902508856008502637852000902722655001202731IND60560743520221121054556.0170105e20161230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056074352DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2016.12320982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorkevičienė, Eglė10aSwitchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) from North Dakota—a New Bioenergy Crop for the Nemoral Zone of Europe  ap. 64-74.  aParallel to the growing interest in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) in southern countries of Europe, there is enhanced interest in knowing about its potential adaptability in the European regions with cool and moderate climates. The objective of this work was to characterize important agricultural parameters of switchgrass originated from North Dakota in order to identify the most valuable accessions for further research, propagation, and breeding in the Nemoral zone of Europe. The selection aimed at evaluating overwintering and productivity of switchgrass, with the ultimate objective of biomass quality improvement. Field trials were carried out in the central lowland of Lithuania during 2012–2014 on 33 germplasm accessions of switchgrass originating from North Dakota. Allthe tested accessions exhibited almost similar overwinter survival rate, i.e., 93.7–96.7%. Significant differences were observed in mean dry matter yields of all the tested accessions harvested once or twice per season (P < 0.05). The higher yielding accessions during both study years were differentiated. The yield potential of these accessions depended on a number of morphological traits, including internode thickness, plant height, panicle length, and leaf and stem weight per tiller (P < 0.05). Ash and mineral composition was associated with the genotype and the year of biomass harvest (P < 0.05). The switchgrass genotypes originating from North Dakota appeared to be adaptable to the European environment with cool and moderate climate and short growing season. The best-performing accessions can serve as a valuable genetic source for future breeding programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3abiomass 3abreeding 3aclimate 3adry matter accumulation 3aenergy crops 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3agrowing season 3ainflorescences 3aleaves 3amineral content 3aoverwintering 3asurvival rate 3aLithuania 3aNorth Dakota 0aBiomass quality 0adry matter yield 0amineral composition 0aNemoral zone 0aNorth Dakota 0aoverwinter survival 0aswitchgrass1 aLemežienė, Nijolė1 aCesevičienė, Jurgita1 aButkutė, Bronislava0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2016 Dec. 30, v. 47, no. sup1 p.64-74dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2016.12320983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017400173300001600347520155000363592002801913650001601941650002101957650002101978650001301999650001702012650001702029650001702046650002602063650001502089650000702104650002002111650001902131650001702150700002102167700001602188700001502204773009902219856008502318990002302403852000902426655001202435IND60099963420221119041656.0141105e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009996342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEfthimiadou, E.K.10aNovel PLA modification of organic microcontainers based on ring opening polymerization: Synthesis, characterization, biocompatibility and drug loading/release properties  ap. 134-142.  aIn the current study, poly lactic acid (PLA) modified hollow crosslinked poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) microspheres have been prepared, in order to obtain a stimulus-responsive, biocompatible carrier with sustained drug release properties. The synthetical process consisted of the preparation of poly(methacrylic acid)@poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-N,N′-methylene bis(acrylamide)) microspheres by a two stage distillation-precipitation polymerization technique using 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator. Following core removal, a PLA coating of the microspheres was formed, after ring opening polymerization of dl-lactide, attributing the initiator's role to the active hydroxyl groups of PHEMA. The anticancer drug daunorubicin (DNR) was selected for the study of loading and release behavior of the coated microspheres. The loading capacity of the PLA modified microspheres was found to be four times higher than that of the parent ones (16% compared to 4%). This coated microspherical carrier exhibited a moderate pH responsive drug release behavior due to the pH dependent water uptake of PHEMA, and PLA hydrolysis. The in vitro cytotoxicity of both the parent and the DNR-loaded or empty modified hollow microspheres has been also examined on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The results showed that although the empty microspheres were moderately cytotoxic, the DNR-loaded microspheres had more potent anti-tumor effect than the free drug. Therefore, the prepared coated microspheres are interesting drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3abiocompatibility 3abreast neoplasms 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3adaunorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3ahydrolysis 3apH 3apolylactic acid 3apolymerization 3awater uptake1 aTziveleka, L.-A.1 aBilalis, P.1 aKordas, G.0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 May 30, v. 428, no. 1-2 p.134-142dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.02.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245015600178300001600334520122400350592002801574650002501602650002301627650002101650650001401671650001401685650001101699650001301710651002101723653002901744653002601773653001301799653002401812700001901836700001801855700002001873773010301893856008601996852000902082655001202091IND60563832220221119185605.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056383222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMormede, S.q(Sophie),10aUsing spatial population models to investigate the potential effects of the Ross Sea region Marine Protected Area on the Antarctic toothfish population  ap. 164-174.  aOne aim of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is to protect a representative portion of the environment through spatial closures to extractive practices such as fisheries. Although they usually involve the displacement of fisheries, their design rarely takes into account the effect of displacing that fishery on the target fish population. We used a spatially explicit population model of Antarctic toothfish in the Ross Sea region to investigate the effects of the endorsed Ross Sea region MPA on the fishery dynamics and the spatial distribution of the toothfish population. Our study indicates that the MPA will likely improve protection of the juvenile population residing on the Antarctic Shelf, while the number of areas with high levels of depletion is unlikely to increase compared to status quo management. Results also suggested a small increase in the catch limit under the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) harvest management rules, but with a slight reduction in catch rates. We have showed that spatial modelling tools can help inform MPA planning by simultaneously quantifying potential effects on the fish population and the ability to achieve conservation goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDissostichus mawsoni 3aconservation areas 3afish communities 3afisheries 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aplanning 3aAntarctic region 0aSpatial population model 0aMarine Protected Area 0aRoss Sea 0aAntarctic toothfish1 aDunn, Alistair1 aParker, Steve1 aHanchet, Stuart0 tFisheries research.g2017 June, v. 190 p.164-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012500175520166300300592002801963650001401991650001402005650001902019650002102038650002502059650001702084650001802101650001702119650001902136650001102155650001902166650001402185650001402199650001502213650001302228650002002241653001702261653002802278653001402306653001502320700002402335700001502359700002002374700001802394773009802412856008202510852000902592655001202601IND60792325220221119082233.0221004e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079232522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1209272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErdogan, Cihan Suleyman10aCombinatorial effects of melatonin and paclitaxel differ depending on the treatment scheme in colorectal cancer in vitro  aColorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most prevalent cancer with high mortality. Besides regulating the circadian rhythm, melatonin (MTN) exerts anticancer activities. Paclitaxel (PTX) is successful against different malignancies, however, acquired resistance and variability in patient response restrict its use. mTOR and MAPK pathways are often deregulated in human cancers. We aimed to investigate whether MTN enhances or sensitizes the chemotherapeutic activity of PTX and if so, determine the underlying possible mechanisms in CRC in vitro. Antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities of PTX and MTN were assessed alone and in combination, as well as with different treatment regimens (renewal or replacement of the treatment after 24 h), up to 48 h. Apoptosis, viability and autophagy were assessed by flow cytometry. mTOR and MAPK pathway activities were investigated by immunoblotting. Both drugs reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner at 24 and 48 h. Only the highest dose of MTN (500 μM) potentiated the cytotoxicity of PTX (50 nM). Replacement of PTX after 24 h with MTN was superior in reducing cell viability than vice versa via apoptosis induction. Renewal of MTN treatment every 24 h reduced autophagy compared to the control group, while other treatments did not alter the autophagic activity. A 24 h MTN treatment followed by 24 h PTX treatment increased S6 phosphorylation in a mTOR-independent manner and increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation. The present study suggests that sequential treatment with MTN and PTX distinctly affect apoptosis and cytotoxicity via regulating mTOR and MAPK pathways differentially in CRC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell viability 3acircadian rhythm 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3amelatonin 3amortality 3apaclitaxel 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 0aColon cancer 0aCombinatorial treatment 0aMelatonin 0aPaclitaxel1 aAl Hassadi, Yasmine1 aAru, Basak1 aYılmaz, Bayram1 aGemici, Burcu0 tLife sciences.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 308 p.120927-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1209273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245017600171520157100347592002801918650001701946650002501963650001701988650001302005650001502018650000902033650001702042650001402059650002802073650001002101650002202111650002002133650001402153650001302167650001502180650000902195650002002204650002502224650001602249653001402265653001302279653001702292653003302309653001802342653002002360700001802380700001402398700002102412700001702433700001702450700001802467700001902485700001802504700001802522773011902540856009002659852000902749655001202758IND60792125220221120091730.0220929e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079212522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2022.1120922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Lijun10aMelatonin alleviates chilling injury and maintains postharvest quality by enhancing antioxidant capacity and inhibiting cell wall degradation in cold-stored eggplant fruit  aMelatonin improves the chilling tolerance and quality of postharvest fruit. In this study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on postharvest quality in cold-stored eggplant fruit for 30 d at 5 °C. Melatonin at 100 μmol L⁻¹ was notably effective in decreasing chilling injury (CI) incidence, CI index, weight loss, and in delaying the decrease of lightness, thereby maintaining better postharvest quality of the fruit. Exogenous melatonin inhibited increases in hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), malondialdehyde (MDA), and relative electro-conductivity in the pericarp and pulp, while maintaining higher levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), total polyamines, anthocyanins, and melatonin, as well as the expressions of SOD, CAT1/2, and other genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis (ADC, ODC), melatonin biosynthesis (TDC1, T5H, SNAT1, ASMT, COMT), anthocyanin biosynthesis (PAL, CHS1, CHI, F3H, F3′H, DFR, ANS, 3GT), and cold regulation (COR1, CBF, ZAT2/6/12), thereby conferring the higher chilling tolerance. Melatonin delayed fruit softening and senescence by inhibiting the activities and gene expressions of cell wall degradation enzymes (PME, PG, Cel) and expressions of senescence-associated genes (IAA17, SAG12, SEN4). Overall, these results indicate that melatonin alleviates chilling injury and maintains postharvest quality by enhancing antioxidant capacity and inhibiting cell wall degradation in cold-stored eggplant fruit, which provides a theoretical foundation for extending fruit shelf-life of eggplant during cold storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosynthesis 3acatalase 3acell walls 3acold 3acold storage 3aeggplants 3aelectrical conductivity 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amalondialdehyde 3amelatonin 3apericarp 3apolyamines 3apulp 3astorage quality 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight loss 0aMelatonin 0aEggplant 0aCold storage 0aPostharvest fruit shelf-life 0aAntioxidation 0aFruit softening1 aZhang, Weiwei1 aLi, Qiang1 aJiang, Zhaoxiang1 aWang, Yanhua1 aXuan, Shuxin1 aZhao, Jianjun1 aLuo, Shuangxia1 aShen, Shuxing1 aChen, Xueping0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2022 Dec., v. 194 p.112092-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2022.1120923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009900165500001900264520136900283592002801652650002401680650002501704650001001729650002401739650002201763650003301785650001101818650001101829650001601840650001901856650001601875700001901891700002401910700002601934700002701960700002301987700001702010773011802027856007702145852000902222655001202231IND60738733920221120051446.0210524e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073873392DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100510752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhellam, Mohamed 10aOptimization of Osmotic Dehydration of Autumn Olive Berries Using Response Surface Methodology  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAutumn olive fruits are a rich source of nutrients and functional compounds, making them functional foods against many diseases and cancers. To increase the consumption, its processing, and its transformation into new products would help spread them to the consumer’s table. In this study, after giving an overview of the physicochemical characteristics and the antioxidant activity, the objective was to optimize the osmotic dehydration (OD) of the berries. Response surface methodology was used to investigate the effect of dehydration factors: syrup concentration (30–70%), temperature (20–70 °C), and fruit-to-syrup ratio (1:10–2:10) on the water loss (WL), sugar gain (SG), weight reduction (WR), density (ρ), water activity (aw), and total color change (ΔE) of fruits after 10 h of OD. Results obtained by employing Box–Behnken design (three variables, three levels), and significant terms of regression equations indicated that the syrup concentration and temperature variation are the most affecting factors on the previously mentioned independent variables (WL SG, WR, ρ, aw, and ΔE). Fruits to syrup ratio appeared to have a significant effect only on WL. Under the optimum conditions found (70%, 70 °C, 1.8:10), the predicted values were 59.21%. 19.21%, 32.34%, 1.22 g/cm³, 0.850, and 3.65 for WL, SG, WR, ρ, aw, and ΔE, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeagnus umbellata 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3aexperimental design 3aosmotic treatment 3aresponse surface methodology 3asugars 3asyrups 3atemperature 3awater activity 3aweight loss1 aZannou, Oscar 1 aPashazadeh, Hojjat 1 aGalanakis, Charis M.,1 aAldawoud, Turki  M.

A major contributor to this has been the introduction of on-board seawater tanks, which allow for the recovery of animals immediately after they have been landed from the net. In this study, we have validated a vigour index that could be used both by fisheries scientists and by the industry dealing with live-traded Nephrops, allowing identification of the proportion of trawl-caught lobsters that fail to recover following capture and are not in a condition to survive live transportation. Results indicate that the process of visual selection into one of four possible vigour categories reflects with good accuracy the underlying physiological state of the animals, as assessed by the level of adenylate 5′ –triphosphate in the tail muscles, by the proportions of other nucleotides as expressed in the Adenylate Energy Charge, and by the amount of intra-muscular l-lactate present. The vigour index also correlates well with their subsequent survival potential in a semi-dry transport system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNephrops norvegicus 3aenergy 3afisheries 3alactic acid 3alobsters 3amarkets 3amuscles 3anucleotides 3aphysiological state 3aseawater 3atail 3atanks 3atransportation 3atrawl nets 3avigor 0aNorway lobster 0aNephrops norvegicus 0aLive transport 0aVigour 0aPhysiology 0aMortality1 aSinclair, Simon1 aNeil, Douglas0 tFisheries research.g2017 July, v. 191 p.25-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245008600163300001800249500001900267520050800286592002800794650001100822650001800833650002800851650002300879650001600902650002600918650001100944653002000955653003300975653002301008653001101031700002301042700002001065773018501085856007501270852000901345655001201354IND60691769020221118104458.0200502e19980101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069176902DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.62.22232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMARUYAMA, Keiichi10aPectins in Extracellular Polysaccharides from a Cell-Suspension Culture of Mentha  ap. 2223-2225.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPectin constituents, which were about 70 w/w% of extracellular polysaccharides (ECP) from a cell-suspension culture of Mentha, were purified by gel filtration chromatography, and their sugar composition and linkage were investigated.

In the present study, incorporation of phenolic-rich extracts (500 and 1000 mg kg⁻¹) from olive leaves (OL) and olive mill wastewater (OMW) into conventional gluten-free formulations has been exploited as a potential strategy for developing nutritious and healthy breadsticks with extended shelf-life. To this end, moisture, water activity (aw), visual and textural properties, the composition of biologically active compounds (soluble, insoluble, and bio-accessible polyphenols), antioxidant activity, oxidation stability, and consumer preference of the resulting breadsticks were investigated. Fortified breadsticks had higher moisture and aw, lower hardness, and similar color in comparison to the control, especially in the case of OL extract supplementation. All enriched formulations significantly affected the phenolic composition, as evidenced by the decrease in insoluble/soluble polyphenols ratio (from 7 in the control up to 3.1 and 4.5 in OL and OMW, respectively), and a concomitant increase in polyphenol bio-accessibility (OL: 14.5–23% and OMW: 10.4–15% rise) and antioxidant activity (OL: 20–36% and OMW: 11–16% rise). Moreover, a significant shelf-life extension was observed in all fortified breadsticks (especially in case of OMW supplementation). Sensory evaluation evidenced that 61% of the assessors showed a marked, but not significant, tendency to consider the sample supplemented with high levels of OL as a more palatable choice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3aconsumer preferences 3aextended shelf life 3ahardness 3aolive mill wastewater 3aolives 3aoxidative stability 3apolyphenols 3asensory evaluation 3awater activity1 aPulina, Simone 1 aDel Caro, Alessandra 1 aFadda, Costantino 1 aUrgeghe, Pietro  Paolo1 aDe Bruno, Alessandra 1 aDifonzo, Graziana 1 aCaponio, Francesco 1 aRomeo, Rosa 1 aPiga, Antonio 0 tFoods.g2021 Apr. 22, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100509233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008800167520214800255592002802403650002102431650000902452650002702461650001602488650002402504650001102528650002602539650001302565650002502578650001902603650001502622651001002637653003402647653002402681653002802705653002102733700001802754700001802772700001302790773011602803856008402919852000903003655001203012IND60673061220221118072219.0200210e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067306122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2019.1058692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qichen10aStudy on factors affecting corn yield based on the Cobb-Douglas production function  aThis paper presents an analysis of the quantitative correlations between corn yield and its influencing factors in Daqing City, China by establishing a Cobb–Douglas production function model. The effective precipitation, corn planting area and chemical fertilizer and pesticide application rates were selected as the influencing factors of corn yield. Using the Cobb–Douglas production function model, the output elasticity and degree of influence for each factor on increasing grain yield were calculated. The current fertilizer and pesticide application rates, effective precipitation and planting area had positive effects on increasing corn yield, and the Daqing City area has the potential to produce more corn. Among the four influencing factors, the amounts of pesticide applications had the greatest impact on corn yield, followed by planting area, amounts of chemical fertilizer applications and, finally, effective precipitation. In this study, we used remote-sensing images combined with meteorological station data to calculate the effective precipitation in corn fields in Daqing City. The accuracy of this method was 0.01%–11.0% greater than that of the traditional effective precipitation calculation method. The innovation was the use of Thiessen polygons to calculate regional precipitation by combining satellite images with ground meteorological station data. The insufficient sensitivity of satellite inversion for precipitation (short and heavy rainfalls cannot be detected) and insufficient temporal resolution were avoided by using precipitation data from ground meteorological stations. Using satellite image interpretations, the weight coefficient of precipitation could be confirmed according to the location and size of the study area, improving the accuracy of Thiessen polygons in calculating regional precipitation. However, this method still has limitations. When calculating precipitation over a short time, it can be limited by the cloudiness of satellite images. When calculating the long-term precipitation trend, it can be limited by incomplete precipitation data from surface meteorological stations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3acorn 3afertilizer application 3agrain yield 3amineral fertilizers 3amodels 3apesticide application 3aplanting 3aproduction functions 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aChina 0aRemote-sensing interpretation 0aInfluencing factors 0aEffective precipitation 0aThiessen polygon1 aDong, Weihong1 aWen, Chuanlei1 aLi, Tong0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 228 p.105869-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.1058693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245014000171300002200311520215100333592002802484650003702512650001902549650001302568650001302581650000902594650000902603650001202612650001402624650001102638650001302649650001302662650001402675650001102689650003102700650001402731650002202745650001002767650001702777650001602794700002402810773012702834856007402961852000903035655001203044IND60641357720221116164102.0190505e20161125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064135772DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra23329e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez-Garcia, J.

The α-LiFeO₂ phase (cubic phase) was synthesized using the nitrate pyrolysis method at moderate temperature and a short calcination time (up to 670 °C and 3 h). Four compositions were synthesized with the nominal formula Li₁₊ₓFeO₂ for 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3, obtaining α-LiFeO₂ phases with different lattice parameters. The specific surface area was calculated for all the compounds from the BET model, fitting the N₂ adsorption–desorption curves. The CO₂ capture was studied under two different sets of physicochemical conditions. Initially, the CO₂ capture was analysed at high temperature, where the Li₁.₃FeO₂ composition showed the best properties at T > 600 °C. It was found that the amount of CO₂ captured at T > 600 °C depended on the lithium excess in the sample. Isothermal studies were performed in the 400–700 °C range, and the curves were fitted to a double exponential model. Kinetic constants were used in the Eyring formalism to obtain the activation enthalpies (ΔH≠) for the surface and bulk reactions. These values were similar to those reported for other Li-based ceramics. The CO₂ capture process in the presence of steam was evaluated at low temperature (from 40 °C to 80 °C, varying the relative humidity from 0 to 80%). In these physicochemical conditions, Li₁.₃FeO₂ could capture up to 24 wt% CO₂. This characterization has not previously been performed on these compounds. After CO₂ and steam capture, the product obtained contained magnetite, which is an iron oxide with mixed Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ oxidation states. The origin of the Fe²⁺ is attributed to the excess lithium added to the crystalline system. Its presence was confirmed by XPS spectroscopy, and it was also possible to identify two different chemical environments for oxygen ions, indicating that the Li⁺ ions occupy two different crystal sites. We associated the high reactivity of compounds under a steam and CO₂ atmosphere with the presence of both Fe²⁺ and the interstitial Li⁺ species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3aceramics 3aenthalpy 3aions 3airon 3alithium 3amagnetite 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphysicochemical properties 3apyrolysis 3arelative humidity 3asteam 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aPfeiffer, Heriberto0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 25, v. 6, no. 113 p.112040-112049dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra23329e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001700169245016200186300001800348520118900366592002801555653001701583653001401600653000901614653001501623653004701638773008101685856011701766852000901883655001201892IND60130634720221122175958.0151127e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013063472DNAL7 a10.1642/0004-8038(2005)122[1055:ATBBFT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayr, Gerald12aA tiny barbet-like bird from the lower oligocene of germany: the smallest species and earliest substantial fossil record of the pici (woodpeckers and allies)  ap. 1055-1063.  aRupelramphastoides knopfi, a new genus and species of the Pici (barbets, woodpeckers, and allies), is described from Frauenweiler, a Lower Oligocene (30––34 mya) fossil site in Germany. The disarticulated skeleton of the new species constitutes the first associated remains of a fossil member of the Pici and is the smallest known species and earliest substantial fossil record of this taxon. Despite an overall resemblance to modern Ramphastidae, R. knopfi appears to be distinguished from crown group Pici by several plesiomorphic characteristics. It is classified ““family incertae sedis,”” pending discovery of additional, better-preserved specimens. The fossil record and geographic occurrence of the basal lineages within the crown group are in concordance with an Old World origin of the Pici. The reasons that led to extinction of tiny Pici in Europe remain uncertain, but food competition with passeriform birds during periods of limited food availability may have played a major role.Ein winziger bartvogeläähnlicher Vogel aus dem Unter-Oligozään Deutschlands: die kleinste Art und der äälteste substantielle Fossilnachweis der Pici (Spechte und Verwandte)  aPublisher supplied data 0afossil birds 0aOligocene 0aPici 0aPiciformes 0aRupelramphastoides knopfi gen. et. sp. nov0 tAuk.g2005 Oct., v. 122, no. 4 p.1055-1063dEstes & Lauriatx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1642%2F0004-8038%282005%29122%5B1055%3AATBBFT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013000174300001200304520187400316592002802190650003202218650002702250650002802277650001102305650001502316650001402331650001002345650002002355650002202375650001502397650001102412650001302423650001702436650002202453650001102475650001902486650002502505650002202530650002502552651001002577651001702587651001302604653002602617653002902643653003002672653002402702653002702726700002202753700002302775773009902798856008602897852000902983655001202992IND60563832520221119185552.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056383252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukumaran, Sandhya10aGenetic population structure and historic demography of Indian mackerel, Rastrelliger kanagurta from Indian peninsular waters  ap. 1-9.  aAn attempt was conducted to understand the genetic population structure and historic demography of Indian mackerel, Rastrelliger kanagurta from Indian peninsular waters using mitochondrial DNA markers. A total of 241 sequences of mitochondrial control region and 271 sequences of mitochondrial ATPase gene region were amplified and analyzed in Indian mackerels collected from 10 different locations along Indian coast resulting in 123 and 155 haplotypes respectively. In addition, control region sequences representing samples from Thailand downloaded from NCBI were also used for analysis. Significant genetic differentiation (ΦST value of 0.38; P<0.001) was recorded between samples from mainland India, Portblair and Thailand when both control region and ATPase gene sequences were analyzed. Whilst, ΦST values were not significant when analyses were carried out between samples collected from mainland India. Oceanographic and environmental barriers between mainland India, Portblair and Thailand contribute to limited larval dispersal and restricted mixing between populations resulting in subtle genetic differentiation. The lack of genetic subdivision between populations from mainland India indicates adequate gene flow and mixing within Indian waters. Bayesian skyline plots revealed a history of population expansion taken place approximately 10000 years ago coinciding with the time after the last glacial maximum or early Holocene. Intensification of monsoon events after the last glacial maximum or early Holocene along the Indian subcontinent contributed to increased productivity in the Tropical Indian Ocean and consequent demographic expansion of mackerel populations historically. Management measures for Indian mackerel populations could be devised regionally so as to conserve intra-specific diversity and biocomplexity of this important resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aRastrelliger kanagurta 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acoasts 3ademography 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3alarvae 3amackerel 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amixing 3amonsoon season 3anucleotide sequences 3apopulation growth 3apopulation structure 3aIndia 3aIndian Ocean 3aThailand 0aDemographic expansion 0aIntra-specific diversity 0aMitochondrial DNA markers 0aPopulation genetics 0aRastrelliger kanagurta1 aSebastian, Wilson1 aGopalakrishnan, A.0 tFisheries research.g2017 July, v. 191 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245011200181520137500293592002801668650001101696650001901707650002201726650000901748650002001757650002801777650001101805650002501816650001301841650001101854650001801865650000901883653001501892653001701907653002201924653001101946653001101957653001201968653000801980653000801988653000801996653000702004653000802011653000802019653000802027653000902035653000702044653000702051653000802058653000802066653000902074653000902083653000802092653000902100653000802109653000802117653000802125653000802133653000802141653000802149700002002157700001902177700002002196773009802216856008702314852000902401655001202410IND60645532620221119031704.0190613e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064553262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, M.q(Makoto),10aVerification of proper operation of dry acid gas removal process on syngas derived by O2/CO2-blown gasifier  aDry syngas purification process was demonstrated on the bench scale test facility comprised of halide removal unit and sulfur removal unit with three fixed bed reactors in which regenerable honeycomb sorbents were installed. The first-ever test of the facility aims to verify the resistance of the zinc ferrite desulfurization sorbent to the carbon deposition in actual syngas condition and proper operation of the cyclic run of the three-reactors system. The test was so challenging that the sulfur removal sorbent was exposed to the severe condition for carbon deposition in the actual syngas derived from oxygen/carbon dioxide blown coal gasifier. The process was operated at 450 °C and 0.98 MPa abs. under the duration of reactor switching of sulfur removal unit of 1 hr for the initial cyclic operation. The dry syngas purification process exhibited sufficient performance of halide and sulfur removal that was evaluated with gas analytical instruments and chemical analysis of the spent sorbent. The sulfur removal unit was operated for the initial cycle of sulfidation, regeneration, and reduction steps without any detrimental effect of carbon deposition. This result encouraged that the process is ready to perform the proper operation in the actual syngas condition during the longer duration of multiple cyclic operation of the bench scale test facility.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical analysis 3acoal 3adesulfurization 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aoxygen 3apurification methods 3asorbents 3asulfur 3asynthesis gas 3azinc 0aDry syngas 0aO2/CO2-blown 0aCarbon deposition 0aSulfur 0aHalide 0aRemoval 0aASU 0aBTL 0aCCS 0aCE 0aFCV 0aFID 0aFPD 0aFTIR 0aFT 0aGS 0aHHV 0aICP 0aIGCC 0aIGFC 0aLHV 0aMDEA 0aMHI 0aSAS 0aSTP 0aTCD 0aTPD 0aZFS1 aAkiho, Hiroyuki1 aOzawa, Yasushi1 aNakajima, Akira0 tApplied energy.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 252 p.113402-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1134023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245008800161300001800249500001900267520058600286592002800872650002800900650001800928650003200946650001000978650002100988650001601009650003901025650002201064650001901086653001101105653001601116653001601132700001801148700002201166700002201188700001901210700002401229773018501253856007501438852000901513655001201522IND60691769320221118104444.0200502e19980101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069176932DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.62.22332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumura, Haruto,10aMolecular Cloning and Analysis of a Lipase Gene from Pseudomonas fluorescens No. 33  ap. 2233-2235.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe gene encoding an extracellular lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens No. 33 was cloned and sequenced.

Although cancer therapy has progressed in recent years, current therapeutic approaches are ineffective due to toxicity and chemoresistance. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate other treatment options, and natural products are a promising alternative as they show antitumor properties in different study models. This review describes the regulation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) expression and the role of flavonoids as molecules with the antitumor activity that targets TIMPs therapeutically. These inhibitors regulate tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover; they inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Data obtained in cell lines and in vivo models suggest that flavonoids are chemopreventive and cytotoxic against various types of cancer through several mechanisms. Flavonoids also regulate crucial signaling pathways such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor κB (NFκB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) involved in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. All these data reposition flavonoids as excellent candidates for use in cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acancer therapy 3acell movement 3achemoprevention 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3aextracellular matrix 3aflavonoids 3ametalloproteinases 3ametastasis 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators 0aFlavonoids 0aTissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 0aMatrix metalloproteinases 0aMetastasis 0aCancer1 aNava-Tapia, Dania A.1 aAstudillo-Justo, Kevin D.1 aArizmendi-Izazaga, Adán1 aSotelo-Leyva, César1 aHerrera Martínez, Mayra,1 aVillegas-Comonfort, Sócrates1 aNavarro-Tito, Napoleón0 tLife sciences.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 308 p.120932-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1209323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245018100176300001600357520148100373592002801854650002201882650002101904650001701925650001401942650001101956650003201967650002001999650001902019650001202038650001602050650002102066650001302087650001102100650002202111650001802133650002902151650001302180650002102193650001202214650001802226653002802244653001402272653003102286653003402317653002402351653001202375700002802387700001802415700003202433700002402465773009702489856008502586852000902671655001202680IND60611575720221118030805.0200210e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061157572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.05.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguieiras, Erika C.G.10aInfluence of the raw material on the final properties of biodiesel produced using lipase from Rhizomucor miehei grown on babassu cake as biocatalyst of esterification reactions  ap. 112-118.  aThe aim of this work was to produce esters with potential application as biodiesel via esterification with short-chain alcohols of free fatty acids (FFA) obtained from soybean and palm oils refining. Esterification reactions were catalyzed by dry lipase immobilized in fermented solids (DFS), obtained by Rhizomucor miehei grown on babassu cake by solid-state fermentation (SSF). A final conversion above 80% was attained using palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and soybean fatty acid distillate (SFAD) as raw materials in esterification reactions with ethanol. The biocatalyst could be reused 5 times in repeated 6 h reactions after its washing with 95% (v/v) ethanol or hexane (using SFAD as raw material). Moreover, the properties of the obtained fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE)-enriched products were characterized. Both products were in accordance with several limits established by biodiesel-related standardized tests from Brazilian specifications including ester content (97.3% for the product obtained from SFAD), water content (180 mg Kg⁻¹ for the product obtained from PFAD), density (867.6 kg (m³)⁻¹for the product obtained from SFAD), viscosity kinematic (3.14–4.29 mm² s⁻¹), flash point (<100 °C), carbon residue (0.01 wt.%), ethanol (0.08–0.083 wt.%), free glycerol (<0.001 wt.%) and total glycerol (0.028–0.10 wt.%), monoglycerides (0.076–0.211 wt.%), diglycerides (0.0196–0.218 wt.%) and triglycerides (0.053–0.114 wt.%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizomucor miehei 3ababassu oil cake 3abiocatalysts 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adiacylglycerols 3aesterification 3aethanol 3afatty acids 3afree fatty acids 3aglycerol 3ahexane 3amonoacylglycerols 3araw materials 3asolid state fermentation 3asoybeans 3atriacylglycerols 3awashing 3awater content 0aFatty acid ethyl esters 0aBiodiesel 0aPalm fatty acid distillate 0aSoybean fatty acid distillate 0aDry fermented solid 0aLipases1 ade Barros, Daniele S.N.1 aSousa, Homero1 aFernandez-Lafuente, Roberto1 aFreire, Denise M.G.0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Dec., v. 113 p.112-118dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.05.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010400161500001900265520142700284592002801711650002001739650001201759650001801771650001801789650001601807650001001823650001301833650001101846650002001857650001401877650000901891650001601900650001301916650001201929650001601941650001001957651001201967700002201979700002502001700001602026700002602042700002002068700001902088773011802107856007702225852000902302655001202311IND60738734320221123031832.0210524e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073873432DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100510782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamal, Rabie 10aIn Vitro & In Vivo Anti-Hyperglycemic Potential of Saponins Cake and Argan Oil from Argania spinosa  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Argan tree (Argania spinosa. L) is an evergreen tree endemic of southwestern Morocco. For centuries, various formulations have been used to treat several illnesses including diabetes. However, scientific results supporting these actions are needed. Hence, Argan fruit products (i.e., cake byproducts (saponins extract) and hand pressed Argan oil) were tested for their in-vitro anti-hyperglycemic activity, using α-glucosidase and α-amylase assays. The in-vivo anti-hyperglycemic activity was evaluated in a model of alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The diabetic animals were orally administered 100 mg/kg body weight of aqueous saponins cake extract and 3 mL/kg of Argan oil, respectively, to evaluate the anti-hyperglycemic effect. The blood glucose concentration and body weight of the experimental animals were monitored for 30 days. The chemical properties and composition of the Argan oil were assessed including acidity, peroxides, K232, K270, fatty acids, sterols, tocopherols, total polyphenols, and phenolic compounds. The saponins cake extract produced a significant reduction in blood glucose concentration in diabetic mice, which was better than the Argan oil. This decrease was equivalent to that detected in mice treated with metformin after 2–4 weeks. Moreover, the saponins cake extract showed a strong inhibitory action on α-amylase and α-glucosidase, which is also higher than that of Argan oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgania spinosa 3aacidity 3aalpha-amylase 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acakes 3adiabetes 3afruits 3aglycemic effect 3ametformin 3aoils 3apolyphenols 3asaponins 3asterols 3atocopherols 3atrees 3aMorocco1 aKharbach, Mourad 1 aVander Heyden, Yvan,1 aYu, Huiwen 1 aBouklouze, Abdelaziz 1 aCherrah, Yahia 1 aAlaoui, Katim 0 tFoods.g2021 May 13, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100510783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01568naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011300165300002000278520064000298592002800938650001200966650002300978650001301001650002201014650001301036700002201049773012401071856007401195852000901269655001201278IND60641358020221116164411.0190505e20161011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064135802DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra23340f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoyiatzis, Evangelos10aHow does the entropy of ternary polymer–solvent–cosolvent mixtures depend on the molar solvent fraction?  ap. 97018-97021.  aA decomposition of the entropy of dilute ternary polymer–solvent–cosolvent systems into pair terms is proposed. The variation of each term and its contribution to the total entropy in a coil–globule–coil transition is quantified by molecular dynamics simulations. Contrary to intuition, the modifications of the intramolecular polymer entropy are much smaller than the ones in the polymer–solvent and polymer–cosolvent entropy. For each solvent–cosolvent concentration, we identify the leading entropy term. Furthermore, we relate the modifications of all pair entropies to the occurring changes in the polymer structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentropy 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3asimulation models 3asolvents1 aBöhm, Michael C.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 6, no. 99 p.97018-97021dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra23340f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245017800153300002200331520170100353592002802054650001802082650001502100650002102115650001302136650002102149650001402170650002802184650001902212650002502231650001902256650001302275650001502288650001402303650001902317650002102336650002502357650001302382700001802395700001702413700001402430700001702444700001502461700001402476700001802490773012702508856007402635852000902709655001202718IND60641358120221116164334.0190505e20161124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064135812DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra23341d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Hui10aHydrophilic polymer/polypyrrole/graphene oxide nanosheets with different performances in electrocatalytic applications to simultaneously determine dopamine and ascorbic acid  ap. 111632-111639.  aHydrophilic polymers (HP) functionalized polypyrrole/graphene oxide nanosheets (HP/PPy/GO) were successfully prepared by covalently modifying polyacrylamide (PAM), polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the surface of PPy/GO nanosheets containing vinyl groups. Besides significantly improving the dispersivity of PPy/GO in water, the different chemical properties among the three HP with different hydrophilic groups further resulted in the different performances of the obtained electrochemical biosensors (PAM/PPy/GO, PAA/PPy/GO and PVP/PPy/GO modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs)) in electrocatalytic applications to simultaneously determine dopamine (DA) and ascorbic acid (AA). PAM/PPy/GO and PAA/PPy/GO modified GCEs exhibited good electrochemical responses to distinguish DA from AA in their mixture at certain concentrations, which cannot be achieved by the PVP/PPy/GO modified GCE, due to their different chemical properties among the three HP with different hydrophilic groups. Particularly, compared to PAA/PPy/GO, PAM/PPy/GO can act as a good steady electrode material with good selectivity and sensitivity that can simultaneously determine the two substrates in their mixture at lower concentrations, which may be due to the different chemical properties between the electron-donating amide groups and electron-withdrawing carboxyl groups. The different electronic effects of the amide group and carboxyl group resulted in the difference in the transmission capability of electrons released from the oxidation reaction of DA and AA. Therefore, PAM/PPy/GO modified GCE can act as a good electrochemical sensor with high sensitivity and selectivity for DA and AA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abiosensors 3achemical bonding 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilic polymers 3ahydrophilicity 3amoieties 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3apyrroles1 aJi, Chunguang1 aLiu, Meihong1 aSun, Ying1 aLiu, Daliang1 aWu, Shuyao1 aZhang, Yu1 aSong, Xi-Ming0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 24, v. 6, no. 113 p.111632-111639dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra23341d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245008500160300002000245520130100265592002801566650001701594650001301611650002201624650001601646650002201662650001401684650000701698650002301705653002201728653001701750653002901767653001401796653002001810700001501830700001801845700001701863700001901880700001601899700001201915700001801927700001601945700001601961700001301977773012601990856008002116852000902196655001202205IND60565935220221121002238.0170329e20170329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056593522DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b167362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Huijun10aLarge Rectification Effect of Single Graphene Nanopore Supported by PET Membrane  ap. 11000-11008.  aGraphene is an ideal candidate for the development of solid state nanopores due to its thickness at the atomic scale and its high chemical and mechanical stabilities. A facile method was adopted to prepare single graphene nanopore supported by PET membrane (G/PET nanopore) within the three steps assisted by the swift heavy ion irradiation and asymmetric etching technology. The inversion of the ion rectification effect was confirmed in G/PET nanopore while comparing with bare PET nanopore in KCl electrolyte solution. By modifying the wall charge state of PET conical nanopore with hydrochloric acid from negative to positive, the ion rectification effect of G/PET nanopore was found to be greatly enhanced and the large rectification ratio up to 190 was obtained during this work. Moreover, the high ionic flux and high ion separation efficiency was also observed in the G/PET nanopore system. By comparing the “on” and “off” state conductance of G/PET nanopore while immersed in the solution with pH value lower than the isoelectric point of the etched PET (IEP, pH = 3.8), the voltage dependence of the off conductance was established and it was confirmed that the large rectification effect was strongly dependent on the particularly low off conductance at higher applied voltage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3agraphene 3ahydrochloric acid 3airradiation 3aisoelectric point 3ananopores 3apH 3apotassium chloride 0agraphene nanopore 0aPET membrane 0aion rectification effect 0ainversion 0aion irradiation1 aZeng, Jian1 aZhai, Pengfei1 aLi, Zongzhen1 aCheng, Yaxiong1 aLiu, Jiande1 aMo, Dan1 aDuan, Jinglai1 aWang, Lanxi1 aSun, Youmei1 aLiu, Jie0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 29, v. 9, no. 12 p.11000-11008dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b167363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245015200169500001900321520121600340592002801556650001601584650000901600650001601609650002401625650001101649650001301660650001101673650001201684650001001696650002401706650002301730650001101753650001101764700002801775700002401803700002301827700002401850700002101874700002301895773011801918856007702036852000902113655001202122IND60738734520221121230322.0210524e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073873452DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100510802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaggiolino, Aristide 10aDry-Aged Beef Steaks: Effect of Dietary Supplementation with Pinus taeda Hydrolyzed Lignin on Sensory Profile, Colorimetric and Oxidative Stability  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFlavor is one of the main factors involved in consumer meat-purchasing decision and use of natural antioxidants in animal feeding had a great appeal for consumers. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effect of Pinus taeda hydrolyzed lignin (PTHL) feed addition on oxidative stability, volatile compounds characteristics, and sensory attributes of 35 days dry-aged beef steaks. Forty steer six months old were randomly divided into a control group (CON; n = 20) and an experimental group (PTHL; n = 20). Both groups were fed ad libitum for 120 days with the same TMR and only the PTHL group received PTHL supplement. Samples of LT muscle were removed from carcasses and dry aged for 35 days at 2 °C, 82% of humidity, and 0.4 m/s of ventilation and then analyzed. Meat of CON group showed lower yellowness (p < 0.01) and higher TBARS (p < 0.01) values. Moreover, CON meat showed higher volatile aldehydes and lower sulfur compounds (p < 0.01), with higher unpleasant odor (p < 0.05) and meaty odor (p < 0.01) score revealed by sensory assessors. PTHL inclusion in beef diet delayed the oxidative mechanisms in 35 days dry-aged steaks, resulting in an improved colorimetric, volatolomic, and sensory profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3abeef 3acolorimetry 3adietary supplements 3aflavor 3ahumidity 3alignin 3amuscles 3aodors 3aoxidative stability 3asensory evaluation 3asteers 3asulfur1 aSgarro, Maria  Federica1 aNatrella, Giuseppe 1 aLorenzo, José M.,1 aColucci, Annamaria 1 aFaccia, Michele 1 aDe Palo, Pasquale 0 tFoods.g2021 May 13, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100510803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008300166300001600249520115900265592002801424650002201452650002301474650001101497650002301508650002901531653001101560653002601571653002801597653001901625700001801644700001601662700001601678700001601694773009701710856008501807852000901892655001201901IND60611575920221118030733.0200210e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061157592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Heng10aExperimental and simulation studies on a novel compound parabolic concentrator  ap. 784-794.  aFlat-plate compound parabolic concentrator (CPC), which are typically applied in photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems, are highly cost-effective, but its uniformity of the light distribution are poor. In this paper, based on the size calculation model of the traditional flat-plate CPC, the light acceptance uniformities on the acceptance surfaces with different truncations are compared by the Lighttools simulation software. After which, a novel biaxial tracking CPC with a special truncation called well distributed CPC(WD-CPC) and its optimization design are proposed. The light distribution uniformity of the acceptance surface can be improved by WD-CPC, which also has a higher lighting half-angle and a smaller height-width ratio. As shown by simulations, the light non-uniformity of the WD-CPC can be decreased to 0.13 or lower, which is 27.2% of a common CPC. While Measured by experiment, the actual light uniformity of the WD-CPC is 0.153, which is in agreement with simulations. Therefore, it is possible that this concentrator can increase the efficiency of a PV/T system and can prolong the life-span of the photovoltaic cell simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acost effectiveness 3amodels 3aphotovoltaic cells 3arenewable energy sources 0aWD-CPC 0aLighttools simulation 0aBiaxial tracking method 0aNon-uniformity1 aChen, Haiping1 aHan, Yuchen1 aLiu, Haowen1 aLi, Mingjie0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Dec., v. 113 p.784-794dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011200170520166900282592002801951650002101979650001902000650002302019650001702042650001002059650002402069650001802093650001402111650001802125650001502143653002702158653001902185653002402204653001802228653003802246700002202284700005702306773009802363856008202461852000902543655001202552IND60792325920221119082153.0221004e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079232592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1209352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAḥmadī, Mahdī,10aEngineered extracellular vesicles: A novel platform for cancer combination therapy and cancer immunotherapy  aExtracellular vesicles (EVs), phospholipid membrane-bound vesicles, produced by most cells, contribute to cell-cell communication. They transfer several proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids between cells both locally and systemically. Owing to the biocompatibility and immune activity of EVs, therapeutic approaches using these vesicles as drug delivery systems are being developed. Different methods are used to design more effective engineered EVs, which can serve as smart tools in cancer therapy and immunotherapy. Recent progress in the field of targeted-cancer therapy has led to the gradual use of engineered EVs in combinational therapy to combat heterogeneous tumor cells and multifaceted tumor microenvironments. The high plasticity, loading ability, and genetic manipulation capability of engineered EVs have made them the ideal platforms to realize numerous combinations of cancer therapy approaches. From the combination therapy view, engineered EVs can co-deliver chemotherapy with various therapeutic agents to target tumor cells effectively, further taking part in immunotherapy-related cancer combination therapy. However, a greater number of studies were done in pre-clinical platforms and the clinical translation of these studies needs further scrutiny because some challenges are associated with the application of engineered EVs. Given the many therapeutic potentials of engineered EVs, this review discusses their function in various cancer combination therapy and immunotherapy-related cancer combination therapy. In addition, this review describes the opportunities and challenges associated with the clinical application of engineered EVs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acancer therapy 3acell communication 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3agenetic engineering 3aimmunotherapy 3aneoplasms 3aphospholipids 3aplasticity 0aExtracellular vesicles 0aEngineered EVs 0aCombination-therapy 0aImmunotherapy 0aExosomal therapy and therapeutics1 aHassanpour, Mehdi1 aRezaie, Jafar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8175-37300 tLife sciences.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 308 p.120935-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1209353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245018000166520154500346592002801891650001501919650001501934650001201949650001901961650003101980650001302011650001702024650001702041650001102058650001402069650001102083650001602094650001502110650001902125653002602144653001202170653001702182653001502199653001702214700001502231700001702246700001202263700001602275700001902291700001502310700001802325700001702343773011402360856008602474852000902560655001202569IND60757232320221117234137.0220531e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075723232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1277982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qinyue10aPyrolyzing pharmaceutical sludge to biochar as an efficient adsorbent for deep removal of fluoroquinolone antibiotics from pharmaceutical wastewater: Performance and mechanism  aThis study explored the impact of pyrolysis parameters and modification methods on the characteristics of pharmaceutical sludge biochar, and investigated its capacity and mechanisms for levofloxacin (LEV), a typical fluoroquinolone antibiotics, adsorption. The results showed that SBET of the biochar was improved with temperature increase, but decreased when temperature reached 900 °C. Under the optimal pyrolysis condition of 800 °C and 90 min, the biochar possessed the highest SBET of 264.05 m² g⁻¹, excellent iodine value of 401.41 ± 3.84 mg∙g⁻¹ and phenol adsorption of 57.36 ± 3.39 mg∙g⁻¹. Among KOH, ZnCl₂, and CO₂ modifications, ZnCl₂ modification achieved the highest phenol adsorption of 123.40 ± 4.65 mg g⁻¹, with a significantly improved SBET of 534.91 m² g⁻¹. The maximum LEV adsorption capacity of ZnCl₂ modified biochar, PZBC800, reached 159.26 mg g⁻¹, which overwhelmed the reported sludge biochars. BET, zeta potential, FT-IR, XPS, and Raman analysis, along with quantum chemistry calculation, revealed that pore filling, hydrogen bonding, π-π interaction, surface complexation, and electrostatic interaction were the main mechanisms for the excellent LEV adsorption performance of PZBC800. Deep removal (99.9%) of Fluoroquinolones (FQs) from pharmaceutical wastewater was also achieved by PZBC800 adsorption.

The methods described represent approaches that have already been developed or are currently being implemented in our laboratories. Some techniques are widespread and well known and hence we will focus only in very specific examples, whilst the relatively less common techniques applied in food science are covered in a wider fashion. We made a particular emphasis on the works published on this topic in the last five years. When appropriate, we referred the reader to specialized reports highlighting each technique’s principle and focused on said technologies’ applications in the food analysis field. Each example forwarded will consider the advantages and limitations of the application. Certain study cases will typify that several of the techniques mentioned are used simultaneously to resolve an issue, support novel data, or gather further information from the food sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aapplication technology 3acase studies 3afeed quality 3afields 3afood analysis 3afood quality 3afood research 3afoods 3asafety assessment 3asampling 3awills1 aCortés-Herrera, Carolina 1 aGranados-Chinchilla, Fabio 0 tFoods.g2021 May 13, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100510813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007500170520152600245592002801771650001801799650001401817650003001831650001201861650002601873650001801899650001901917650001401936650001501950650002501965653001701990653001202007653001102019653002902030700002002059700001902079773010402098856008602202852000902288655001202297IND60792126020221120071159.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079212602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1067832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolcott, Scott10aGreen walls as a novel wastewater treatment option for craft breweries  aThe fermentation industry has experienced significant growth as craft breweries and small wineries and cideries are enjoying increased popularity. These beverage manufacturers are also facing increased regulatory pressure to treat wastewater (WW) prior to discharge to the environment and municipal sewer systems. This research assesses the performance of a green wall system in treating brewery WW by measuring reductions in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), turbidity, total solids and total nitrogen. The system includes a green wall column with a 35 L sump and a pump that continuously cycles wastewater at an average rate of 3 L/min through the green wall in a batch process. Experimental scenarios included a control with the pump cycling WW between the sump and an empty column and WW cycled through a media filled column, columns with media and biofilm, and the full system including media, plants and biofilm. After 24 h of treatment, the full system achieved 78%, 97% and 63% reductions of BOD, turbidity and total nitrogen, respectively. The net hydraulic residence time within the green wall column was 40 min over the 24 h treatment period. Although, the WW resided in the green wall columns for only 2.8% of the treatment period, the green wall accounted for 50%, 84%, and 94% of the reduction of BOD, turbidity, and total nitrogen. This green wall system has the potential to provide adequate treatment of brewery wastewater prior to discharge to a municipal sewer system or an onsite treatment system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch systems 3abeverages 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiofilm 3afermentation industry 3asewer systems 3atotal nitrogen 3aturbidity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aLiving walls 0aBiofilm 0aPlants 0aBOD, nitrogen, turbidity1 aEndreny, Ted A.1 aNewman, Lee A.0 tEcological engineering.g2022 Nov., v. 184 p.106783-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1067833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245013200160300001800292500001900310520042800329592002800757650002300785650002400808650002600832650001800858650001900876650001300895653002500908653001800933653003200951653002400983653002701007700002101034700001901055700002101074700002401095773018501119856007501304852000901379655001201388IND60691770220221122035231.0200502e19980101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069177022DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.62.22602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSASSA, Takeshi10aIsolation and Identification of New Antifungal Macrophorins E, F and G as Malonyl Meroterpenes from Botryosphaeria berengeriana  ap. 2260-2262.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMacrophorins E, F and G were newly isolated from Botryosphaeria berengeriana, each showing potent antifungal activity similar to that of macrophorin A against phytopathogenic fungi B. berengeriana and Gibberella fujikuroi.

In this study, we investigated 22 solid bitumen samples from 17 different veins in the Şırnak Province in southeast Turkey using conventional and advanced geochemical tools with respect to their formation. Southeast Turkey is located in an active collision zone from the Alpine orogeny, and compressional pressure occurred with different intensities across the region, generating an overall increase in maturation from west to east. Special focus was paid to the characterization of polar compounds containing nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen (NSO) of high molecular weight using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization in negative ion mode (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). The results indicate that, among possible secondary processes, thermal stress plays the major role in transforming solid bitumen compositions across the region after their initial emplacement in subsurface veins and vugs. Hydrogen Index values and amounts of extractable organic matter correlate well with Tₘₐₓ. A progressive shortening of n-alkyl chains and increasing proportions of aromatic hydrocarbons are observed by pyrolysis-GC. While common maturity ratios based on saturated biomarkers are at equilibrium or saturated biomarkers are below the detection limit for samples with Tₘₐₓ > 450 °C, those based on aromatic hydrocarbons, such as phenanthrenes or alkyldibenzothiophenes, are useful to describe the whole range of thermal chemical alteration. ESI-FT-ICR-MS results reveal a dominance of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (NySz) with 1–2 pyrrolic nitrogen atoms and 0–2 thiophenic sulfur atoms and nitrogen only (Ny) compounds with 1–2 pyrrolic nitrogen atoms. Condensation, aromatization, and side-chain cracking reactions of NSO compounds take place with ongoing maturation, as indicated by double bond equivalent and carbon number distributions. At highest maturation levels, side-chain cracking has proceeded so far that further condensation and aromatization processes are not possible, which can be interpreted as an indication that solid bitumens have formed from migrated, reservoired petroleum and not from source rock kerogen. An increase in oxygen containing compounds indicates oxidation processes which most likely occurred after emplacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aorganic matter 3aionization 3apolar compounds 3acarbon 3amass spectrometry 3apetroleum 3asulfur 3adetection limit 3asulfates 3abiomarkers 3aweathering 3ahydrogen 3aoxidation 3amolecular weight 3aoxygen 3abitumen 3acatalytic cracking 3aphenanthrenes 3anitrogen 3athermal stress 3abiodegradation 3aTurkey (country) 0aphenanthrene1 aHorsfield, Brian1 aPoetz, Stefanie1 aWilkes, Heinz1 aYalçın, M.

Methods: This study included 40 patients undergoing laparoscopy for suspected endometriosis from January to December 2012. Preoperative levels of serum CA125, CA19-9, CEA and mRNA expression levels for survivin and VEGF were obtained. Real-time PCR was used to determine relative gene expression. A new diagnostic score was obtained by deploying the peripheral blood markers to the TVU findings. Statistical methods used were Chi-square, Fisher’s, Student’s t-test or the Mann - Whitney test. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in serum CA125, survivin and VEGF levels in patients with endometriosis and those without endometriosis (p<0.001, p=0.025 and p=0.009, respectively). False negative TVU findings were noted in 3/13 patients (23.1%) with peritoneal endometriosis without ovaries involvement. High sensitivity (93.3%), specificity (90.0%), PPV (96.6%), NPV (81.8%) and accuracy (92.5%) were obtained for a diagnostic score based on TVU and significant peripheral blood markers (CA125, survivin and VEGF). Conclusions: Determination of serum CA125, mRNA expression levels for survivin and VEGF along with TVU can contribute to higher accuracy of the noninvasive diagnostic tools for endometriosis.  aPublisher supplied data 0asurvivin 0aVEGF 0aCA125 0aendometriosis 0alapa - roscopy 0atransvaginal ultrasound1 aVidakovic, Snezana1 aMilic, Natasa1 aJeremic, Katarina1 aMarkovic, Milos1 aMilosevic-Djeric, Ana1 aLazovic-Radonjic, Gordana0 tJournal of Medical Biochemistry.g2015 Dec. 30, v. 35, no. 1 p.63-68dDe Gruyter Openx1452-82667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jomb-2015-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245010500209300001800314500001900332520164300351592002801994650001502022650001602037650001702053650001502070650001902085650002202104650001802126650002002144651001402164653002902178653002302207653002302230653002602253653002102279653002002300700002002320700002002340700002102360773012902381856008102510852000902591655001202600IND60733599220221123014613.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073359922DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800210004832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidoutt, Bradley G1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7352-042713aAn assessment of the water use associated with Australian diets using a planetary boundary framework  ap. 1570-1575.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAgriculture accounts for around 70 % of global freshwater withdrawals. As such, the food system has been identified as a critical intervention point to address water scarcity. Various studies have identified dietary patterns that contribute less to water scarcity. However, it is unclear what level of reduction is necessary to be considered sustainable. The pursuit of unnecessarily aggressive reductions could limit dietary diversity. Our objective was to assess the sustainability of water use supporting Australian dietary habits and the adequacy of current dietary guidelines. Dietary intake data were obtained from the National Nutrition and Physical Activity component of the Australian Health Survey. For each individual daily diet, the water scarcity footprint was quantified, following ISO14046:2014, as well as a diet quality score. Water scarcity footprint results were compared with the planetary boundary for freshwater use downscaled to the level of an individual diet. Australia. 9341 adults participating in the Australian Health Survey. Dietary water scarcity footprints averaged 432·6 L-eq (95 % CI 432·5, 432·8), less than the 695 litres/person per d available to support the current global population of 7·8 billion, and the 603 litres/person per d available for a future population of 9 billion. Diets based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines required 521 L-eq/d, or 379 L-eq/d with lower water scarcity footprint food choices. Diets based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines were found to be within the freshwater planetary boundary. What is needed in Australia is greater compliance with dietary guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3afood intake 3afood quality 3afreshwater 3ahealth surveys 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3awater shortages 3aAustralia 0aAustralian Health Survey 0aDietary guidelines 0aDiscretionary food 0aLife cycle assessment 0aSustainable diet 0aWater footprint1 aBaird, Danielle1 aAnastasiou, Kim1 aHendrie, Gilly A0 tPublic health nutrition.g2021 Apr., v. 24, no. 6 p.1570-1575dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800210004833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03985naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245017700209300001000386506007600396520229400472592002802766506003702794650002002831650002302851650001002874650002002884650001202904650001602916650000902932650001302941650002402954650002102978650002202999650002003021650001503041650000903056650001703065700002203082700001903104700003103123700002703154700003003181700002503211773014103236856008103377852000903458655001203467IND60606738420221207064749.0180727e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060673842DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-014-0064-52doi7 aPMC43076352pmcid7 a256285202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabault, Nicolas10aPea proteins oral supplementation promotes muscle thickness gains during resistance training: a double-blind, randomized, Placebo-controlled clinical trial vs. Whey protein  ap. 3.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The effects of protein supplementation on muscle thickness and strength seem largely dependent on its composition. The current study aimed at comparing the impact of an oral supplementation with vegetable Pea protein (NUTRALYS®) vs. Whey protein and Placebo on biceps brachii muscle thickness and strength after a 12-week resistance training program. METHODS: One hundred and sixty one males, aged 18 to 35 years were enrolled in the study and underwent 12 weeks of resistance training on upper limb muscles. According to randomization, they were included in the Pea protein (n = 53), Whey protein (n = 54) or Placebo (n = 54) group. All had to take 25 g of the proteins or placebo twice a day during the 12-week training period. Tests were performed on biceps muscles at inclusion (D0), mid (D42) and post training (D84). Muscle thickness was evaluated using ultrasonography, and strength was measured on an isokinetic dynamometer. RESULTS: Results showed a significant time effect for biceps brachii muscle thickness (P < 0.0001). Thickness increased from 24.9 ± 3.8 mm to 26.9 ± 4.1 mm and 27.3 ± 4.4 mm at D0, D42 and D84, respectively, with only a trend toward significant differences between groups (P = 0.09). Performing a sensitivity study on the weakest participants (with regards to strength at inclusion), thickness increases were significantly different between groups (+20.2 ± 12.3%, +15.6 ± 13.5% and +8.6 ± 7.3% for Pea, Whey and Placebo, respectively; P < 0.05). Increases in thickness were significantly greater in the Pea group as compared to Placebo whereas there was no difference between Whey and the two other conditions. Muscle strength also increased with time with no statistical difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to an appropriate training, the supplementation with pea protein promoted a greater increase of muscle thickness as compared to Placebo and especially for people starting or returning to a muscular strengthening. Since no difference was obtained between the two protein groups, vegetable pea proteins could be used as an alternative to Whey-based dietary products.

Based on the current available literature, the conclusions of the ISSN are as follows: 1) Four weeks of beta-alanine supplementation (4–6 g daily) significantly augments muscle carnosine concentrations, thereby acting as an intracellular pH buffer; 2) Beta-alanine supplementation currently appears to be safe in healthy populations at recommended doses; 3) The only reported side effect is paraesthesia (tingling), but studies indicate this can be attenuated by using divided lower doses (1.6 g) or using a sustained-release formula; 4) Daily supplementation with 4 to 6 g of beta-alanine for at least 2 to 4 weeks has been shown to improve exercise performance, with more pronounced effects in open end-point tasks/time trials lasting 1 to 4 min in duration; 5) Beta-alanine attenuates neuromuscular fatigue, particularly in older subjects, and preliminary evidence indicates that beta-alanine may improve tactical performance; 6) Combining beta-alanine with other single or multi-ingredient supplements may be advantageous when supplementation of beta-alanine is high enough (4–6 g daily) and long enough (minimum 4 weeks); 7) More research is needed to determine the effects of beta-alanine on strength, endurance performance beyond 25 min in duration, and other health-related benefits associated with carnosine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3abeta-alanine 3acarnosine 3aexercise 3afatigue strength 3amuscles 3apH 3asports nutrition1 aSmith-Ryan, Abbie E.1 aStout, Jeffrey R.1 aHoffman, Jay R.1 aWilborn, Colin D.1 aSale, Craig1 aKreider, Richard B.1 aJäger, Ralf,1 aEarnest, Conrad P.1 aBannock, Laurent1 aCampbell, Bill1 aKalman, Douglas1 aZiegenfuss, Tim N.1 aAntónio, José,0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2015 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.30-30dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-015-0090-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245010600168300001600274500001500290520138100305592002801686650001301714650002401727650001101751650001401762650001801776650001001794650001001804650001401814650001201828650001301840650001901853650001101872650002001883650000901903650001101912650002601923650001801949650001301967651001301980651002301993651001102016651001302027651001102040653001902051653001502070700001902085773011602104856007802220852000902298655001202307IND60238289420221118144019.0160303e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023828942DNAL7 a10.1656/058.014.02182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemlitsch, Raymond D.10aStructure and Dynamics of Lithobates sylvaticus (Wood Frog) at the Periphery of Its Range in Missouri  ap. 329-341.  a2019-12-05  aLithobates (Rana) sylvaticus (Wood Frog) has an extensive distribution primarily in the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern US and throughout Canada and Alaska. However, peripheral populations exist along the southern edge of its range, including in the Ozark regions of Missouri and Arkansas. We present results on the structure and dynamics of 5 Wood Frog populations studied over 4 years (2004–2007) at the edge of the species' range in central Missouri. We used drift fences and pitfall traps surrounding breeding ponds to sample adults and metamorphosing juveniles. We captured breeding males between 7 February and 13 March, and females between 28 February and 16 March. The sex ratio was male-biased (M:F = 2.4), females were larger than males (mean SVL = 61.3 and 52.3 mm, respectively), and the larval period averaged 14 weeks. The metamorphs had a mean SVL of 18.1 mm and varied in number from 0 to 400 individuals per pond per year. The mean juvenile production per female was 8.7 (range = 0–52), and mean survival from egg to juvenile was 1.28% (range = 0–6.08%). Land managers should consider the species' small population sizes, low recruitment, survival rates of terrestrial stages, and the interaction of population dynamics with changing climate conditions when planning for conservation of Wood Frog populations at the periphery of the species' range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanning 3apopulation dynamics 3aadults 3ajuveniles 3apitfall traps 3aponds 3amales 3asex ratio 3afemales 3amanagers 3aclimate change 3alarvae 3apopulation size 3aeggs 3afences 3aLithobates sylvaticus 3asurvival rate 3abreeding 3aMissouri 3aAppalachian region 3aCanada 3aArkansas 3aAlaska 0aRana sylvatica 0aLithobates1 aDrake, Dana L.0 tSoutheastern naturalist.g2015 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.329-341dHumboldt Field Research Institutex1528-70927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656%2F058.014.02183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245007500167300002000242520064100262592002800903650002300931650001300954650002200967650002200989700002101011773012101032856007501153852000901228655001201237IND60550065920221117173332.0160909e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055006592DNAL7 a10.1021/jo401870s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangeswara Rao, G.

Base-induced fragmentation of an oxetanol-type moiety embedded in a tetracyclic norbornyl ketal leads to a cyclobutane-fused derivative as the major or exclusive product. The fragmentation reaction for bridgehead-bromine-substituted derivatives was much faster than for the corresponding chlorine-substituted substrates. The functionalized cyclobutane product was formed exclusively in high yield in the former case, while the latter furnished a minor uncyclized side product in varying yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds1 aKhan, Faiz Ahmed0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 Nov. 01, v. 78, no. 21 p.11092-11095dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo401870s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04163naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003400188245021000222300001100432506007600443520249700519592002803016596004203044506003703086650001303123650001503136650001003151650002103161650001303182650002003195650002303215650001503238650002603253650001003279650001103289650002403300650001103324650001303335650001103348650002103359650001103380650001703391700001603408773014303424856008103567852000903648655001203657IND60606738620221207064748.0180727e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060673862DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-015-0092-92doi7 aPMC45185942pmcid7 a262251302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurkalec-Michalski, Krzysztof14aThe efficacy of a β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate supplementation on physical capacity, body composition and biochemical markers in elite rowers: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study  ap. 31.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyric acid (HMB) is an interesting supplement in sports. However, literature sources present a limited number of studies that verify the efficacy of HMB intake over a longer time period among endurance athletes. For this reason, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of HMB supplementation on physical capacity, body composition and levels of biochemical markers in rowers. METHODS: Sixteen elite male rowers were administered a 12-week HMB supplementation (3×1 gHMB · day⁻¹) and placebo administration (PLA) following the model of a randomised, placebo controlled, double-blind crossover study with a 10 days washout period. Over the course of the experiment, aerobic (maximal oxygen uptake, ventilatory threshold) and anaerobic (anaerobic power indices) capacity were determined, while analyses were conducted on body composition as well as levels of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, testosterone, cortisol and the T/C ratio. A normal distribution of variables was tested using the paired 2-tailed t-tests; the Mann–Whitney U-test or the Wilcoxon-signed rank test were applied for non-normally distributed variables. RESULTS: Following HMB supplementation, [Formula: see text] increased (+2.7 mL · min⁻¹ · kg⁻¹) significantly (p < 0.001) in comparison to its reduction after PLA (−1.0 mL · min⁻¹ · kg⁻¹). In turn, at the ventilatory threshold, a longer time was required to reach this point (+1.2 minHMB vs. −0.2 minPLA, p = 0.012), while threshold load (+0.42 W · kg⁻¹HMB vs. −0.06 W · kg⁻¹PLA, p = 0.002) and threshold heart rate (+9 bpmHMB vs. +1 bpmPLA, p < 0.001) increased. After HMB supplementation, fat mass decreased (−0.9 kgHMB vs. +0.8 kgPLA, p = 0.03). In relation to the initial values after HMB supplementation, the refusal time to continue in the progressive test was extended (p = 0.04), maximum load (p = 0.04) and anaerobic peak power (p = 0.02) increased. However, in relation to the placebo, no differences were observed in anaerobic adaptation or blood marker levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that HMB intake in endurance training has an advantageous effect on the increase in aerobic capacity and the reduction of fat mass. It may also stimulate an increase in peak anaerobic power, while it seems to have no effect on other indices of anaerobic adaptation and levels of investigated markers in the blood.  aPublisher supplied data  aN N312 262340cNarodowe Centrum Nauki0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aathletes 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3abody composition 3acortisol 3acreatine kinase 3across-over studies 3aheart rate 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amales 3amodels 3anormal distribution 3aoxygen 3aplacebos 3asports 3asports nutrition 3at-test 3atestosterone1 aJeszka, Jan0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2015 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.31-31dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-015-0092-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04673naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003400135040001800169100002200187245013100209300001200340506007600352520210300428592002802531506003702559650002002596650002702616650001602643650002602659650002802685650001402713650001202727650003402739650002202773650002502795650001902820650002002839650001202859650001302871650001602884650001002900650000902910650002202919650001002941650005202951650001903003650002803022650002303050650004603073650007503119650001103194650001803205650001903223650001103242650004603253650005303299650007303352650001503425650007903440650002403519650001603543651001003559651002503569700001903594700001703613700002003630710007203650773009203722856008003814852000903894655001203903IND50071538720221207110717.0150211e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007153872DNAL7 a243507142pmid7 aPMC38782522pmcid7 a10.1186/1475-2891-12-1642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Satomi10aHigh protein intake is associated with low prevalence of frailty among old Japanese women: a multicenter cross-sectional study  ap. 741.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Protein intake has been inversely associated with frailty. However, no study has examined the effect of the difference of protein sources (animal or plant) or the amino acid composing the protein on frailty. Therefore, we examined the association of protein and amino acid intakes with frailty among elderly Japanese women. METHODS: A total of 2108 grandmothers or acquaintances of dietetic students aged 65 years and older participated in this cross-sectional multicenter study, which was conducted in 85 dietetic schools in 35 prefectures of Japan. Intakes of total, animal, and plant protein and eight selected amino acids were estimated from a validated brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire and amino acid composition database. Frailty was defined as the presence of three or more of the following four components: slowness and weakness (two points), exhaustion, low physical activity, and unintentional weight loss. RESULTS: The number of subjects with frailty was 481 (23%). Adjusted ORs (95% CI) for frailty in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth quintiles of total protein intake were 1.00 (reference), 1.02 (0.72, 1.45), 0.64 (0.45, 0.93), 0.62 (0.43, 0.90), and 0.66 (0.46, 0.96), respectively (P for trend = 0.001). Subjects categorized to the third, fourth, and fifth quintiles of total protein intake (>69.8 g/d) showed significantly lower ORs than those to the first quintile (all P <0.03). The intakes of animal and plant protein and all selected amino acids were also inversely associated with frailty (P for trend <0.04), with the multivariate adjusted OR in the highest compared to the lowest quintile of 0.73 for animal protein and 0.66 for plant protein, and 0.67-0.74 for amino acids, albeit that the ORs for these dietary variables were less marked than those for total protein. CONCLUSIONS: Total protein intake was significantly inversely associated with frailty in elderly Japanese women.

We confirmed the increased interaction strength of these modified boronic acid receptors using diol-containing dyes such as 4-methylesculetin and alizarin red S as probes in optical spectroscopy experiments. We then translated these results to sugar sensing using the self-assembled [PAMAM-ba·(dye)ₙ] complexes as sensors in an indicator displacement assay. Our approach successfully detected simple sugars (e.g. fructose, glucose, galactose and ribose) in water, traditionally a very challenging medium for carbohydrate detection. Finally, we demonstrated the use of these polymer-based sensors in a multivariate array sensing platform for the discrimination of simple sugars in water as a proof of principle towards their broader applicability under physiologically and environmentally relevant conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3abinding capacity 3aboronic acids 3achemical bonding 3adendrimers 3adyes 3afructose 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amoieties 3areceptors 3aribose 3asolubility 3aspectroscopy1 aBonizzoni, M.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 May 4, v. 4, no. 18 p.3094-3103dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5tb02530c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014300172300001600315520140400331592002801735650002401763650002301787650001301810650003101823650001901854650001101873650001401884650000701898650002201905650001401927653001401941653003901955653001901994653002102013653001702034653002602051700001802077700001602095700001902111700001502130700002202145700002202167773013502189856008702324852000902411655001202420IND60790484820221119040707.0220830e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079048482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.08.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamal, Shagufta10aGraphene oxide/chitosan composites as novel support to provide high yield and stable formulations of pectinase for industrial applications  ap. 683-691.  aAn extracellular pectinase from a mixed consortium of Bacillus sp. (BSP) was immobilized onto graphene oxide/chitosan composite (GO/CS) through covalent binding to enhance its recycling and operational stability features. Different parameters were optimized, including cross-linker concentration (%), time, pH, and GO/CS-pectinase ratios. GO/CS-pectinase was further characterized by FT-IR and XRD. The activity of GO/CS-pectinase was reached up to 804 μmolmin⁻¹ with an immobilization efficiency of 80.64 ± 1.15 % under optimum conditions. GO/CS-pectinase exhibited a 3.0-folds higher half-life (t₁/₂) than free pectinase at 50, 55, and 60 °C, respectively. The Vₘₐₓ and KM values of GO/CS-pectinase were found to be nearly equal to the free pectinase indicating that conformational flexibility was retained. Kd, t₁/₂, ∆G*, ∆H*, and ∆S* of both free pectinase and GO/CS-pectinase was 0.0339 & 0.0721 min⁻¹, 9.62 and 40.44 min, 81.35, 90.72 kJmol⁻¹, 47.098 & 63.635 kJmol⁻¹, −102.86 & −81.340 Jmole⁻¹ K⁻¹. SEM morphological analysis further confirmed the successful binding of pectinase with GO/CS, which retained about 92 % of its original catalytic activity after ten consecutive reaction cycles. Finally, GO/CS-pectinase was employed for guava juice clarification which exhibited the turbidity reduction up to 81 % after 75 min of treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3acatalytic activity 3achitosan 3aclarification (processing) 3agraphene oxide 3aguavas 3ahalf life 3apH 3apolygalacturonase 3aturbidity 0aPectinase 0aGraphene oxide/chitosan composites 0aImmobilization 0aCovalent binding 0aBacillus sp. 0aOperational stability1 aRehman, Saima1 aBibi, Ismat1 aAkhter, Naheed1 aAmir, Rija1 aAlsanie, Walaa F.1 aIqbal, Hafiz M.N.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 220 p.683-691dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.08.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009800169300001800267520100000285592002801285650000801313650001401321650001101335650001801346650001101364650001301375650001401388650002201402650001901424650001901443650003101462650002001493650002401513650000901537650001501546700001501561700001601576700003501592700001601627700001801643773010401661856008901765852000901854655001201863IND60564741420221121230551.0170319e20170316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056474142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b020572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Ping10aSolar Photocatalytic Water Oxidation and Purification on ZIF-8-Derived C–N–ZnO Composites  ap. 2138-2143.  aPhotocatalytic water splitting and purification become more and more important to tackle the severe energy and environment challenges in modern society. In this study, carbon- and nitrogen-modified ZnO photocatalysts were prepared by the controlled thermal decomposition of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-8. ZIF-8 carbonization in a nitrogen atmosphere confined highly dispersive Zn into porous carbon, and the followed calcination in air induced the formation of nanosized ZnO photocatalysts. The physicochemical properties of the photocatalysts were investigated by a variety of characterization techniques, and the photocatalytic performances were evaluated in both oxygen evolution and degradation of dye under solar light. It was found that the two-step synthesis delivered better photocatalyst materials than that from one-step synthesis (directly annealing in nitrogen or air). The co-existence of nitrogen and carbon in ZnO was suggested to be favorable to enhanced photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aannealing 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3aenergy 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphysicochemical properties 3asolar radiation 3athermal degradation 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aZhang, Chi1 aSun, Hongqi1 aLau, R.

Recently, PA has been proposed to stimulate skeletal muscle protein accretion, but mechanistic studies are lacking. Furthermore, it is unknown whether co-ingesting PA with other leucine-containing ingredients can enhance intramuscular anabolic signaling mechanisms. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine if oral PA feeding acutely increases anabolic signaling markers and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in gastrocnemius with and without whey protein concentrate (WPC). METHODS: Overnight fasted male Wistar rats (~250 g) were randomly assigned to four groups: control (CON, n = 6-13), PA (29 mg; n = 8), WPC (197 mg; n = 8), or PA + WPC (n = 8). Three hours post-feeding, gastrocnemius muscle was removed for markers of Akt-mTOR signaling, gene expression patterns related to skeletal muscle mass regulation and metabolism, and MPS analysis via the SUnSET method. RESULTS: Compared to CON rats, PA, WPC and PA + WPC resulted in a significant elevation in the phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2481) and rps6 (Ser235/236) (p < 0.05) in the gastrocnemius though there were no differences between the supplemented groups. MPS levels in the gastrocnemius were significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in WPC versus CON rats, and tended to be elevated in PA versus CON rats (p = 0.08), though MPS was less in PA + WPC versus WPC rats (p < 0.05) in spite of robust increases in mTOR pathway activity markers in the former group. C₂C₁₂ myoblast data agreed with the in vivo data herein showing that PA increased MPS levels 51 % (p < 0.001) phosphorylated p70s6k (Thr389) levels 67 % (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are the first in vivo evidence to demonstrate that PA tends to increases MPS 3 h post-feeding, though PA may delay WPC-mediated MPS kinetics within a 3 h post-feeding window.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agene expression regulation 3aingredients 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3amyoblasts 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3asports nutrition 3awhey protein concentrate1 aHornberger, Troy A.1 aFox, Carlton D.1 aHealy, James C.1 aFerguson, Brian S.1 aLowery, Ryan P.1 aMcNally, Rachel M.1 aLockwood, Christopher M.1 aStout, Jeffrey R.1 aKavazis, Andreas N.1 aWilson, Jacob M.1 aRoberts, Michael D.0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2015 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.32-32dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-015-0094-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245008700199300001800286500001900304500002000323520203600343592002802379596002502407596002602432650002402458650001502482650001102497650002402508700006202532700006002594773012802654856007902782852000902861655001202870IND60720129620221119000420.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072012962DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.133522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvgar, Tal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8764-697610aHabitat selection patterns are density dependent under the ideal free distribution  ap. 2777-2787.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite being widely used, habitat selection models are rarely reliable and informative when applied across different ecosystems or over time. One possible explanation is that habitat selection is context‐dependent due to variation in consumer density and/or resource availability. The goal of this paper is to provide a general theoretical perspective on the contributory mechanisms of consumer and resource density‐dependent habitat selection, as well as on our capacity to account for their effects. Towards this goal we revisit the ideal free distribution (IFD), where consumers are assumed to be omniscient, equally competitive and freely moving, and are hence expected to instantaneously distribute themselves across a heterogeneous landscape such that fitness is equalised across the population. Although these assumptions are clearly unrealistic to some degree, the simplicity of the structure in IFD provides a useful theoretical vantage point to help clarify our understanding of more complex spatial processes. Of equal importance, IFD assumptions are compatible with the assumptions underlying common habitat selection models. Here we show how a fitness‐maximising space use model, based on IFD, gives rise to resource and consumer density‐dependent shifts in consumer distribution, providing a mechanistic explanation for the context‐dependent outcomes often reported in habitat selection analysis. Our model suggests that adaptive shifts in consumer distribution patterns would be expected to lead to nonlinear and often non‐monotonic patterns of habitat selection. These results indicate that even under the simplest of assumptions about adaptive organismal behaviour, habitat selection strength should critically depend on system‐wide characteristics. Clarifying the impact of adaptive behavioural responses may be pivotal in making meaningful ecological inferences about observed patterns of habitat selection and allow reliable transferability of habitat selection predictions across time and space.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Guelph  cNSERC Discovery Grant 3ahabitat preferences 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics1 aBetini, Gustavo S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0707-41281 aFryxell, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5278-87470 tjournal of animal ecology.g2020 Dec., v. 89, no. 12 p.2777-2787dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.133523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002400185245026200209300001400471520176500485592002802250653001602278653001402294653002402308700002602332700002602358700002602384700002502410700002002435700002702455700001902482700002002501773010702521856007802628852000902706655001202715IND60481859620221118124042.0160212e20151230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048185962DNAL7 a10.1515/jomb-2015-00092doi7 aPMC53467982pmcid7 a283568612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBačković, Dragana10aInfluence of Cyp2c19*2 Gene Variant on Therapeutic Response During Clopidogrel Treatment in Patients with Carotid Artery Stenosis/ Uticaj cyp2c19*2 varijante gena na terapijski odgovor u toku primene klopidogrela kod bolesnika sa stenozom karotidne arterije  ap. 26-33.  aBackground: Despite the proven clinical effect of oral antiplatelet drugs, a considerable number of patients do not have an adequate response to clopidogrel. The aim of our study was to determine the influence of CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function variant allele on clopidogrel responsiveness in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Methods: One hundred and twelve patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing endarterectomy were included in this one-year prospective study. All of them received clopidogrel (75 mg daily) for at least 30 days after the intervention. They were followed from the moment of hospital admission. CYP2C19*2 genotyping was performed by TaqMan Assay. The influence of CYP2C19*2 variant allele on clopidogrel platelet reactivity was determined using multiple-electrode aggregometry (MEA). Results: Genotyping results showed that 82 (73.2%) patients were homozygous for wild type, 29 (25.9%) were heterozygous for the CYP2C19*2 allele and 1 (0.9%) was CYP2C19*2 homozygous. After 24 hours, among those with the wild type 29.3% were clopidogrel responders, and in those with the CYP2C19*2 alleles 10%. In the wild type group, 74.4% were clopidogrel responders after 7 days of taking the drug; 82.9% after 30 days of clopidogrel introduction, respectively. In patients with the CYP2C19*2 alleles the number of responders increased up to 46.7% after 7 days; 53.3% after 30 days of taking the drug, respectively. The risk for being a low-responder is higher for the patients heterozygous for the CYP2C19*2 allele vs. wildtype (OR 4.250, 95% CI 1.695-10.658, P<0.01).Conclusions: The CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function variant allele has significant influence on clopidogrel response in patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing endarterectomy.  aPublisher supplied data 0aclopidogrel 0aCYP2C19*2 0aplatelet reactivity1 aIgnjatović, Svetlana1 aRakićević, Ljiljana1 aKusić-Tišma, Jelena1 aRadojković, Dragica1 aČalija, Branko1 aStrugarević, Evgenija1 aRadak, Đorđe1 aKovach, Mirjana0 tJournal of Medical Biochemistry.g2015 Dec. 30, v. 35, no. 1 p.26-33dDe Gruyter Openx1452-82667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jomb-2015-00093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009800166300001200264520126000276592002801536650002501564650001401589650001801603650001101621650002601632650001601658650002801674650002001702650001001722650001301732650003101745700002201776700001701798700002101815700002201836700001901858700002301877773011101900852000902011856008202020655001202102IND4433080420221119081734.0190314e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443308042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-009-1060-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKijidani, Yoshio10aEffect of height-to-diameter ratio on stem stiffness of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) cultivars  ap. 1-6.  aThe lumber from sugi plantations in Japan displays large intra- and intertree variation in mechanical properties, even within a stand. These variations seem to be induced by the effects of the characteristics of cultivars as well as the effects of growth traits on mechanical properties. Therefore, the effects of growth traits on mechanical properties per cultivar need to be precisely examined. In this study, we focused on the effects of growth traits, especially height-to-diameter ratio (H/D ratio), on stem stiffness per cultivar. Sixteen cultivars were classified into three groups according to the relationships between stem stiffness and growth traits. In cultivars that showed a close correlation between growth traits and stem stiffness, it was assumed that stem stiffness could be controlled to a certain extent by silvicultural practices using the H/D ratio as an indicator. In cultivars that showed a weak correlation between growth traits and stem stiffness, selecting cultivars for the production of logs with higher mechanical properties seemed to be effective; in this study, Kumotoshi, Tanoaka, and Edanaga were found to be suitable. Tree age and site index may be important factors for producing wood with higher mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3acultivars 3agrowth traits 3alumber 3amechanical properties 3aplantations 3asilvicultural practices 3astem elongation 3astems 3atree age 3awood mechanical properties1 aHamazuna, Tetsuya1 aIto, Satoshi1 aKitahara, Ryushi1 aFukuchi, Shinsuke1 aMizoue, Nobuya1 aYoshida, Shigejiro0 tJournal of wood science.g2010 Feb., v. 56, no. 1 p.1-6dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-009-1060-23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02545naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245012200175300001800297520135900315592002801674650004401702650001401746650003101760650001801791650002301809650001301832650001101845650001401856650001601870700002001886700002101906700002101927700002101948773010401969856008902073852000902162655001202171IND60564741520170630000000.0170319e20170316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056474152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b020612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThion, Sébastien10aExperimental and Detailed Kinetic Modeling Study of Cyclopentanone Oxidation in a Jet-Stirred Reactor at 1 and 10 atm  ap. 2144-2155.  aCyclopentanone oxidation was studied in a jet-stirred reactor at 1 and 10 atm and over the temperature range of 730–1280 K for fuel-lean (φ = 0.5), stoichiometric, and fuel-rich (φ = 2) mixtures. A total of 16 reaction intermediates and products were identified and quantified using online Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and offline gas chromatography. A kinetic submodel was developed, supported by theoretical calculations for the rate constants of hydrogen abstraction reactions by H atoms and OH and CH₃ radicals at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. The resulting model consisting of 343 species involved in 2065 reactions was used to simulate the present experiments and showed good agreement with the data. The main oxygenated intermediates are aldehydes, and cyclopentenone was also found to be an important species for cyclopentanone oxidation. The rate of production analyses showed that cyclopentanone is mainly consumed by a sequence of reactions producing CO and the but-1-en-4-yl radical. Unimolecular reactions reported in the literature were found to have a very low contribution to the fuel consumption in our experimental conditions. It was finally highlighted that some of the discrepancies observed between the simulation and experiments arise from the chemistry of cyclopentenone that would need to be more detailed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaldehydes 3aenergy use and consumption 3afree radicals 3agas chromatography 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aoxidation 3atemperature1 aTogbé, Casimir1 aDayma, Guillaume1 aSerinyel, Zeynep1 aDagaut, Philippe0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Mar. 16, v. 31, no. 3 p.2144-2155dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b020613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245011800183300001600301520177600317592002802093650002302121650001902144650001902163650001702182650001702199650001802216650001702234650001002251650002102261650002502282650001402307650001802321650002602339650002202365650004102387650001202428650001802440650001702458650005002475650003702525650002802562650001402590650002702604650003902631650003402670650002702704650002402731651001402755651001602769651001602785700002102801700001902822700002102841700002302862773009502885856008102980852000903061655001203070IND50067437020221121220312.0150207e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006743702DNAL7 a233449682pmid7 a10.1007/s10126-013-9493-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVicente, Jan10aBiodiversity of Actinomycetes Associated with Caribbean Sponges and Their Potential for Natural Product Discovery  ap. 413-424.  aMarine actinomycetes provide a rich source of structurally unique and bioactive secondary metabolites. Numerous genera of marine actinomycetes have been isolated from marine sediments as well as several sponge species. In this study, 16 different species of Caribbean sponges were collected from four different locations in the coastal waters off Puerto Rico in order to examine diversity and bioactive metabolite production of marine actinomycetes in Caribbean sponges. Sediments were also collected from each location, in order to compare actinomycete communities between these two types of samples. A total of 180 actinomycetes were isolated and identified based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of at least 14 new phylotypes belonging to the genera Micromonospora, Verruscosispora, Streptomyces, Salinospora, Solwaraspora, Microbacterium and Cellulosimicrobium. Seventy-eight of the isolates (19 from sediments and 59 from sponges) shared 100 % sequence identity with Micromonospora sp. R1. Despite having identical 16S rRNA sequences, the bioactivity of extracts and subsequent fractions generated from the fermentation of both sponge- and sediment-derived isolates identical to Micromonospora sp. R1 varied greatly, with a marked increase in antibiotic metabolite production in those isolates derived from sponges. These results indicate that the chemical profiles of isolates with high 16S rRNA sequence homology to known strains can be diverse and dependent on the source of isolation. In addition, seven previously reported dihydroquinones produced by five different Streptomyces strains have been purified and characterized from one Streptomyces sp. strain isolated in this study from the Caribbean sponge Agelas sceptrum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCellulosimicrobium 3aMicrobacterium 3aMicromonospora 3aStreptomyces 3abiodiversity 3acoastal water 3afermentation 3agenes 3amarine sediments 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence homology 2aActinobacteriaxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiodiversity 2aBiological Productsxisolation & purification 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPoriferaxmicrobiology 2aQuinonesxisolation & purification 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 3aCaribbean 3aPuerto Rico 0aPuerto Rico1 aStewart, Allison1 aSong, Bongkeun1 aHill, Russell T.1 aWright, Jeffrey L.0 tMarine biotechnology.g2013 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.413-424dSpringer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-013-9493-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010400171300001600275520144900291592002801740650001301768650003001781650002101811650002501832650001401857650002701871650002301898650001301921650001901934650001401953650002901967650001601996650002102012650001902033650001402052650001002066650001502076650002102091650001302112650002502125653001902150653001302169653001302182653002102195653001302216700002302229700002302252700001602275700002102291773008802312856005102400852000902451655001202460IND50087087520221120200127.0140412e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008708752DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2010.5042362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChebli, Derradji10aIntegration of photocatalysis and biological treatment for azo dye removal – application to AR183  ap. 507-514.  aThe feasibility of coupling photocatalysis with biological treatment to treat effluents containing azo dyes was examined in this work. With this aim, the degradation of Acid Red 183 was investigated. The very low biodegradability of AR183 was confirmed beforehand by measuring the biological oxygen demand (BOD₅). Photocatalysis experiments were carried out in a closed‐loop step photoreactor. The reactor walls were covered by TiO₂ catalyst coated on non‐woven paper, and the effluent flowed over the photocatalyst as a thin falling film. The removal of the dye was 82.7% after 4 h, and a quasi‐complete decolorization (98.5%) was obtained for 10 h of irradiation (initial concentration 100 mg L⁻¹). The decrease in concentration followed pseudo‐first‐order kinetics, with a constant k of 0.47 h⁻¹. Mineralization and oxidation yields were 80% and 75%, respectively, after 10 h of pretreatment. Therefore, even if target compound oxidation occurs (COD removal), indicating a modification to the chemical structure, the concomitant high mineralization was not in favour of subsequent microbial growth. The BOD₅ measurement confirmed the non‐biodegradability of the irradiated solution, which remained toxic since the EC₅₀ decreased from 35 to 3 mg L⁻¹. The proposed integrated process appeared, therefore, to be not relevant for the treatment of AR183. However, this result should be confirmed for other azo dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo dyes 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradability 3abiological treatment 3acatalysts 3achemical oxygen demand 3achemical structure 3acoatings 3adecolorization 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental technology 3airradiation 3amicrobial growth 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3apaper 3aphotolysis 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 0aphotocatalysis 0aazo dyes 0akinetics 0abiodegradability 0atoxicity1 aFourcade, Florence1 aBrosillon, Stephan1 aNacef, Saci1 aAmrane, Abdeltif0 tEnvironmental technology.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 32, no. 5 p.507-514dTFx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.504236  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245011600177300001400293520174000307592002802047650001002075650001502085650001302100650001202113650001702125650001402142650001102156650001702167650002602184650001002210650001102220650001702231653001402248653000902262653001602271653001402287653002302301700001602324700001602340700001802356700001802374773011002392856009002502852000902592655001202601IND60526308020221121221827.0190405e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsteller-Vico, A.10aEffects of estradiol on uterine perfusion in anesthetized cyclic mares affected with uterine vascular elastosis  ap. 57-63.  aUterine vascular elastosis in mares is characterized by degeneration of uterine vasculature through thickening of the elastin layers. Factors commonly associated with this degeneration include age, parity, and chronic uterine endometritis. Affected mares have also been shown to exhibit decreases in uterine blood flow and perfusion of the uterus. Due to the increased thickness of the elastin layers, we hypothesize that vasodilatation of the uterine vasculature is also impaired. To test the functionality of these vessels, we evaluated the vasodilatory effects of estradiol on the uterine vascular bed in mares with normal vasculature and mares with severe elastosis. Both groups were tested in estrus and diestrus. Fluorescent microspheres were used to determine basal blood perfusion, followed by the intravenous administration of 1.0μg/kg of 17β-estradiol. After 90min, perfusion was measured once again to determine the vascular response to estradiol. Control mares in estrus displayed a significant increase in total uterine blood flow after the administration of estradiol when compared to baseline levels. No other group had a significant increase in total blood flow and perfusion after estradiol administration. The administration of estradiol in control mares induced regional increases in perfusion in the uterine horns and uterine body during estrus and only in the uterine horns during diestrus. Mares affected by elastosis exhibited no regional differences in perfusion levels post-estradiol administration. The difference in the vasodilatory response induced by estradiol between reproductively healthy mares and mares affected with elastosis indicates that the functionality of the affected vessels is compromised.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood flow 3adiestrus 3aelastin 3aendometritis 3aestradiol 3aestrus 3afluorescence 3aintravenous injection 3amares 3auterus 3avasodilation 0aElastosis 0aMare 0aInfertility 0aEstradiol 0aUterine blood flow1 aLiu, I.K.M.1 aVaughan, B.1 aSteffey, E.P.1 aBrosnan, R.J.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2016 Jan., v. 164 p.57-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014600165300001600311520177000327592002802097650002102125650003702146650001302183650001602196650001502212650001702227650001902244650001502263650002102278650001202299650001302311650001902324650001402343650000902357650001302366650002002379653005102399653005002450653004802500653002402548653001502572653004202587700001602629700001702645700001702662773012202679856008202801852000902883655001202892IND60597579420221118130157.0181015e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2017.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yimeng10aControl of aliphatic halogenated DBP precursors with multiple drinking water treatment processes: Formation potential and integrated toxicity  ap. 322-330.  aThe comprehensive control efficiency for the formation potentials (FPs) of a range of regulated and unregulated halogenated disinfection by-products (DBPs) (including carbonaceous DBPs (C-DBPs), nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs), and iodinated DBPs (I-DBPs)) with the multiple drinking water treatment processes, including pre-ozonation, conventional treatment (coagulation–sedimentation, pre-sand filtration), ozone-biological activated carbon (O3-BAC) advanced treatment, and post-sand filtration, was investigated. The potential toxic risks of DBPs by combing their FPs and toxicity values were also evaluated. The results showed that the multiple drinking water treatment processes had superior performance in removing organic/inorganic precursors and reducing the formation of a range of halogenated DBPs. Therein, ozonation significantly removed bromide and iodide, and thus reduced the formation of brominated and iodinated DBPs. The removal of organic carbon and nitrogen precursors by the conventional treatment processes was substantially improved by O3-BAC advanced treatment, and thus prevented the formation of chlorinated C-DBPs and N-DBPs. However, BAC filtration leads to the increased formation of brominated C-DBPs and N-DBPs due to the increase of bromide/DOC and bromide/DON. After the whole multiple treatment processes, the rank order for integrated toxic risk values caused by these halogenated DBPs was haloacetonitriles (HANs)≫haloacetamides (HAMs)>haloacetic acids (HAAs)>trihalomethanes (THMs)>halonitromethanes (HNMs)≫I-DBPs (I-HAMs and I-THMs). I-DBPs failed to cause high integrated toxic risk because of their very low FPs. The significant higher integrated toxic risk value caused by HANs than other halogenated DBPs cannot be ignored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abromides 3abromination 3abyproducts 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3afiltration 3ahaloacetic acids 3aiodides 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aozonation 3arisk 3atoxicity 3awater treatment 0aCarbonaceous disinfection by-products (C-DBPs) 0aNitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs) 0aIodinated disinfection by-products (I-DBPs) 0aFormation potential 0aToxic risk 0aDrinking water treatment plant (DWTP)1 aChu, Wenhai1 aYao, Dechang1 aYin, Daqiang0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2017 Aug., v. 58 p.322-330dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2017.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245016400172300001600336520164100352592002801993650001502021650000902036650003302045650001002078650002102088650002002109650001702129650001202146650002402158650001902182650002502201653001202226653001102238653001602249653001202265653001402277653001402291700001702305700001602322700001402338700001602352773011202368856009002480852000902570655001202579IND60526308520221121235012.0190405e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDan, Xingang10aEffect of the novel DNA vaccine fusing inhibin α (1-32) and the RF-amide related peptide-3 genes on immune response, hormone levels and fertility in Tan sheep  ap. 105-110.  aThe objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of novel DNA vaccines fusing inhibin (INH) α (1-32) and RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3) genes on the immune response, reproductive hormone levels, and fertility of Tan sheep. Thirty-two female Tan sheep were divided into four groups (groups A, B, C, and D with 8 sheep per group) and respectively immunized (thrice, 20 d apart) with 0.6mg of p-TPA-SINH/TPA-SRFRP (group A), p-SINH/SRFRP (group B), p-SINH (group C) or 0.4ml saline (group D). Twenty days after primary immunization, all vaccines elicited significant immune responses, and the antibody levels of anti-INH and anti-RFRP-3 in the vaccinated groups were significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of the control group. Immunization with p-TPA-SINH/TPA-SRFRP induced higher antibodies against INH and RFRP-3. Hormone levels of FSH and LH in group A immunized with p-TPA-SINH/TPA-SRFRP were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those in group C, which are immunized with p-SINH and the control group 20 d after the third immunization. Additionally, the p-TPA-SINH/TPA-SRFRP, p-SINH/SRFRP, p-SINH and saline vaccine induced different twinning rate of ewes (37.5%, 37.5%, 12.5%, and 0, respectively), but no significant differences were found in improving twinning rate of ewes among four groups. These results suggested that neutralization of endogenous INH and RFRP-3 with novel DNA vaccine fusing INH α (1-32) and RFRP-3 genes successfully elicited a humoral immune response, increased reproductive hormone levels, but it did not significantly improve litter sizes and twinning rate of ewes in the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aewes 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agenes 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3ainhibin 3aluteinizing hormone 3aneutralization 3arecombinant vaccines 0aInhibin 0aRFRP-3 0aDNA vaccine 0aHormone 0aFertility 0aTan sheep1 aLiu, Xiaoran1 aHan, Yanguo1 aLiu, Qing1 aYang, Liguo0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2016 Jan., v. 164 p.105-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011500168300001400283520232300297592002802620650001502648650002202663650001202685650001102697650001402708650001102722650001102733650001302744651001102757700002402768700002602792700002002818700002202838700001802860773009102878856008102969990002303050852000903073655001203082IND60096205420221119044524.0141104e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009620542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2011.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCovelli, Stefano10aSpatial variation, speciation and sedimentary records of mercury in the Guanabara Bay (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)  ap. 29-42.  aAs part of the “TAGUBAR” (TAngential GUanabara Bay Aeration Recovery) project, surface and long core sediments of the Guanabara Bay (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) were investigated for mercury (Hg). The main, but not the only, input of Hg into the Bay's waters is known to be a Chlor-Alkali Plant (CAP) located in the Acarì-São João de Merití River system, on the northwestern side of the Bay. Mercury distribution in surface sediments (<0.1–3.22mgkg⁻¹, average 0.87±0.80, n=40) seems to be controlled by the organic component, along with sulfur rather than grain-size, where Hg concentrations are less than 1mgkg⁻¹. Conversely, where the metal contents are higher than 1mgkg⁻¹, accumulation in surface sediments is mostly related to the presence of nearby contamination sources, such as industrial and urban settlements in the western sector of the Bay. Although total Hg contents in surface sediments exceed the values suggested by the effects-based standard quality guidelines as potentially toxic for the benthic community, results from a sequential extraction procedure showed that the contribution of the more soluble, easily exchangeable and eventually bioavailable Hg phases was found almost negligible (<0.1%). Most of the metal is strongly bound to the mineral lattice of the sedimentary matrix and should therefore be considered almost immobilized. The reduction in Hg accumulation in bottom sediments, expected as a consequence of the adoption of contamination control policies (i.e. Hg-free technologies in the CAP and sewage treating facilities), has not been clearly observed in the core profiles. Current estimates of Hg accumulation rates at the core top range from approximately 1 to 18mgm⁻²yr⁻¹. Pre-industrial bottom core samples indicate that the central and northeastern sectors of the Bay are strongly affected by Hg enrichment: concentrations exceed the estimated baseline concentration by up to 20 factors. A cumulative Hg inventory suggests that the metal content has increased with the same order of magnitude in the vicinity of potential contamination sources on the western side of the Bay, but at a different rate; this is apparently determined by local conditions. A natural attenuation of Hg concentrations to background levels is not predictable in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguidelines 3aissues and policy 3amercury 3arivers 3asediments 3asewage 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3aBrazil1 aProtopsalti, Ioanna1 aAcquavita, Alessandro1 aSperle, Marcelo1 aBonardi, Maurizio1 aEmili, Andrea0 tContinental shelf research.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 35 p.29-42dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245017100175300001800346520189500364592002802259650002302287650001202310650001302322650001502335650003102350650001302381650002202394650001302416650001202429650002602441650000902467650001502476653001702491653001702508653002202525653002102547653001502568700002702583700002002610700001602630700002002646773012902666856008502795852000902880655001202889IND60568191020221119113100.0170502e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056819102DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b000122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChuang, Chuan-Chung10aSimple Synthesis of Eco-Friendly Multifunctional Silk-Sericin Capped Zinc Oxide Nanorods and Their Potential for Fabrication of Hydrogen Sensors and UV Photodetectors  ap. 4002-4010.  aThe present investigation describes a new eco-friendly, low cost material-based approach for sensor device fabrication. In this study, sericin capped zinc oxide nanorod (ZNR)-based H₂ gas sensors and UV photodetectors were fabricated by incorporating silk-sericin with ZnO. The proposed sensors have higher sensitivity to H₂ and greater photoresponsivity. The sericin capped ZNRs were fabricated from a degummed waste sericin solution using an inexpensive hydrothermal method. The sericin capped ZNRs show excellent H₂ gas response (17.8%) and photoresponse with a fast response time under UV illumination due to sericin coating on the surface of the ZnO. Sericin is a water-soluble protein with strong polar groups as side chains, such as carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl groups, which can easily interact with zinc particles through electrostatic interactions, resulting in the unique and improved ZnO sensor behavior. This interaction was characterized by various analytical techniques and compared with as-grown ZNR. The gas sensing property and UV photoresponse were evaluated for both as-grown ZNRs and sericin capped ZNRs as functions of the H₂ concentration and time, respectively. Under 365 nm UV illumination, the sericin capped ZNR possesses an ultrahigh photoresponse of 408.4, which is 40 times better than that of the as-prepared ZnO devices (10.3). Moreover, the sensing response for the sericin capped ZNRs shows a complete recovery to the original level after evacuation of the H₂ and UV illumination in each cycle, indicating complete desorption and decomposition of the main adsorbed moieties. The sericin capped ZNR presented in this work shows enhanced, sustained, and reversible H₂ gas sensing and fast switching speed in the UV region and can be employed for the development of inorganic–organic novel materials utilizing the biomass from industrial waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiomass 3acoatings 3adesorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen 3aindustrial wastes 3ananorods 3asericin 3aultraviolet radiation 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aBiorenewable 0aSilk-sericin 0aZnO photoresponse 0aUV photodetector 0aH2 sensors1 aPrasannan, Adhimoorthy1 aHuang, Bohr-Ran1 aHong, Po-Da1 aChiang, Ming-Yu0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 May 01, v. 5, no. 5 p.4002-4010dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b000123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013900162300001400301520133600315592002801651650001201679650001901691650002201710650001001732650000801742650001801750650001901768650001901787650001401806650001101820651002101831700001301852700001501865700001601880700001601896773009101912856008102003990002302084852000902107655001202116IND60096205620221119044526.0141104e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009620562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2011.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSañé, E.10aBenthic macrofauna assemblages and biochemical properties of sediments in two Antarctic regions differently affected by climate change  ap. 53-63.  aLipid, protein and carbohydrate concentrations have been determined in sediment cores from the continental shelf in the South Eastern Weddell Sea (SEWS), where no ice shelves have been present at least for thousands of years, and the continental shelf off the Eastern Antarctic Peninsula (EAP), in the area where two ice shelf collapses occurred in 1995 and 2002. On one hand, SEWS presents an important flux of fresh organic matter to the seabed during summer, whereas on the other hand, the presence of ice shelves in EAP hampered photosynthesis restricting the input of organic matter to advected refractory material. In the present study, biochemical variables and benthic macrofauna abundance, biomass and diversity confirmed differences between the two regions. Lipid concentrations were higher in SEWS than in EAP, whereas carbohydrate concentrations were higher in the latter region. These differences were attributed to the higher concentration of labile and refractory material, respectively. Biomass, abundance and diversity of the macrofauna were higher in SEWS than in EAP, where benthic communities started receiving a fresh organic matter input only after the recent ice shelf collapses. As regards macrofauna composition, both regions presented macrobenthic communities associated to early stages of recolonization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acontinental shelf 3afauna 3aice 3alipid content 3aorganic matter 3aphotosynthesis 3asediments 3asummer 3aAntarctic region1 aIsla, E.1 aGerdes, D.1 aMontiel, A.1 aGili, J.-M.0 tContinental shelf research.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 35 p.53-63dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2011.12.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245010400183300001800287500001500305520139100320592002801711650001701739650001301756650001101769650002901780650001501809650002601824650001701850650002401867650001201891650002501903650002901928650001701957650002501974651001101999653002302010653002502033653003102058653001802089653002302107700003102130700004702161700003802208700003202246773012902278856008502407852000902492655001202501IND60568191120171219000000.0170502e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056819112DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b000152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuiroz-Ramírez, Juan José10aOptimal Planning of Feedstock for Butanol Production Considering Economic and Environmental Aspects  ap. 4018-4030.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper presents a multiobjective optimization to obtain the optimal planning of butanol production, considering the optimal selection of feedstock and the correct ratio of fermentable sugars. This multiobjective methodology was applied during both the fermentation and purification process of butanol. The multiobjective optimization problem considers minimizing the total annual cost and environmental impact as objective function. The economic objective function takes into account the availability of bioresources, the cost of feedstocks, the fermentation conditions, and the separation units. On the other hand, the environmental assessment includes the overall impact measured through the eco-indicator 99 which is based on a life cycle analysis methodology. Both objective functions were applied to a case study for the optimal planning to produce biobutanol in Mexico. After the optimization process, we generated a set of solutions represented by a Pareto curve that identifies a group of optimal solutions for both objectives. Considering the best compromise of both targets, the best solution involves initially a raw material with a moderate content of sugars followed by a separation unit designed as a hybrid separation process. This hybrid process considers the inclusion of a liquid–liquid extraction column followed by three thermally coupled distillation columns.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3aplanning 3asugars 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3afeedstocks 3alife cycle assessment 3adistillation 3asystem optimization 3abutanol 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental assessment 3acase studies 3apurification methods 3aMexico 0aFermentable sugars 0aButanol fermentation 0aButanol feedstock planning 0araw materials 0aButanol production1 aSánchez-Ramírez, Eduardo1 aHernández, Salvadorq(Hernández Castro),1 aSegovia-Hernández, Juan Gabriel,1 aPonce-Ortega, José María,0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 May 01, v. 5, no. 5 p.4018-4030dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b000153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015600170300001600326520121400342592002801556650001401584650002901598650001701627650001301644650001601657650001101673650001501684650001701699650001401716650001901730651001101749651001801760653002701778653002301805653001701828653001301845653001101858700001701869700001901886773008801905856005101993852000902044655001202053IND50087088520221120200432.0140412e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008708852DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2010.5064912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKakosimos, K.E.10aApplication and evaluation of AERMOD on the assessment of particulate matter pollution caused by industrial activities in the Greater Thessaloniki area  ap. 593-608.  aIndustrial activities are sources of high emission rates of particulate matter. The existence of many such industrial plants close to a densely populated area can have a severe effect on human health. The effects can be even worse when these emissions are added to existing background concentration levels. This study deals with the assessment of the primary particulate matter pollution caused by industrial activities close to the city of Thessaloniki in Greece. An atmospheric dispersion and regulatory model was employed, i.e. AERMOD from the US Environmental Pollution Agency. A new PM₁₀ emission sources inventory was prepared for the main industrial plants of the area and the annual and monthly average concentrations from 2003 to 2007 were calculated. The results from AERMOD were validated against data from available monitoring stations and showed reasonably good agreement. It was estimated that industry contributes approximately 30% of primary PM₁₀ on the western suburbs of the city and about 7% in the city centre. The effect of the wind direction was also studied and it was illustrated that the frequent southwest winds present higher concentration levels than the strong north ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aenvironmental technology 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3ainventories 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3apollution 3awind direction 3aGreece 3aUnited States 0aatmospheric dispersion 0aparticulate matter 0aThessaloniki 0aindustry 0aAERMOD1 aAssael, M.J.1 aKatsarou, A.S.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 32, no. 6 p.593-608dTFx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.506491  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005100144245014000195520134900335592002801684650001101712650003101723650002901754650002101783650002201804650001601826650002401842650001201866650000901878650001001887650001601897650001901913650001401932650001401946650002401960650002101984650001302005650000902018650001702027650003102044650002702075700003302102700003002135700003402165700004602199700003902245700003002284700003802314700003902352700002602391700003702417700002702454700003502481700003902516700002102555700004602576700003602622773011902658856007802777852000902855655001202864IND60702436720221120055502.0200718e20200530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070243672DNAL7 a10.3390/biology90601142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira Brito Pereira Bezerra Martins, Anita 10aAnti-Inflammatory and Physicochemical Characterization of the Croton rhamnifolioides Essential Oil Inclusion Complex in β-Cyclodextrin  aCroton rhamnifolioides is used in popular medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The objective of this study was to characterize and evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of C. rhamnifolioides essential oil complexed in β-cyclodextrin (COEFC). The physicochemical characterization of the complexes was performed using different physical methods. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in vivo by ear edema, paw edema, cotton pellet-induced granuloma, and vascular permeability by Evans blue extravasation. The mechanism of action was validated by molecular docking of the major constituent into the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2 enzyme). All doses of the COEFC reduced acute paw edema induced by carrageenan and dextran, as well as vascular permeability. Our results suggest the lowest effective dose of all samples inhibited the response induced by histamine or arachidonic acid as well as the granuloma formation. The complexation process showed that the pharmacological effects were maintained, however, showing similar results using much lower doses. The results demonstrated an involvement of the inhibition of pathways dependent on eicosanoids and histamine. Complexation of β-cyclodextrin/Essential oil (β-CD/EO) may present an important tool in the study of new compounds for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCroton 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aarachidonic acid 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acarrageenan 3acomputer simulation 3adextran 3aears 3aedema 3aeicosanoids 3aessential oils 3agranuloma 3ahistamine 3amechanism of action 3amedicinal plants 3amedicine 3aoils 3apermeability 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprostaglandin synthase1 aWanderley, Almir  Gonçalves1 aAlcântara, Isabel  Sousa1 aRodrigues, Lindaiane  Bezerra1 aCesário, Francisco  Rafael Alves Santana1 aCorreia de Oliveira, Maria  Rayane1 aCastro, Fyama  Ferreira e1 aAlbuquerque, Thaís  Rodrigues de1 ada Silva, Maria  Sanadia Alexandre1 aRibeiro-Filho, Jaime 1 aCoutinho, Henrique  Douglas Melo1 aMenezes, Paula  Passos1 aQuintans Junior, Lucindo Jose,1 aAraújo, Adriano  Antunes de Souza1 aIriti, Marcello 1 aAlmeida, Jackson Roberto Guedes da Silva,1 aMenezes, Irwin  Rose Alencar de0 tBiology.g2020 May 30, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology90601143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014200165300001400307520165100321592002801972650002102000650001502021650001502036650001902051650002602070650001302096650002602109650001502135650002302150650001502173650001902188650002202207650003002229650001202259650003702271650002302308650001602331650002402347700001502371700001902386773010402405856008102509852000902590655001202599IND60087550320221121051949.0141102e20110117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008755032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2010.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Borgne, P.10aEstimation of Sea Surface Temperature from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager, improved using numerical weather prediction  ap. 55-65.  aMost of the operational Sea Surface Temperature (SST) products derived from satellite infrared radiometry use multi-spectral algorithms. They show, in general, reasonable performances with root mean square (RMS) residuals around 0.5K when validated against buoy measurements, but have limitations, particularly a component of the retrieval error that relates to such algorithms' limited ability to cope with the full variability of atmospheric absorption and emission. We propose to use forecast atmospheric profiles and a radiative transfer model to simulate the algorithmic errors of multi-spectral algorithms. In the practical case of SST derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), we demonstrate that simulated algorithmic errors do explain a significant component of the actual errors observed for the non linear (NL) split window algorithm in operational use at the Centre de Météorologie Spatiale (CMS). The simulated errors, used as correction terms, reduce significantly the regional biases of the NL algorithm as well as the standard deviation of the differences with drifting buoy measurements. The availability of atmospheric profiles associated with observed satellite-buoy differences allows us to analyze the origins of the main algorithmic errors observed in the SEVIRI field of view: a negative bias in the inter-tropical zone, and a mid-latitude positive bias. We demonstrate how these errors are explained by the sensitivity of observed brightness temperatures to the vertical distribution of water vapour, propagated through the SST retrieval algorithm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth atmosphere 3aabsorption 3aalgorithms 3aimage analysis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alatitude 3amultispectral imagery 3aprediction 3aradiative transfer 3aradiometry 3aremote sensing 3asimulation models 3asurface water temperature 3atropics 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awater distribution 3awater vapor 3aweather forecasting1 aRoquet, H.1 aMerchant, C.J.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2011 Jan. 17, v. 115, no. 1 p.55-65dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2010.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245012600175500001900301520176900320592002802089650001002117650002102127650001102148650001502159650001302174650001502187650001902202650002102221650001802242650002802260650001302288651001702301653001702318653002202335653003402357653002502391653001702416700002302433773011102456856009002567852000902657655001202666IND60736076320221119052141.0210527e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073607632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1040952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowes, Caroline10aAbsence of a Luxury Effect on bird alpha diversity in a rapidly developing African city, but surrounding landscape is key  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAspiring towards cities that are sustainable and equitable, as detailed by Goal 11 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, has become increasingly relevant given the growing human population in urban areas. A key part of guaranteeing that cities meet Goal 11 is to ensure equitable access to urban green spaces, and the biodiversity that they support, for all residents. However, there is evidence from developed world cities of a Luxury Effect, where wealthier residents have greater access to urban biodiversity than poorer residents. To test for this Luxury Effect in a developing world city, we measured bird species richness and diversity in 27 urban green spaces in Johannesburg, South Africa, to examine how socio-economic and ecological drivers influence urban biodiversity. We found no evidence of a Luxury Effect with the median income of neighbourhoods surrounding the green spaces having no significant effect on bird richness or diversity. There were, however, ecological effects with surrounding natural land-cover negatively correlated to richness, and a positive influence of wetland connectivity on richness. The negative effect of natural land-cover is possibly due to the relatively low bird diversity of the natural grasslands surrounding Johannesburg. The positive effect of wetland connectivity and the lack of a Luxury Effect indicate that the use of waterbodies to historically separate populations has buffered poorer neighbourhoods from depreciated biodiversity within the selected green spaces. The effect of wetlands also further emphasises the importance of water availability on urban biodiversity. This indicates that historical land use decisions can still influence how biodiversity is distributed in urban landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3ahuman population 3aincome 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3asocioeconomics 3aspecies richness 3asurface water 3asustainable development 3awetlands 3aSouth Africa 0aBiodiversity 0aLandscape ecology 0aSustainable Development Goals 0aSocioeconomic status 0aUrbanization1 aReynolds, Chevonne0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2021 Sept., v. 213 p.104095-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1040953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03789naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245011100212300001800323520242100341592002802762650002402790650001202814650001802826650001102844650001002855650001902865650001402884650002802898650001702926650002502943650000902968650001302977650001302990650001103003650001603014700006103030700006003091773011903151856008803270852000903358655001203367IND60767445620221120084042.0220217e20220203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076744562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c038372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaik, Imran K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3030-559910aMicrofluidics-Based Low Salinity Wettability Alteration Study of Naphthenic-Acid-Adsorbed Calcite Surfaces  ap. 1842-1853.  aMicrofluidics is relatively a new area in the oil and gas industry and has great potential to be used as an effective tool to address various outstanding research questions where microscale investigation is necessary. Low salinity brine flooding has been known to enhance oil recovery in carbonate reservoirs through a wettability alteration mechanism. Wettability alteration is a molecular-scale phenomenon that is often characterized at a mesoscale through contact angle experiments. By using microfluidic chips, the low salinity effects involving solid–fluid interactions could be directly visualized, and the wettability alteration could be verified at microscale. However, to replicate solid–fluid interactions involved in carbonate reservoirs, the internal wetting surfaces must be transformed to carbonate surfaces. In this study, first, wetting surfaces of straight-channel glass microfluidic chips were functionalized using a metal-chelating silane coupling agent, and then, the surfaces were coated with CaCO₃ using a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition process. The calcite-coated straight-channel glass microfluidic chips were then used to investigate the effects of brine salinity and the role of divalent ions in the wettability alteration of oil-wet calcite surfaces at both room temperature and high temperature (70 °C). Naphthenic acid was used as the surface-active component in a model oil to render calcite surfaces oil wet. Six single-electrolyte-based brines were used in this study: high salinity 5 M NaCl, seawater equivalent 0.656 M NaCl, and 4-times diluted seawater-equivalent low salinity brines─0.164 M ionic strength NaCl, Na₂SO₄, MgSO₄, and MgCl₂. The low salinity brines were found to induce significant wettability alteration on naphthenic-acid-adsorbed calcite surfaces at ambient temperature. Low salinity Na₂SO₄ resulted in the highest wettability alteration followed by low salinity NaCl solution. Insignificant wettability alteration was observed in 0.656 M NaCl compared to 0.164 M NaCl where the wettability alteration was significant, suggesting the extent of wettability alteration increases with reduction in brine salinity. Magnesium ions were found to be unfavorable for wettability alteration in the presence or absence of sulfate ions. Exposure to higher temperature resulted in no or insignificant further wettability alteration in most of the brines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acalcite 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3aglass 3aionic strength 3amagnesium 3amicrofluidic technology 3anaphthenates 3aoil and gas industry 3aoils 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asilane 3awettability1 aAichele, Clint P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4414-23801 aBikkina, Prem K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1236-80320 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 Feb. 03, v. 36, no. 4 p.1842-1853dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c038373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008200167300001600249520208300265592002802348650002002376650001302396650003002409650001602439650002002455650002202475650001302497650001502510650001902525650001602544650001102560650001502571650001302586650001902599650001802618650002402636651001502660651001802675651001402693700001502707700002002722700001602742700001402758700001802772700001902790700001802809700002202827700001602849773010602865856008102971852000903052655001203061IND60087551720221120065058.0141102e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008755172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2010.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiancamaria, S.10aAssimilation of virtual wide swath altimetry to improve Arctic river modeling  ap. 373-381.  aGlobal surface water variations are still difficult to monitor with current satellite measurements. The future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is designed to address this issue. Its main payload will be a wide swath altimeter which will provide maps of water surface elevations between 78°S and 78°N over a 120km swath. This study aims to combine coupled hydrologic/hydraulic modeling of an Arctic river with virtual SWOT observations using a local ensemble Kalman smoother to characterize river water depth variations. We assumed that modeling errors are only due to uncertainties in atmospheric forcing fields (precipitation and air temperature) and different SWOT orbits were tested. First, we tested orbits that all have a three day repeat period but differ in terms of their spatial coverage of the study reach; these orbits correspond to the first three months of the mission, which will be dedicated to calibration and validation experiments. For these orbits, the mean spatial Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in modeled channel water depth decreased by between 29% and 79% compared to the modeled RMSE with no assimilation, depending on the spatial coverage. The corresponding mean temporal RMSE decrease was between 54% and 91%. We then tested the nominal orbit with a twenty two day repeat period which will be used during the remaining lifetime of the mission. Unlike the three day repeat orbits, this orbit will observe all continental surfaces (except Antartica and the northern part of Greenland) during one repeat period. The assimilation of SWOT observations computed with this nominal orbit into the hydraulic model leads to a decrease of 59% and 66% in the mean spatial and temporal RMSE in modeled channel water depth, respectively. These results show the huge potential of the future SWOT mission for land surface hydrology, especially at high latitudes which will be very well sampled during one orbit repeat period. Still, further work is needed to reduce current modeling uncertainties and to better characterize SWOT measurement errors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acartography 3afluid mechanics 3ahydrologic models 3alatitude 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3ariver water 3arivers 3asatellites 3aseawater 3aspace and time 3asurface water 3asurface water level 3aAntarctica 3aArctic region 3aGreenland1 aDurand, M.1 aAndreadis, K.M.1 aBates, P.D.1 aBoone, A.1 aMognard, N.M.1 aRodríguez, E.1 aAlsdorf, D.E.1 aLettenmaier, D.P.1 aClark, E.A.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 115, no. 2 p.373-381dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2010.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245012700171300001600298520176900314592002802083650001802111650001402129650001302143650001402156650001202170650001302182650001502195650002102210650001702231650001502248650001702263650001302280650002102293650001202314653001602326653001302342653001802355653001002373700002802383700003102411700001502442700002502457700001702482700002202499700001802521700002402539700002602563773012802589856007802717852000902795655001202804IND60786067620221119013747.0220818e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606762DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2021.01582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustamante-Pozo, Moises10a(−)-Epicatechin Ameliorates Cardiac Fibrosis in a Female Rat Model of Pre-Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction  ap. 836-844.  aOne of the most abundant flavonoids present in cacao is (−)-epicatechin (Epi) and this flavanol has been linked to the cardiovascular health promoting actions of cocoa products. We previously demonstrated that Epi reduces infarct size in rodent models of ischemia/reperfusion and permanent coronary occlusion. Reduced infarct size was associated with decreased left ventricular (LV) oxidative stress (OS) and indicators of inflammation factors, which foster myocardial fibrosis. In this study, we examine the antifibrotic actions of Epi in an aging female rat model of pre-heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (pre-HFpEF) as well as its potential to mitigate plasma levels of OS, proinflammatory/profibrotic cytokines, and improve passive and active LV function. Epi treatment [1 mg/(kg·d)] was provided daily by gavage from 21 to 22 months of age, whereas controls received water. A Millar catheter was used to assess hemodynamic function. Subsequently, hearts were arrested in diastole, a balloon inserted into the LV and passive pressure–volume curves generated. Fixed LV sections were processed for collagen area fraction quantification using Sirius Red staining. Treatment with Epi did not lead to detectable changes in LV contractile function. However, passive LV pressure volume curves were significantly right shifted with Epi. Collagen area fraction values indicated that Epi treatment significantly reduces LV fibrosis. Epi also significantly reduced plasma OS markers and levels of profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, Epi reduces cardiac fibrosis in an aged, female rat model of pre-HFpEF, which correlates with significant reductions in OS and cytokine levels in the absence of changes in LV contractile function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acatheters 3acollagen 3acytokines 3afemales 3afibrosis 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3ahemodynamics 3ainfarction 3ainflammation 3aischemia 3aoxidative stress 3arodents 0aepicatechin 0afibrosis 0aheart failure 0aHFpEF1 aRamirez-Sanchez, Israel1 aGarate-Carrillo, Alejandra1 aIto, Bruce1 aNavarrete, Viridiana1 aHaro, Moises1 aGarcía, Ricardo,1 aCarson, Nancy1 aCeballos, Guillermo1 aVillarreal, Francisco0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 25, no. 8 p.836-844dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl57082x1557-76007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2021.01583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245015600169520168600325592002802011650003102039650002902070650001602099650002302115650002502138650001702163650000902180650002402189650001902213650002102232650001902253650001802272650001802290650001202308650002002320650001302340650002202353650001902375650001102394700002302405700001502428700002002443700002202463700001902485700002402504773012002528856007802648852000902726655001202735IND60702425720221122092435.0200718e20200420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070242572DNAL7 a10.3390/biology90400822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlettjord, Tiril  H.10aOverexpression of <i>T-bet</i>, <i>GATA-3</i> and <i>TGF-ß</i> Induces <i>IFN-γ</i>, <i>IL-4/13A</i>, and <i>IL-17A</i> Expression in Atlantic Salmon  aThe overexpression of <i>GATA-3</i>, <i>T-bet</i> and <i>TGF-&szlig;</i> may theoretically induce <i>IL-4/A</i>, <i>IFN-&gamma;</i> and <i>IL-17A</i> expression, respectively. Whether this also applies to fish is not yet known. The plasmid vectors encoding reporter gene (RFP)-tagged <i>T-bet</i>, <i>GATA-3</i> and <i>TGF-&szlig;</i> were used as overexpression tools, transfected into cells or injected intramuscularly to monitor the expression of <i>IFN-&gamma;</i>, <i>IL-4/13A</i> and <i>IL-17A</i>. In addition, the fish were either experimentally challenged with <i>Vibrio anguillarum</i> (VA group) or <i>Piscirickettsia salmonis</i> (PS group). The reporter gene (RFP) inserted upstream of the <i>GATA-3</i>, <i>T-bet</i> and <i>TGF-&szlig;</i> genes, was observed in muscle cell nuclei and in inflammatory cells after intramuscular (i.m.) injection. PS group: following the injection of <i>GATA-3</i> and <i>T-bet</i>-encoding plasmids, the expression of <i>GATA-3</i> and <i>T-bet</i> was high at the injection site. The spleen expression of <i>IFN-&gamma;</i>, following the injection of a <i>T-bet</i>-encoding plasmid, was significantly higher on day 2. VA group: The <i>T-bet</i> and <i>GATA-3</i>-overexpressing fish expressed high <i>T-bet</i> and <i>GATA-3</i> mRNA levels in the muscles and on day 4 post-challenge. The expression of <i>TGF-&szlig;</i> in the muscles of fish injected with <i>TGF-&szlig;</i>-encoding plasmids was significantly higher on days 7 (8 days pre-challenge) and 19 (4 days after challenge). The protective effects of the overexpression of <i>T-bet</i>, <i>GATA-3</i> and <i>TGF-&szlig;</i> on both bacterial infections were negligible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGATA transcription factors 3aPiscirickettsia salmonis 3aSalmo salar 3aVibrio anguillarum 3abacterial infections 3acell nucleus 3afish 3agene overexpression 3ainjection site 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-4 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3aplasmid vectors 3aplasmids 3aprotective effect 3areporter genes 3aspleen1 aSekkenes, Hege  J.1 aChi, Heng 1 aBøgwald, Jarl 1 aSwain, Trilochan 1 aDalmo, Roy  A.1 aKumari Swain, Jaya 0 tBiology.g2020 Apr. 20, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology90400823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008200166300001600248520105100264592002801315650004401343650001501387650001801402650001601420650002301436650001801459650001901477650001401496650002901510650001601539650002301555650001101578650001501589650002201604650004401626650001101670650002101681650001301702650001601715650002501731651001001756653003001766653003801796653002101834653002201855653002401877700001501901700001501916773008801931856005102019852000902070655001202079IND50087085620221120185856.0140412e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008708562DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2010.4975012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavalon, S.10aAnalysis of organic compounds in an urban wastewater treatment plant effluent  ap. 295-306.  aIn the present work we fractioned the effluent water from an urban sewage treatment plant (USTP) of Ribarroja (Valencia, Spain) using the conventional protocol based on DAX8 and XAD4 resins. The fractions were analyzed by elemental analysis, FT–IR, ¹H‐NMR, COSY‐NMR, HSQC‐NMR, FAB⁺‐MS and also by derivatization with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide with 10% of trimethylchlorosilane. The four fractions obtained have common spectroscopic features and individual compounds indicating that the fractioning procedure is inefficient at separating different families of compounds. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of the derivatized fractions allowed identification of many individual compounds. The main classes of organic compounds present in the effluent are saccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, hydroxyacids, aromatic compounds and steroids. Also we were able to identify in the effluent the emerging pollutants paracetamol and ketoprofen – two best‐selling anti‐inflammatory drugs used in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetamides 3aacetaminophen 3aamino acids 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbohydrates 3aderivatization 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental technology 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography 3ahumans 3aketoprofen 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aresins 3asewage treatment 3asteroids 3aurban areas 3awastewater treatment 3aSpain 0aurban wastewater effluent 0adissolved organic matter analysis 0aNMR spectroscopy 0amass spectroscopy 0aemergent pollutants1 aAlvaro, M.1 aGarcia, H.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 32, no. 3 p.295-306dTFx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.497501  aDNAL 7aarticle03727naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013900161520220800300592002802508650001602536650002302552650002602575650001202601650001002613650001402623650002102637650001202658650003002670650001002700650001602710650001502726650001402741650001102755650001402766650001402780650003002794650001402824650001102838650001102849650001402860651001102874700002002885700001802905700002502923700002402948700001802972773012002990856007803110852000903188655001203197IND60702426920221120101058.0200718e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070242692DNAL7 a10.3390/biology90400692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalman, Ben 10aIsolation and Identification of <i>Fusarium</i> spp., the Causal Agents of Onion (<i>Allium cepa</i>) Basal Rot in Northeastern Israel  aOver the past decade, there have been accumulating reports from farmers and field extension personnel on the increasing incidence and spread of onion (<i>Allium cepa</i>) bulb basal rot in northern Israel. The disease is caused mainly by <i>Fusarium</i> species. Rotting onion bulbs were sampled from fields in the Golan Heights in northeastern Israel during the summers of 2017 and 2018. Tissue from the sampled onion bulbs was used for the isolation and identification of the infecting fungal species using colony and microscopic morphology characterization. Final confirmation of the pathogens was performed with PCR amplification and sequencing using fungi-specific and <i>Fusarium</i> species-specific primers. Four <i>Fusarium</i> spp. isolates were identified in onion bulbs samples collected from the contaminated field: <i>F. proliferatum</i>, <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cepae</i>, and two species less familiar as causative agents of this disease, <i>F. acutatum</i> and <i>F. anthophilium</i>. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these species subdivided into two populations, a northern group isolated from white (Riverside cv.) onion bulbs, and a southern group isolated from red (565/505 cv.) bulbs. Pathogenicity tests conducted with seedlings and bulbs under moist conditions proved that all species could cause the disease symptoms, but with different degrees of virulence. Inoculating seeds with spore suspensions of the four species, <i>in vitro</i>, significantly reduced seedlings&rsquo; germination rate, hypocotyl elongation, and fresh biomass. Mature onion bulbs infected with the fungal isolates produced typical rot symptoms 14 days post-inoculation, and the fungus from each infected bulb was re-isolated and identified to satisfy Koch&rsquo;s postulates. The onion bulb assay also reflected the degree of sensitivity of different onion cultivars to the disease. This work is the first confirmed report of the direct and primary cause of <i>Fusarium</i> onion basal rot disease in northeastern Israel. These findings are a necessary step towards uncovering the mycoflora of the diseased onion plants and developing a preventive program that would reduce the disease damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium proliferatum 3abiomass 3abulbs 3acultivars 3aextension agents 3afarmers 3afungal diseases of plants 3afungi 3agermination 3ahypocotyls 3amycobiota 3aonions 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseedlings 3aspores 3asummer 3avirulence 3aIsrael1 aAbraham, Dekel 1 aGraph, Shaul 1 aPerl-Treves, Rafael 1 aMeller Harel, Yael 1 aDegani, Ofir 0 tBiology.g2020 Apr. 02, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology90400693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003900134024004200173024001200215040001800227100001300245245008600258300001800344506017300362520132400535592002801859596008301887596008901970650001302059650001902072650001102091650002502102650001602127650001502143650002002158650002102178650002602199650001102225650001102236650001302247650002002260650001802280650001702298650002202315651001702337653002002354653001302374653002602387653001302413700001902426700002102445700001802466700002502484700002202509700002102531773012802552856011402680856008602794956010902880961001702989852000903006655001203015IND60568188720221119111256.0170502e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818872DNAL7 a3359452aris7 a10113/56818872hdl7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b029562doi7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b029562chorus8 ans12354  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Rui10aLife Cycle Water Footprint Analysis for Rapeseed Derived Jet Fuel in North Dakota  ap. 3845-3854.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aRapeseed is considered to be a promising sources for hydroprocessed ester and fatty acid (HEFA) jet fuel production as a means to address energy security and climate change mitigation. However, concerns have been raised about its impact on water, as large-scale biofuel production may place pressure on fresh water supplies and water quality. Water footprint (WF) analysis, when combined with water-focused life cycle assessment (LCA), can be an effective system analysis tool for water sustainability. This study developed a life cycle water footprint analysis informed by inputs from multiple models for rapeseed HEFA jet fuel production in North Dakota and evaluated the environmental impacts on water utilization and water quality due to large scale HEFA jet production. The biogeochemical-based EPIC model was incorporated to simulate crop growth that influences the hydrological cycle. Systematic LCA models were built in SimaPro to conduct life cycle blue WF analysis. Results using energy allocation indicate that rapeseed derived HEFA jet fuel has a WF of 131–143 m³ per GJ fuel over a rapeseed price range of $470–600, including all green, blue, and gray WF components. Discussions also indicate the importance of incorporating allocation within a life cycle approach when conducting biofuel WF analysis.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006134 3abiofuels 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afatty acids 3afreshwater 3afuel production 3ahydrologic cycle 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3aprices 3arapeseed 3awater footprint 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awater utilization 3aNorth Dakota 0aWater footprint 0aJet fuel 0aLife cycle assessment 0aRapeseed1 aUkaew, Suchada1 aArcher, David W.1 aLee, Joon Hee1 aPearlson, Matthew N.1 aLewis, Kristin C.1 aShonnard, David,0 tACS sustainable chemistry.g2017 May 01, v. 5, no. 5 p.3845-3854dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/56818873Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b029563Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Publ1243%20...DWA%2C%20et%20al.pdf  aUSDAUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003000138245005900168300001600227520135500243592002801598650002201626650001101648650001201659650001501671650001801686650001501704650001401719651001801733653001501751653001401766653001101780653001201791653001801803700001901821700002001840700002801860773014401888856007302032852000902105655001202114IND60786067920221119013455.0220802e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606792DNAL7 a10.1898/NWN20-352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolt, D.

We considered 3 recaptures within the natal or breeding neighborhood to be philopatry (site fidelity), and 1 case as dispersal. One banded female was recaptured as a 2y old, 3.4 km from her natal box. We considered this philopatry. She was later recaptured 15.8 km from her 2nd breeding site, and we considered this breeding dispersal. She lived at least 5 y, but we did not know her whereabouts in all years. A 2nd female banded as a nestling was recaptured 2.0 km from her natal box, breeding as a yearling (11 mo). We considered this natal philopatry. A 3rd female, previously banded as a breeding adult, was recaptured 2 y later breeding 2.5 km from her initial site of banding. We considered this philopatry. She was at least 4 y old. The 4th female was recaptured 3.6 km from her initial breeding box. We considered this philopatry. She was recaptured again the following year in the same nest box as her 2nd nest site. We considered the use of this same nest site philopatry. She was in her 5th calendar year. Our records are perhaps the 1st reports of natal philopatry and age of 1st breeding for female Boreal Owls in North America, and contribute additional records of female site fidelity and dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegolius funereus 3aadults 3afemales 3anest boxes 3anesting sites 3aphilopatry 3ayearlings 3aNorth America 0aBoreal Owl 0adispersal 0afemale 0aMontana 0asite fidelity1 aLarson, Matt D1 aHiro, Stephen P1 aSeidensticker, Mathew T0 tNorthwestern naturalist.g2022 Aug. 1, v. 103, no. 2 p.154-161dSociety for Northwestern Vertebrate BiologywJournal:13816x1051-17337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1898/NWN20-353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245019000167520193300357592002802290650001202318650001502330650001602345650001902361650001902380650002002399650002202419650001302441650001502454650001802469650002102487650002402508650001202532650001002544650001402554650001902568650002602587650001202613650001502625650001702640650001302657650002002670650001302690650000902703650001502712650001202727650001302739650002902752650001902781650001002800700002102810700002502831700002202856700002302878773011902901856007803020852000903098655001203107IND60702429920221120101107.0200718e20200513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070242992DNAL7 a10.3390/biology90500982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDallons, Matthieu 12aA Comparative Study of Rat Urine <sup>1</sup>H-NMR Metabolome Changes Presumably Arising from Isoproterenol-Induced Heart Necrosis Versus Clarithromycin-Induced QT Interval Prolongation  aCardiotoxicity remains a challenging concern both in drug development and in the management of various clinical situations. There are a lot of examples of drugs withdrawn from the market or stopped during clinical trials due to unpredicted cardiac adverse events. Obviously, current conventional methods for cardiotoxicity assessment suffer from a lack of predictivity and sensitivity. Therefore, there is a need for developing new tools to better identify and characterize any cardiotoxicity that can occur during the pre-clinical and clinical phases of drug development as well as after marketing in exposed patients. In this study, isoproterenol and clarithromycin were used as prototypical cardiotoxic agents in rats in order to evaluate potential biomarkers of heart toxicity at very early stages using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR-based metabonomics. While isoproterenol is known to cause heart necrosis, clarithromycin may induce QT interval prolongation. Heart necrosis and QT prolongation were validated by histological analysis, serum measurement of lactate dehydrogenase/creatine phosphate kinase and QTc measurement by electrocardiogram (ECG). Urine samples were collected before and repeatedly during daily exposure to the drugs for <sup>1</sup>H-NMR based-metabonomics investigations. Specific metabolic signatures, characteristic of each tested drug, were obtained from which potential predictive biomarkers for drug-induced heart necrosis and drug-induced QT prolongation were retrieved. Isoproterenol-induced heart necrosis was characterized by higher levels of taurine, creatine, glucose and by lower levels of Krebs cycle intermediates, creatinine, betaine/trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), dimethylamine (DMA)/sarcosine. Clarithromycin-induced QT prolongation was characterized by higher levels of creatinine, taurine, betaine/TMAO and DMA/sarcosine and by lower levels of Krebs cycle intermediates, glucose and hippurate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abetaine 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acardiotoxicity 3aclarithromycin 3aclinical trials 3acomparative study 3acreatine 3acreatinine 3adimethylamine 3adrug development 3aelectrocardiography 3aglucose 3aheart 3ahistology 3aisoproterenols 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amarkets 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3anecrosis 3anitrogen oxides 3apatients 3arats 3asarcosines 3ataurine 3atoxicity 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3atrimethylamine 3aurine1 aDelcourt, Manon 1 aSchepkens, Corentin 1 aPodrecca, Manuel 1 aColet, Jean-Marie 0 tBiology.g2020 May 13, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology90500983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002200142245017200164300001600336520177000352592002802122650002402150650002002174650001802194650001102212650001902223650001302242650002102255650001302276650001402289650002402303700002202327700001802349773010702367856004502474852000902519655001202528IND4514299720221118200508.0150918e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451429972DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2011000422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakeri, Shahryar10aSurveillance of single‐cell behavior in different subpopulations of Ralstonia pickettii AR1 during growth and polyhydroxybutyrate production phases by flow cytometry  ap. 206-215.  aMost bacterial strains accumulate intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules as an energy reservoir, in response to fluctuations in their microenvironment. Flow cytometry was applied for the analysis of single cells of Ralstonia pickettii AR1 in response to changes in the culture conditions. Two parameters, the PHB production‐related FL2 and side scatter (SSC) parameters, were used to monitor, distinguish and characterize different subpopulations in the growth and PHB production phases. A high SSC level was observed in the mid‐log exponential growth phase. When the nitrogen source reached a limiting level, the SSC started to decrease, in contrast to the intracellular PHB granules‐related FL2 parameter. The results show that ammonium limitation is a critical and important factor for the accumulation of reserve compounds. Four subpopulations were observed and distinguished upon entrance of the cells into the exponential growth phase. When the cells entered the late exponential growth or early stationary phase, two subpopulations had disappeared and only two, different subpopulations were dominant. One of the subpopulations with changed SSC and PHB production activity switched to another subpopulation that was only active in PHB production in the stationary phase. The whole cells of R. pickettii AR1 tended to form a homogeneous population at the end of the stationary phase. In fact, the changes in the subpopulations of a single strain are related to different physiological states of the cells. The observation of different subpopulations suggests that each subpopulation shows a specific response to changes in the surrounding microenvironment, nutrients and limiting factors.

P.10aIntensifying Multiphase Reactions and Reactors: Strategies and Examples  ap. 3607-3622.  aIntensification is intrinsic to better chemical and process engineering and has always been used in practice. Multiphase reactions and reactors are ubiquitous in chemical and allied industries and are of great economic and ecological importance. There is a great scope for intensifying multiphase reactions and reactors for realizing productivity enhancements, which are crucial for sustainable manufacturing. These enhancements can be in terms of increased throughput; better yield, conversion, and selectivity; smaller environmental footprint; and intrinsically safer operations. The advances in intensified reactors, especially microreactors and microfluidic devices, have created significant awareness about intensification in recent decades. In this article, we discuss different strategies for intensifying multiphase reactions and reactors based on the published information. A variety of tools and examples are presented to showcase the potential of intensification. We have found the efforts toward intensification of multiphase reactions and reactors very rewarding academically as well as professionally. We hope that this article will further stimulate interest in this area and pave the way toward realizing next generation productivity for chemical and allied industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological footprint 3aengineering 3amanufacturing 3asustainable manufacturing 0aProcess intensification 0aMultiphase reactors 0aMicroreactor 0aSustainable process development1 aRanade, Vivek V.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 May 01, v. 5, no. 5 p.3607-3622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b030173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245015400165520134100319592002801660650002501688650001601713650001501729650001201744650002601756650001001782650001901792650001101811650001801822700002001840700001701860700002001877700002001897773012001917856007802037852000902115655001202124IND60702430820221120095649.0200718e20200427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070243082DNAL7 a10.3390/biology90500902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVannini, Andrea 14aThe Water Content Drives the Susceptibility of the Lichen <i>Evernia prunastri</i> and the Moss <i>Brachythecium</i> sp. to High Ozone Concentrations  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerance of lichens (<i>Evernia prunastri</i>) and mosses (<i>Brachythecium</i> sp.) to short-term (1 h), acute (1 ppm) O<sub>3</sub> fumigation under different hydration states (dry, <10% water content, metabolism almost inactive; wet, >200% water content, metabolism fully active). We hypothesized that stronger damage would occur following exposure under wet conditions. In addition, we checked for the effect of recovery (1 week) after the exposure. Ozone fumigation negatively affected the content of chlorophyll only in wet samples, but in the moss, such a difference was no longer evident after one week of recovery. Photosynthetic efficiency was always impaired by O<sub>3</sub> exposure, irrespective of the dry or wet state, and also after one week of recovery, but the effect was much stronger in wet samples. The antioxidant power was increased in wet moss and in dry lichen, while a decrease was found for wet lichens after 1 week. Our results confirm that the tolerance to O<sub>3</sub> of lichens and mosses may be determined by their low water content, which is the case during the peaks of O<sub>3</sub> occurring during the Mediterranean summer. The role of antioxidant power as a mechanism of resistance to high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations needs to be further investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3achlorophyll 3afumigation 3alichens 3amosses and liverworts 3aozone 3aphotosynthesis 3asummer 3awater content1 aCanali, Giulia 1 aPica, Mario 1 aNali, Cristina 1 aLoppi, Stefano 0 tBiology.g2020 Apr. 27, v. 9, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology90500903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245005300181300001600234520129700250592002801547650001501575650001501590650001901605650002001624650002901644650001801673650001701691650001601708650002001724650001501744650002901759650001001788650000901798650001901807650001101826650000701837650001901844650001601863650002301879650001801902653001601920653001501936653001701951653001801968653002501986700002202011700003502033773008802068856005102156852000902207655001202216IND50087086220221120175117.0140412e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008708622DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2010.4911332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte Zaragoza, Victor M.10aLead sorption–desorption from organic residues  ap. 353-361.  aSorption and desorption are mechanisms involved in the reduction of metal mobility and bioavailability in organic materials. Metal release from substrates is controlled by desorption. The capacity of coffee husk and pulp residues, vermicompost and cow manure to adsorb Pb²⁺ was evaluated. The mechanisms involved in the sorption process were also studied. Organic materials retained high concentrations of lead (up to 36,000 mg L⁻¹); however, the mechanisms of sorption varied according to the characteristics of each material: degree of decomposition, pH, cation exchange capacity and percentage of organic matter. Vermicompost and manure removed 98% of the Pb from solution. Lead precipitated in manure and vermicompost, forming lead oxide (PbO) and lead ferrite (PbFe₄O₇). Adsorption isotherms did not fit to the typical Freundlich and Langmuir equations. Not only specific and non‐specific adsorption was observed, but also precipitation and coprecipitation. Lead desorption from vermicompost and cow manure was less than 2%. For remediation of Pb‐polluted sites, the application of vermicompost and manure is recommended in places with alkaline soils because Pb precipitation can be induced, whereas coffee pulp residue is recommended for acidic soils where Pb is adsorbed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aadsorption 3aalkaline soils 3abioavailability 3acation exchange capacity 3acattle manure 3acoffee beans 3acoffee pulp 3acoprecipitation 3adesorption 3aenvironmental technology 3ahulls 3alead 3aorganic matter 3aoxides 3apH 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3asorption isotherms 3avermicomposts 0abiosorption 0aadsorption 0aheavy metals 0aprecipitation 0achemical equilibrium1 aCarrillo, Rogelio1 aGutierrez Castorena, Carmen M.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 32, no. 4 p.353-361dTFx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.491133  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245013100155300001600286520090900302592002801211650002301239650002301262650001101285650000901296650000901305650001001314650001101324650001001335650000901345650001401354650002601368653001901394653002201413653003001435653001801465653002201483653002001505653001501525773014401540856007301684852000901757655001201766IND60786068520221119013459.0220802e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606852DNAL7 a10.1898/NWN21-202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, Thor10aPredation of a pacific tree frog (pseudacris regilla) by an american robin (turdus migratorius) on san juan island, washington  ap. 190-193.  aThe diet of the American Robin (Turdus migratorius) consists largely of fruit and invertebrates. Rarely, predation of small vertebrates has also been reported, including attacks on, and/or consumption of, snakes, a skink, fish, shrews, a field mouse, a salamander, and frogs. Few observations have included a prolonged interaction, leaving unanswered questions about how the prey are subdued, killed, and eaten. Here I describe an 8-min encounter between an adult male Robin and a Pacific Tree Frog (Psuedacris regilla), including plausible prey-dropping, pursuit, bill-pouncing, pecking, and beating the frog against the ground. The frog was killed, but not consumed, apparently because it was too large to swallow whole and the Robin failed to open or dismember the carcass. This marks the first reported attack by a Robin on a Pacific Tree Frog, and the first confirmed Robin kill of any frog species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudacris regilla 3aTurdus migratorius 3aadults 3adiet 3afish 3afrogs 3afruits 3amales 3amice 3apredation 3asalamanders and newts 0aAmerican Robin 0aPacific Tree Frog 0apredator-prey interaction 0aprey-dropping 0aunusual prey item 0aSan Juan Island 0aWashington0 tNorthwestern naturalist.g2022 Aug. 1, v. 103, no. 2 p.190-193dSociety for Northwestern Vertebrate BiologywJournal:13816x1051-17337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1898/NWN21-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010400171300001600275520156300291592002801854650001401882650002201896650001501918650001101933650001901944650002501963650001701988650001602005650001002021650001702031650001502048650001102063650002902074650001902103650001302122650001002135650001902145650001502164653002102179653003902200653002902239653003502268653000802303653001702311653000902328653000702337653000702344653001002351653000702361653000602368653000702374653000802381653000902389653001502398653001102413653000702424653000702431653000702438653001202445653000702457653000802464653000902472653000902481653000902490653001102499653000702510653000902517700002102526700002102547700002702568700002102595700002102616773012402637856008502761852000902846655001202855IND60597578120221118124335.0200113e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozentsvet, Olga10aStructural and molecular strategy of photosynthetic apparatus organisation of wild flora halophytes  ap. 213-220.  aStructural and molecular parameters of photosynthetic apparatus in plants with different strategies for the accumulation of salts were investigated. CO₂ gas exchange rate, content of pigments, mesostructure, chloroplast ultrastructure and the biochemical composition of the membrane structural components in leaves were measured. The objects of the study were euhalophytes (Salicornia perennans, Suaeda salsa, Halocnemum strobilaceum), crynohalophyte (Limonium gmelinii), glycohalophyte (Artemisia santonica). Euhalophytes S. perennans and S. salsa belong to the plants of the halosucculent type, three other species represent the xerophilic type. The highest photosynthetic activity estimated by the average parameters of CO₂ gas exchange rate in the leaves was observed in S. perennans plants. Plants of the xerophyte type including both H. strobilaceum euhalophyte and cryno- and glycohalophytes are described by lower values of these characteristics. Larger cells with a great number of chloroplasts and a high content of membrane glycerolipids and unsaturated C18:3 fatty acid, but with smaller pigment and light-harvesting complexes size characterise the features of euhalophytes with a succulent leaf type. Thus, features of the mesostructure, ultrastructure, and supramolecular interactions of the halophyte PA were closely related to the functional parameters of gas exchange, and were characterised by the strategy of species in relation to the accumulation of salts, the life form of plants, and the attitude to the method of water regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aLimonium gmelinii 3aSalicornia 3aSuaeda 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical composition 3achloroplasts 3afatty acids 3aflora 3agas exchange 3ahalophytes 3aleaves 3alight harvesting complex 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3asalts 3aultrastructure 3axerophytes 0aCO2 gas exchange 0aChlorophyll lipids and fatty acids 0aPhotosynthetic apparatus 0aUltrastructura of chloroplasts 0aCCA 0aChl a, Chl b 0aDGDG 0aDW 0aFA 0aFAMEs 0aFW 0aG 0aGL 0aLHC 0aMGDG 0aNChp, NChs 0aNp, Ns 0aPA 0aPG 0aPL 0aPSI, II 0aSE 0aStm 0aSQDG 0aSChp 0aVChp 0aVp, Vs 0aΨ 0aΨ l1 aNesterov, Viktor1 aBogdanova, Elena1 aKosobryukhov, Аnatoly1 aSubova, Svetlana1 aSemenova, Galina0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Aug., v. 129 p.213-220dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006600144245007700210300001600287520146400303592002801767650003401795650001901829650002001848650001901868650001801887650002601905650001801931650001201949650001201961650000901973650001301982650002101995653002802016653002102044653001102065653000602076653000902082700001902091700005502110773014102165856007902306852000902385655001202394IND60786068920221119013541.0220802e20220502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606892DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfr-2021-03382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchimleck, Laurence R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1958-605910aRadial patterns of specific gravity variation in North American conifers  ap. 889-900.  aAn extensive summary of publications reporting radial specific gravity (SG) variation for North American conifers is presented. SG varies from pith to bark in three distinct patterns before reaching asymptomatic values: Type 1 (SG increases with cambial age), Type 2 (SG is initially high at the pith, then decreases with cambial age, before increasing), and Type 3 (SG decreases with cambial age). Pinaceae have either a Type 1 or 2 pattern (majority are Type 2). Cupressaceae have a Type 3 pattern, but radial SG data do not exist for some species. We reviewed publications in table 7-1 of Panshin and de Zeeuw (the 1970 edition) which reports SG variation by species and Type (the 1980 edition has an equivalent table but does not reference publications), examining sampling strategies and radial patterns. For a small number of species, Type was either incorrectly interpreted or sampling made a conclusion regarding pattern of radial variation impossible. Specific examples of mislabeled Types reported by Panshin and de Zeeuw for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), red pine (Pinus resinosa) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), and western redcedar (Thuja plicata) are described. We conclude for nearly all species the pattern of radial SG variation is consistent; however, different patterns have been reported for eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) and subspecies of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aPinus echinata 3aPinus ponderosa 3aPinus resinosa 3aPinus strobus 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aThuja plicata 3acambium 3aforests 3apith 3aresearch 3aspecific gravity 0aNorth American conifers 0aradial variation 0aType 1 0a2 0aor 31 aDahlen, Joseph1 aAuty, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5146-44760 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2022 May 02, v. 52, no. 6 p.889-900dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:jnl2003x1208-60377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2021-03383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05081naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245011400209300001400323520331000337592002803647650001303675650001103688650001203699650002603711650002303737650001903760650001303779650001603792650001903808650001503827650001303842650001103855650001103866650001903877650002703896650001403923650001903937650001203956650002503968650001403993650001904007650001704026650002504043651001704068653001604085653001404101653003504115653001004150700006204160700002104222700002004243700001904263773010604282856008204388852000904470655001204479IND60526307120221117233225.0190403e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunjonji, Lawrence1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7647-636110aCombining carbon-13 and oxygen-18 to unravel triticale grain yield and physiological response to water stress  ap. 36-49.  aWater availability in semi-arid regions is increasingly becoming threatened by erratic rains and frequent droughts leading to over-reliance on irrigation to meet food demand. Improving crop water use efficiency (WUE) has become a priority but direct measurements remain a challenge. There is therefore a need to identify reliable proxies and screening traits for WUE. Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) offers potential as a proxy for WUE, but its application is hindered by environmental factors and thus varies greatly among different studies. A two-year study was carried out with four moisture levels, ranging from well-watered (430–450mm) to severe stress (SS) (220–250mm), combined with four commercial triticale genotypes grown under field conditions in a hot, arid, steppe climate of Limpopo in South Africa. The study tested the use of Δ13C as a proxy of intrinsic WUE and grain yield of triticale. Second, δ13C and δ18O in combination with measured gas exchanges were used to test the functionality of the dual isotope model to interpret causes of variation in carbon isotope composition. Third, grain filling carbon assimilate sources were inferred from measured flag leaf and grain Δ13C.The results showed that moisture level significantly influenced grain yield, intrinsic WUE and Δ13C in triticale. Well-watered conditions increased grain yield, which ranged from 3.5 to 0.8tha−1 and 4.9–1.8tha−1 in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Δ13C was also high under well-watered conditions and decreased with decreasing moisture level while WUEintrinsic increased with decreasing moisture level. The relationship between Δ13C and grain yield was positive (P<0.01), but only significant under water stressed conditions, indicating dependence of the relationship on moisture level. The relationship between Δ13C and WUEintrinsic did not depend on the moisture level but showed a negative relationship when data for all moisture levels was combined. δ13C showed a negative relationship with photosynthetic rate (A), while the relationship between stomatal conductance (gs) and δ18O varied with season. Hence, the dual isotope model could only predict that variation observed in Δ13C and thus intrinsic water use efficiency was due to a concomitant decrease in both A and gs when transpiration was not limited by evaporative demand. Flag leaf Δ13C measured under SS at GS71 in the 2014 growing season, was significantly higher (2.2–3.6‰) than grain Δ13C, also measured under SS, suggesting minimal contribution of flag leaf photosynthesis to grain filling. No genotypic differences were observed in Δ13C, grain yield and WUEintrinsic, indicating a probable lack of diversity in the studied genotypes.The results of this study show that carbon isotope discrimination could be useful as a predictor of triticale grain yield in drought prone areas. Δ13C also offers potential as a proxy for WUEintrinsic and breeding for lower Δ13C values could result in varieties with higher WUEintrinsic in triticale. Flag leaf photosynthesis and pre-anthesis assimilates contribute much less carbon to grain filling under water stress than previously thought. Lastly, our results show that the dual isotope model is operational, but is not all encompassing but depends on evaporative demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acarbon 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3aevaporative demand 3afilling period 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3airrigation 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3ascreening 3asemiarid zones 3asteppes 3astomatal conductance 3atriticale 3avapor pressure 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3aSouth Africa 0aGrain yield 0aTriticale 0aIntrinsic water use efficiency 0aΔ13C1 aAyisi, Kingsley K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3647-87301 aVandewalle, Bram1 aHaesaert, Geert1 aBoeckx, Pascal0 tField crops research.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 195 p.36-49dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014300165500001900308520199100327592002802318650001602346650001602362650002102378650002002399650001602419650002002435650003502455650002802490653002202518653002102540653002002561653003002581700001602611700002502627700002402652700002302676773012502699856008502824852000902909655001202918IND60736074420221119023544.0210513e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073607442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1061712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Jihao12aA supervised machine learning method to detect anomalous real-time broiler breeder body weight data recorded by a precision feeding system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA precision feeding (PF) system is an intelligent computer-controlled feeding system that can be used to feed individual broilers, breeders or layers automatically based on measuring real-time body weight (BW). Vast amounts of real-time BW data can be generated every day when birds visit a PF station. However, anomalous observations occurred in real-time BW observations, which were caused by multiple birds entering the station at the same time, upward or downward variation in scale measurement in the recorded data due to the movement of the bird, or a misread for radio frequency identification tag. Known anomalous data should be removed because they have a negative impact on the interpretation of the data. Manually cleaning the anomalies is accurate, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Statistical methods and unsupervised machine learning methods are effective in detecting anomalies to some extent because they just check data distribution. The current study reported a supervised machine learning method to detect anomalies in real-time BW recorded by the PF system. Real-time BW data of 5 broiler breeders from day 15 to 306 were checked and the anomalies were manually labeled. Variables regarding the statistical distribution of data and features regarding the feeding activity recorded by the PF system in each day were extracted from the dataset. Among the 4 machine learning algorithms including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest classifier (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), RF produced the highest F1 score (0.9712) and area under the precision-recall curve (0.9948). Compared with 4 other common anomaly detection methods including Z-scores, interquartile range (IQR), density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and local outlier factor (LOF), RF had a higher average F1 score (0.9448), which indicated that RF was a more effective anomaly detection algorithm for this type of data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3abody weight 3abroiler breeders 3adata collection 3aelectronics 3aneural networks 3aradio frequency identification 3asupport vector machines 0aOutlier detection 0aMachine learning 0aModel selection 0aImbalanced classification1 aLou, Edmond1 aAfrouziyeh, Mohammad1 aZukiwsky, Nicole M.1 aZuidhof, Martin J.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 June, v. 185 p.106171-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1061713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001600165245013500181300001600316520106600332592002801398650002101426650001601447650002001463650001901483650001701502650000901519650001101528650001101539650002301550650001301573650001401586650002501600650002101625650001101646650001201657650002701669650002401696650005501720650000901775650001101784650001101795650000901806650003801815650006901853650006001922650003501982650001402017650003702031650004402068651001102112700001602123700001802139700001902157700001802176700002002194773011302214856008202327852000902409655001202418IND4461710020221118023145.0141112e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446171002DNAL7 a213153992pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaiad, T.P.10aPhysical therapy assessment tools to evaluate disease progression and phenotype variability in Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy  ap. 188-193.  aDogs suffering from Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) present symptoms that are similar to human patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Phenotypic variability is common in both cases and correlates with disease progression and response to therapy. Physical therapy assessment tools were used to study disease progression and assess phenotypic variability in dogs with GRMD. At 5 (T0), 9 (T1), 13 (T2) and 17 (T3)months of age, the physical features, joint ranges of motion (ROM), limb and thorax circumferences, weight and creatine kinase (CK) levels were assessed in 11 dogs with GRMD. Alterations of physical features were higher at 13months, and different disease progression rates were observed. Passive ROM decreased until 1year old, which was followed by a decline of elbow and tarsal ROM. Limb and thorax circumferences, which were corrected for body weight, decreased significantly between T0 and T3. These measurements can be used to evaluate disease progression in dogs with GRMD and to help discover new therapies for DMD patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGolden Retriever 3abody weight 3acreatine kinase 3adisease course 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aelbows 3ahumans 3amuscular dystrophy 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aphysical therapy 3athorax 2aAnimals 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDisease Progression 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiopathology 2aMuscular Dystrophy, Animalxdiagnosisxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aMuscular Dystrophy, Duchennexphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aPathology, Veterinaryxmethods 2aPhenotype 2aPhysical Examinationxveterinary 2aPhysical Therapy Modalitiesxveterinary 0aBrazil1 aSilva, M.B.1 aSilva, G.C.A.1 aCaromano, F.A.1 aMiglino, M.A.1 aAmbrósio, C.E.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2011 Oct., v. 91, no. 2 p.188-193dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245017000163300001600333520167500349592002802024650001702052650002602069650001102095650002002106650001602126650001502142650001402157650001202171650002102183650001102204650001102215650001802226650001902244650001602263650001802279653002102297653002302318653003202341700002202373773014402395856007502539852000902614655001202623IND60767443420221120045206.0220216e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076744342DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toab2572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrison, Ryan R.10aDevelopment of Azalea Lace Bug, Stephanitis pyrioides, on Susceptible and Resistant Rhododendron species in Western Washington [Erratum: April 2022, v.115(3); p.914]  ap. 233-239.  aThe invasive azalea lace bug, Stephanitis pyrioides (Scott) (Tingidae: Hemiptera), is an important pest of Rhododendron (L.) (Ericales: Ericaceae). Feeding by nymphs and adults removes chlorophyll, reduces rates of photosynthesis and transpiration, and causes leaf stippling, which reduces the aesthetic value of infested plants. Rhododendron spp. are a major component of landscapes in the Pacific Northwest. Previous studies on the seasonality of S. pyrioides in North America are largely from the southeastern United States, which could have limited applicability in the Pacific Northwest. To quantify S. pyrioides seasonality in western Washington, we sampled ∼200 leaves from 18 Rhododendron plants 1–2 times per wk from April to October over 2 yr, and microscopically counted the number of eggs, early instars, late instars, and adults. We developed a degree-day model for first generation S. pyrioides, which we used to estimate that S. pyrioides undergoes two full and a partial third generation in western Washington. Our model estimates 5 and 50% early instar occurrence, after hatching from overwintering eggs, at 69 and 171 accumulated degree-days from 1 January, respectively, when using a base threshold of 10.2°, which can be used to optimize the timing of management decisions. We also observed faster development and adult emergence when S. pyrioides nymphs feed on susceptible host plants relative to more resistant host plants, which may influence the timing of management decisions and potentially increase the probability of a full third generation. This research enhances our knowledge of an emerging invasive species in the Pacific Northwest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhododendron 3aStephanitis pyrioides 3aadults 3aaesthetic value 3achlorophyll 3aentomology 3aheat sums 3ainstars 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3amodels 3aoverwintering 3aphotosynthesis 3aprobability 3atranspiration 0adegree-day model 0ainsect seasonality 0ainvasive species management1 aTobin, Patrick C.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 115, no. 1 p.233-239dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toab2573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013200169300001600301520128300317592002801600650002101628650002701649650001301676650002601689650001201715650002401727650004401751650001901795650003901814650003301853653002401886653001901910653003301929653004401962653003902006700001802045700001802063700001502081700001702096700001702113773011202130856008302242852000902325655001202334IND60087548920221122051531.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008754892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Duo-Ying10aEvaluation of long term stability of seeded bacteria in a bio-enhanced activated carbon filter used for treating drinking water  ap. 701-708.  aA bio-enhanced activated carbon (BEAC) filter immobilized with 5 bacteria was operated for 180 days to investigate the seeded bacterial stability. The TOC and ammonium removal efficiency of the filter was analyzed continuously every day. The biofilm, bioactivity and bacterial community structure was evaluated by SEM, ATP test and DGGE respectively. At the initial stage (0 day), low abundance of the bacteria led to low bioactivity (202.97 ng ATP g−1 carbon), which resulted in low TOC and ammonium removal efficiency (63.98% and 30.68%). On the 120th day, The TOC and ammonium removal efficiency improved with the increase of bioactivity (increased to 1436.8 ng ATP g−1 carbon) and climbed to 81.47% and 51.97%, respectively. DGGE results showed that from day 0–120 of the BEAC operation, 5 seeded bacteria were stable with little change. On the 180th day, there were 4 indigenous bacteria appeared in DGGE profiles, which affected TOC removal efficiency and bioactivity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization results showed that, on the 180th day, the seeded bacteria were 92.98% of total count of bacteria, which were dominant in BEAC filter. In this study, BEAC with relatively stable seeded bacteria is a promising approach to maintain performance of the filter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiofilm 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3adrinking water 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aBacterial stability 0aDrinking water 0aBio-enhance activated carbon 0aDenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 0aFluorescence in situ hybridization1 aLi, Wei-Guang1 aGong, Hai-Nan1 aZhang, Lei1 aGong, Xu-Jin1 aLiu, Bai-Yin0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.701-708dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245011800214300001800332520191100350592002802261650001502289650001202304650001502316650001102331650003702342650001102379650001802390650001702408700006102425700002202486700002002508773011902528856008802647852000902735655001202744IND60767443720221120045038.0220414e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076744372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c026912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarrahian, Khosro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7933-760710aExperimental Analysis of Scale Inhibitors Retention in Carbonate Formations for Application in Squeeze Treatments  ap. 1776-1791.  aIn this work, static adsorption/precipitation (Γ/Π) experiments were conducted for two widely used scale inhibitors (DETPMP and VS-Co) using two different size fractions of Moroccan calcite (315–500 and 125–250 μm) to study the effect of particle size on the “apparent adsorption” of these SIs onto carbonate. The reason for performing these experiments at two particle size ranges was to determine whether the relative surface area to volume ratios (as presented as particle size) would affect whether the precipitating SI–Ca complex forms as a “skin” on the mineral surface and, if so, to determine whether this “skin” could affect the further interaction between the SI and the carbonate mineral by a “surface poisoning” effect. The results of both environmental scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis (ESEM/EDX) and direct particle size analysis (PSA) clearly showed that no (or very little), such surface deposition or coating around calcite grains occurred for either of these SIs. Essentially, the results for both particle sizes were qualitatively the same for each of the SIs. The DETPMP retention showed coupled Γ/Π behavior, which was predominantly precipitation at [DETPMP] > 100 ppm and was quantitatively almost the same for both calcite particle sizes. Likewise, the results for VS-Co were quantitatively almost identical for both particle sizes and the retention was predominantly via adsorption up to [VS-Co] ≈ 3000 ppm, with some small degree of precipitation at higher concentration observed. The rather different behavior of DETPMP and VS-Co may be ascribed to different functional groups having different pKₐ values and strengths of SI–Ca binding. Both sets of static adsorption/precipitation experimental results for DETPMP and VS-Co on each calcite particle size fraction were also predicted using a previously published model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalcite 3acarbonates 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amodels 3aparticle size 3asurface area1 aAminnaji, Morteza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5837-13361 aGraham, Alexander1 aSorbie, Kenneth0 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 Feb. 04, v. 36, no. 4 p.1776-1791dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c026913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245013900209300001800348520119600366592002801562650001701590650001501607650001601622650001201638650001101650650002301661650001401684650000901698650000701707650001401714650001901728650002001747650001601767650001601783650002201799650001401821700001501835700001501850700001801865700002001883700005601903700005601959773011902015856008802134852000902222655001202231IND60767443820221120045114.0220217e20220128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076744382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c029252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Si-Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2605-411410aRheological Properties of a New Microbial Exopolysaccharide Produced by Sphingomonas sp. HS and Its Potential in Enhanced Oil Recovery  ap. 1792-1798.  aThe alkali-free surfactant–polymer flooding system with ultralow interfacial tensions is still a challenge to enhance oil recovery at present. In this study, a new thermally stable and salt tolerant biopolymer (HS-EPS) was obtained from thje broth of Sphingomonas sp. HS, a newly isolated strain (CGMCC No. 22954). Compared to HPAM, the elasticity of HS-EPS was dominant which is conducive to enhancing oil recovery. The HS-EPS showed good viscosity stability at salinities up to 360 g/L of NaCl, 60 g/L of Ca²⁺, and 60 g/L of Mg²⁺, temperatures up to 90 °C, and pH 4–10. Meanwhile, a new alkali-free surfactant–polymer binary system was developed using HS-EPS and a biobased surfactant newly synthesized in our laboratory. The interfacial tension between this binary flooding system and Daqing crude oil was below 10–² mN/m with 100 g/L of NaCl, 400 mg/L of Ca²⁺, or at a temperature of 80 °C. In addition, this binary system possesses a good oil sand adsorption resistance, dilution resistance, and aging stability. These results demonstrate that the new biopolymer HS-EPS secreted by Sphingomonas sp. HS is promising in oil recovery in the alkali-free flooding system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphingomonas 3aadsorption 3abiopolymers 3acalcium 3aenergy 3aexopolysaccharides 3aoil sands 3aoils 3apH 3apetroleum 3asalt tolerance 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aviscosity1 aZhou, Jing1 aQi, Gui-Na1 aLiu, Jin-Feng1 aYang, Shi-Zhong1 aGang, Hongze1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1555-35191 aMu, Bo-Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9564-49700 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 Jan. 28, v. 36, no. 4 p.1792-1798dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c029253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011500166300001600281520235800297592002802655650001502683650001902698650001502717650000802732650001002740650001302750650002402763650002602787650001102813650002002824650001902844650001302863650000902876650001302885650002202898650001602920650002702936650001102963651002602974700002203000700001903022700002203041700001703063773010603080856008103186852000903267655001203276IND60087549920221122032301.0141102e20110117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008754992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2010.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunn, Grant E.10aEvaluation of the HUT modified snow emission model over lake ice using airborne passive microwave measurements  ap. 233-244.  aThe algorithms designed to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) using passive microwave measurements falter in lake-rich high-latitude environments due to the emission properties of ice covered lakes on low frequency measurements. Microwave emission models have been used to simulate brightness temperatures (Tbs) for snowpack characteristics in terrestrial environments but cannot be applied to snow on lakes because of the differing subsurface emissivities and scattering matrices present in ice. This paper examines the performance of a modified version of the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model that incorporates microwave emission from lake ice and sub-ice water. Inputs to the HUT model include measurements collected over brackish and freshwater lakes north of Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada in April 2008, consisting of snowpack (depth, density, and snow water equivalent) and lake ice (thickness and ice type). Coincident airborne radiometer measurements at a resolution of 80×100m were used as ground-truth to evaluate the simulations. The results indicate that subsurface media are simulated best when utilizing a modeled effective grain size and a 1mm RMS surface roughness at the ice/water interface compared to using measured grain size and a flat Fresnel reflective surface as input. Simulations at 37GHz (vertical polarization) produce the best results compared to airborne Tbs, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.2K and 7.9K, as well as Mean Bias Errors (MBEs) of −8.4K and −8.8K for brackish and freshwater sites respectively. Freshwater simulations at 6.9 and 19GHz H exhibited low RMSE (10.53 and 6.15K respectively) and MBE (−5.37 and 8.36K respectively) but did not accurately simulate Tb variability (R=−0.15 and 0.01 respectively). Over brackish water, 6.9GHz simulations had poor agreement with airborne Tbs, while 19GHz V exhibited a low RMSE (6.15K), MBE (−4.52K) and improved relative agreement to airborne measurements (R=0.47). Salinity considerations reduced 6.9GHz errors substantially, with a drop in RMSE from 51.48K and 57.18K for H and V polarizations respectively, to 26.2K and 31.6K, although Tb variability was not well simulated. With best results at 37GHz, HUT simulations exhibit the potential to track Tb evolution, and therefore SWE through the winter season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abrackish water 3afreshwater 3aice 3alakes 3alatitude 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave radiometers 3amodels 3apolarized light 3aremote sensing 3asalinity 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awinter 3aNorthwest Territories1 aDuguay, Claude R.1 aDerksen, Chris1 aLemmetyinen, Juha1 aToose, Peter0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2011 Jan. 17, v. 115, no. 1 p.233-244dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2010.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245012100172520130100293592002801594650001601622650002001638650001401658650001801672650001101690650002101701650001801722650002401740650001201764650001501776650001501791650001101806650001701817650001501834650001101849651000901860651001101869651001801880700002201898700002301920700002101943700002501964700002401989773012202013856008002135852000902215655001202224IND60702415620221121140543.0200718e20200420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070241562DNAL7 a10.3390/beverages60200262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazhand, Amirhossein 10aReady to Use Therapeutical Beverages: Focus on Functional Beverages Containing Probiotics, Prebiotics and Synbiotics  aThe growing global interest in functional foods containing nutrients capable of adding possible beneficial health effects is rapidly increasing both interest and consumer demand. In particular, functionalized beverages for their potential positive effect on health e.g., decreasing cholesterol level, lowering sugar, high fiber content, ability to enhance the immune system, and help digestion, have recently received special attention. Among the different beverages available on the market, probiotic dairy and non-dairy products have attracted much attention because of their affordable cost and their numerous therapeutic activities. Fermented milk and yogurt are currently worth €46 billion, with 77% of the market reported in Europe, North America, and Asia. Consumption of dairy beverages has some limitations due for example to lactose intolerance and allergy to milk proteins, thereby leading consumers to use non-dairy beverages such as fruit, grains, and vegetable juices to add probiotics to diet as well as driving the manufacturers to food matrices-based beverages containing probiotic cultures. The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the therapeutic performance and properties of dairy and non-dairy beverages in terms of probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3aconsumer demand 3adigestion 3afiber content 3afruits 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmune system 3alactose intolerance 3amarkets 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3asugars 3atherapeutics 3avegetables 3ayogurt 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aSouto, Eliana B.,1 aLucarini, Massimo 1 aSouto, Selma  B.1 aDurazzo, Alessandra 1 aSantini, Antonello 0 tBeverages.g2020 Apr. 20, v. 6, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27131x2306-57107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/beverages60200263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010700170300001800277520127900295592002801574650001501602650002801617650001901645650001901664650001401683650001901697650001501716650001501731650001401746653002001760653002101780653001801801653002001819653002701839700001701866700001201883700001801895700002001913700001901933773012901952856008502081852000902166655001202175IND60568187420221119111320.0170502e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818742DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b026502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Ya-Qiong10aSilver Silicate@Carbon Nanotube Nanocomposites for Enhanced Visible Light Photodegradation Performance  ap. 3641-3649.  aThe abilities of adsorption and separation of electron hole pairs are two important factors in photodegradation, and a balance between them is required to obtain an excellent photodegradation performance. As a new photocatalyst, silver silicate has a poor conductivity that hinders its photodegradation ability. Herein, silver silicate (AgSiOx)@carbon nanotube (CNT) and AgSiOx@reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposites are prepared for the first time to improve the photodegradation performance of AgSiOx. The influences of CNT and RGO contents on improving the photodegradation efficiency of AgSiOx are different due to the differences in the concentration of oxygen-containing groups and the electrical conductivity. The photodegradation efficiency of AgSiOx@CNT nanocomposites first increases and then decreases with increasing the concentration of CNTs, while the removal efficiency of pollutants by AgSiOx@RGO nanocomposites increases with the GO concentration owing to the residual oxygen-containing functional groups on RGO. The AgSiOx@CNT nanocomposite with a trace amount of CNTs (0.1 wt %) shows fairly effective photodegradation activity, and its photodegradation process is completed in 10 min with a higher removal efficiency and rate constant than reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aelectrical conductivity 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3ananotubes 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3asilicates 0aSilver silicate 0aPhotodegradation 0aVisible light 0aCarbon nanotube 0aReduced graphene oxide1 aGui, Chen-Xi1 aQu, Jin1 aHao, Shu-Meng1 aWang, Qian-Qian1 aYu, Zhong-Zhen0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 May 01, v. 5, no. 5 p.3641-3649dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b026503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016300170300001800333520146800351536016501819592002801984596001202012650001902024650001302043650002902056650004402085653001902129653001202148653001502160653001802175653001302193653004902206653001402255653001202269653002002281700002102301700001902322700002002341700002402361773012702385856008602512852000902598655001202607IND60786066620221119013829.0220802e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606662DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2022.20858872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDetry, Pauline10aDevelopment, validation and application of multi-class methods for the analysis of food additives by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 1349-1364.  aFood additives are used in numerous food products and are characterised by various physicochemical properties. In European member states, their use in food is regulated by the European Union. This work aimed to develop an accurate and high-throughput analytical method enabling the simultaneous determination of additives from different functional classes to facilitate controls and generate occurrence data for exposure assessments. The QuEChERS principle was applied due to its ease of implementation and flexibility to adjust to various food matrices. However, very polar substances could not be extracted with sufficient recoveries. Consequently, an alternative basic methanol sample-preparation methodology was developed. After sample preparation, the obtained extracts were analysed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Overall, the developed methodology allowed the quantification of 27 additives from the functional classes of colours, sweeteners, preservatives, and antioxidants in various foods (e.g. beverages, dairies, processed meals). The methods were also validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, matrix effect, limit of quantification, accuracy, repeatability, and intra-laboratory reproducibility. Finally, the methods were successfully applied to eighty-four actual samples. All additives were found below authorised levels. However, irregularities were spotted in labelling.  aThe research that yielded these results was funded by the Belgian Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment through the contract RT 18/8.  aPublisher supplied data  aRT 18/8 3aEuropean Union 3amethanol 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aFood additives 0acolours 0asweeteners 0apreservatives 0aQuEChERS 0aultra-high performance liquid chromatography 0abeverages 0adairies 0aprocessed foods1 aWillame, Pauline1 aVan Hoeck, Els1 aVan Loco, Joris1 aGoscinny, Séverine0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2022 Aug. 3, v. 39, no. 8 p.1349-1364dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2022.20858873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011300170300001800283520106100301536016801362592002801530650002301558650001501581650001401596650001201610650002301622650001001645650001301655650002101668650001201689650001501701650002101716650002701737653001301764653002301777653002101800700001801821700001401839773012701853856008601980852000902066655001202075IND60786066720221119013719.0220802e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606672DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2022.20858882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Jiachang10aDevelopment of biochar-impregnated alginate beads for the delivery of biocontrol agents for peanut aflatoxin  ap. 1487-1500.  aThe competitive inhibition of aflatoxigenic fungi by non-aflatoxigenic Aspergillus flavus has proved to be an effective method to prevent and control peanut aflatoxin contamination, and most of the currently used inoculum carriers are grains. In this study, the reliability and efficiency of replacing grain kernels with novel chitosan-coated alginate-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) beads impregnated with biochar (CSACB) were evaluated. Characterisation of the beads was performed by SEM, thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), and swelling properties analyses. The optimised CSACB beads had good physical stability, shelf life, and entrapment efficiency. In addition, the water-holding capacity and porous structure were excellent, as the biochar provided a beneficial microenvironment for the attachment and microbial growth of the biocontrol fungus. The effect of reducing aflatoxin in peanuts was verified experimentally. Collectively, the novel CSACB beads are suitable carriers of non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus for the biocontrol of peanut aflatoxin.  aThis work was supported by Research start-up fund of Jiangsu University of Science and Technology; and Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program of Jiangsu Province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aaflatoxins 3aalginates 3abiochar 3abiological control 3afungi 3ainoculum 3amicrobial growth 3apeanuts 3ashelf life 3athermogravimetry 3awater holding capacity 0aAlginate 0acontrolled release 0apeanut aflatoxin1 aDou, Jianpeng1 aWu, Wenfu0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2022 Aug. 3, v. 39, no. 8 p.1487-1500dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2022.20858883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006400168300001400232520210300246592002802349650002302377650001302400650001602413650001002429650001202439650002602451650001902477650001402496650001602510650001002526650002902536650001302565650001002578650001002588650002002598650001002618653001102628653001602639653002202655653001602677653002502693700002102718700002202739700001502761700002502776773010602801856008202907852000902989655001202998IND60526305220221117233013.0190509e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsseng, Senthold10aSimulating the impact of source-sink manipulations in wheat  ap. 47-56.  aGrain yields in wheat can be limited by the assimilate supply (source) or by the carbohydrate demand of the grains (sink). Recently, there have been questions regarding the capability of crop models to simulate the physiology of source-sink interactions in crops; however, crop models have never been tested with source-sink manipulated data. We tested the Nwheat model with detailed measured field experimental data with treatments of manipulated source (i.e., assimilate supply), sink (i.e., kernel number), and their combinations. In general, the model could reproduce observed effects of shading before and after anthesis as well as the additional impact of halving the spikes. A 90% shading during grain filling reduced individual grain weights drastically, with the remaining yield mostly determined by carbohydrate remobilisation, which the model reproduced. The model also reproduced the decline of biomass accumulation due to shading, but was not sensitive enough to simulate the observed reduction of kernels per m2 from a 90% reduction in solar radiation between booting and the beginning of grain filling, resulting in an overestimated grain yield. The model reproduced the positive impact of a 7% genetically increased radiation use efficiency (RUE) on growth and yield. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the yield response to increased RUE can vary among environments. The yield impact can be positive in many environments, but negative in terminal drought environments. In these environments, stimulated early growth from higher RUE can cause accelerated water deficit during grain filling and reduced yields.The model adequately simulated source-sink interactions of most of the treatments, but there were obvious shortcomings in simulating kernel set and final grain size. Improving these will be critical for estimating crop-environmental interactions that affect assimilate supply, including breeding, industrialisation-induced or geo-engineered solar dimming, genetically and atmospheric CO2-related increased RUE, and source manipulations, such as pest and disease impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3abreeding 3acrop models 3acrops 3adrought 3afield experimentation 3afilling period 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3apests 3aradiation use efficiency 3aseed set 3aseeds 3ashade 3asolar radiation 3awheat 0aNwheat 0aGrain yield 0aModel performance 0aSink-source 0aTriticum aestivum L.1 aKassie, Belay T.1 aLabra, Marcelo H.1 aAmador, C.1 aCalderini, Daniel F.0 tField crops research.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 202 p.47-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245009500182300001800277520135600295592002801651650002101679650001501700650001501715650001601730650001301746650002201759650001701781650001901798650001101817650001001828650002301838650002201861650002001883650001301903653001401916653001301930653001901943653002001962653001201982700003201994700003702026700002802063700004102091700002902132773012702161856008602288852000902374655001202383IND60786066920221119013620.0220802e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606692DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2022.20879202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHonorato, Karina Rodrigues10aRemoval of copper ions from alembic cachaça using agro-industrial residues as biosorbents  ap. 1424-1438.  aCachaça is a typical Brazilian distilled beverage made from fermented sugarcane juice. The copper levels in alembic cachaça are of great concern among producers, and the removal of this contaminant is important for the quality of the product. The present study aimed to remove copper ions from alembic cachaça by adsorption. Sugarcane bagasse, okara, Moringa oleifera Lam., three different types of zeolites, and two types of commercial charcoal were tested as biosorbents. The heat-treated sugarcane bagasse removed 100% of the copper present in a cachaça sample, while other low-cost natural adsorbents had close to 50% removal as was observed for M. oleifera seeds and okara. All adsorbents had porous and fibrous structures, favorable to adsorption. A kinetic study showed that a pseudo-second-order model was appropriate, with equilibrium times of 15 h for heat-treated sugarcane bagasse, okara, and M. oleifera seeds used as adsorbents. The Langmuir model better fitted the experimental data, indicating monolayer adsorption. The maximum adsorption capacity was 17.00, 0.77, and 5.33 mg of Cu g⁻¹ for the heat-treated sugarcane bagasse, M. oleifera seeds, and okara, respectively. The results presented here are promising indicating three agro-industrial residues were favorable to the adsorption of copper ions from alembic cachaça.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiosorbents 3acharcoal 3adistilled spirits 3afermentation 3aheat treatment 3amodels 3aokara 3asorption isotherms 3asugarcane bagasse 3asugarcane juice 3azeolites 0aalcoholic 0abeverage 0acopper removal 0aquality control 0aresidue1 aReck Paulino, Isabela Maria1 aOliveira, Alessandra Marjorie de1 aBergamasco, Rosângela,1 aVieira, Angelica Marquetotti Salcedo1 aGomes, Raquel Guttierres0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2022 Aug. 3, v. 39, no. 8 p.1424-1438dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2022.20879203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014600166300001600312520162800328592002801956650002501984650001802009650001402027650001202041650001202053650001102065650001402076650004302090650001302133650001002146650002302156650001102179650002002190650001602210650001202226650002602238653001502264653001602279653002202295653003102317653001202348700001802360700001702378700001202395700001502407773012402422856008502546852000902631655001202640IND60597576620221118125639.0190410e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yameng10aGenome-wide identification of PHD-finger genes and expression pattern analysis under various treatments in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis)  ap. 378-391.  aPlant homeodomain (PHD)-finger proteins are a class of important zinc-finger transcription factors responsible for regulating transcription and the chromatin state and responsive to various stresses. The family genes have been reported in many plants, but there is little information about PHD-finger genes in moso bamboo. In this study, 60 PHD-finger genes (PePHD1–60) were identified in moso bamboo and classified into 11 subfamilies (A–K) based on phylogenetic analysis. Gene structure and conserved motif analysis showed that these genes contained different numbers of introns but had similar motif organizations within each subfamily. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the PHD-finger proteins possessed conserved structural domain sequences. In addition, the family underwent purifying selection during evolution and experienced a large-scale duplication event around 7.69–15.4 million years ago. Most importantly, the expression profiles of young leaves (YL), mature leaves (L), roots (R), stems (S), shoots (Sh) and rhizomes (Rh) displayed that they might involve in the formation of these tissues. Based on promoter analysis of 16 putative stress-related genes, quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed using moso bamboo leaves and showed that these genes were differentially regulated under abscisic acid (ABA), drought, low temperature and NaCl treatments. Therefore, the results reveal that PePHD genes play crucial roles in organ formation and response to multiple environmental stress conditions of moso bamboo, which will make for further function analysis of PHD-finger genes in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aabscisic acid 3achromatin 3adrought 3aintrons 3aleaves 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizomes 3aroots 3asequence alignment 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3atissues 3atranscription factors 0aPHD-finger 0aMoso bamboo 0aPromoter analysis 0aTissue expression analysis 0aqRT-PCR1 aLiu, Huanlong1 aWang, Yujiao1 aLi, Fei1 aXiang, Yan0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Feb., v. 123 p.378-391dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245006700176300001800243520131100261536063001572592002802202596009202230596002702322596002402349596003402373650001202407650003502419650001402454650002102468650001502489650001302504650000902517650000902526650001702535650004302552650001102595650001602606650001902622650001402641650002002655651001102675653001302686653001002699700002702709700002502736700002902761700002702790700002902817773012702846856008602973852000903059655001203068IND60786067120221119013633.0220802e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606712DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2022.20939822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRangel-Moreno, Karla10aDietary contribution to total urinary arsenic in Mexican women  ap. 1453-1462.  aExposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) damages health in many ways. The main routes of human exposure are consumption of contaminated water and diet, but evidence regarding the dietary contribution of iAs is limited. The objective of this work was to determine the foods and beverages that contribute to urinary total arsenic levels (TAs). This is a secondary analysis of an original study of breast cancer cases and population controls carried out in northern Mexico during the period 2007–2011, from which 1,462 women without a history of diabetes were selected. We estimated the consumption of the food and beverage groups with a frequency questionnaire. We measured the concentrations of urinary iAs metabolites by high performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). Total arsenic ranged from 0.5 to 2,360 µg/g creatinine. After adjusting for covariates, we observed a positive association between TAs (with arsenobetaine) with non-bottled drinking water intake, as well as the consumption of root vegetables, vegetables and fruits rich in water, eggs, fish and shellfish. Our findings highlight the relevance of water consumption and some foods for TAs exposure. Food quality monitoring deserves attention in high-risk regions of arsenic contamination.  aThis study was partially supported by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT)-Fondo Sectorial de Investigación en Salud y Seguridad Social (FOSISS) SALUD-2005-C02-14373, SALUD- 2009-01-111384, SALUD-2010-C01-140962, SALUD-2016-1-272632; Fondo Sectorial de Investigación para la Educación 2008-79912 SEP-CONACYT; Proyectos de desarrollo científico para atender problemas nacionales PDCPN2013-01-215464; Fondo Institucional para el Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación FORDECYT-PRONACES/137732/2020 and partially funded by U.S.-Mexico Binational Center for Environmental Science and Toxicology.  aPublisher supplied data  aSALUD-2005-C02-14373aSALUD- 2009-01-111384aSALUD-2010-C01-140962aSALUD-2016-1-272632  a2008-79912 SEP-CONACYT  aPDCPN2013-01-215464  aFORDECYT-PRONACES/137732/2020 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abeverages 3abreast neoplasms 3acreatinine 3adiabetes 3adiet 3afish 3afood quality 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3aquestionnaires 3ashellfish 3awater pollution 3aMexico 0adrinking 0awater1 aMérida-Ortega, Ángel1 aGamboa-Loira, Brenda1 aFlores-García, M.

These bacteria also have a great capacity to spread the resistance genes, sometimes to phylogenetically distant bacteria, which poses an additional threat to public health worldwide. Here, we aimed to use the analytical potential of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize <i>E. coli</i> isolates and identify proteins associated closely with antibiotic resistance. Thirty strains of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing <i>E. coli</i> were sampled from various animals. The phenotypes of antibiotic resistance were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methods, and they showed that all bacterial isolates were multi-resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and ampicillin. To identify peptides characteristic of resistance to particular antibiotics, each strain was grown in the presence or absence of the different antibiotics, and then proteins were extracted from the cells. The protein fingerprints of the samples were determined by MALDI-TOF MS in linear mode over a mass range of 2 to 20 kDa. The spectra obtained were compared by using the ClinProTools bioinformatics software, using three machine learning classification algorithms. A putative species biomarker was also detected at a peak <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> of 4528.00.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aalgorithms 3aampicillin 3aanimals 3aantibiotic resistance 3aartificial intelligence 3abacteria 3abeta-lactamase 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3acomputer software 3aintestines 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3apeptides 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3aresistance genes 3atetracycline 3avirulence1 aViala, Didier 1 aThéron, Laetitia 1 aChambon, Christophe 1 aHébraud, Michel 1 aPoeta, Patricia 1 aIgrejas, Gilberto 0 tBiology.g2020 Mar. 19, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology90300563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03811naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013200164300001600296520204600312592002802358650001702386650001802403650001602421650002002437650001902457650001402476650001302490650001602503650001902519650001502538650001102553650002102564650001402585650002602599650001302625650001502638650000902653650002202662650001402684650002102698651001602719653001702735653002802752653002002780653002002800653001802820653002502838653002202863700002202885700002902907700001902936700002402955700002202979773010503001856008203106852000903188655001203197IND60526305620221117232957.0190403e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.04.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUttam Kumar,10aCompensatory phenotypic plasticity in irrigated rice: Sequential formation of yield components and simulation with SAMARA model  ap. 164-177.  aHigh-yielding rice varieties (HYV) show strong compensation among sequentially developed yield components (YC). This phenotypic plasticity has adaptive value but for crop improvement, more information is needed on its effects on yield. SAMARA, a deterministic crop model predicting trait-trait and trait-environment interactions by simulating morphogenetic processes and competition among sinks for assimilates, was developed to study crop phenotypic plasticity. Dynamics of YC and morphology were observed on the HYV IR72 planted at standard and 4-fold greater density in 4 environments in the Philippines in 2012/13. Data for other years/seasons were obtained for model validation. Sequential path analysis was used to determine the phenotypic plasticity of traits consecutively contributing to yield. Tiller number at flowering (R2=0.94) and maturity (R2=0.84) and grain yield (R2=0.77) were predicted accurately for independent datasets. The model also predicted accurately density effects on aboveground dry weight (agdw), plant height, leaf size, spikelet number per panicle and filling percentage. Tiller and leaf mortality were over-estimated under high density. Overall, the model predicted satisfactorily the sequential compensation processes among YCs. They led to stable grain yield despite large morphological differences among density treatments and environments. Sensitivity analysis of simulation outcomes vs. variation in crop parameters indicated that modified genotypic tillering ability, phyllochron or leaf size had little effect on final grain yield because of compensations by other traits, although IR72 appeared to have an optimal combination of parameter values. Larger effects on grain yield were predicted for variation of parameters affecting the sensitivity of leaf and tiller mortality to assimilate resources and the ability to mobilize stem non-structural carbohydrates during grain filling. The model will be used next to perform physiological trait dissection and plasticity analyses for diverse genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acarbohydrates 3acrop models 3adata collection 3afilling period 3aflowering 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ainflorescences 3airrigation 3aleaves 3amodel validation 3amortality 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aplanting 3aprediction 3arice 3asimulation models 3atillering 3ayield components 3aPhilippines 0aCompensation 0aCompetition among sinks 0aGrowth analysis 0aOryza sativa L. 0aStand density 0aSource-sink dynamics 0aTiller production1 aLaza, Ma.

More than simple molecular platforms aiming at designing new ligands or interfacial additives, CDs have been employed to generate unconventional reaction media such as supramolecular hydrogels or low melting mixtures (LMMs) capable of stabilizing active catalytic species. By using such alternative and unconventional media, high catalytic activities and selectivities were obtained in various transition metal catalytic reactions. The studied catalytic systems are easy to implement and allow for the remarkable stabilization of organometallic or metal nanoparticle catalysts. Interestingly, the size of metal nanoparticles can be finely tuned through confinement in the network of CD-based supramolecular hydrogels. Additionally, the catalysts can be recovered by a simple phase separation. The catalytic phase can be stored at room temperature under an air atmosphere in the solid state and reused as needed without significant loss of activity. Eventually, such CD-based catalytic systems greatly improve process safety. The present article intends to show the reader the very substantial progress that has recently been made in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acyclodextrins 3ahydrogels 3aligands 3amelting 3ananoparticles 3aseparation 0aCatalysis 0aSupramolecular assembly 0aHydrogel 0aLow melting mixtures 0aThermoresponsive systems1 aMenuel, Stéphane1 aFerreira, Michel1 aLéger, Bastien1 aBricout, Hervé1 aTilloy, Sébastien1 aMonflier, Eric0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 May 01, v. 5, no. 5 p.3598-3606dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b028863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245018800179300001600367520133200383592002801715650002101743650002401764650001401788650002001802650002201822650001101844650002101855650001101876650001401887650002201901650001601923650001901939650002101958650002101979650002902000653001302029653001802042653002202060653001102082653002402093700002802117700002902145700002902174700002202203700002602225700002002251700002202271700006202293773012402355856008502479852000902564655001202573IND60597577020221118124816.0200113e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAceituno-Valenzuela, Uri10aIdentification of a type II cystatin in Fragaria chiloensis: A proteinase inhibitor differentially regulated during achene development and in response to biotic stress-related stimuli  ap. 158-167.  aThe equilibrium between protein synthesis and degradation is key to maintaining efficiency in different physiological processes. The proteinase inhibitor cystatin regulates protease activities in different developmental and physiological contexts. Here we describe for the first time the identification and the biological function of the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin of Fragaria chiloensis, FchCYS1. Based on primary sequence and 3D-structural homology modelling, FchCYS1 is a type II phytocystatin with high identity to other cystatins of the Fragaria genus. Both the papain-like and the legumain-like protease inhibitory domains are indeed functional, based on in vitro assays performed with Escherichia coli protein extracts containing recombinant FchCYS1. FchCYS1 is differentially-expressed in achenes of F. chiloensis fruits, with highest expression as the fruit reaches the ripened stage, suggesting a role in preventing degradation of storage proteins that will nourish the embryo during seed germination. Furthermore, FchCYS1 responds transcriptionally to the application of salicylic acid and to mechanical injury, strongly suggesting that FchCYS1 could be involved in the response against pathogen attack.

Carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study randomly assigned citizen science participants Booklets of six randomized, counterbalanced daily stimuli to print out, prepare, and place on the floor in pairs. Owners observed and videorecorded their cats’ behavior with the stimuli and reported findings from home over the course of the six daily trials. This study ultimately reached over 500 pet cats and cat owners, and of those, 30 completed all of the study’s trials. Of these, nine cat subjects selected at least one stimulus by sitting within the contours (illusory or otherwise) with all limbs for at least three seconds. This study revealed that cats selected the Kanizsa illusion just as often as the square and more often than the control, indicating that domestic cats may treat the subjective Kanizsa contours as they do real contours. Given the drawbacks of citizen science projects such as participant attrition, future research would benefit from replicating this study in controlled settings. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first of its kind in three regards: a citizen science study of cat cognition; a formal examination into cats’ attraction to 2D rather than 3D enclosures; and study into cats’ susceptibility to illusory contours in an ecologically relevant paradigm. This study demonstrates the potential of more ecologically valid study of pet cats, and more broadly provides an interesting new perspective into cat visual perception research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aFelis silvestris 3aanimal behavior 3acitizen science 3acognition 3alaundry 3avisual perception 0aCat 0aBehavior 0aVision 0aKanizsa illusion1 aChouinard, Philippe A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9817-06891 aByosiere, Sarah-Elizabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3583-67780 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2021 July, v. 240 p.105338-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2021.1053383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007200167300001600239520099200255592002801247650001601275650001601291650003501307650001801342650001701360650001501377650001701392650002901409650001501438653001801453653001901471653003101490700002001521700002001541773011201561856008301673852000901756655001201765IND60087546920221122231445.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008754692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jufang,10aDi-n-butyl phthalate removal using mixed cultures in batch reactors  ap. 587-591.  aDi-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), belonging to the family of phthalic acid esters, is usually used as plasticizer. Application of extensive plastic commodities has made DBP the most frequently identified chemical found in the environment. A recent research concern has been raised that DBP may be a mutagen and carcinogen, and also an endocrine-disrupting chemical. Thus, environmentally friendly deposal and treatment of DBP are critically important. In this research, an acclimatized mixed culture was used to explore the treatments of different DBP concentrations in synthetic and actual wastewaters by batch strategy. The mixed culture could utilize DBP for growth when the initial DBP concentration was lower than 1000 mg l−1 in both wastewaters. Initial DBP concentrations between 200 and 1000 mg l−1 in the synthetic wastewater could be neutralized at 91–99% removal efficiency. The same concentrations in actual wastewaters contained removal efficiencies between 92 and 100%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3acarcinogens 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3amixed culture 3amutagenicity 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3aproducts and commodities 3awastewater 0aBatch reactor 0aBiodegradation 0aDi-n-butyl phthalate (DBP)1 aWang, Chun-Chin1 aChen, Chih-Hung0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.587-591dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016300166300001600329520129100345592002801636650001101664650001601675650001701691650001501708650001501723650002001738650001701758650002301775650001101798650001101809650001301820650001901833650001101852650003301863650001901896651001501915700001801930700002101948773011901969856008202088852000902170655001202179IND60709023820221121041643.0210428e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070902382DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829200300622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlerova, E.

The general plan of the mesonephric kidney structure is presented. Specific features of the structure of leukocytes and nephron of salmonids under smoltification are described. The size of leukocytes and the height of the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules of the kidneys of salmon smolts are greater in comparison with those kidney cells of freshwater teleost fishes. The number, size, and population density of mitochondria, as well as the development of a rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in different types of cells of the mesonephros of salmon smolts, are higher than those in freshwater fish. A similar pattern is observed for the number of vesicles in the basal part of the distal tubule of the kidneys of the salmon smolt in comparison with freshwater fish. Cells with radially arranged vesicles (CRAVs) of different ultrastructures have been found for the first time in mesonephros of Atlantic salmon. All the described features of the ultrastructure of mesonephros cells are revealed for the smolts prior their migration into sea water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3aSalmo salar 3aSalmo trutta 3aepithelium 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3amitochondria 3apopulation density 3arivers 3asalmon 3aseawater 3asmoltification 3asmolts 3asmooth endoplasmic reticulum 3aultrastructure 3aBaltic Sea1 aSendek, D.

Three species of this complex are known to have established, two in California (E. fornicatus; and Euwallacea kuroshio), and a third in Florida (Euwallacea perbrevis). Their native ranges are spread across southern and southeast Asia. In Taiwan, all three species occur in sympatry. They attack healthy trees of widely varied species and cause severe damage and death to the trees. The attractant quercivorol is commonly used to promote their detection by passive trapping. Recent studies in Florida have shown that trapping of E. perbrevis can be further improved by adding a synergist, α-copaene, alongside the quercivorol lure. Thus, we were interested in testing the effectiveness of α-copaene for trapping the other invasive members of the complex in California and in an area of Taiwan where all three species co-occur. We found that α-copaene marginally enhanced the trapping of E. perbrevis in Taiwan, but had no effect on the trapping of E. fornicatus or E. kuroshio in either California or Taiwan. We conclude that any enhancing effect of α-copaene is specific to E. perbrevis. This highlights the economic importance of accurate species identification in developing and implementing an efficient, and yet cost-effective, monitoring program for the management of E. fornicatus and E. kuroshio in California and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aEuwallacea fornicatus 3acost effectiveness 3adeath 3aentomology 3aspecies identification 3asympatry 3aCalifornia 3aFlorida 3aSouth East Asia 3aTaiwan 0aambrosia beetle 0ainvasive species 0amonitoring 0atrapping 0ahigh-resolution melt analysis1 aRugman-Jones, Paul1 aLiao, Yi-Chang1 aFernández, Verónica,1 aChien, Iris1 aDodge, Christine1 aCooperband, Miriam F.1 aDuan, Shuren,1 aStouthamer, Richard0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 115, no. 1 p.116-123dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toab2323Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/APHIS  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245012400164300001600288520185800304592002802162650002202190650001502212650001502227650003102242650001002273650001902283651001102302653003002313653002202343653001802365653001902383700002202402700001602424773014402440856007602584852000902660655001202669IND60767441720221120104404.0220216e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076744172DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toab2332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRukke, Bjørn Arne10aProcurement Competence and Framework Agreements for Upgraded Bed Bug Control [Cimex lectularius (Hemiptera: Cimicidae)]  ap. 240-249.  aThe prevalence of bed bugs (Cimex lectularius L.) is increasing worldwide. Due to this increase, low-income housing owners and managers need an efficient method for controlling the pests without excessive resource use. The quality of pest control efforts is crucial for efficient eradication. Infestations often need to be approached using a variety of strategies through an integrated pest management (IPM) framework. Efficient eradication is often thought to be the responsibility of the pest control contractor alone. However, the purchase and supply management theory suggests that optimal solutions actually involve sound buyer–supplier relations to support the strategic aim of pest eradication. This study illustrates the positive outcomes of elevating pest management competence on the buyer's part. Further, this study outlines a large-scale purchase situation that quantifies bed bug control efforts, in addition to their outcomes. In total, 11,000 apartment units were observed in Oslo, Norway, over a period of six years. The release and implementation of a procurement officer together with a state-of-the-art pest management framework agreement quickly reversed the consistent escalation of bed bug infestations in the observed units. Observations revealed that the study yielded the most success in eradicating bed bugs by increasing both the number of visits to the infested apartment and the overall duration of control efforts. The improved control was achieved at a reduced cost per infested apartment unit, which allowed for the implementation of bed bug preventive measures and building-wide inspections. The observations made in this study have been discussed in the context of the impact of bed bugs in low-income communities, relative to the factors of pest burden, demography, socioeconomics, and the welfare system in Norway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCimex lectularius 3ademography 3aentomology 3aintegrated pest management 3apests 3asocioeconomics 3aNorway 0abuyer–supplier relation 0apurchase strategy 0asocial impact 0acost–benefit1 aRoligheten, Espen1 aAak, Anders0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 115, no. 1 p.240-249dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toab2333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264520109100280592002801371650001501399650001101414650001501425650001701440650000901457650001001466650001401476650001301490650001701503650001301520650001601533650000901549651001201558700002801570773011901598856008201717852000901799655001201808IND60709024120221121080627.0210428e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070902412DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829200300372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAşçi, Ferruh10aToxic Exposure to Heavy Metal (Fe, Zn, Co, Mn) on Hydrodroma despiciens (Acari, Hydrachnidia)  ap. 467-471.  aIn this study, the resistance limit of Hydrodroma despiciens, which is a common water mite in inland waters, against heavy metal salts such as iron, zinc, cobalt and manganese has been tested. Water mites were sampled in Karamik Lake in Afyonkarahisar, Turkey, during April–August 2015. Separate small lake ecosystems (microcosms) were modeled in the laboratory for each metal salt. Equal amounts of the samples of species collected in the lake were placed into these ecosystems. Increasing and equal amounts of the nitrate salts of the tested metals were added to the microcosms at certain intervals. A control microcosm was constructed as well. The samples were continuously monitored in these four different ecosystems. The water and live samples from each ecosystem were analyzed separately with ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma-optical Emission Spectroscopy, ICP-OES; Spectro Genesis, Germany), and the resulting data were compared. It was revealed that the most toxic salts for Hydrodroma despiciens were those with Co and Zn, while the least toxic were compounds with Fe and Mn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrodroma 3acobalt 3aecosystems 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alakes 3amanganese 3anitrates 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 3awater mites 3azinc 3aGermany1 aAkkuş, Gülderen Uysal0 tInland water biology.g2020 July, v. 13, no. 3 p.467-471dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000000086x1995-08297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S19950829200300373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245015000173300001600323500001500339520155000354592002801904650001201932650003001944650001601974650000901990650001201999650001702011650002002028650001302048650001402061650001502075650001502090653001802105773010102123856005502224852000902279655001202288IND4478283120221118023159.0120727e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447828312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0022-3646.1991.00291.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSluiman, Hans J.10aCell division in gloeotilopsis planctonica, a newly identified ulvophycean alga (chlorophyta) studied by freeze fixation and freeze substitution1  ap. 291-298.  a2019-12-05  aGloeotilopsis planctonica Iyengar & Philipose, a soil isolate, was cultured for the first time since its description in 1956. Cell division was investigated ultrastructurally by using rapid freeze fixation and freeze substitution. Vegetative interphase cells contain a persisting basal apparatus (centrioles) in which the absolute configuration of the basal body pair is identical to that in ulvophycean flagellated cells. Basal apparatus replication and segregation occurs shortly before prophase. Also before mitosis, a shallow plasma membrane indentation is formed, subtended by 2â3 cortical microtubules, in the forthcoming division plane. Daughter basal body pairs are located lateral to the mitotic spindle poles. A Golgi stack occupies each polar position of the mitotic spindle. During mitosis, which is structurally identical to that described previously for members of the Ulotrichales sensu Sluiman (Ulvophyceae), an extensive network of tubular membranes (trans Golgi reticulum, TGR) develops from each polar Golgi stack to the incipient cleavage furrow. A microtubular system, possibly organized by the basal apparatus, is associated with both the TGR and the cytokinetic septum. The TGR appears to be involved in the further development of the furrow after mitosis is completed. I conclude on the basis of this ultrastructural study that the genus Gloeotilopsis, which includes G. planctonica Iyengar & Philipose (type species) and G. sterilis Deason, should be classified in the Ulotrichales sensu Sluiman, class Ulvophyceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3amitosis 3amitotic spindle apparatus 3aChlorophyta 3asoil 3afurrows 3amicrotubules 3aplasma membrane 3aprophase 3areticulum 3acentrioles 3ainterphase 0aChlorophycota0 tJournal of phycology.g1991 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.291-298dBlackwell Science Incx0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1991.00291.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03778naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014800169500001900317520163800336592002801974650003102002650001302033650001602046650001202062650001202074650001902086650001302105650001602118650001602134650002302150650001502173650002402188650002302212650001602235650001602251650002602267650001702293653002602310653001802336653002202354653000802376653000902384653000802393653000702401653000802408653000802416653000702424653000702431653000802438653000802446653000902454653000802463653000902471653000802480653000802488653000802496653000702504653001002511653000802521653000902529653000902538653001002547653000802557653001002565653000702575700001102582700001702593700001702610700001602627700001402643700001502657700001702672700001602689773012502705856008502830852000902915655001202924IND60736073120221119023609.0210513e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073607312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1061422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaofang10aProjection of the climate change effects on soil water dynamics of summer maize grown in water repellent soils using APSIM and HYDRUS-1D models  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil water repellency greatly affects crop growth and soil water movement. The aim of this study was to estimate dynamics of soil water storage (SWS), actual evapotranspiration (ETₐ), root water uptake (RWU) and actual evaporation (Eₐ) under an annual crop grown in water repellent (WR) soils at future climate scenarios. The soil hydraulic parameters were calibrated and validated for HYDRUS-1D based on the experimental data in 2016 and 2017. The summer maize growth periods and irrigation schedules were generated with Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). The daily SWS, ETₐ, RWU and Eₐ values from five water repellent treatments were simulated for summer maize growth periods during 1981–2000, 2030–2059 and 2060–2089 using eight selected global climate models under two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Due to the increased temperature, the growth period reduced by 12–27 days, the total SWS, ETₐ, RWU and Eₐ decreased by 8.1%-21.1%, 2.2%-11.1%, 0.5%-9.7% and 0.8%-9.6% compared to the baseline period, respectively. Changes of total SWS, ETₐ, RWU and Eₐ during the whole summer maize growth periods under RCP 4.5 were greater than RCP 8.5 during the same period. Values of total SWS, ETₐ, RWU and Eₐ in 2030–2059 were higher than 2060–2089 for the same RCP scenario. With increasing initial water droplet penetration time, total SWS and Eₐ increased, while ETₐ and RWU decreased. The global circulation model (GCM) and Period contributed greatly to uncertainty. The results implied that it is necessary to adjust the planting date of summer maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aZea mays 3aagriculture 3aannuals 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adroplets 3aelectronics 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3asoil water 3asoil water movement 3asoil water storage 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awater repellent soils 3awater uptake 0aSoil water repellency 0aSoil moisture 0aRoot water uptake 0aSWR 0aGCMs 0aSWS 0aET 0aETa 0aRWU 0aEa 0aWR 0aRCP 0aETp 0aWDPT 0aLAI 0aIPCC 0aθv 0aθr 0aθs 0aR2 0aRRMSE 0aNSE 0aTmax 0aTmin 0aCMIP5 0aDAS 0aAPSIM 0aRn1 aLi, Yi1 aChen, Xinguo1 aWang, Haoran1 aLi, Linchao1 aYao, Ning1 aLiu, De Li1 aBiswas, Asim1 aSun, Shikun0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 June, v. 185 p.106142-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1061423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012500168300001600293520139200309592002801701650002201729650001801751650002201769650001801791650001801809650001301827650001501840650001401855650001301869650002201882651001401904700002201918700002601940700001901966700002001985773011902005856008202124852000902206655001202215IND60709024720221121080705.0210428e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070902472DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829200202852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyabushko, L.

A vertical collector with polymer material samples was exposed in Karantinnaya Bay (the Black Sea) at a depth of 1 to 12 m from August 4 to September 18, 2018. A total of 94 taxa of Bacillariophyta (67) and Cyanobacteria (27) have been found. Two diatom and 15 cyanobacteria species have been detected in the Crimean coastal waters of the Black Sea for the first time. Benthic species are predominant, of which 74% are marine; two major groups are constituted by cosmopolites (58%) and arctic–boreal–tropical species (37%). In total, 32 species–indicators of saprobity are identified; among them, 21% are beta-mesosaprobiont diatoms living in the conditions of moderate organic pollution. The largest number of diatom and cyanobacteria species are detected on the surface of mesh collectors (48/19) and containers (40/7). These organisms actively participate in transforming and reorganizing the architectonics of fouling on the surface of the polymer samples. Thus, it is shown that synthetic materials may obtain novel biochemical properties, which can be used in the future in different areas of science and technology (medicine, biotechnology, etc.).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCyanobacteria 3abenthic organisms 3abiotechnology 3ainland waters 3amedicine 3aperiphyton 3apollution 3apolymers 3aspecies diversity 3aBlack Sea1 aBondarenko, A.

The total Hg (THg) concentration in the sediment and lake water was substantially elevated compared to uncontaminated lakes and reservoirs. The spatial distribution of THg pointed to waste water discharged from Kunming City as the dominant source of Hg in Dianchi Lake. Despite the high concentration of THg, the concentration of methyl mercury (MeHg) was relatively low compared to other deep water lakes and reservoirs, and the ratio of MeHg/THg was generally lower than 1% in lake water and sediments, implying the low potential of Hg methylation. No significant relationship was found between the total organic carbon (TOC) and MeHg in either surface sediment or sediment cores. This result is different from previous conclusions that an increase of organic material load in sediment can enhance the potential of Hg methylation in sediments. A significant relationship between the total S and MeHg in the two cores indicated that sulfur played an important role in Hg methylation. However, because of similar concentrations of MeHg and distinct differences in the S concentration in the two cores, the total S should not be a limiting factor for Hg methylation in sediment. The most important limiting factors controlling Hg methylation were high pH and Eh induced by heavy algal blooms and shallow water depth in Dianchi Lake because Hg methylation will be inhibited and the demethylation of MeHg may be accelerated under alkaline and oxic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3aaquatic habitat 3alakes 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3apollution load 3asediments 3awastewater 3awater reservoirs 2aEutrophication 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aLakes 2aMethylmercury Compoundsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina1 aZhang, Mingmei1 aLi, Biao1 aXing, Denghua1 aWang, Xin1 aWei, Chaoyang1 aJia, Yonfeng0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 417-418 p.204-213dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245009400189300001800283520137300301592002801674650002001702650001401722650001201736650001301748650002501761650001901786650001401805650001701819650001701836650001001853650002401863650002001887650002701907650002201934650000901956650001301965650001101978650001301989650001802002650001102020650001902031650001802050650001302068650001602081650001302097650002302110650004602133650002802179650002602207650003002233650001702263650003302280650002202313650001602335650005802351650002502409650001502434650004502449650002602494700002002520700001602540773009602556856004802652852000902700655001202709IND4465701820221118023236.0130807e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446570182DNAL7 a215846782pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-011-1083-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudhakar Johnson, T.10aMolecular approaches to improvement of Jatropha curcas Linn. as a sustainable energy crop  ap. 1573-1591.  aWith the increase in crude oil prices, climate change concerns and limited reserves of fossil fuel, attention has been diverted to alternate renewable energy sources such as biofuel and biomass. Among the potential biofuel crops, Jatropha curcas L, a non-domesticated shrub, has been gaining importance as the most promising oilseed, as it does not compete with the edible oil supplies. Economic relevance of J. curcas for biodiesel production has promoted world-wide prospecting of its germplasm for crop improvement and breeding. However, lack of adequate genetic variation and non-availability of improved varieties limited its prospects of being a successful energy crop. In this review, we present the progress made in molecular breeding approaches with particular reference to tissue culture and genetic transformation, genetic diversity assessment using molecular markers, large-scale transcriptome and proteome studies, identification of candidate genes for trait improvement, whole genome sequencing and the current interest by various public and private sector companies in commercial-scale cultivation, which highlights the revival of Jatropha as a sustainable energy crop. The information generated from molecular markers, transcriptome profiling and whole genome sequencing could accelerate the genetic upgradation of J. curcas through molecular breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3abreeding 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3aenergy crops 3afossil fuels 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic markers 3agenetic transformation 3agenetic variation 3aoils 3aoilseeds 3aprices 3aproteome 3apublic sector 3ashrubs 3atissue culture 3atranscriptome 2aBiofuels 2aBiomarkers. 2aBreeding 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConservation of Energy Resourcesxmethods 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aGenetic Variation 2aGermination 2aJatrophaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Oilsxanalysis 2aProteomics 2aSeedsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aStress, Physiological1 aEswaran, Nalini1 aSujatha, M.0 tPlant cell reports.g2011 Sept., v. 30, no. 9 p.1573-1591dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-011-1083-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008800168300001600256520137900272592002801651650001901679650001101698650003001709650001301739650002501752650003701777650001601814650000901830650002401839650001901863653003701882653001601919653002101935653004101956653002801997653003702025700002002062700001602082773011202098856008302210852000902293655001202302IND60087548120221120212353.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008754812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seockheon10aSelective biodegradation of sorbitan ethoxylated surfactants by soil microorganisms  ap. 652-660.  aSurfactants have received increasing interest as potential agents for the enhanced remediation of soils and groundwater contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, the fate of surfactants with respect to biological transformations and associated changes in their characteristics has not been addressed clearly. Thus, the biodegradation of ethoxylated sorbitan fatty ester non-ionic surfactants, referred to as Tween surfactants, was investigated in this study. The PAH-degrading soil microbes partially utilized the surfactant as a carbon source (26.9–32.7% of initial dose). The characterization of biodegraded surfactants revealed that the partial biodegradation occurred selectively on the hydrophobes of surfactants, resulting in an imbalance of amphiphilic moieties of surfactants. Consequently, the critical micelle concentration values increased by 61.9–88.0% and the micellar solubilization ratio values decreased by 66.5–84.3% after the surfactant biodegradation. These observations supported our conclusion that the partial and selective microbial degradation of surfactants can result in a significant reduction of surface-active and micellar solubilization capacities of surfactants. The findings of this study are expected to provide important implications for the application of surfactant-mediated remediation processes for PAHs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3agroundwater contamination 3amicelles 3anonionic surfactants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aremediation 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asolubilization 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aRemediation 0aTween surfactant 0aPartial and selective biodegradation 0aSurface-active capacity 0aMicellar solubilization capacity1 aKweon, Ji Hyang1 aKim, Han S.0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.652-660dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245015000164300001400314520161000328592002801938650002301966650002001989650001402009650002302023650002102046650001302067650002202080650000902102650001102111650001402122650001502136650001402151650002202165650002602187650001102213651001102224651003102235653002702266653001402293653001702307653002502324700002402349700001802373700002002391700001502411700001902426773014202445856007602587852000902663655001202672IND60767442820221120040040.0220216e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076744282DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toab2472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReisig, Dominic D.10aBest Management Practices to Delay the Evolution of Bt Resistance in Lepidopteran Pests Without High Susceptibility to Bt Toxins in North America  ap. 26-36.  aCanadian and United States (US) insect resistance management (IRM) programs for lepidopteran pests in Bacillus thuriengiensis (Bt)-expressing crops are optimally designed for Ostrinia nubilalis Hübner in corn (Zea mays L.) and Chloridea virescens Fabricius in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Both Bt corn and cotton express a high dose for these pests; however, there are many other target pests for which Bt crops do not express high doses (commonly referred to as nonhigh dose pests). Two important lepidopteran nonhigh dose (low susceptibility) pests are Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Striacosta albicosta Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). We highlight both pests as cautionary examples of exposure to nonhigh dose levels of Bt toxins when the IRM plan was not followed. Moreover, IRM practices to delay Bt resistance that are designed for these two ecologically challenging and important pests should apply to species that are more susceptible to Bt toxins. The purpose of this article is to propose five best management practices to delay the evolution of Bt resistance in lepidopteran pests with low susceptibility to Bt toxins in Canada and the US: 1) better understand resistance potential before commercialization, 2) strengthen IRM based on regional pest pressure by restricting Bt usage where it is of little benefit, 3) require and incentivize planting of structured corn refuge everywhere for single toxin cultivars and in the southern US for pyramids, 4) integrate field and laboratory resistance monitoring programs, and 5) effectively use unexpected injury thresholds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aHeliothis 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3aRichia albicosta 3aZea mays 3acommercialization 3acorn 3acotton 3acultivars 3aentomology 3aevolution 3ainsect resistance 3aresistance management 3atoxins 3aCanada 3aSoutheastern United States 0aBacillus thuringiensis 0ahigh dose 0anonhigh dose 0aStriacosta albicosta1 aDiFonzo, Christina,1 aDively, Galen1 aFarhan, Yasmine1 aGore, Jeff1 aSmith, Jocelyn0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 115, no. 1 p.26-36dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toab2473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03557naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005100150245010600201300001500307520163900322592002801961650001701989650001702006650001602023650001002039650001602049650002502065650001102090650003102101650001002132650001402142650003002156650001202186650001802198650002002216650001002236651001002246653002502256653002002281653001002301653001902311653000802330653000902338653000702347653000802354653000802362653000802370653001102378653000902389653000702398653000802405653000802413653000802421653001202429653000902441653000802450653000902458653000702467700001502474700001702489700001702506700001802523700001902541700001702560700001702577773012302594856008502717852000902802655001202811IND60597574520221118125218.0190410e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6961-329210aTranscriptome analysis reveals novel genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in the flesh of peach  ap. 94-102.  aPeach is an important deciduous fruit tree species. Anthocyanins play an important role in fruit color formation and, through linkage analysis, previous studies have identified and mapped the key genes regulating anthocyanins' accumulation to chromosomes 3 and 5 in two different germplasms. To understand the overall regulatory network of anthocyanins biosynthesis, genes co-expressed with these key genes were identified in the red-fleshed ‘Tianjin Shui Mi’ and white-fleshed ‘Hakuho’ germplasms. Analysis of their flesh anthocyanin contents revealed differences 15 days before maturation. Therefore, transcriptome analysis of the flesh of fruits belonging to these two germplasms was performed to search for genes that were up-regulated at the late stage of development of ‘Tianjin Shui Mi’ but not of ‘Hakuho’, and identified 183 genes. These genes were also analyzed in the flesh transcriptomes of peach fruits belonging to 30 peach varieties with different anthocyanin contents at maturation, and the Pearson's correlation coefficients between their expression levels and anthocyanin contents were determined. The results showed that 66 genes were significantly correlated to anthocyanin contents, most of which previously reported as regulatory, biosynthetic, and transporter genes involved in anthocyanins' regulatory network. The results of this study enrich the understanding of key genes involved in the biological pathway regulating anthocyanins biosynthesis. The genes mostly associated with anthocyanins biosynthesis presented in this study are of great importance for molecular marker-assisted breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3achromosomes 3acolor 3acorrelation 3adevelopmental stages 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agermplasm 3amarker-assisted selection 3apeaches 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atrees 3aChina 0aAnthocyanin contents 0aGene expression 0aPeach 0aRNA sequencing 0a3GT 0abHLH 0aBL 0aCHI 0aCHS 0aDFR 0aF3′H 0aFPKM 0aGO 0aGSH 0aGST 0aMBW 0aqRT-PCR 0aQTLs 0aSSR 0aUFGT 0aUV1 aDing, Tiyu1 aMao, Dongmin1 aZhu, Gengrui1 aFang, Weichao1 aChen, Changwen1 aWang, Xinwei1 aWang, Lirong0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Feb., v. 123 p.94-102dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100004000147245013100187300001800318520116100336592002801497650002001525650001501545650001901560650001101579650001301590650002201603650001501625650000901640650001101649650001401660650001201674650001501686651002301701700001501724700001701739700001401756700001401770773010401784856008101888990002301969852000901992655001202001IND60096198920221121014232.0141104e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009619892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2011.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurnas, Miles J.q(Miles Jonathan),10aRegional-scale nitrogen and phosphorus budgets for the northern (14°S) and central (17°S) Great Barrier Reef shelf ecosystem  ap. 1967-1990.  aSeasonally averaged N and P box model budgets were constructed for two regional-scale sections of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) shelf, one in the near-pristine far-northern GBR (13.5–14.5°S) and the other in the central GBR (17–18°S) adjacent to more intensively farmed wet tropics watersheds. We were unable to simultaneously balance shelf-scale N and P budgets within seasonal or annual time frames, indicating that magnitudes of a number of key input and, especially, loss processes are still poorly constrained. In most cases, current estimates of system-level N and P sources (rainfall, runoff, upwelling, N-fixation) are less than estimated loss processes (denitrification, cross-shelfbreak mixing and burial). Nutrient dynamics in both shelf sections are dominated by the tightly coupled uptake and mineralization of soluble N and P in the water column and the sedimentation–resuspension of particulate detritus. On an area-averaged basis, internal cycling fluxes are an order of magnitude greater than input–output fluxes. Denitrification in shelf sediments is a significant sink for N while lateral mixing is both a source and sink for P.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenitrification 3aecosystems 3amineralization 3amixing 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aphosphorus 3arain 3arunoff 3asediments 3atropics 3awatersheds 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aAlongi, D.1 aMcKinnon, D.1 aTrott, L.1 aSkuza, M.0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Dec., v. 31, no. 19-20 p.1967-1990dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2011.09.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04232naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245020100166300001600367520214800383592002802531650002302559650002002582650001802602650001202620650002402632650001602656650001402672650002202686650001902708650001502727650002002742650002102762650002202783650002602805650002002831650002602851650002302877650001402900650001702914650001202931650001502943650002302958650001902981650001703000650001203017650001303029650002603042650001403068650002503082650001803107650001703125653002203142653001803164653004603182653001703228653001703245653002103262700002403283700002103307773012403328856008503452852000903537655001203546IND60597574620221118125229.0190410e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAziz, Aniqa10aInfluence of natural and synthetic vitamin C (ascorbic acid) on primary and secondary metabolites and associated metabolism in quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) plants under water deficit regimes  ap. 192-203.  aPhytoextracts are being widely used these days as a source of bioactive compounds for mitigating the harmful effects of abiotic stresses including drought stress. In this study, it was assessed how far foliar applied pure synthetic ascorbic acid (AsA) or natural sweet orange juice (OJ) enriched with AsA could mitigate the drought stress induced adverse effects on growth and some key metabolic processes in quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.; cultivar V9) plants. Two weeks old quinoa seedlings were subjected to varying irrigation regimes as control [100% field capacity (FC)] and drought stress (60% FC, 40% FC and 20% FC). After one month of water deficit treatments, various levels of ascorbic acid (150 mg L−1 AsA or 25% OJ) besides control [distilled water (DW) and no spray (NS)] were applied as a foliar spray. After 15 days of AsA application, different physio-biochemical attributes were measured. The results showed that water deficit markedly decreased plant growth, relative water content (RWC), photosynthetic rate, total carotenoids (CAR) and total flavonoids, while it increased relative membrane permeability (RMP), intrinsic AsA content, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), glycinebetaine (GB), total phenolics, total soluble proteins (TSP), total free amino acids, activities of key antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD)], total soluble sugars (TSS), reducing (RS) and non-reducing sugars (NRS). Most obvious results of most of these parameters were observed at 40% and 20% FC. Foliar-applied pure 150 mg L−1 AsA and 25% OJ were found to be very effective in improving plant growth, RMP, photosynthetic rate, CAR, proline, AsA, MDA, GB, TSP, free amino acids, SOD, POD, TSS, RS, NRS and total flavonoids. It was noticed that 25% OJ enriched with AsA and other essential nutrients and biomolecules was as efficient as 150 mg L−1 AsA in reducing the adverse effects of drought stress on quinoa plants. So, it was concluded that OJ, a cheaper source of vitamin C, can be used as a mitigating agent for improving drought tolerance in plants under drought-prone environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aadverse effects 3aascorbic acid 3abetaine 3abioactive compounds 3acarotenoids 3acultivars 3adrought tolerance 3afield capacity 3aflavonoids 3afoliar spraying 3afree amino acids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airrigation management 3amalondialdehyde 3amembrane permeability 3anonreducing sugars 3anutrients 3aorange juice 3aoranges 3aperoxidase 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aproline 3aproteins 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater content 3awater stress 0aDrought tolerance 0aAscorbic acid 0aPhytoextracts quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) 0aOrange juice 0aAntioxidants 0aSugar metabolism1 aAkram, Nudrat Aisha1 aAshraf, Muhammad0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Feb., v. 123 p.192-203dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245006100172520097000233592002801203650004401231650001401275650002401289650001701313650001501330650001001345700002201355700002701377700002801404773012101432856008001553852000901633655001201642IND60702413920221121223708.0200718e20200508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070241392DNAL7 a10.3390/beverages60200302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasalekou, Marianthi 10aWine Authenticity and Traceability with the Use of FT-IR  aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has gained popularity in the wine sector due to its simplicity and ability to provide a wine’s fingerprint.

Because of their extreme potency, methods to safely and rapidly detect these compounds are of high interest. This work investigates the use of thermal desorption direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (TD-DART-MS) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) as tools for the rapid and sensitive (nanogram to picograms) detection of fentanyl, 16 fentanyl analogues, and five additional opioids. Competitive ionization studies highlight that detection of these compounds in the presence of heroin is readily achievable, down to 0.1% fentanyl by mass with TD-DART-MS. With IMS, detection of nanogram levels of fentanyl in a binary fentanyl and heroin mixture is possible but can be complicated by decreased resolution in certain commercial instrument models. Modifications to the alarm windows can be used to ensure detection of fentanyl in binary mixtures. Additionally, three complex background matrices (fingerprint residue, dirt, and plasticizers) are shown to have a minimal effect of the detection of these compounds. Wipe sampling of the exterior of bags of questioned powders is shown to be a safe alternative method for field screening and identification, removing the need to handle potentially lethal amounts of material.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFentanyl 0aTrace detection 0aIMS 0aDART-MS 0aOpioids 0aNarcotics1 aVerkouteren, Jennifer1 aStaymates, Jessica1 aLawrence, Jeffrey0 tForensic Chemistry.g2017 June, v. 4 p.108-115dElsevier B.V.x2468-17097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forc.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245016200162500002200324520146600346592002801812653003401840653003601874653003101910653001901941700001901960700001601979700001801995700002602013773007802039856008202117852000902199655001202208IND60568185720221119111206.0170524s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.serj.2017.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutisna, 10aPrototype of a flat-panel photoreactor using TiO2 nanoparticles coated on transparent granules for the degradation of Methylene Blue under solar illumination  aPre-press version  aThe purpose of this work is to design a prototype of a flat-panel (FP) photoreactor for wastewater treatment via solar illumination using TiO2 nano-photocatalysts. The TiO2 nanoparticles are initially coated on transparent plastic granules to avoid the difficulties associated with the recovery of nanoparticles after completing the treatment process. The coated granules were distributed in the space inside the reactor panel. The upper cover of the reactor is a transparent material that allows light penetration to activate the catalyst. Wastewater is circulated into the spaces between the coated granules. When exposed to solar illumination, photocatalytic reactions occur on nearly the entire surface of the coated granules. To test the reactor viability, we used technical grade TiO2 (for affordability) and a solution of Methylene Blue (MB) as a sample of wastewater. The photoreactor was tested for treating 30 L of MB solution with an initial concentration of 25 mg L−1. We observed that the reactor was able to degrade more than 98% of the MB in the solution after 48 h of solar illumination. The performance of the FP photoreactor was also improved by arranging several reactor panels in series. Using four panels, we observed that the complete decomposition of the same MB solution can be achieved within 10 h. The proposed FP photoreactor is a very promising alternative for use in decomposing recalcitrant organic pollutants in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFlat-panel solar photoreactor 0aCoated TiO2 on plastic granules 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0aMethylene Blue1 aRokhmat, Mamat1 aWibowo, Edy1 aKhairurrijal,1 aAbdullah, Mikrajuddin0 tSustainable Environment Research.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x2468-20397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.serj.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001600188245009600204300001200300506007600312520106000388592002801448506003701476650002101513650001901534650001301553650002001566650001501586650000901601650000901610650001401619650000901633650001301642651001901655653001501674653001501689653001301704653001601717653001701733700001501750700001801765700001501783700001801798700001601816700001901832700001701851700001401868700001701882700002001899700001901919773010301938856008202041852000902123655001202132IND60526303720221207125422.0201124e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630372DNAL7 aPMC58903842pmcid7 a297251582pmid7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikirou, M.10aScreening African rice (Oryza glaberrima) for tolerance to abiotic stresses: I.

Oryza glaberrima the cultivated rice species that originated from West Africa is well-adapted to its growing ecologies. The aim of this study was to identify the promising O. glaberrima accessions tolerant to Fe toxicity from the 2106 accessions held at the AfricaRice gene bank. The screenings were conducted over a four-year period and involved evaluating the entries under Fe-toxic field conditions in West Africa, selecting good yielding accessions and repeating the testing with newly selected lines. Three accessions (TOG 7206, TOG 6218-B and TOG 7250-A) were higher yielding than O. sativa checks under stress but with similar yields under control conditions. These accessions yielded over 300g/m² under both Fe toxicity and control conditions. In conclusion, these materials could be used as donors in breeding programs for developing high yielding rice varieties suited to Fe toxicity affected areas in West Africa.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza glaberrima 3aabiotic stress 3abreeding 3acrop production 3agene banks 3airon 3arice 3ascreening 3asoil 3atoxicity 3aWestern Africa 0aHigh yield 0aNew donors 0aHotspots 0aWest africa 0aLowland rice1 aShittu, A.1 aKonaté, K.A.1 aMaji, A.T.1 aNgaujah, A.S.1 aSanni, K.A.1 aOgunbayo, S.A.1 aAkintayo, I.1 aSaito, K.1 aDramé, K.N.1 aAhanchédé, A.1 aVenuprasad, R.0 tField crops research.g2018 May 01, v. 220 p.3-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03842naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009300165300001800258520259900276592002802875650001102903650001202914650001602926650001802942650001102960650001902971650002302990650001403013650001703027650001903044650002303063650001003086650001603096700001903112700002403131700001603155700002003171773010403191856008103295990002303376852000903399655001203408IND60096199420221123013739.0141104e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009619942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2011.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yongsheng10aTidally-induced sediment transport patterns in the upper Bay of Fundy: A numerical study  ap. 2041-2053.  aThe Minas Basin, the eastern end of the Bay of Fundy, is well known for its high tide ranges and strong tidal currents, which can be exploited to extract electricity power. The properties of the tidally-induced sediment transport in the Minas Basin, where significant changes in tidal processes may occur due to a recently proposed tidal power project, have been studied with a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, an empirical bed load sediment transport model and surface sediment concentrations derived from the remotely-sensed images. The hydrodynamic model was evaluated against independent observational data, which include tidal elevation, tidal current (in the full water column and bottom layer), residual current profile and tidal asymmetry indicators. The evaluation shows that the model is in good agreement with the observations. The sediment transport includes two components, bed load and suspended particulate load. The bed load is calculated using the modelled bottom shear stress and the observed grain size data. The estimated features of bed load transport roughly agree with the observed patterns of the erosion and deposition in the Minas Basin and Cobequid Bay. The transport of the suspended load is estimated using the modelled velocity fields and the surface sediment concentration derived from remote-sensing images. The comparisons between the modelled results and the limited observations illustrate that the observed directions of suspended sediment transport are basically reproduced by the model. The modelled net suspended sediment input into the Minas Basin through Minas Passage is 2.4×10⁶m³yr⁻¹, which is comparable to the observed value of 1.6×10⁶m³yr⁻¹. The variations of the bed load and the suspended load in space and time are also presented. The total net transport, defined as the mean value of the sum of bed and suspended load transports during the tidal cycle, shows strong spatial variability. The magnitude of the transport flux ranges from 0.1 to 0.2kgm⁻¹s⁻¹ in Minas Channel and Minas Passage, 0.1kgm⁻¹s⁻¹ in Cobequid Bay, to 0.01kgm⁻¹s⁻¹ in the central Minas Basin and Southern Bight. In Minas Channel, the sediment transport follows the structure of the tidal residual circulation, which features a large anticlockwise gyre. The sediment in Minas Passage moves eastward and deposits into the central Minas Basin. However, the sediment from the eastern part of the Basin moves westward and deposits in the central Minas Basin as well. In the Cobequid Bay, sediment moves eastward and deposits in the upper bay.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abedload 3aelectricity 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asediment transport 3asediments 3ashear stress 3aspace and time 3asuspended sediment 3atides 3awater power1 aChaffey, Jason1 aGreenberg, David A.1 aColbo, Keir1 aSmith, Peter C.0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Dec., v. 31, no. 19-20 p.2041-2053dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2011.10.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245019400169300001400363520166800377592002802045650001902073650001202092650001102104650002902115650003002144650000902174650000902183650001402192650001202206650001402218650003102232650001502263650003702278650001802315650002702333650001402360650000902374651002202383651001102405653001702416653001702433653001802450653001902468653001802487700002202505773008602527856005102613852000902664655001202673IND50087083120221120190016.0140412e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008708312DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2010.4835982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMzoughi, Nadia10aDistribution of trace metals, aliphatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediment cores from the Sicily Channel and the Gulf of Tunis (south‐western Mediterranean Sea)  ap. 43-54.  aUnder the framework of the IAEA's Technical Co‐operation project RAF7/004, international research cruises were carried out in 2004 to assess the distribution of radionuclides and micropollutants in the south‐western Mediterranean Sea. Sediments samples had variable concentrations of total aliphatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 µg g⁻¹ and 26.9 to 364.4 ng g⁻¹, respectively, in the Sicily Channel and from 0.7 to 2.8 µg g⁻¹ and 14.7 to 618.1 ng g⁻¹, respectively, in the open sea of the Gulf of Tunis. Hydrocarbon concentrations changed with depth and were relatively high at 3 cm and 10 cm depths. The use of ‘fingerprint’ ratios of certain isomeric pairs of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and the proportion of 2–3 ring and 4–5 ring PAH concentrations showed that the main origins are characteristic of petroleum sources. The ranges of trace metal concentrations, expressed in µgg⁻¹, in the Sicily Channel and in the Gulf of Tunis, respectively, were: Hg 0.009–0.2 and 0.02–0.1; Pb 9.9–26.1 and 21.2–32.5; Cd 0.06–0.1 and 0.07–0.33; Fe 23.7–28.1 and 29.9–36.2p; Zn 83–99.5 and 83–104; Mn 309.2–752.5 and 651–814; Cu 17.1–18.5 and 33.5–51.3. Sediment metal abundances were in the order: Mn > Zn > Fe > Cu > Pb > Cd > Hg. The results showed significant differences (p < 0.001) for trace metal and hydrocarbon mean concentrations between the two cores. These concentrations are generally similar to the background levels from the Mediterranean Sea and could be affected by physico‐chemical conditions and sedimentation rate as well as biodegradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acadmium 3acopper 3aenvironmental technology 3ageographical distribution 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3apetroleum 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aradionuclides 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3azinc 3aMediterranean Sea 3aSicily 0ahydrocarbons 0atrace metals 0asediment core 0aSicily Channel 0aGulf of Tunis1 aChouba, Lassâad,0 tEnvironmental technology.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 32, no. 1 p.43-54dTFx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.483598  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012000172300001400292500001500306520118100321592002801502650002701530650001101557650000901568650002201577650002601599650001601625650001501641650001201656650000901668650002201677650001501699650001201714650001301726650002901739650002301768650001501791651001001806653003901816653001301855653004801868653001801916653001201934653002401946700002301970700002301993773008602016856005102102852000902153655001202162IND50087083320221120175154.0140412e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008708332DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2010.4868442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhong, Thai Khanh10aSimulating concentration of bensulphuron‐methyl in a drainage canal of a paddy block using a rice pesticide model  ap. 69-81.  a2019-12-05  aA pesticide fate and transport model (PCPF‐B) was developed to predict the runoff of pesticides from paddy plots to a drainage canal in a paddy block based on the plot scale model (PCPF‐1). The block‐scale model now comprises three modules: (1) a module for pesticide application, (2) a module for pesticide behaviour in paddy fields, and (3) a module for pesticide concentration in the drainage canal. The PCPF‐B model was first evaluated using published data in a single plot and then was applied to predict the concentration of bensulphuron‐methyl in one paddy block in the Sakura river basin, Ibaraki, Japan, where a detailed field survey was conducted. The PCPF‐B model simulated well the concentration of bensulphuron‐methyl in individual paddy plots. It also reflected the runoff pattern of bensulphuron‐methyl at the block outlet, although overestimation of bensulphuron‐methyl concentrations occurred due to uncertainty in water balance estimation. A sensitivity analysis showed that the soil adsorption coefficient of the herbicide had the greatest influence on the concentrations and cumulative loss of bensulphuron‐methyl to the drainage canal.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical concentration 3arunoff 3arice 3asimulation models 3apesticide application 3auncertainty 3aherbicides 3asurveys 3asoil 3adrainage channels 3awatersheds 3apaddies 3adrainage 3aenvironmental technology 3aenvironmental fate 3aadsorption 3aJapan 0apesticide application distribution 0aPCPF‐1 0apredicted environmental concentration (PEC) 0awater balance 0aseepage 0apesticide modelling1 aHiramatsu, Kazuaki1 aWatanabe, Hirozumi0 tEnvironmental technology.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 32, no. 1 p.69-81dTFx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.486844  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006300167300001300230520139300243592002801636653003101664653001701695653002501712700001501737700002301752700001201775700001701787700001701804700001601821700005701837700001601894700001301910773008401923856008402007852000902091655001202100IND60568186320221119111226.0170709e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mtener.2017.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jinfeng10aRecent progress of fiber-shaped asymmetric supercapacitors  ap. 1-14.  aFiber-shaped supercapacitors have attracted widely attention for their great potential application in future portable and wearable electronics compared with traditional 2D planar structured supercapacitors, which is associated to their high flexibility, tiny volume and good deformability. Asymmetric designed supercapacitors usually couple two different electrodes with a Faradaic or battery-type electrode as the energy source role and a non-faradaic (or electric double-layer) electrode as the power source in one configuration, and thus can operate in much wider potential windows than that of the symmetrical design, thus potentially leading to a substantial increase in the energy density. Here, we focused on the recent progresses and advances of fiber-shaped asymmetric supercapacitors (FASCs) with respect to their electrode materials, design and configuration. Firstly, capacitive and pseudocapacitive materials, such as carbon materials, conductive polymers and metal oxides/sulfides/nitrides, are comprehensively discussed with the scope of their working potential ranges, proper electrolytes and working principles. Then the progresses to date on the FASCs including the device design, electrode fabrication and electrochemical performance of the FASCs are summarized.

The small size of Palmer amaranth seeds, relative to other common weeds, provides an opportunity to use physical weed control through high-biomass, rolled cover crop mulches, in conjunction with herbicide tools. Experiments were conducted to characterize Palmer amaranth suppression and light permeability from a range of rye biomass levels. There was an inverse relationship between Palmer amaranth emergence and rye biomass that was described by a log-logistic regression model. In the absence of rye, there was approximately 80% Palmer amaranth emergence, while the highest rate of rye biomass prevented Palmer amaranth emergence. A log-logistic regression model also described the amount of photosynthetic active radiation transmitted through rye mulch in a green house experiment. The highest level of rye biomass reduced the amount of light to 13% of full sunlight, while 5370kgha−1 of rye caused a 50% reduction of light transmission; a similar level of rye biomass (P=0.93) reduced Palmer amaranth emergence by 50%. Effective suppression of Palmer amaranth will depend upon the ability to produce high-biomass rye. Field experiments evaluated changes in planting date, seeding rate, and nitrogen application on rye biomass production. Maximum rye biomass in April occurred when rye was planted prior to middle-November. However, a 50% reduction in rye biomass resulted from middle-December planting of rye, providing growers with a short planting interval for high-biomass rye production. Additionally, rye seeding rate did not increase rye biomass accumulation indicating that delays in autumn sowing cannot be overcome with plant density. Finally, nitrogen fertilizer applied at planting consistently increased rye biomass production 23–33% relative to non-fertilized controls averaged over all planting dates. Additional research is needed to evaluate how repeated high-biomass cover crop systems affect weed management systems, other pest complexes, and soil moisture status in the sandy soils of the southeast Coastal Plain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus palmeri 3aamaranth grain 3aautumn 3abiomass production 3acoastal plains 3acover crops 3acrop production 3afield experimentation 3agrowers 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3amanagement systems 3amulches 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apermeability 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplant density 3aplanting date 3aregression analysis 3arye 3asandy soils 3asoil water 3asolar radiation 3asowing 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aGeorgia 0aGR50 0aAmaranthus palmeri 0aCover crops 0aGlyphosate resistant Palmer amaranth 0aHigh-biomass mulch 0aWeed suppression1 aSimmons, Danielle B.1 aCulpepper, A.

While antigen detection techniques are widely used in Clinical Microbiology laboratories, for the diagnosis of viruses, some parasites and some bacteria, molecular techniques are routinely used only for some pathogens (such as Clostridium difficile). However, molecular techniques are constantly evolving, and they allow a rapid diagnosis for an increasing number of pathogens, with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, they are also able to detect virulence factors or resistance mechanisms. Syndromic surveillance systems, which detect different pathogens simultaneously, are very promising because they enable the most frequent pathogens to be diagnosed in a few hours and they can be very useful in certain patients.For the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection, molecular techniques are able to detect bacteria and its resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, allowing the most appropriate treatment to be selected for each patient when bacterial culture is not possible.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRotavirus 0aClostridium difficile 0aHelicobacter pylori 0aRotavirus 0aClostridium difficile 0aHelicobacter pylori1 aAlarcón-Cavero, Teresa0 tEnfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica (English ed.).g2017 June,  July, v. 35 p.367-376dElsevier España, S.L.U.x2529-993X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eimce.2017.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009500173300001600268520140300284536033901687592002802026596005402054650001502108650001802123650002102141650001502162650002402177650001602201650001402217650001502231650001602246650001102262653001402273653001502287653002702302653002002329700002802349700002602377700002502403700002302428700002802451700002602479700002702505773013302532856008602665852000902751655001202760IND60786065620221119013817.0220802e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606562DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2021.19981102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBychkova, Anna V.10aNonspecific interaction between plasminogen and modified magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles  ap. 800-808.  aThe magnetic particles modified with silicon dioxide (SiO₂) and amino groups (-NH₂), as well as the magnetic particles modified with human serum albumin (HSA) were synthesized using the approaches we developed before and characterized by physico-chemical methods in this study. Plasminogen was chosen as a model protein since plasminogen plays a major role in the fibrinolytic system and plasminogen level correlates with different pathologies and conditions. For the first time it has been carried out qualitative and quantitative assessment of plasminogen nonspecific binding (noncovalent adsorption) by the particles in buffer and plasma solutions. The fibrinolytic activity of plasminogen on the surface of the particles has been measured by the aid of commercially available kits and appeared to be 28–30% of its initial value. Plasminogen desorption from the surface of particles was studied in phosphate buffer with NaCl and ε-aminocaproic acid. Despite nonspecific plasminogen binding is an undesirable process, the data obtained is valuable for further modification of particles for high-specific proteins extraction from biological fluids or transport of plasminogen by the particles. The perspectives of particles modified with SiO₂ and –NH₂, and particles modified with HSA for isolation of protein analytes and their quantitative assessment thereafter have been discussed.  aThe reported study aimed at design of the systems based on magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and their study by EMR was supported by the Russian Science Foundation [grant number 18-73-00350].

We measured chlorophyll a fluorescence as well as profiles of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH) and fumarase activities, malic and citric acids contents and the expression of NADP-ICDH and NADP-ME in the organ-dependent (root vs leaves) response of cucumber plants exposed to individual or sequential action of salt stress (50 mM or 100 mM NaCl) and Pseudomonas syringae pv lachrymans (Psl). NaCl treatment, Psl infection and the combination of these stresses caused disturbances in the activity of photosystem II which were suggested to specifically transmit the stress signals. PEPC and NADP-ME were induced in cucumber plants under stress, confirming that in C3 plants they function in defence responses. The profiles of malate and citrate contents, PEPC as well as NADP-ICDH and NADP-ME activities and gene expression in response to a combination of salt and pathogen stresses differed from those provoked by individual stress with respect to the direction, intensity and timing. The results indicated that the most pronounced defence response related to the readjustment of the carbon metabolism was observed in the leaves of plants exposed to combined stress. Intense activity changes of NADPH-generating enzymes, NADP-ICDH and NADP-ME, characterized the tailored response to combined stress and could be important for the integration of defence mechanisms between organs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans 3abacterial infections 3acarbon metabolism 3achlorophyll 3acitrates 3acitric acid 3acucumbers 3adefense mechanisms 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afumarate hydratase 3agene expression 3aleaves 3amalates 3apathogens 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aphotosystem II 3asalt stress 0aBiotic stress 0aSalinity 0aStress interactions 0aPhotosynthetic carbon metabolism 0aC4 enzymes 0aP. syringae pv lachrymans1 aKuźniak, Elżbieta1 aLinkiewicz, Anna1 aSowa, Sławomir0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Feb., v. 123 p.160-169dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011300167300001800280520148800298592002801786650004401814650001501858650001501873650001101888650001201899650001101911650003101922650000901953650000901962650001801971650001101989650001502000650002202015650003302037650002302070650001102093650002302104650001902127653001402146653001302160653002502173653002102198653002202219653002602241700002502267700001502292700002602307773012902333856008502462852000902547655001202556IND60568186920221119111100.0170502e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818692DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b021522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Linlin10aSuccessive Extraction of As(V), Cu(II), and P(V) Ions from Water Using Surface Modified Ghee Residue Protein  ap. 3742-3750.  aRenewable adsorbents are interesting for water purification owing to easy access and presence of multiple functional groups for extraction of pollutants. The biowaste, ghee residue from the milk industry was washed to remove fat contents, coated with polyethylenimine (PEI) and Fe(III) ions (Prot-PEI-Fe) was synthesized for the successive adsorption of As(V), Cu(II) and P(V) ions from spiked water samples. The pretreated ghee residue was characterized using FTIR, SEM, ζ-potential and elemental analysis. Batch mode experiments and kinetic regression results showed that the adsorption processes of As(V) and P(V) anions were more accurately described by a pseudo-second-order model, whereas the adsorption of Cu(II) ions followed a pseudo-first-order model. The maximum adsorption capacities estimated by Langmuir model for As(V), Cu(II) and P(V) ions were 45.1, 80.7 and 21.7 mg/g, respectively. The successive adsorptions of As(V), Cu(II) and P(V) ions were achieved through electrostatic attraction, which was demonstrated by the changes in ζ-potentials of the adsorbent after each experiment. The dynamic column adsorption behavior of the adsorbent was described by Thomas model. The simulated results showed good agreement between the theoretical values (q₀) generated by using Thomas model and the experimental values (qₑₓₚ). The results presented in this paper could be used for developing new adsorbent from the renewable waste materials for water purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aarsenic 3acopper 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aghee 3airon 3amilk industry 3amodels 3apollutants 3apolyethyleneimine 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3awastes 3awater purification 3azeta potential 0aAdsorbent 0aBiowaste 0aGhee residue protein 0aHeavy metal ions 0aArsenic pollution 0aSuccessive Adsorption1 aDesai, Masoom Kartik1 aWang, Peng1 aValiyaveettil, Suresh0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 May 01, v. 5, no. 5 p.3742-3750dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b021523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010100168300001800269520122300287592002801510650001301538650002101551650001101572650001501583650001701598650001401615650001401629650001201643650001001655651001901665773010501684856008101789990002301870852000901893655001201902IND60096200220221119044607.0141104e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009620022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2010.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpearman, Jeremy14aThe development of a tool for examining the morphological evolution of managed realignment sites  ap. S199-S210.  aThis paper describes the development of a model for prediction of local changes in morphodynamics resulting from managed realignment, undertaken as part of a UK project funded by Defra. The methodology builds on the conceptual modelling approach to habitat development employed successfully by Di Silvio (1989, 1998), Di Silvio and Gambolati (1990) and others for lagoon environments. The overall approach can be described as hybrid – combining bottom-up (process-based) and top-down (simplified and/or empirical) predictive techniques – to describe the essential inlet functioning. The model described in this paper is used to predict the evolution of a managed realignment site under the action of tides and waves and sediment supply. Validation of the managed realignment model is undertaken using the available survey data from before the realignment and from several years afterwards. The performance of the model is promising in this respect, producing the right magnitude and the main qualitative features of bathymetric change. Longer simulations are used to see how the growth of saltmarsh itself affects the evolution of the setback field and how sea level rise would affect the development of saltmarsh.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitats 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aprediction 3asalt marshes 3asea level 3asediments 3asurveys 3atides 3aUnited Kingdom0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 July 15, v. 31, no. 10S p.S199-S210dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2010.12.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245015000163300001600313520140400329592002801733650002501761650002501786650001501811650001001826650002201836650001501858650002001873650001601893650001001909650001001919653001801929653002101947653000901968700002401977700002502001700002502026700002902051773014402080856007602224961001502300852000902315655001202324IND60767439720221118032355.0220216e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076743972DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toab2092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLampiri, Evagelia10aComparative Population Growth of the Khapra Beetle (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) and the Warehouse Beetle (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) on Wheat and Rice  ap. 344-352.  aWe evaluated the relative population growth of two stored-product insect species in the genus Trogoderma, the khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium Everts (Coleoptera: Dermestidae), and the warehouse beetle, Trogoderma variabile Ballion (Coleoptera: Dermestidae). Ten adults of each species were placed in vials containing wheat or paddy rice. These tests were performed at 27 and 32°C and the number of adults in the vials were counted after 35 and 70 days. For all the time intervals and temperatures of both species on wheat, the resulting larval abundances were similar, with the exception of 27°C at 70 days where more T. variabile larvae developed. At the higher temperature, both species had similar population growth on rice. However, the success was mixed at 27°C with T. granarium having a greater abundance after 35 days, while T. variabile dominated after 70 days. Frass production in both commodities was usually similar for the two species, but greater frass production occurred by T. variabile on wheat after 70 days at 27°C, while T. granarium produced more frass on rice after 35 days at 32°C. Both species nearly always caused equivalent commodity damage. Our research suggests that under ideal conditions these two closely, but very differently treated species in commerce from the genus Trogoderma have comparable population growth, and cause similar damage on wheat and rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrogoderma granarium 3aTrogoderma variabile 3aentomology 3afrass 3apopulation growth 3arough rice 3astorage insects 3atemperature 3atrade 3awheat 0akhapra beetle 0awarehouse beetle 0arice1 aBaliota, Georgia V.1 aMorrison, William R.1 aDomingue, Michael J.1 aAthanassiou, Christos G.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 115, no. 1 p.344-352dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toab2093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/APHIS  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245013400165300001600299520130500315592002801620650002101648650001701669650001901686650001601705650001901721650002501740650002701765650002401792650004401816650003001860650002501890650001801915650001801933650001301951650001501964653001701979653001901996653003002015653001202045700001802057700001202075700001902087773011202106856008302218852000902301655001202310IND60087545220221121165442.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008754522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yingzi10aStudy of archaea community structure during the biodegradation process of nitrobenzene wastewater in an anaerobic baffled reactor  ap. 499-505.  aNitrobenzene (NB) is an important industrial raw material in organic synthesis. However, successful biological treatment is challenging since NB wastewater is biologically toxic. During the experiment, the performance was examined during the acclimation process of NB in an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR). The removal efficiencies of NB and chemical oxygen demand were 98% and 90%, respectively. Furthermore, by applying polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technology of 16SrDNA, this paper analyzes the structural change of the archaea community in the ABR before and after NB acclimation and identifies the dominant community. The sequence structure analysis of archaea 16S rDNA in DGGE profiles shows that after NB biodegradation, the archaea-dominant community primarily consists of Methanothrix soehngenii from Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta concilii from Methanosaeta, Methanobacterium beijingense 8-2, uncultured Archaeon TA04, and uncultured Methanobacterium sp. isolated from environmental samples, which may be the important functional archaea in an ABR for NB biodegradation. The study of the population structure distribution and the dominant archaea community is helpful for elucidating the mechanisms of the anaerobic biodegradation mechanism of NB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobacterium 3aMethanosaeta 3aMethanosarcina 3aacclimation 3abiodegradation 3abiological treatment 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation structure 3araw materials 3aribosomal DNA 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aNitrobenzene 0aBiodegradation 0aAnaerobic baffled reactor 0aArchaea1 aHan, Xiangkui1 aLu, Hai1 aZhou, Jinliang0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2013 Nov., v. 85 p.499-505dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2013.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245018000168300001200348500001900360520103600379592002801415596007101443596007201514650001901586650000801605650001201613650002701625650001701652650001601669650001901685650001301704650001001717650001001727700001801737700001501755700001601770700001501786700001801801700005301819773014201872856008302014852000902097655001202106IND60709021820221122053538.0210529e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070902182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-04834-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yongchao10aEvaluation and Comparison of the Toxic Effects of MgO NPs, ZnO NPs, α-Fe2O3 NPs, γ-Fe2O3 NPs, and Fe3O4 NPs on the Remediation for Cadmium-Related Effects in Wheat Seedlings  ap. 471.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn order to find the best nanometal oxides to alleviate the cadmium-caused toxicity, we chose five kinds of nanometal oxides (MgO NPs, ZnO NPs, α-Fe₂O₃ NPs, γ-Fe₂O₃ NPs, and Fe₃O₄ NPs) tried to research the different effects. In this study, the effects of nanometal oxides on physiological response indicators in wheat seedlings poisoned by cadmium were figured out. The results showed that the properties of nanometal oxides were related to their capacity to mitigate the toxicity induced by cadmium. Comparatively, 30 mg/L MgO NPs showed the best repair effect, as well as it can also alleviate the significant abiotic stress caused by Cd²⁺ on plants. The activity of antioxidant enzymes had been reduced and the growth of plants had been improved after the addition of MgO NPs. ZnO NPs showed further toxicity to Cd-poisoned wheat seedlings. Among the three nanoiron oxides, Fe₃O₄ NPs has a relatively good repair effect, which may be related to its Fe(II)—an essential element required for plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data  a20191B005cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2019HSB104cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aabiotic stress 3aair 3acadmium 3aphysiological response 3aplant growth 3aremediation 3asoil pollution 3atoxicity 3awater 3awheat1 aCheng, Yuxuan1 aZheng, Han1 aSong, Yaxin1 aLi, Ruizhe1 aWan, Fengting1 aLi, Junli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8792-37850 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 Sept., v. 231, no. 9 p.471-471dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04834-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04677naa a2201009 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100001900184245016800203300001200371506007600383520173200459592002802191506003702219650002402256650000802280650001502288650001502303650001702318650001802335650001502353650001702368650002002385650002102405650000902426650002302435650001202458650001302470650001002483650001102493650001402504650002302518650001602541650002002557650001402577650002502591650002102616650001502637650001502652650002502667650001002692650003102702650002502733650002602758650002302784650001602807650002302823650002902846650001502875650000902890650002402899650001102923650002102934650001102955650003202966650002502998650003503023650002803058650000903086650002703095650001603122650003503138650003903173650002403212650002803236650002503264650001603289700002103305700001803326700002103344700001803365700002303383700002003406700001903426700001803445700002303463700002203486773009203508856004603600852000903646655001203655IND4471608620221207141555.0130416e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447160862DNAL7 a215861772pmid7 aPMC31183312pmcid7 a10.1186/1475-2891-10-542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrevik, Asgeir10aSupplementation of a western diet with golden kiwifruits (Actinidia chinensis var.'Hort 16A':) effects on biomarkers of oxidation damage and antioxidant protection  ap. 379.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The health positive effects of diets high in fruits and vegetables are generally not replicated in supplementation trials with isolated antioxidants and vitamins, and as a consequence the emphasis of chronic disease prevention has shifted to whole foods and whole food products. METHODS: We carried out a human intervention trial with the golden kiwifruit, Actinidia chinensis, measuring markers of antioxidant status, DNA stability, plasma lipids, and platelet aggregation. Our hypothesis was that supplementation of a normal diet with kiwifruits would have an effect on biomarkers of oxidative status. Healthy volunteers supplemented a normal diet with either one or two golden kiwifruits per day in a cross-over study lasting 2 × 4 weeks. Plasma levels of vitamin C, and carotenoids, and the ferric reducing activity of plasma (FRAP) were measured. Malondialdehyde was assessed as a biomarker of lipid oxidation. Effects on DNA damage in circulating lymphocytes were estimated using the comet assay with enzyme modification to measure specific lesions; another modification allowed estimation of DNA repair. RESULTS: Plasma vitamin C increased after supplementation as did resistance towards H₂O₂-induced DNA damage. Purine oxidation in lymphocyte DNA decreased significantly after one kiwifruit per day, pyrimidine oxidation decreased after two fruits per day. Neither DNA base excision nor nucleotide excision repair was influenced by kiwifruit consumption. Malondialdehyde was not affected, but plasma triglycerides decreased. Whole blood platelet aggregation was decreased by kiwifruit supplementation. CONCLUSION: Golden kiwifruit consumption strengthens resistance towards endogenous oxidative damage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinidia chinensis 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abiomarkers 3ablood lipids 3ablood platelets 3achronic diseases 3adiet 3adisease prevention 3aenzymes 3aexcision 3afoods 3afruits 3akiwifruit 3alipid peroxidation 3alymphocytes 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidation 3aplatelet aggregation 3atriacylglycerols 3avegetables 3avolunteers 2aActinidiaxchemistry 2aAdult 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aAscorbic Acidxblood 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aCarotenoidsxblood 2aComet Assay 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDNA Damagexdrug effects 2aDNA Repair 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHumans 2aHydrogen Peroxidextoxicity 2aIntervention Studies 2aLipid Metabolismxdrug effects 2aLymphocytesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMalondialdehydexblood 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPlatelet Aggregationxdrug effects 2aPurinesxmetabolism 2aPyrimidinesxmetabolism 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aYoung Adult1 aGaivão, Isabel,1 aMedin, Tirill1 aJørgenesen, Aud1 aPiasek, Anita1 aElilasson, Johanna1 aKarlsen, Anette1 aBlomhoff, Rune1 aVeggan, Turid1 aDuttaroy, Asim K.,1 aCollins, Andrew R0 tNutrition journal.g2011 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.379-379dSpringer-Verlagx1475-28917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-10-54  aDNAL 7aarticle01560naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245010400158300001600262520070000278592002800978650001401006650001001020650001301030650001101043650002401054700001701078700001301095773009301108856004801201852000901249655001201258IND4482062420221118023209.0120303e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448206242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-012-0078-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, L.10aGenes involved in the synthesis and signaling pathway of strigolactone, a shoot branching inhibitor  ap. 210-214.  aBranching is an important step in higher plant development, which not only determines the configuration of the plant directly, but also affects its adaptability to the environment. The interactions between hormones, genes, environmental and other factors subtly regulate the process of branching. Strigolactone is a newly recognized phytohormone and its content and distribution might be a key factor affecting branching. This review is focused on the genes related to synthesis and transduction pathway of strigolactone, and summarizes the inhibitory role of strigolactone in plant branching. Discussions about the issues to be clarified and prospects of the future research were also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranching 3agenes 3ahormones 3ashoots 3asignal transduction1 aYang, Y. -J.1 aZhou, J.0 tBiologia plantarum.g2012 June, v. 56, no. 2 p.210-214dSpringer-Verlagx0006-31347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10535-012-0078-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03951naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011000170300001600280520210700296592002802403650002502431650001102456650002102467650001602488650002202504650001402526650002102540650001402561650001402575650001702589650001702606650001802623650001302641650004302654650002202697650001102719650001102730650001502741650001302756650001502769650001002784650001202794650001902806650001202825650001302837650001002850650001302860650001402873650001202887650001102899650002802910650001202938650001902950700003302969700002403002700002603026700001803052773012803070856008203198852000903280655001203289IND60709022520221121041623.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070902252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-020-09768-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolla, Siva Kumar10aBiochemical components of wild relatives of chickpea confer resistance to pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera  ap. 623-639.  aEfforts are being made to develop chickpea varieties with resistance to the pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera for reducing pesticide use and minimizing the extent of losses due to this pest. However, only low to moderate levels of resistance have been observed in the cultivated chickpea to this polyphagous pest. Hence, it is important to explore wild relatives as resistance sources to develop insect-resistant cultivars. Therefore, we studied different biochemical components that confer resistance to H. armigera in a diverse array of wild relatives of chickpea. Accessions belonging to wild relatives of chickpea exhibited high levels of resistance to H. armigera as compared to cultivated chickpea genotypes in terms of lower larval survival, pupation and adult emergence, decreased larval and pupal weights, prolonged larval and pupal developmental periods and reduced fecundity of the H. armigera when reared on artificial diet impregnated with lyophilized leaf powders. Amounts of proteins and phenols in different accessions of chickpea wild relatives were significantly and negatively correlated with larval weight, pupation and adult emergence. Phenols showed a negative correlation with pupal weight and fecundity, but positive correlation with pupal period. Total soluble sugars showed a negative correlation with larval period, but positive correlation with pupation and pupal weight, while tannins showed a positive correlation with larval weight, pupation and adult emergence. The flavonoid compounds such as chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, naringin, 3,4-dihydroxy flavones, quercetin, naringenin, genistein, biochanin-A and formononetin that were identified through HPLC fingerprints, exhibited negative effects on survival and development of H. armigera reared on artificial diet impregnated with lyophilized leaf powders. The wild relatives with diverse mechanisms of resistance conferred by different biochemical components can be used as sources of resistance in chickpea breeding programs to develop cultivars with durable resistance to H. armigera for sustainable crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aadults 3aartificial diets 3abiochanin A 3abreeding programs 3achickpeas 3achlorogenic acid 3acultivars 3afecundity 3aferulic acid 3aformononetin 3afreeze drying 3agenotype 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainsect resistance 3alarvae 3aleaves 3anaringenin 3anaringin 3apesticides 3apests 3aphenols 3aplant breeding 3apowders 3aproteins 3apupae 3apupation 3aquercetin 3arearing 3asugars 3asustainable agriculture 3atannins 3awild relatives1 aSharma, H.

We compare patterns of historical and contemporary genetic structure for three sympatric Great Lake’s lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) morphs (lean, siscowet, and humper) that differ in patterns of habitat occupancy, susceptibility to overfishing and predation by invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). Differential susceptibilities to overfishing and predation were expected to result in different impacts to levels of genetic diversity loss for each morphotype. Genetic data was collected for samples at three points in time: 1948 (pre-collapse), 1959 (collapse) and 1990s (current), corresponding to periods of intensive fishing, mortality due to lamprey and recovery, respectively. The lean morph preferentially targeted by the fishery and recognized as highly preyed upon by sea lamprey was more highly impacted genetically than other morphs, as evidenced by greater loss of genetic diversity first during the period of overfishing, then during the period of high sea lamprey abundance once the fishery collapsed. The siscowet morph also experienced genetic bottlenecks during the period of overfishing (pre-collapse period). Results indicate significant levels of genetic differentiation among morphs historically prior to declines in abundance and also among contemporary populations, suggesting that periods of population decline and resurgence in abundance and distribution did not result in loss of genetic distinctiveness among morphs.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahistory 3amorphs 3ahumans 3aoverfishing 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3apredation 3afish 3agenetic variation 3aPetromyzon marinus 3apopulation dynamics 3ahabitats 3amortality 3ahomogenization 3aLake Superior 0aresurgence1 aPage, Kevin S.1 aBurnham-Curtis, Mary K.1 aScribner, Kim T.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2012 Nov., v. 95, no. 3 p.323-334dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-012-0005-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245015400206300001600360520147700376592002801853596007101881650002201952650001601974650001901990650001702009650001602026650002002042650003102062650001002093650001702103650002302120650001602143650001402159650002502173650004302198650005202241650002202293650002102315650002002336700001902356700001702375773012802392856008202520852000902602655001202611IND60709022920221121041657.0200902e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070902292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-020-09772-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xunbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7745-686410aGrowth performance and transcriptomic response of Calliptamus abbreviatus Ikonn (Orthoptera: Acrididae) to suitable and unsuitable host plant species  ap. 605-612.  aThe growth of herbivorous insects is influenced by their host plants, which is underpinned by genetic regulations. We studied the growth performance of the grasshopper Calliptamus abbreviatus Ikonn when it fed on a suitable host plant, Artemisia frigida (Asteraceae) and unsuitable host plant, Stipa krylovii (Poaceae) in a two-year feeding trial. Additionally, the underlying transcriptomic response was also measured using RNA-seq. When C. abbreviatus fed on S. krylovii, it had a significantly reduced growth rate and large variation in its gene expression profiles. A total of 106 genes were significantly up-regulated and mainly enriched in stress resistance-related KEGG pathways. Another 161 genes were significantly down-regulated and were mainly associated with development regulation-, cuticle biosynthesis-, and nutrition metabolism-related pathways. A total of 18 candidate genes were verified by RT-qPCR and were consistent with the transcriptomic results. Stress resistance was significantly induced in grasshopper when C. abbreviatus fed on the unsuitable host. However, the capacity for cuticle biosynthesis or nutrition metabolism significantly declined. The negative effects which S. krylovii had on the grasshopper’s growth performance and gene expression indicate that this plant species was a stressor compared to A. frigida. This study enhances the knowledge on the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in plant–herbivore insect co-evolution.  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2019BC030cShandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China 3aArtemisia frigida 3aCalliptamus 3aStipa krylovii 3abiosynthesis 3acoevolution 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrasshoppers 3agrowth performance 3ahost plants 3anutrition 3aphytophagous insects 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3astress tolerance 3atranscriptomics1 aUllah, Hidayat1 aWang, Yueyue0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2020 Oct., v. 14, no. 5 p.605-612dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4130426x1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-020-09772-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245011300158300001400271520164600285592002801931650002201959650001101981650001001992650000902002650003102011650001502042650001202057650001202069650001702081650001302098650001302111650001902124650001602143650001602159650002902175650001802204653002202222653002002244653001902264653002102283700003202304700002502336700002002361773014202381856007602523852000902599655001202608IND60767441020221120094227.0220216e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076744102DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toab2252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhongyi10aReproduction of Black Soldier Fly (Diptera: Stratiomyidae) Under Different Adult Densities and Light Regimes  ap. 37-45.  aThe black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens (L.) (Diptera: Stratiomyidae) has been recognized as a promising insect species for sustainable management of organic waste and by-products. Indoor breeding of BSF with artificial lighting has been proved successful, but efforts are still needed to optimize BSF reproductive output. Increasing adult density seems an option to exploit space, whereas decreasing artificial lighting duration may reduce unnecessary power consumption. This study aimed at investigating the effects of adult density (10, 25, and 50 pairs per 30 × 30 × 30 cm cage; i.e., 370, 926, and 1,852 pairs/m³), light regime (8:16, 12:12, and 16:8 [L:D] h), and their possible interactions, on some BSF life history traits relevant to reproduction. The results show that the overall BSF reproductive output increased with increasing adult density but was not affected by light regimes per se. With the highest BSF adult density tested, an average of more than 20,000 neonate larvae were produced from a cage within 10 d. At this density, increasing photoperiod increased neonate production, but also decreased the number of neonates per watt used for artificial illumination. The temporal oviposition patterns, mean individual female reproductive output, mating success, egg hatching rate, and insect survival rate were not affected by adult density or light regime as simple effects. However, the interaction between adult density and light regime was significant for the first oviposition peak, mean individual female reproductive output, and insect survival rate. The possible mechanisms behind our results are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3aadults 3acages 3aeggs 3aenergy use and consumption 3aentomology 3afemales 3ainsects 3alife history 3alighting 3aneonates 3aorganic wastes 3aoviposition 3aphotoperiod 3areproductive performance 3asurvival rate 0aegg hatching rate 0aindoor breeding 0amating success 0aoviposition rate1 aNajar-Rodriguez, Adriana J.1 aMorel, Patrick C.

In the Mid-Atlantic region, it is a significant, direct pest in tree fruit orchards, many of which are bordered by woodlots containing a variety of its deciduous tree and shrub hosts. During the growing season, H. halys moves from woodland habitats into crops, but seasonal changes in its relative abundance between these adjacent habitats have not been examined. Using linear transects of six pheromone-baited pyramid traps that extended from 100 m into the interior of woodlots to 100 m into the interior of adjacent commercial apple orchards in Virginia, spatiotemporal changes in H. halys captures were measured during three growing seasons. Captures of H. halys adults and nymphs were recorded weekly from May through October, and annual data were separated into early, mid, and late-season captures. Only adults were captured during the early season, and there was no indication of a spatial trend in captures across traps in the transects among years. Beginning in mid-season and becoming increasingly apparent by late season, captures of H. halys adults and nymphs tended to become most frequent in traps at the woods and orchard edges and at 50 m into the orchard interior. These findings conform with and expand upon previous research documenting an edge effect for H. halys relative abundance and can inform and support the optimization of perimeter-based management strategies for H. halys in Mid-Atlantic apple orchards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalyomorpha halys 3aapples 3aedge effects 3aentomology 3aorchards 3apheromone traps 3ashrubs 3atrees 3awoodlands 3aMid-Atlantic region 3aVirginia 0abrown marmorated stink bug 0amonitoring 0aapple 0aforest 0aspatiotemporal1 aNixon, Laura J.1 aLeskey, Tracy C.1 aBergh, J.

Tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius) is a great source of resistance against A. obtectus to improve dry bean production. We developed two F₂ populations of Phaseolus spp. by crossing bean genotypes resistant to A. obtectus × susceptible, to (1) search for metabolites related to bean weevil resistance using an untargeted metabolomics approach and (2) understand the genetics of resistance to A. obtectus attack using the number of adults emerged from seeds as resistance criteria. The segregation of the number of adults emerged from seeds showed that the genetics of resistance (0 emerged adults = resistant, 1 or more emerged adults = susceptible) was controlled by a single dominant gene in two (resistant × susceptible) F₂ populations. From nine metabolites detected, pipecolic acid concentration was significantly higher in the testa of resistant individuals than in the testa of susceptible individuals. From a breeding point of view, (P. Saltillo × T. amarillo) F₂ is of special interest because it is derived from a cultivated tepary × cultivated common bean cross and showed 3:1 resistant vs susceptible segregation. Therefore, this F₂ is a suitable base material for breeding programmes to obtain new bean lines with good agronomic performance, seed quality and resistance to insect attack. Pipecolic acid plays a role in resistance against A. obtectus.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2015-67313-C2-1-RcPlan Estatal de Ciencia y Tecnología de España  aAGL2016-77628-RcPlan Estatal de Ciencia y Tecnología de España  aAGL2015-67313-C2-1-RcEuropean Regional Development Fund  aAGL2016-77628-RcEuropean Regional Development Fund 3aAcanthoscelides obtectus 3aPhaseolus acutifolius var. acutifolius 3aadults 3aagronomic traits 3abreeding programs 3acrop production 3acrossing 3adominant genes 3adry beans 3agenotype 3ainsect resistance 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3apipecolic acid 3aseed quality 3astorage pests 3atesta1 aTortosa, María1 aVelasco, Pablo1 aFuente, María de la,1 aOrdás, Bernardo1 aMalvar, Rosa Ana0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2020 Oct., v. 14, no. 5 p.641-651dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4130426x1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-020-09776-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245011400207300001600321520124900337592002801586653002501614653001301639653001501652653003901667653001101706653003501717700001401752700001701766700002001783700001401803700001701817700001801834700001801852700001601870700004001886700001801926700002201944700002301966700001901989773008802008856008102096852000902177655001202186IND60568183820221119111117.0170710e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056818382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pvr.2017.04.0052doi7 aPMC58831882pmcid7 a287204502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChernesky, Max10aDetection of cervical precancerous lesions with Aptima HPV assays using SurePath preservative fluid specimens  ap. 155-159.  aSurePath specimens from women referred to colposcopy were treated with Aptima Transfer Solution (ATS) before testing in Aptima HPV (AHPV) and Aptima HPV 16, 18/45 (AHPV-GT) assays. Untreated SurePath specimens were tested with the cobas HPV test. PreservCyt specimens were assessed for cytology and tested with AHPV. High-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions served as the reference standard. Excellent agreement (95.5%; k=0.91) was observed for ATS-treated SurePath specimens between Tigris and Panther systems and between the PreservCyt and ATS-treated SurePath specimens (91.1%, k=0.81) with the AHPV assay on Tigris. Agreement between the AHPV and cobas assays with SurePath specimens was substantial (89.9%, k=0.80). AHPV sensitivity for CIN2+(n=147) was 91.2% for SurePath and PreservCyt. Cobas HPV sensitivity was 93.9% for SurePath specimens. AHPV testing of SurePath specimens was more specific (59.4%) than cobas (54.7%) (p<0.001). Detection and genotyping showed similar absolute and relative risks. ATS-treated SurePath specimens tested with AHPV and AHPV-GT assays showed similar performance with greater specificity than cobas HPV on SurePath specimens. Similar overall results were seen using a CIN3 disease endpoint.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHuman papillomavirus 0aSurePath 0aPreservCyt 0aCervical intraepithelial neoplasia 0aCIN2+, 0aAptima transfer solution (ATS)1 aJang, Dan1 aEscott, Nick1 aGilchrist, Jodi1 aLi, Jenny1 aElit, Laurie1 aLytwyn, Alice1 aSmieja, Marek1 aRatnam, Sam1 aArias B., Manuelq(Arias Bazantes),1 aGetman, Damon1 aWeinbaum, Barbara1 aKirkconnell, Brett1 aDockter, Janel0 tPapillomavirus Research.g2017 June, v. 3 p.155-159dElsevier B.V.x2405-85217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pvr.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014400163300001600307520114000323592002801463650002701491650001701518650002101535650002301556650001501579650002101594650001001615650002301625650002601648650001201674650001101686650002001697650002001717650000901737650001001746650002201756653001501778653001201793653001601805653002201821700001401843700001801857700001701875700001601892700001601908700001801924700001801942700001501960700001701975700001601992773010502008856008202113852000902195655001202204IND60526302120221117233153.0190403e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yang10aTransgenic Bt (Cry1Ab/Ac) rice lines with different genetic backgrounds exhibit superior field performance under pesticide-free environment  ap. 117-122.  aTransgenic rice with Cry Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) genes have been developed in the last few decades. The performance of transgenic rice, especially the yield and resistance, must be meticulously evaluated prior to commercial production. In this study, yield and resistance performance of newly bred transgenic Bt (Cry1Ab/Ac) rice lines with different genetic backgrounds were first investigated under pesticide-free field environment. Transgenic Bt (Cry1Ab/Ac) rice lines showed high insect resistances and superior agronomic traits, resulting in obvious yield advantages ranging from 9.1% to 38.0% over their respective non-Bt control lines. Bt protein content (BTC) was similar among the Bt (Cry1Ab/Ac) rice lines in different years, while it was much higher in leaves than in stems of the Bt (Cry1Ab/Ac) rice lines. Different genetic backgrounds of Bt (Cry1Ab/Ac) rice lines affected the yield advantage but had no influence on the resistance and BTC. The results suggested that Bt (Cry1Ab/Ac) rice lines have gained obvious yield advantages and high resistances regardless of genetic background under pesticide-free environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aOryza sativa 3aagronomic traits 3abacterial proteins 3acrop yield 3acrystal proteins 3agenes 3agenetic background 3ainsecticidal proteins 3ainsects 3aleaves 3apest resistance 3aprotein content 3arice 3astems 3atransgenic plants 0aBt protein 0aBt rice 0aGrain yield 0aInsect resistance1 aLing, Lin1 aZhang, Lingli1 aWang, Kangxu1 aCai, Mingli1 aMing, Zhan,1 aLi, Chengfang1 aWang, Jinping1 aChen, Xuan1 aLin, Yongjun1 aCao, Cougui0 tField crops research.g2016 July, v. 193 p.117-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011300172300001600285520135400301536012601655592002801781650003201809650001801841650002201859650001401881650001601895650001501911650001001926650001901936650001201955653001201967653002201979653002702001653002002028700001902048700002202067700001802089700001802107700002002125700002002145700001702165773011602182856008602298852000902384655001202393IND60786063220221119013626.0220802e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078606322DNAL7 a10.1080/10495398.2020.18131512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomar, Neelam R.10aIsolation and propagation of classical swine fever virus in porcine Wharton’s Jelly mesenchymal stem cells  ap. 629-637.  aClassical Swine Fever (CSF) is an extremely infectious and deadly disease of pigs and wild boars caused by the CSF virus (CSFV) which is a member of the Pestivirus genus and the family Flaviviridae. This study was designed to detect the permissibility and replication of CSFV in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) monolayer derived from Porcine Wharton’s jelly. Porcine Wharton’s jelly MSCs (pWJ-MSCs) were ex vivo expanded and propagated for more than 81 generations and third passage pWJ-MSCs were characterized as per standard criteria i.e., growth characteristics, trilineage differentiation potential and molecular characterization for pluripotency and stem cell surface markers. Porcine WJ tissue samples found negative for CSFV by RT-PCR test were processed further for the isolation of pWJ-MSCs and CSFV was propagated over the characterized pWJ-MSCs monolayer. No cytopathic effect was observed, which was consistent with non-cytopathic nature of CSFV. The replication of CSFV in pWJ-MSCs was affirmed by RT-PCR and demonstration of viral antigen in the cytoplasm of virus infected cells by immuno-staining technique. In total, three different CSFV isolates were propagated in pWJ-MSCs. Primary pWJ-MSCs permitted CSFV replication to good titer. To the best of our information, this is the first ever report of isolation of CSFV in pWJ-MSCs.  aThe authors are grateful to the Director, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar for providing the funding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3abiotechnology 3acytopathogenicity 3acytoplasm 3ahog cholera 3astem cells 3aswine 3aviral antigens 3aviruses 0aPorcine 0aWharton’s Jelly 0amesenchymal stem cells 0avirus isolation1 aBhat, Irfan A.1 aBharti, Mukesh K.1 aJohn, Jeny K.1 aSharma, Veena1 aChandra, Vikash1 aSharma, G.

Dominance of swells and wind seas on monthly and seasonal basis has been estimated, and the analysis shows that swells dominate Goa coastal region not only during southwest monsoon (93%), but also during the post-monsoon (67%) season. Wind seas are dominant during the pre-monsoon season (51%). The mean wave periods (Tₘ) during southwest monsoon are generally above 5s, whereas Tₘ is below 5s during other seasons. Co-existence of multiple peaks (from NW and NE) was observed in the locally generated part of the wave spectrum, especially during the post-monsoon season. NCEP reanalysis winds have been used to analyse active fetch available in the Indian Ocean, from where the predominant swells propagate to the west coast of India. A numerical model was set up to simulate waves in the Indian Ocean using flexible mesh bathymetry. The correlation coefficients between measured and modelled significant wave heights and mean wave periods are 0.96 and 0.85, respectively. Numerical simulations reproduced the swell characteristics in the Indian Ocean, and from the model results potential swell generation areas are identified. The characteristics of swells associated with tropical storms that prevail off Goa during 1996 have also been analysed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acorrelation 3amathematical models 3amonsoon season 3aspectral analysis 3astorms 3awind 3aIndia 3aIndian Ocean1 aRashmi, R.1 aVethamony, P.1 aMenon, H.B.0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 31, no. 16 p.1701-1712dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2011.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010500169300001600274520203600290592002802326650002002354650001502374650001202389650002202401650001302423650001602436650001202452650001402464650002102478650001702499650001602516653004202532653001902574653001502593653001402608653001902622653001802641700002402659700001802683773010502701856008202806852000902888655001202897IND60526302220221117233111.0190403e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOngom, Patrick O.10aSelection for drought tolerance in sorghum using desiccants to simulate post-anthesis drought stress  ap. 312-321.  aLate-season drought is a major limiting factor worldwide for rainfed sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] production. Field screening of genotypes against post-anthesis drought is challenging as the stress is unpredictable and, when it happens, is often confounded with stalk diseases and lodging. In this study, we report on the results of tests on the use of desiccants in simulating post-anthesis drought effects in sorghum as aid in selection for late-season drought tolerance. First, we tested the efficacies of three desiccants KI, NaClO3 and KClO3. Each desiccant was applied at three concentrations: 0.4% w/v, 0.6% w/v and 1% w/v, and on three genotypes P89001, P898012 and TX7078, known for their drought responses. Genotypic grain yield (GY) and seed weight (SWT) differed significantly under each of these desiccants. Genotype P898012, tolerant to post-anthesis drought, had the highest GY and SWT, while TX7078 and P89001, known for their post-anthesis drought susceptibility, had the lowest values following treatment with desiccants. The desiccants had significantly different effects, with NaClO3 inducing the most severe effect on GY and SWT while KI had the least effect. Observed genotypic differences were greater at 0.4% w/v for NaClO3 and KClO3, while KI had greater marked effect both at 0.6% w/v and 1% w/v. In the second experiment, we assessed the sensitivity of 18 diverse sorghum genotypes to KI (0.6% w/v). All genotypes tolerant to late-season drought had lower grain yield reduction (GYR), seed weight reduction (SWR) and stress susceptibility index (SSI), but a higher stress tolerance index (STI) than the susceptible genotypes. Remobilized total nonstructural carbohydrate was associated positively with STI’s but negatively with SSI’s. Results from this study suggested that desiccants simulated the effect of post-season drought stress, and that this technique could be used in assisting sorghum breeders to rapidly screen for post-anthesis drought tolerance under drought free environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3adesiccants 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3alodging 3ascreening 3astress tolerance 3awater stress 3aweight loss 0aSorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Eighteen non-lactating pregnant Holstein dairy cows with similar body conditions with 1 to 2 parity were randomly divided into three groups (n = 6), receiving a basal diet with 0 (CON group), 200 (T-200 group), and 300 (T-300 group) g TCHMC per day from 14 to 9 days prepartum. The results demonstrated that TCHMC treatments decreased the days of gestation, calving to first service, and calving to first visible estrus. Compared with CON at specific time points, TCHMC treatments increased the concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol (E₂), whereas progesterone (P₄) and E₂ concentrations decreased. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatine kinase (CK) concentrations were downregulated, whereas that of globulin (GLB) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were upregulated by TCHMC treatments around the time of calving. Compared with CON and T-200 treatments, the T-300 treatment increased the serum concentrations of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration from 7 d prepartum to 21 d postpartum when. In addition, although TCHMC treatment had no effect on average birth weight, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature of calves, the T-300 treatment increased serum albumin (ALB) and IgG concentrations in calves from 3 to 14 days postpartum. The addition of TCHMC used in the present study could serve as a potential effective strategy to improve the health and productive performance of periparturient dairy cows, and the optimal dose should be set at 300 g per day.  aThis work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFD0502005], Hunan Provincial Key R&D Program [2017NK2351], and a double first-class construction project of Hunan Agricultural University [SYL201802017].  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0502005  a2017NK2351  aSYL201802017 3aHolstein 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiotechnology 3abirth weight 3ablood serum 3abody temperature 3acatalase 3acreatine kinase 3adiet 3aestradiol 3aestrus 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheart rate 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aluteinizing hormone 3amalondialdehyde 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3areproductive performance 3arespiratory rate 3aserum albumin 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aTraditional Chinese herbal medicine 0abiochemical parameter 0aantioxidation 0aperiparturient dairy cow1 aCha, Cheng1 aXu, Youtao1 aZhang, Hongliang1 aYang, Zecao1 aLi, Zhicai1 aWang, Shuilian0 tAnimal biotechnology.g2022 Aug. 1, v. 33, no. 4 p.647-656dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl48639x1532-23787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10495398.2020.18198233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013100163300001400294520184500308592002802153650002202181650001002203650002602213650002702239650001502266650001902281650002302300650001102323653002302334653001602357653003002373653003002403653002802433700001602461700001402477773008602491856008402577852000902661655001202670IND60597573320221118124656.0180624e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059757332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2018.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugi, H.10aBasic properties of ATP-induced myosin head movement in hydrated myosin filaments, studied using the gas environmental chamber  ap. 15-25.  aAlthough more than 50 years have passed since the monumental discovery of Huxley and Hanson that muscle contraction results from relative sliding between actin and myosin filaments, coupled with ATP hydrolysis, the mechanism underlying the filament sliding still remains to be a mystery. It is generally believed that the myofilament sliding is caused by cyclic attachment-detachment between myosin heads in myosin filaments and myosin-binding sites in actin filaments. Attempts to prove the myosin head movement using techniques of X-ray diffraction and chemical probes attached to myosin heads have failed to obtain clear results because of the asynchronous nature of myosin head movement. Using the gas environmental chamber (EC) attached to an electron microscope, we succeeded in recording myosin head movement in hydrated myosin filaments, coupled with ATP hydrolysis with the following results: (1)In the absence of actin filaments, myosin heads fluctuate around a definite neutral position, so that their time-averaged position remains unchanged; (2) On ATP application, myosin heads bind with ATP to be in the charged-up state, M-ADP-Pi, and perform a recovery stroke in the direction away from the myosin filament central bare zone and stay in the post-recovery stroke position; (3) In the actin-myosin filament mixture, myosin heads form rigor linkages with actin, and bind with applied ATP to be in the charged-up state, M-ADP-Pi, and perform a power stroke in the direction towards the myosin filament bare zone, while releasing ADP and Pi to stay in the post-power stroke position; (4) In both recovery and power strokes, myosin heads in the non charged-up state return to the neutral position. These results indicate that the charged-up myosin heads decide their direction of movement without being guided by actin filaments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactin 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ahydrolysis 3amicrofilaments 3amuscle contraction 3amyosin 0aMuscle contraction 0aMyosin head 0aAntibodies to myosin head 0aGas environmental chamber 0aWater vapor environment1 aAkimoto, T.1 aChaen, S.0 tMicron.g2018 Sept., v. 112 p.15-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2018.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007600166300001800242520099400260592002801254650002001282650001101302650001101313650002901324650001201353650001501365650001401380650003701394650001101431651001801442700001901460700001601479700001701495700002101512700001401533700001601547700001901563773010301582856008101685990002301766852000901789655001201798IND60096197620221120114828.0141104e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009619762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2011.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartolomé, L.14aThe use of limpets as monitor of PAHs pollution in the Cantabrian coast  ap. 1818-1826.  aThe concentrations of 24 parental and methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels in common limpet (Patella vulgata) were measured in 15 coastal localities of the southern Bay of Biscay and 2 sites per locality for 2 years (spring and autumn of 2004 and 2005, respectively). Although the average concentrations shown a wide variability among the sites and the season, several sites showed a remarkable high concentration (PAHₜₒₜ>900ngg⁻¹ d.w.) or medium (300–800ngg⁻¹ d.w) levels, but in most of the cases the initial high concentrations decreased sharply from one campaign to the following. Moreover, based on ratios of individual isomers concentration, petrogenic and pyrolitic sources were distinguished suggesting more than one source. Finally, based on the results of this work and comparing with previously reported data, it can concluded that limpets can be used as sentinel organisms in coastal environmental monitoring, even when oil spills are involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPatella vulgata 3aautumn 3acoasts 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aisomers 3aoil spills 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aspring 3aBay of Biscay1 aBustamante, M.1 aNavarro, P.1 aTajadura, J.1 aGorostiaga, J.M.1 aDíez, I.1 aZuloaga, O.1 aEtxebarria, N.0 tContinental shelf research.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 31, no. 17 p.1818-1826dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle05234naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100002500185245012500210300001300335506002800348506003600376506007600412506003100488520262900519592002803148596006203176596005803238596006303296596007003359596006403429506003703493650001903530650000903549650001603558650001503574650001203589650001603601650001203617650001203629650002403641650001803665650002203683650002003705650001603725650002503741650001203766651002103778651001803799653002603817653001403843653001803857653002003875653002403895700002103919700002403940700002103964700002103985700001604006700002404022700002604046700002604072700002304098700002004121700001504141700002404156700002004180700002304200773010204223856008204325903002404407852000904431655001204440IND60526302620221207120646.0190403e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052630262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.04.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2016.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorell, Francisco J.10aCan crop simulation models be used to predict local to regional maize yields and total production in the U.S. Corn Belt?  ap. 1-12.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aCrop simulation models are used at the field scale to estimate crop yield potential, optimize current management, and benchmark input-use efficiency. At issue is the ability of crop models to predict local and regional actual yield and total production without need of site-year specific calibration of internal parameters associated with fundamental physiological processes. In this study, a well-validated maize simulation model was used to estimate yield potential for 45 locations across the U.S. Corn Belt, including both irrigated and rainfed environments, during four years (2011–2014) that encompassed diverse weather conditions. Simulations were based on measured weather data, dominant soil properties, and key management practices at each location (including sowing date, hybrid maturity, and plant density). The same set of internal model parameters were used across all site-years. Simulated yields were upscaled from locations to larger spatial domains (county, agricultural district, state, and region), following a bottom-up approach based on a climate zone scheme and distribution of maize harvested area. Simulated yields were compared against actual yields reported at each spatial level, both in absolute terms as well as deviations from long-term averages. Similar comparisons were performed for total maize production, estimated as the product of simulated yields and official statistics on maize harvested area in each year. At county-level, the relationship between simulated and actual yield was better described by a curvilinear model, with decreasing agreement at higher yields (>12Mgha−1). Comparison of actual and simulated yield anomalies, as estimated from the yearly yield deviations from the long-term actual and simulated average yield, indicated a linear relationship at county-level. In both cases (absolute yields and yield anomalies comparisons), the agreement increased with increasing spatial aggregation (from county to region). An approach based on long-term actual and simulated yields and year-specific simulated yield allowed estimation of actual yield with a high degree of accuracy at county level (RMSE≤18%), even in years with highly favorable weather or severe drought. Estimates of total production, which are of greatest interest to buyers and sellers in the market, were also in close agreement with actual production (RMSE≤22%). The approach proposed here to estimate yield and production can complement other approaches that rely on surveys, field crop cuttings, and empirical statistical methods and serve as basis for in-season yield and production forecasts.  aPublisher supplied data  cIowa State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009227  cPurdue Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006377  cRisk Management Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009176  cSouth Dakota State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008213  cUniversity of Minnesotadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000072490 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimatic zones 3acorn 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3adrought 3afield crops 3ahybrids 3amarkets 3ameteorological data 3aplant density 3asimulation models 3asoil properties 3asowing date 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 3aCorn Belt region 3aUnited States 0aCrop simulation model 0aUpscaling 0aYield anomaly 0aYield potential 0aRegional production1 aYang, Haishun S.1 aCassman, Kenneth G.1 aWart, Justin Van1 aElmore, Roger W.1 aLicht, Mark1 aCoulter, Jeffrey A.1 aCiampitti, Ignacio A.1 aPittelkow, Cameron M.1 aBrouder, Sylvie M.1 aThomison, Peter1 aLauer, Joe1 aGraham, Christopher1 aMassey, Raymond1 aGrassini, Patricio0 tField crops research.g2016 June, v. 192 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245007700210300002000287506007600307520091000383592002801293506003701321650002201358650001101380650001501391650001901406700002001425700002201445700002301467700001901490773017601509856008301685852000901768655001201777IND4481177420221207103906.0120502e20111220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448117742DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11151241082doi7 aPMC32511502pmcid7 a221437622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStranges, P.

Methods for designing high-affinity interactions that adopt a predetermined binding mode have proved elusive, suggesting the need for new strategies that simplify the design process. A solvent-exposed backbone on a Î²-strand is thought of as "sticky" and Î²-strand pairing stabilizes many naturally occurring protein complexes. Here, we computationally redesign a monomeric protein to form a symmetric homodimer by pairing exposed Î²-strands to form an intermolecular Î²-sheet. A crystal structure of the designed complex closely matches the computational model (rmsdÂ =Â 1.0Â Ã). This work demonstrates that Î²-strand pairing can be used to computationally design new interactions with high accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrystal structure 3amodels 3aphysiology 3aprocess design1 aMachius, Mischa1 aMiley, Michael J.1 aTripathy, Ashutosh1 aKuhlman, Brian0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Dec. 20, v. 108, no. 51 p.20562-20567dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11151241083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245009300179300001600272500001900288520118500307592002801492596010701520596012201627596013101749650001501880650002501895650001801920650001501938650001201953650001201965650002001977651001101997651001902008651001802027651002902045651001802074651002002092653001602112653001702128653002002145700002002165700001902185773010302204856008502307852000902392655001202401IND60695660020221120103612.0200518e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069566002DNAL7 a10.1080/00318884.2019.16409962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlemañ, Alejandro Espi10aDevelopment of seaweed cultivation in Latin America: current trends and future prospects  ap. 462-471.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeaweed farming has now expanded across several continents from South East Asia to South America, Northern Europe, Canada and East Africa, contributing to global food security, supporting rural livelihoods, alleviating poverty and improving the health of oceans. Latin America (LA) covers a vast geographical area, which includes four different oceanic domains (Temperate Northern Pacific, Tropical Eastern Pacific, Temperate South America and Tropical Atlantic) and encompasses many types of coastal ecosystems with a wide range of seaweed species. LA has major potential for the development of seaweed farming activities; however, almost all the production is based on the harvesting of natural beds. This review describes the development of and prospects for the aquaculture seaweed industry in LA. The status of the seaweed aquaculture sector for green, brown and red seaweed and the main industry challenges are addressed. Regulation in the primary countries is also discussed.

While soft-bodied preservation in the Fezouata Shale is confined to a few stratigraphic intervals, other fossiliferous intervals contain only shelly fossils in sandstone lenses (SL).Placed in the context of a previously established depositional model, EPF are interpreted as autochthonous assemblages buried by storm deposits, close to storm wave-base. There, the current component of storms is reduced compared to proximal settings and weak oscillation is dominant resulting in the record of oscillation ripples. In contrast, bioclastic accumulations were generated upslope in shallower, more proximal lower shoreface environments. There, the current component of storms was significant, as suggested by the disarticulation of skeletal remains. Bioclastic materials are localized in SL, which are lenses a few tens of centimeters in thickness and a few meters in width and length. These lenses commonly display erosive bases and convex tops, resulting in a lobate or a channel-lobe morphology. A large amount of sediment was thus rapidly deposited, resulting in the rapid burial of allochthonous material across a strongly localized surface of the sea floor.Integrating both sedimentological and paleontological evidence, intervals yielding EPF are considered as Konservat-Lagerstätten (KsL), in contrast with bioclastic accumulations defined as Konzentrat-Lagerstätten (KzL). Thus, KsL assemblages are interpreted to approximate biocenoses, in which organisms experienced rapid burial by distal tempestites, while KzL assemblages more likely correspond to thanatocenoses, locally deposited by storm back-currents. Here, a genetic link between KsL and KzL is suggested within the Fezouata Shale. Both types of Lagerstätten were related to storm activity, but at different depths.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocenosis 3afossils 3amodels 3asandstone 3asediments 3ashale 3astorms 3aMorocco 0aLagerstätte 0aStorm deposits 0aSandstone lenses 0aFezouata Biota 0aLower Ordovician1 aMartin, Emmanuel L.O.1 aHormière, Hélène1 aPittet, Bernard0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 460 p.24-34dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012300163300001600286520178800302592002802090650001302118650001502131650001702146650001302163650001302176650001302189650001602202650001402218650001702232650002502249650001602274650002102290650001102311650004302322650001502365650001502380650001702395650001902412650004102431650001602472651001102488651001302499700001902512700001702531700001802548700002002566773009702586856004802683852000902731655001202740IND4468070620221119174345.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446807062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-011-9217-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChew, Lye Yee10aAnalysis of Phenolic Compounds of Dabai (Canarium odontophyllum Miq.) Fruits by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography  ap. 126-137.  aDabai (Canarium odontophyllum Miq.) fruit is a popular seasonal indigenous fruit of Sarawak, Malaysia that is always appreciated as an exotic fruit by the local community. The present study was designed to identify and quantify the phenolic compounds of dabai fruits from different divisions of Sarawak. Difference between the purple and red varieties of the fruits was also investigated. Analysis of phenolic compounds was performed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector. Three detection wavelengths (280, 254 and 329 nm) were used to monitor all phenolic compounds (except for anthocyanidins) since they display absorbance maxima at different wavelengths. Characteristic spectra of eluted peaks provide useful information in confirming the identities of peaks. Hydrolysis of phenolic compounds of dabai fruits was insufficient under the milder conditions (30 °C, 2 h) employed thus resulted in unidentified peaks. Two phenolic acids (ellagic and vanillic acids), five flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, apigenin) and ethyl gallate were detected in the fruits. Furthermore, three anthocyanidins (cyanidin, pelargonidin and delphinidin) and four anthocyanins (malvidin-3,5-di-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside and peonidin-3-O-glucoside) were detected. All these phenolic compounds were reported in dabai fruits for the first time. The fruit variety affected the anthocyanidins and anthocyanins profile (p < 0.01) but had little or no effect on the phenolic acids and flavonoids profile of the fruits. Within the same variety, diversity in environmental conditions had an impact on the quantitative differences of phenolic compounds (p < 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanarium 3aabsorbance 3aanthocyanins 3aapigenin 3acatechin 3acyanidin 3adelphinidin 3adetectors 3aellagic acid 3aenvironmental impact 3aepicatechin 3aepigallocatechin 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3amonitoring 3apelargonidin 3aphenolic acids 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3awavelengths 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia1 aKhoo, Hock Eng1 aAmin, Ismail1 aAzrina Azlan,1 aLau, Cheng Yuon0 tFood analytical methods.g2012 Feb., v. 5, no. 1 p.126-137dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-011-9217-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016300163300001800326500001900344520155400363592002801917596009401945596014302039596008002182596009602262596007302358650001302431650001302444650001602457650001302473650002102486650001602507650001502523650001302538650001902551650002002570650002502590650001602615700001302631700001702644700001702661700001702678773013002695856008302825852000902908655001202917IND60731838920221123034824.0210415e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073183892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-020-02340-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Yixun10aRising nutrient nitrogen reverses the impact of temperature on photosynthesis and respiration of a macroalga Caulerpa lentillifera (Ulvophyceae, Caulerpaceae)  ap. 1115-1123.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBoth temperature and nutrient nitrogen are rising in worldwide aquatic ecosystems. To explore their interactive impacts on algal physiology, we measured the growth, cell components, photosynthesis, and dark respiration of a farmed green alga, Caulerpa lentillifera, under a matrix of temperatures (low, 22 °C; high, 27 °C) and nitrogen concentrations (low, 47 μmol L⁻¹; medium, 188 μmol L⁻¹; high, 750 μmol L⁻¹). The relative growth rate (RGR) was less than 1.0% day⁻¹ at low temperature, which was ~ eightfold higher at high temperature, with no significant effect of nitrogen. Pigment contents of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and carotenoids (Car) and soluble protein content increased with increasing nitrogen levels. High temperature reduced Chl a content under lower nitrogen and enhanced Car contents under higher nitrogen, but had a limited effect on proteins. Photosynthetic parameters, i.e., light-utilized efficiency (α) and maximum photosynthetic rate (Pₘₐₓ), and dark respiration rate (Rd) increased with increasing nitrogen levels at low temperature. High temperature enhanced the α, Pₘₐₓ, and Rd under low nitrogen, but reduced them under high nitrogen. Moreover, high temperature lowered both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) contents, indicating the beneficial effects on metabolism of C. lentillifera and thus the growth. In addition, our results indicate that the temperature-caused effects on photosynthesis and respiration of C. lentillifera are reversed by increased nitrogen levels.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018B030311029, 2019B121202001cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China  aGML2019ZD0407cKey Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou)  a41890853, 31741018, 31971498, 41676156cNational Natural Science Foundation  a2018FY100104cSpecial Foundation for National Science and Technology Basic Research Program  a201707010226, 201904010287cGuangzhou Science and Technology Project 3aCaulerpa 3aalgology 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3acell respiration 3achlorophyll 3amacroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein content 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature1 aLi, Gang1 aZou, Dinghui1 aHu, Shanshan1 aShi, Xiaohan0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 Apr., v. 33, no. 2 p.1115-1123dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-020-02340-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001500164245016600179300001400345520192500359592002802284650002102312650003102333650001302364650002102377650001002398650001702408650002102425650002202446650001802468650004102486650001202527650002702539650001302566650002102579650004302600650005602643650002702699650004302726650003202769650000902801650002502810650003202835650005702867650003902924653001202963653003102975653001303006653002103019700001803040700001803058773010403076852000903180856008203189655001203271IND9205204220221122044909.0181009e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920520422DNAL7 a15578652pmid7 a10.1177/0300985892029001092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeRosa, M.10aAcute Airsacculitis in Untreated and Cyclophosphamide-pretreated Broiler Chickens Inoculated with Escherichia coli or Escherichia coli Cell-free Culture Filtrate  ap. 68-78.  aNinety commercial broiler chickens were divided into three equal groups; 30 were injected with brain-heart-infusion broth into the cranial thoracic air sacs (controls), 30 were similarly inoculated with a culture of Escherichia coli, and 30 were similarly inoculated with E. coli cell-free culture filtrate. Birds were examined from 0 to 6 hours post-inoculation. E. coli-inoculated and cell-free culture filtrate-inoculated chickens reacted similarly, with exudation of heterophils into the air sac. Microscopically, heterophils were present in low numbers perivascularly 0.5 hour after inoculation and became more numerous by 3 hours post-inoculation. By 6 hours post-inoculation, there was severe swelling of air sac epithelial cells and thickening of the air sac by proteinaceous fluid and heterophils. Ultrastructurally, air sac epithelial cells were swollen and vacuolated, and interdigitating processes were separated. Histologically and ultrastructurally, all features in control chickens were normal, with only rare heterophils in the air sac interstitium. In E. coli-inoculated and cell-free culture filtrate-inoculated chickens, cell counts (predominantly heterophils) in air sac lavage fluids increased markedly at 3 and 6 hours, with only slight increases in counts from lavages of controls. Heteropenia was observed in E. coli-inoculated chickens, whereas heterophilia was observed in cell-free filtrate chickens and controls. Ninety additional chickens were pretreated with cyclophosphamide, subdivided into three equal groups, and inoculated and examined similarly as above. Cyclophosphamide pretreatment reduced inflammatory changes in air sacs, lowered cell numbers in lavage fluids, and abolished hematologic changes; however, it did not prevent epithelial cell changes. These results indicate that cell-free culture filtrate of E. coli induces changes similar to those induced by cultures of E. coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aair sacs 3aEscherichia coli 3ablood 3ainflammation 3acyclophosphamide 3aculture filtrates 2aAcute Disease 2aAir Sacsxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aAnimals 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aChickens 2aCyclophosphamide 2aEpitheliumxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aGranulocytesxcytology 2aImmunosuppression Therapyxveterinary. 2aLeukocyte Countxveterinary 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathology 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aTherapeutic Irrigationxveterinary 0aAir sac 0acell-free culture filtrate 0achickens 0aEscherichia coli1 aFicken, M.

This study was undertaken to investigate the antioxidant and DNA damage inhibition potentials of Sundarban honey. The estimated polyphenol, flavonoid, ascorbic acid, reducing sugar and protein contents in the investigated honey were found to be 593.96 ± 13.71 mg GAEs/kg, 50.00 ± 0.00 mg CEs/kg, 117.04 ± 1.05 mg/kg, 60.58 ± 3.23 g/100 g and 6.43 ± 0.12 mg/g, respectively. Some phenolics including gallic acid, pyrogallol, vanillic acid and trans‐Cinnamic acid, as well as three flavonoids, naringin, rutin and quercetin, were identified and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. Sundarban honey was found to possess protective activity against hydrogen peroxide and UV irradiation‐induced damage to pBR322. The DNA protection activity of honey corresponded to its antioxidant potential and exhibited dose‐dependent effects. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Sundarban honey, a wild multifloral honey produced by Apis dorsata bees is one of the most renowned types of honey from Bangladesh and confers protection against oxidative stress‐induced liver and kidney damage. This honey can a be very good source of natural antioxidant which particularly contains some phenolic compounds including gallic, vanillic and trans‐Cinnamic acids as well as three flavonoids (naringin, rutin and quercetin). Sundarban honey can protect against oxidative DNA damage and consecutive illness.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolyphenols 3aDNA damage 3anaringin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahoney 3adose response 3areducing sugars 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aDNA 3arutin 3apyrogallol 3agallic acid 3aApis dorsata 3akidneys 3aantioxidant activity 3aquercetin 3aascorbic acid 3aliver 3avanillic acid 3aprotein content 3aBangladesh 0aantioxidants1 aTanvir, E.M.1 aPaul, Sudip1 aBhoumik, Nikhil Chandra1 aGan, Siew Hua1 aKhalil, Md.

Herein, we demonstrate that the power outputs of double-chamber air-cathode catalyst free MFCs can be increased by approximately 40% through the cyclical redox of vanadium (between v and iv) in the catholyte. The enhanced performance can be explained by the regenerated vanadium(v) resulting from aeration of residual vanadium(iv) on the cathode surface as well as an accelerated electron transfer rate in the aqueous solution. This study provides a simple and cost-efficient strategy to improve the performance of MFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aaqueous solutions 3abioelectricity 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acost effectiveness 3aelectron transfer 3amicrobial fuel cells 3avanadium1 aZhang, Baogang1 aSong, Qinan1 aBorthwick, Alistair G.

With >1000 microbial species identified to date, the gastro-intestinal microbiota is the most complex of human biotas. It is composed of a majority of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and, although exhibiting great inter-individual variations according to age, geographic origin, disease or antibiotic uptake, it is stable over time. Metagenomic studies have suggested associations between specific gut microbiota compositions and a variety of diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, colon cancer, type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, these data remain method-dependent, as no consensus strategy has been defined to decipher the complexity of the gut microbiota. High-throughput culture-independent techniques have highlighted the limitations of culture by showing the importance of uncultured species, whereas modern culture methods have demonstrated that metagenomics underestimates the microbial diversity by ignoring minor populations. In this review, we highlight the progress and challenges that pave the way to a complete understanding of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and its influence on human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aCrohn disease 3aFirmicutes 3aantibiotics 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agastrointestinal system 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3airritable bowel syndrome 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aprovenance 0aHuman microbiome 0aGut microbiota 0aDiversity 0aCulture 0aMetagenomics1 aLagier, Jean-Christophe1 aPontarotti, Pierre1 aRaoult, Didier1 aFournier, Pierre-Edouard0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2015 June, v. 38, no. 4 p.276-286dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2015.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04070naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016500168300001600333500001900349520128700368536039401655592002802049596011302077596009802190596009802288596009802386596006602484596007102550596005002621650001502671650001802686650001202704650002802716650002602744650001502770650002002785650001602805650001802821650001302839650002002852650001102872650001902883650001402902650001302916650001602929651001002945651001502955653001402970653002302984653002003007653001803027653001903045653001203064700002003076700001303096700002803109700002003137700001503157700001603172773010203188856008503290852000903375655001203384IND60695660320221120103529.0200518e20191102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069566032DNAL7 a10.1080/00318884.2019.16444772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haijiao10aMorphology, phylogenetic position, and ecophysiological features of the coccolithophore Chrysotila dentata (Prymnesiophyceae) isolated from the Bohai Sea, China  ap. 628-639.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCoccolithophores are cosmopolitan, major calcifying protists that have significant roles in marine carbon cycling. Although the influence of temperature and irradiance fluctuation on coccolithophore physiology have been extensively studied, little is known about these effects on coastal coccolithophore species, including their cell morphology, coccolith formation, life cycle, and photoacclimation. We carried out indoor experiments to investigate the photo-physiological response of Chrysotila dentata at two temperatures (13 °C and 25 °C) and varied light irradiance. Using a geometric model, coccolith volume and mass of C. dentata were estimated. At low temperature (13 °C) and low irradiance (100 μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹) cell size and coccolith calcite mass increased, which was further verified using a geometric model. The ratio of calcification to total carbon fixation rate and certain pigments (chlorophyll a, fucoxanthin and β-carotene concentrations) increased at high temperature (25 °C). Cells had variable C and N quotas (apparent diel cycling of C:N ratio) when cells were forming new coccoliths. Our findings help to better understand environmental controls on coccolith carbonate production and interaction with organic carbon production in C. dentata.  aThis research was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China grants (41876134, 41676112 and 41276124), the University Innovation Team Training Program for Tianjin (TD12-5003), the Tianjin 131 Innovation Team Program (20180314), National Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin (17JCZDJC40000); and the Changjiang Scholar Program of Chinese Ministry of Education to Jun Sun.  aPublisher supplied data  aT2014253cChangjiang Scholar Program of Chinese Ministry of Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005240  a41276124cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a41676112cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a41876134cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a17JCZDJC40000cNational Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin  aTD12-5003cUniversity Innovation Team Training Program for Tianjin  a20180314cTianjin 131 Innovation Team Program 3aChrysotila 3acalcification 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acarbonates 3acell structures 3achlorophyll 3aecophysiology 3ageometry 3alight intensity 3amodels 3aorganic carbon 3aphylogeny 3aprotists 3atemperature 3aChina 3aYellow Sea 0aC:N ratio 0aChrysotila dentata 0aGeometric model 0aHolococcolith 0aPhotosynthesis 0aPigment1 aZhang, Xiaodong1 aSun, Jun1 aSatheeswaran, Thangaraj1 aZhang, Guicheng1 aLi, Hongbo1 aAn, Xinlong0 tPhycologia.g2019 Nov. 2, v. 58, no. 6 p.628-639dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00318884.2019.16444773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245006600174300001600240500001900256520177200275592002802047650002602075650002802101650001402129650001302143650002002156650001502176650002702191650002302218650001902241650002102260650001502281650001402296650001802310650001502328650002402343650001102367650002002378650001702398650001202415700006802427700005802495700007202553773012802625856008302753852000902836655001202845IND60731839220221117161116.0210415e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073183922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-020-02337-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Samskrathi A.10aBromelain enhances digestibility of Spirulina-based fish feed  ap. 967-977.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroalgae like Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) are protein rich and can be alternative protein sources to fishmeal and soybean meal in fish feed formulation. The present study aims to improve the protein bioavailability of Spirulina by cost-effective protein extraction followed by protease supplementation in fish feed, using in vitro studies. Different extraction procedures such as microwave-assisted, high pressure, and temperature-mediated extraction, boiling and an isoelectric precipitation were employed to study the protein yield from Spirulina powder, and this was compared with the conventional soybean meal and fishmeal conditioning during feed manufacture. Bromelain is a potent protease that has not been widely used as a feed additive with Spirulina. To study the comparative efficiency of bromelain and other proteases like papain and trypsin on Spirulina and conventional feed substrates, a protease assay was performed at different temperatures and enzyme concentrations. The digestibility of these substrates was also studied in vitro, using gut extracts from the fingerlings of Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). Unlike an in vivo feeding trial, a novel method was used to study the effect of protease supplementation on the inherent digestibility of the gut with an in vitro method. Bromelain showed the highest activity on all the substrates at both the temperatures. Bromelain supplementation improved the in vitro digestibility of the Spirulina that were subjected to protein extraction, more than the un-extracted one. The results of the present in vitro study suggest that Spirulina could serve as an alternative protein source, and bromelain-based supplementation could improve the digestibility of Spirulina-based fish diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3aSpirulina 3aalgology 3abioavailability 3abromelains 3achemical precipitation 3acost effectiveness 3afeed additives 3afeed formulation 3afish feeds 3afish meal 3amanufacturing 3amicroalgae 3amicrowave treatment 3apapain 3aprotein sources 3asoybean meal 3atrypsin1 aSurveswaran, Siddharthan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6824-981X1 aArulraj, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8680-99831 aVelayudhannair, Krishnakumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2183-46320 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 Apr., v. 33, no. 2 p.967-977dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-020-02337-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245015200171300001300323520073400336592002801070650001601098650002101114650001301135650002101148650002101169650001001190650000901200773013701209856007701346852000901423655001201432IND60524083420221120184734.0160701e19901230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052408342DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.1990.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPyszyński, Władysław14aThe relationship between the arrangement of rays in secondary phloem and grain inclination in the wood of Pinus silyestris L. and Picea abies Karst  ap. 9-24.  aThe arrangement of rays in cross sections of secondary phloem and the wood grain on the tangential and radial surfaces of wood columns from Pinus silvestris and Picea abies was studied.

Morphologically similar decimeter- to meter-scale helical concretions occur with spheroidal and macrobotryoidal concretions in the shale of the Ikalukrok unit in the upper part of the Mississippian Kuna Formation that hosts the Red Dog Mine in northwestern Alaska. The mineral assemblages of both the helical and spheroidal concretions at Ikalukrok Creek are identical. The calcite of these concretions consists of cm-scale radiating aggregates of elongate poikilotopic crystals; this texture is megaspherulitic. The calcite has a relatively narrow range of δ¹³CVDPB values between 1.9‰ to 3.0‰ and δ¹⁸OVPDB values from −5.9‰ to −8.0‰. Growth of the concretions is considered to be pre-compaction because there is no evidence of internal layering, or inclusions of the host shale, despite their preservation of numerous microfossils. There is no indication of a causative small-scale burrow or of large-scale burrows. Analogy with laboratory syntheses of biomimetic carbonates suggests that the megaspherulitic texture of the helical and spheroidal concretions probably resulted from crystallization under strong driving forces such as high supersaturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aGastropoda 3aMississippian period 3abiomimetics 3aburrows 3acalcite 3acarbonates 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3amicrofossils 3ashale 3astreams 3atexture 3aAlaska 3aUnited Kingdom 0aDinocochlea ingens 0aHelical concretion 0aIchnofossil 0aPseudofossil 0aMegaspherulitic growth1 aBowerman, Melissa1 aLi, Long1 aKraft, Jamie L.1 aGingras, Murray0 tSedimentary geology.g2020 Apr., v. 399 p.105619-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2020.1056193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014900168300001800317500001900335520158900354592002801943650001301971650000901984650001301993650002102006650002302027650001802050650001202068650001502080650002002095700006702115700002902182700003102211700002002242773013002262856008302392852000902475655001202484IND60731839320221117161146.0210415e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073183932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-020-02344-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatista, Deonir10aEffects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), jasmonic acid (JA), and gibberellic acid (GA3) on the direct regeneration of Gelidium floridanum explants  ap. 1089-1099.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGelidium floridanum is a red seaweed of economic importance as it yields high-quality agar which is extracted exclusively from material harvested from natural beds. Phytoregulators have not been explored in macroalgal culture as a probable alternative for large-scale farming of seaweed. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the direct regeneration of G. floridanum explants using indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), jasmonic acid (JA), and gibberellic acid (GA). Explants (5 mm) were treated in liquid medium supplemented with IAA (0.57, 5.7, and 57 μM), JA (2, 4, and 8 mM), and GA (29, 43, and 58 mM) for 48 h and then further cultivated for 20 days. To observe the morphology and formation of new axes, micrographs were taken on the 5th day of culture using stereoscopic microscopy, and explants were processed for light and scanning electron microscopy. On the 20th day micrographs were obtained through stereoscopic microscopy for a final count of formed axes. After 5 days the formation of upright axes was greater and with a greater average size in the 2 and 4 mM JA treatments and floridean starch grains accumulated at the base, not being observed in the apical region. After 20 days the formation of new explants was higher in all treatments with IAA. We conclude that the direct regeneration of G. floridanum explants occurs from the medullary cells and starts in the first week of culture. Among the phytoregulators tested, JA contributed to the earlier formation of the upright axes, but after 20 days, IAA proved to be more efficient in the formation and size of these axes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGelidium 3aagar 3aalgology 3agibberellic acid 3aindole acetic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3aliquids 3amacroalgae 3aseaweed culture1 aPereira, Débora Tomazi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2330-88121 aCarvalho, Mariana Fontes1 aOuriques, Luciane Cristina1 aSimioni, Carmen0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 Apr., v. 33, no. 2 p.1089-1099dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-020-02344-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245011800180300001800298520129600316592002801612653002301640653002601663653001401689653001101703653001901714700002301733700002301756773015501779856008101934852000902015655001202024IND60517015220221120110450.0160328e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051701522DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154100001472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso-Fernández, Alexandre10aEmbryonic development and spawning pattern of Trisopterus luscus (Teleostei: Gadidae) under controlled conditions  ap. 1281-1287.  aKnowledge on early ontogeny of Trisopterus luscus is scarce and incomplete. This paper describes the first successful attempt ever at achieving the natural spawning in captivity for this species. The reproductive specimens used for this study were obtained in the Ría de Vigo in September 2008 and subsequently transported to the facilities of the Institute of Marine Research (CSIC). The spawning frequency was variable among females, 1.8–4.6 days, but no size-dependent trend was determined. The average batch size, i.e. the number of eggs released per batch, has proven significantly dependent on female length and weight. In the present study the complete embryonic development in controlled conditions (sand–filtered seawater at ~13°C, with natural photoperiod), from egg to hatched larva, has been described for the first time ever. The development of pouting eggs was divided into six stages, based on the artificially-reared material. Pouting eggs are pelagic with a smooth, clear and spherical chorion, and a homogeneous yolk. The perivitelline space is narrow and oil globules are absent. Live eggs fertilized were 0.95–1.10 mm in diameter. The embryo hatches as a yolk-sac larva with closed mouth and gut. The pouting eggs hatched during the latter half of the fifth day.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTrisopterus luscus 0aembryonic development 0afish eggs 0alarvae 0aGalician shelf1 aVergara, Alba Ruth1 aSaborido-Rey, Fran0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2011 Sept., v. 91, no. 6 p.1281-1287dCambridge University Pressx1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154100001473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012000163300001600283500002000299520147500319592002801794650002201822650002201844650001201866650001801878650002201896650001601918650002201934650000701956650001501963650001801978650002001996650001002016650002302026700002902049700002902078700003102107700003302138700002202171773011002193856007402303852000902377655001202386IND60548343520221118134604.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054834352DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.122292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellicer, José A.10aKinetic Characterization and Thermal Properties of Two Acidic Peroxidases from White Cabbage (Brassica Oleracea L.)  ap. 480-489.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoluble and membrane‐bound peroxidases (POD) were extracted from white cabbage. Optimum activity was obtained at pH 4.0 for both enzymes. The KM and Vₘ values for H₂O₂ were found to be 0.62 mM and 6.5 μM/min, respectively, for soluble POD; and 1.1 mM and 7.75 μM/min, respectively, for membrane‐bound POD. The KM and Vₘ values for ABTS were found to be 0.92 mM and 7.4 μM/min, respectively, for soluble POD; and 0.43 mM and 6.95 μM/min, respectively, for membrane‐bound POD. The effect of several reducing agents was studied. The effect of cyclodextrins was studied and the complexation constant between ABTS and HP‐β‐CDs was calculated (Kc = 303 M⁻¹). A thermal inactivation study showed a first‐order inactivation kinetic for both enzymes and the Arrhenius plot yielded a straight line with a slope equivalent to activation energy of 153.1 kj/mol for membrane‐bound POD and 49.1 kj/mol for soluble POD. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Roots of horseradish serve at present as the major source of commercially available peroxidase. However, this peroxidase has certain problems with regard stability and inactivation under certain conditions, hence the interest in finding novel plant peroxidases with greater stability and similar applicability. White cabbage peroxidase could be highly promising for biotechnological applications, taking into account, its high activity, low cost of the raw material and the easy extraction method described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aactivation energy 3acabbage 3acyclodextrins 3aheat inactivation 3ahorseradish 3ahydrogen peroxide 3apH 3aperoxidase 3araw materials 3areducing agents 3aroots 3athermal properties1 aLucas‐Abellán, Carmen1 aSerrano‐Martínez, Ana1 aLópez‐Miranda, Santiago1 aNúñez‐Delicado, Estrella1 aFortea, María I.0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2016 Aug., v. 40, no. 4 p.480-489dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.122293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245018500157300002000342520076100362592002801123650002601151650001401177650001201191650003601203650002301239650002101262650002501283650001501308650001401323650001401337700001801351700002201369700002701391700001801418773012401436856007401560852000901634655001201643IND60640423020221121005743.0190504e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064042302DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra01861k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagui, Wided10aDirect access to 2-(hetero)arylated pyridines from 6-substituted 2-bromopyridines via phosphine-free palladium-catalyzed C–H bond arylations: the importance of the C6 substituent  ap. 17110-17117.  aA phosphine-free palladium catalytic system was found to be very active to promote C–H bond activation/arylation of 5-membered ring heterocycles or electron-deficient arenes with 6-substituted 2-bromopyridines, providing a general, straightforward and environmentally benign synthetic approach to a broad variety of 2-(hetero)arylpyridines. The reactivity of 2-bromopyridines is strongly dependent on the substituent at the C6 position. Several C6 substituents such as Br, CF₃, CH₃, CHO, or morpholine have been employed.

It is vital for robots to recognise and localise fruits before the harvesting in natural orchards. However, the workspace of harvesting robots in orchards is complex: many fruits are occluded by branches and leaves. It is important to estimate a proper grasping pose for each fruit before performing the manipulation. In this study, a geometry-aware network, A3N, is proposed to perform end-to-end instance segmentation and grasping estimation using both color and geometry sensory data from a RGB-D camera. Besides, workspace geometry modelling is applied to assist the robotic manipulation. Moreover, we implement a global-to-local scanning strategy, which enables robots to accurately recognise and retrieve fruits in field environments with two consumer-level RGB-D cameras. We also evaluate the accuracy and robustness of proposed network comprehensively in experiments. The experimental results show that A3N achieves 0.873 on instance segmentation accuracy, with an average computation time of 35 ms. The average accuracy of grasping estimation is 0.61 cm and 4.8° in centre and orientation, respectively. Overall, the robotic system that utilizes the global-to-local scanning and A3N, achieves success rate of harvesting ranging from 70% to 85% in field harvesting experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aagriculture 3aapples 3acameras 3acolor 3aelectronics 3afruits 3ageometry 3arobots 0aDeep learning 0aInstance segmentation 0aGrasping estimation 0aHarvesting robot1 aKang, Hanwen1 aZhou, Hongyu1 aAu, Wesley1 aChen, Chao0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Feb., v. 193 p.106716-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.1067163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245013000210300001200340520203400352592002802386596003902414596004202453650001302495650001102508650002402519650001502543650002802558650000902586650002602595650001802621650000702639650001402646650001302660650001402673650001102687650001602698700001602714700002102730773015102751856008202902852000902984655001202993IND60685837720221119143417.0200423e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068583772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-8169-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarikari-Yeboah, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2003-581210aMicrobial diversity and functional response to the redox dynamics of pyrite-rich sediment and the impact of preload surcharge  ap. 226.  aMicrobial diversity and activities play pivotal biogeochemical roles in a redox-sensitive, pyrite-rich sediment’s ecosystem. However, very little is known about the microbial community composition and distribution among the redox zones of pyrite-rich sediment and their response to changes caused by the burial of the sediment beneath compacted fill. In the present work, culture-independent, molecular phylogenetic investigations of the prokaryotic population and its diversity in a naturally occurring pyrite-rich sediment were undertaken to determine the microbial community composition, richness, diversity and distributions among the varying redox zones and their functional response to the imposition of surface surcharge, in the form of compacted fill. It was established that the pyrite-rich sediment is a redox-sensitive environment consisting of microhabitats with distinct and discontinuous physico-chemical characteristics, including DO, pH, Eh, temperature, electrical conductivity and salinity. It is a favourable environment for cyclic transformation of inorganic sulphur compounds and a unique environment for the habitation and growth of various microorganisms. Microbes adapted to the microhabitat and lived together in consortia, in response to their physiological and functional requirements. Microbes involved in the sulphur cycle had their populations concentrated in the oxic zone, while those involved in iron and carbon cycles were prevalent in the anoxic zones. As a result, highly diverse microbial populations occurred in isolated peaks within the sediment. The physico-chemical differences within the sediment changed in response to changes in the sediment redox dynamics. Imposition of the surcharge resulted in significant changes in the pH, temperature, Eh, DO, EC and salinity, reflecting marked re-distribution of the microbial population within the ecosystem. The cable bacteria phenomenon was evident in the sediment studied; however, there were doubt regarding their filamentous occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data  aNot ApplicablecMaiden Geotechnics  aNot ApplicablecAustralian Government 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aelectrical conductivity 3airon 3amicrobial communities 3amicrohabitats 3apH 3aphylogeny 3asalinity 3asediments 3asulfur 3atemperature1 aSkinner, W.1 aAddai-Mensah, J.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Apr., v. 192, no. 4 p.226-226dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-8169-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01724naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003000143245013200173300001400305520066600319592002800985650001901013650002201032650002601054650003001080650003301110650001801143650001401161650001101175773013801186856007701324852000901401655001201410IND60524083620221120184818.0160701e19901230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052408362DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.1990.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudzińska-Langwald, Anna10aCytological changes in phloem parenchyma cells of Solanum rostratum (Dunal.) related to the replication of potato virus M (PVM)  ap. 45-53.  aThe first cytological symptom of infection of phloem parenchyma cells by potato virus M is the formation of clusters of endoplasmic reticulum cisterns in a cytoplasm containing numerous ribosomes.

There are two types of deposits in the inclusions containing PVM virus particles - additionally coated particles and tubules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotato virus M 3aSolanum rostratum 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3aribosomes 3avirion0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g1990 Dec. 30, v. 59, no. 1-4 p.45-53dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.1990.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245011700158300001800275500000900293520101400302592002801316650001501344650002301359650002901382650001601411650000701427650001901434650002601453650001201479700001701491700001701508700001501525773014001540856007901680852000901759655001201768IND60668093220221121132843.0191228e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066809322DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2004.15782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOorts, K.12aA New Method for the Simultaneous Measurement of pH-Dependent Cation Exchange Capacity and pH Buffering Capacity  ap. 1578-1585.  aepub  aThe pH dependent cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pH buffering capacity (pH BC) are two crucial properties in soil fertility management of variable charge soils. However, they are rarely measured, since most of the existing methods are cumbersome and time-consuming. We propose a new method, based on the silver-thiourea (AgTU) method, for the simultaneous measurement of pH dependent CEC and the pH BC. In general, this method consists of first increasing the pH of the soil to about pH 7 and then gradually acidifying the soil by titrating with HNO₃, while measuring pH and CEC after each equilibration. This way, both CEC at different pH values and the pH BC are measured on the same sample, without the multiple washing steps needed in other procedures. Various aspects of the proposed method were tested and the results obtained were compared with the ion adsorption method. The modified AgTU method obtains field relevant results and is suitable for the routine analysis of large numbers of samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abuffering capacity 3acation exchange capacity 3anitric acid 3apH 3asoil fertility 3avariable charge soils 3awashing1 aVanlauwe, B.1 aPleysier, J.1 aMerckx, R.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2004 Sept., v. 68, no. 5 p.1578-1585dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.15783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245006400174300001600238520145500254592002801709650002001737650003101757650003101788650001401819650001301833650001801846650001301864653000901877653000901886653001301895653001501908653001401923700002101937773012601958856008402084852000902168655001202177IND60542620420221120112209.0190405e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054262042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2015.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlaeser, Stefanie P.10aMultilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) in prokaryotic taxonomy  ap. 237-245.  aTo obtain a higher resolution of the phylogenetic relationships of species within a genus or genera within a family, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) is currently a widely used method. In MLSA studies, partial sequences of genes coding for proteins with conserved functions (‘housekeeping genes’) are used to generate phylogenetic trees and subsequently deduce phylogenies. However, MLSA is not only suggested as a phylogenetic tool to support and clarify the resolution of bacterial species with a higher resolution, as in 16S rRNA gene-based studies, but has also been discussed as a replacement for DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) in species delineation. Nevertheless, despite the fact that MLSA has become an accepted and widely used method in prokaryotic taxonomy, no common generally accepted recommendations have been devised to date for either the whole area of microbial taxonomy or for taxa-specific applications of individual MLSA schemes. The different ways MLSA is performed can vary greatly for the selection of genes, their number, and the calculation method used when comparing the sequences obtained. Here, we provide an overview of the historical development of MLSA and critically review its current application in prokaryotic taxonomy by highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the method's numerous variations. This provides a perspective for its future use in forthcoming genome-based genotypic taxonomic analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aessential genes 3amultilocus sequence typing 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomy 0aMLSA 0aMLST 0aTaxonomy 0aResolution 0aPhylogeny1 aKämpfer, Peter,0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2015 June, v. 38, no. 4 p.237-245dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2015.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014800171300001600319520120200335592002801537650004201565650002501607650001801632650001701650650002201667650001301689650002401702650001401726650000701740650001601747650002101763650001001784650002001794650002101814653001801835653001301853653002301866653001601889653002101905653000801926653000801934653000801942653000801950653000801958700002501966700002401991700002102015700002402036700002302060700002202083773012502105856008502230852000902315655001202324IND60611769320221121035956.0201125e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061176932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Nilo C.Q.10aSalt stress inhibits germination of Stylosanthes humilis seeds through abscisic acid accumulation and associated changes in ethylene production  ap. 399-407.  aIn Stylosanthes humilis, salt stress tolerance is associated with ethylene production by the seeds, however, how salt stress controls seed germination and ethylene production is poorly understood. Here, we studied the hormonal and metabolic changes triggered by salt stress on germination of S. humilis seeds. Salt stress led to decreased seed germination and ethylene production, concomitantly with higher abscisic acid (ABA) production by seeds. Treatment with NaCl and ABA promoted distinct changes in energy metabolism, allowing seeds to adapt to salt stress conditions. Treatment with the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone or ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) reversed the effects of salt stress on seed germination and ethylene production. Moreover, ethylene concentration was decreased by increasing the pH of the salt solution. High pH, however, did not influence concentration of ABA in seeds under salt stress. We conclude that biosynthesis of ABA and ethylene in response to salt stress constitutes a point of convergence that provides flexibility to regulate energy metabolism and embryo growth potential of S. humilis seeds within a given pH condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aStylosanthes humilis 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aenergy metabolism 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afluridone 3apH 3asalt stress 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asodium chloride 3astress tolerance 0aAbscisic acid 0aEthylene 0aPrimary metabolism 0aSalt stress 0aSeed germination 0aABA 0aACC 0aACO 0aACS 0aTCA1 ade Souza, Genaina A.1 aPimenta, Thaline M.1 aBrito, Fred A.L.1 aPicoli, Edgard A.T.1 aZsögön, Agustín1 aRibeiro, Dimas M.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Sept., v. 130 p.399-407dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011800155520173400273592002802007650002002035650001102055650001602066650003102082700001902113700002102132700001702153700001702170773011902187856007302306852000902379655001202388IND60653502320221120113637.0190714e20190130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065350232DNAL7 a10.3390/w110202372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ming 10aExperimental Investigation on Mean Flow Development of a Three-Dimensional Wall Jet Confined by a Vertical Baffle  aThree-dimensional (3D) confined wall jets have various engineering applications related to efficient energy dissipation. This paper presents experimental measurements of mean flow development for a 3D rectangular wall jet confined by a vertical baffle with a fixed distance (400 mm) from its surface to the nozzle. Experiments were performed at three different Reynolds numbers of 8333, 10,000 and 11,666 based on jet exit velocity and square root of jet exit area (named as B), with water depth of 100 mm. Detailed measurements of current jet were taken using a particle image velocimetry technique. The results indicate that the confined jet seems to behave like an undisturbed jet until 16B downstream. Beyond this position, however, the mean flow development starts to be gradually affected by the baffle confinement. The baffle increases the decay and spreading of the mean flow from 16B to 23B. The decay rate of 1.11 as well as vertical and lateral growth rates of 0.04 and 0.19, respectively, were obtained for the present study, and also fell well within the range of values which correspond to the results in the radial decay region for the unconfined case. In addition, the measurements of the velocity profiles, spreading rates and velocity decay were also found to be independent of Reynolds number. Therefore, the flow field in this region appears to have fully developed at least 4B earlier than the unconfined case. Further downstream (after 23B), the confinement becomes more pronounced. The vertical spreading of current jet shows a distinct increase, while the lateral growth was found to be decreased significantly. It can be also observed that the maximum mean velocity decreases sharply close to the baffle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aparticle image velocimetry1 aHuang, Haijin 1 aZhang, Xingxing 1 aLv, Senpeng 1 aLi, Rengmin 0 tWater.g2019 Jan. 30, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110202373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245009900210300001600309520124400325592002801569596005701597596005701654650001001711650002101721650002001742650002601762650001401788650002401802650002201826650001101848700001901859773011701878856008201995852000902077655001202086IND60685837820221119143126.0200311e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068583782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10669-019-09736-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshioka, Hidekazu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5293-324612aA growth rate control problem of harmful species population and its application to algae bloom  ap. 107-124.  aA mathematical framework for controlling growth rate of harmful species population is established based on the concept of stochastic control. The main problem to be addressed in this paper is to effectively suppress the population growth through manipulating its surrounding environmental conditions. The growth control is achieved through minimization of a performance index that contains the cost of interventions and a metric based on the growth rate. Solving the problem ultimately reduces to finding a solution to the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Its solution behavior is analyzed from a mathematical viewpoint, showing that the optimal control and the optimized growth rate are critically affected by the chosen metrics in the performance index. The present model is then applied to an urgent management problem of the harmful attached algae in a dam downstream river reach, in which the dam discharge is the control variable. The application results clarify environmental dependence of the optimal dam discharge and under what condition it serves as the environmental flow to suppress the algae bloom. Throughout this paper, we demonstrate how mathematical models can be applied to environmental decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data  a17K15345cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a17J09125cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aalgae 3adams (hydrology) 3adecision making 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3amathematical models 3apopulation growth 3arivers1 aYaegashi, Yuta0 tEnvironment systems & decisions.g2020 Mar., v. 40, no. 1 p.107-124dSpringer USwJournal:12167x2194-54037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10669-019-09736-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011000175300001400285520076600299592002801065650001901093650001501112650001701127650001001144650001001154650003301164650001101197650001801208650001001226651001001236653002201246653002101268653002001289653002201309700001701331700002501348700002501373700002501398773009701423856008501520852000901605655001201614IND60557642820221118011438.0190415e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055764282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2016.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudhakara Reddy, M.,10aPestalotiopsis species occur as generalist endophytes in trees of Western Ghats forests of southern India  ap. 70-75.  aOne hundred tree species from 4 different forest types (25 from each forest) of the Western Ghats were studied for the occurrence of Pestalotiopsis as foliar endophytes.

Furthermore, a single tree species harboured more than one species of this endophyte. Considering the leaf as a microhabitat, such a wide ecological amplitude of Pestalotiopsis as a foliar endophyte appears to be the result of accumulation of a suite of traits which are governed by the environment.

In addition, both antipodes of products with equally excellent enantioselevity could be obtained since a pair of enantiomeric catalysts is guaranteed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aenantioselectivity 3alactones1 aWang, Wei1 aWang, Haitao1 aWang, Yuqiang1 aJiang, Xiaojian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1355-36110 tOrganic letters.g2019 Oct. 04, v. 21, no. 20 p.8275-8279dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b030283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015500171300001600326520136800342592002801710650002101738650002101759650001601780650001001796650001701806650002201823650001401845650001201859650002001871650001001891650003301901650002201934650002101956650003201977650001402009650001702023650002502040650001502065650002902080650001702109653002402126653003202150653001202182653002102194653001502215653001902230700002302249700002102272773012502293856008502418852000902503655001202512IND60611769420221121035919.0201125e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061176942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhakdan, Fatemeh10aMolecular cloning, functional characterization and expression of a drought inducible phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene (ObPAL) from Ocimum basilicum L.  ap. 464-472.  aPhenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is a control point for branched phenylpropanoid and terpenoid pathways. It represents the first regulatory step to provide a metabolic flux to produce of the precursors needed for biosynthesizing main volatile phenylpropanoid compounds (methyleugenol and methylchavicol) in basil. It is crucial during the stage of the environmental and development stimulants. To obtain better knowledge of the biosynthesis of these phenylpropene compounds, characterization and cloning of Ocimum basilicum PAL (ObPAL) cDNA and its heterologous expression and enzyme activity were assessed. The almost full-length ObPAL was 2064 bp in size encoding a 687-amino-acid polypeptide with molecular weight of 74.642 kDa and theoretical pI of 8.62. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a significant evolutionary relatedness of ObPAL with the PAL sequence reported in different species of Lamiaceae. To further confirm its function, ObPAL was cloned into pET28a (+) vector and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein exhibited high PAL activity and could catalyze the L-Phe conversion to trans-cinnamic acid. Expression analysis of PAL gene showed that ObPAL manifested various transcription ratios exposed to drought stress. Overall, our results demonstrated the ObPAL regulation gene is possibly a mechanism dependent on cultivar and drought stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aOcimum basilicum 3aamino acids 3abasil 3abiosynthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aheterologous gene expression 3amolecular cloning 3amolecular weight 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aphylogeny 3apolypeptides 3arecombinant proteins 3aterpenoids 3atranscription (genetics) 3awater stress 0aOcimum basilicum L. 0aPhenylalanine ammonia-lyase 0aCloning 0aCharacterization 0aExpression 0aDrought stress1 aAlizadeh, Houshang1 aRanjbar, Mojtaba0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Sept., v. 130 p.464-472dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04173naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012100164520233700285592002802622650003002650650001102680650001302691650002502704650002902729650003502758650001102793650001202804650001202816650002002828650001302848650002102861650001102882650001902893650003102912650001702943650000902960650001402969650001502983650001402998650001403012650003303026650002403059650000903083650001303092650001603105650001103121650001103132650001403143650002003157651001403177700002403191700002103215700002003236700002103256700001803277700002703295773011903322856007303441852000903514655001203523IND60653502420221120113510.0190714e20190130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065350242DNAL7 a10.3390/w110202382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Khatib, Issam  A.10aHealth Risk Associated with Some Trace and Some Heavy Metals Content of Harvested Rainwater in Yatta Area, Palestine  aRainwater is considered a dependable source for domestic purposes within rural areas in Palestine. Harvested rainwater stored in cisterns is used to leverage deficits from municipal water supplies. Harvested rainwater in areas surrounded with industrial and agricultural activities is usually contaminated with heavy and trace metals. To study the effects of human exposure to heavy and trace metals, 74 harvested rainwater samples of rain-fed cisterns were collected from different localities in the Yatta area of Palestine in the months of January and February of 2016. The water samples were analysed for Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, K, Na, Ag, Li, Co, Ba, Bi, Sr, Ga, V, Rb, Mo, Beand Tl elements utilizing ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). The selected trace metals were found within the concentration limits of the acceptable values, in accordance with WHO and Palestinian standards, except for K and Al, which were found above the allowed limits. The potential risks of the selected trace metals on the health of the local residents, as well as the possible sources of such heavy metals, were also studied. The Chronic daily intake (CDI) of each metal and health risk indexes (HRI) were calculated for both adults and children residents. The oral ingestion pathway was studied, including exposure via drinking water. The values for CDI were found in the descending order of: Ca > Mg > Na > K > Sr > Fe > Al > Ba > Li > V > Rb > Ag > Mo > Ga > Co > Bi > TI > Be. The values of HRI were below 1 for most of the selected heavy metals, expect for Li for children, indicating potential health risk. The study also predicted that the local residents have a higher chance of developing cancer in their lifetime, especially children, with respect to the carcinogenic risk (CR<inf>ing</inf>) values for Na, Mg, Al, Ba, K, Ca, Fe and Sr, which were greater than standardized limits (>10&minus;6). The rest of the selected elements were within the acceptable limit in the five different studied locations. Furthermore, univariate, multivariate and statistical analysis depending on one-way ANOVA, inter-metal correlation, cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) results revealed that geogenic and anthropogenic activities were major sources of drinking water contamination by heavy metals in the Yatta area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3aaluminum 3aanalysis of variance 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abarium 3abismuth 3acalcium 3acarcinogenicity 3achildren 3acluster analysis 3acobalt 3adrinking water 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amagnesium 3amolybdenum 3aneoplasms 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3apublic water supply 3arain 3arubidium 3arural areas 3asilver 3asodium 3astrontium 3awater pollution 3aPalestine1 aArafeh, Ghadeer  A.1 aAl-Qutob, Mutaz 1 aJodeh, Shehdeh 1 aHasan, A.

To achieve uniform crushed straw throwing in dense fields of rice stubble, and high-quality straw mulching in dense fields, the conveying device of a no-till planter to perform uniform throwing of crushed straw stubble on fields and determine the device operation mechanism was analyzed. Using kinematics and dynamics analyses of particles of crushed rice straw during lifting and dispersion, a flexible-body model of rod-shaped and agglomerate-shaped crushed straw and a coupling model that included the mechanical structure of the device were developed. By integrating computational fluid dynamics and the discrete element method, the gas–solid coupling theory in numerical simulations and motion analysis of crushed straw particles was used to determine the flow field and motion characteristics under different parameters. The simulation focused on the conveying performance of different pipelines under four scenarios with varying throwing blade speed, conveying volume, pipeline diameter, and initial feeding velocity. The influence of these parameters on both the conveying device performance and their own variation was determined. Actual operations that are then compared with test results to achieve optimal operation were demonstrated. By adopting the Box-Behnken design, the throwing speed of crushed straw was set to the evaluation index a response surface test was performed on the throwing blade speed, conveying volume of crushed straw, and pipeline diameter. The optimization results showed that the predicted optimal parameters were 2300 rpm throwing blade speed, 1.4 kg/s conveying volume, and 220 mm pipeline diameter. The simulated planter achieved an optimized throwing speed of 14.6 m/s. Then, a field test verification was conducted, and the results were averaged. The planter achieved a throwing speed of 14.8 m/s with the same optimal parameters. The straw lifting and throwing device provides high conveying performance and satisfies requirements for real-time operation. This study provides a theoretical basis and supporting data for innovating seeding technologies and optimizing equipment to achieve uniform crushed straw-throwing in dense fields of rice stubble.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aelectronics 3aexperimental design 3afluid mechanics 3akinematics 3ano-tillage 3arice 3arice straw 3asimulation models 3astubble 0aRice straw stubble 0aUniform crushed straw throwing 0aRice straw 0aCoupled CFD-DEM 0aResponse surface analysis1 aYouqun, Zhao1 aFeng, Wu1 aZhichao, Hu1 aLili, Shi0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Feb., v. 193 p.106720-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.1067203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245009300184300001600277500002900293520091200322592002801234650001401262650001101276650001101287650001301298653002601311653002501337653002201362700002601384773010201410856008501512852000901597655001201606IND60695660920221120103525.0200518e20191102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069566092DNAL7 a10.1080/00318884.2019.16634772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbonell-Moore, M.

Here, the morphologies of G. hyalina and G. fragilis were restudied in field samples from different parts of the World Ocean. Results showed that Escalera et al. did not observe G. fragilis, as all strains used in their study belong to one species, G. hyalina. In consequence, it is hereby proposed that the two taxa remain as separate species until further genetic studies are carried out. Additionally, the interpretation of the anterior sulcal plate as unique within gonyaulacoids is considered here inaccurate, as the plate pattern of both species is similar to other species of Gonyaulax, e.g. G. polygramma. We also show that both species may co-occur in the same sample. Their observation of an anterior intercalary plate in cultures of G. hyalina was confirmed in field samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGonyaulax 3afields 3aoceans 3asampling 0aAnterior sulcal plate 0aGonyaulax polygramma 0aMisidentification1 aMertens, Kenneth Neil0 tPhycologia.g2019 Nov. 2, v. 58, no. 6 p.685-689dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00318884.2019.16634773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002400161245005200185300001600237500000900253520107100262592002801333650001101361650001501372650000901387650001501396650001101411650001801422651001101440651001601451700002001467700001801487773014801505856009601653852000901749655001201758IND60668093420221123044951.0191125e195607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066809342DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1956.03615995002000030031x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlson, Charles A.10aPredicting Moisture in the Surface Foot of Soil  ap. 412-415.  aepub  aA method of predicting moisture content in the surface foot of soil has been developed by the U. S. Forest Service in cooperation with the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army. By this method, moisture can be predicted for a given soil from the wettest to the driest condition that naturally occurs. In the development of the method, soil wetting and drying relationships were determined from detailed soil moisture and concurrent weather records. Wetting in the surface foot was found to depend primarily on the amount of rainfall and the amount of space available for storing water. Drying varied with the moisture level of the soil; it followed a characteristic curve for each season. Information needed for prediction—in addition to the wetting and drying relationships—includes the field maximum moisture content, transition dates for the seasonal depletion curves, and the size of the smallest storm which affects soil moisture. Records and prediction relations are being obtained for 146 experimental sites throughout the United States, Alaska, and Puerto Rico.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrying 3aprediction 3arain 3asoil water 3astorms 3awater content 3aAlaska 3aPuerto Rico1 aReinhart, K.

Membranes are complex, primarily two-dimensional assemblies with varied lipid compositions depending on the particular region of the cell. Supported lipid bilayers are considered as appropriate models for physio-chemical studies of membranes including numerous single molecule techniques. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) as a topographic technique is a fully appropriate single molecule technique capable of direct observation of molecular processes on membranes. However, reliable experimental AFM studies require the preparation of the bilayer with a sub-nanometer smooth morphology, which remains stable over long-time observation. Here we present the methodology, which allows one to prepare a smooth, stable, structurally homogeneous lipid bilayer without the presence of any trapped vesicles. We described the application of such lipid bilayers to probe time-dependent early stages of aggregation of monomeric amyloid proteins. Importantly, the proposed methodology can be extended to bilayers with various compositions, by incorporating different lipids for on-membrane aggregation study including cholesterol. Furthermore, this methodology development allowed us to monitor the aggregation of amyloid protein at its physiologically relevant low protein concentration.

Weight loss of natural white oak leaf litter averaged 35% for the 1st yr and reached 67% after 2 yr. Litter decomposition rates were similar in control and treated areas. However, white oak leaves defoliated through stem injections lost 59% of their biomass in 1 yr. Decomposition was increased because of initially higher N levels and a lower C:N ratio in defoliated leaf tissue. Herbicide spray treatment increased microarthropod densities for up to 8 mo after application. The herbicide spray apparently influenced springtail and mite reproductive activity in treated areas. The increases in soil and litter microarthropod densities were not sufficient to affect leaf litter weight losses. Repeated defoliation of plant communities and the resulting increased decomposition rates could cause imbalances in litter dynamics and cycling processes. Changes in the timing of annual litterfall and the rates of nutrient release may thus lead to soil desiccation and the depletion of available nutrient pools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus alba 3abiomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adefoliation 3aforest litter 3aforests 3aherbicides 3aleaves 3alitter weight 3amites 3aplant communities 3aweight loss 3aGeorgia1 aShure, Donald J.0 tEcology.g1979 Feb., v. 60, no. 1 p.143-151dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19364763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009300165300001600258520067500274592002800949650001400977650002300991650002201014650002101036650001801057650001701075653004501092653002101137653001401158653002901172700002201201700001901223700001701242700002001259700002001279700001701299773010201316856008201418852000901500655001201509IND60605721820221122012837.0180723e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060572182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2016.10.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Wan Sik10aFacile synthesis of perovskite LaMnO3+δ nanoparticles for the oxygen reduction reaction  ap. 578-582.  aWe demonstrate the catalytic performance of perovskite-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst based on LaMnO3+δ nanoparticles (LMO NPs) prepared using the laser ablation synthesis in solution method.

The consumption of low-fat dairy foods has been linked with decreasing the risk of DM but studies have yet to show a clear correlation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of dairy intake on homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), waist circumference, and body weight. In MEDLINE and Embase, we identified and reviewed 49 relevant RCTs: 30 had appropriate data format for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Using the Review Manager 5 software, we calculated the pooled standardized mean differences comparing dairy dietary interventions to control for our outcomes of interest. For HOMA-IR (794 individuals), we found a mean difference of &minus;1.21 (95% CI &minus;1.74 to &minus;0.67; p-value < 0.00001; I2 = 92%). For waist circumference (1348 individuals), the mean difference was &minus;1.09 cm (95% CI 1.68 to &minus;0.58; p-value < 0.00001; I2 = 94%). For body weight (2362 individuals), the dairy intake intervention group weighed 0.42 kg less than control (p-value < 0.00001; I2 = 92%). Our findings suggest that dairy intake, especially low-fat dairy products, has a beneficial effect on HOMA-IR, waist circumference, and body weight. This could impact dietary recommendations to reduce DM risk.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody weight 3acomputer software 3adairy consumption 3adietary recommendations 3ainsulin resistance 3alow fat dairy products 3ameta-analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition risk assessment 3anutritional intervention 3arandomized clinical trials 3asystematic review 3awaist circumference 3aUnited States1 aJohns, Tanya  S.1 aButtar, Rupinder  S.1 aRandhawa, Lovepreet 1 aSanchez, Edeline 1 aGal, Maya 1 aLestrade, Katherine 1 aMerzkani, Massini 1 aAbramowitz, Matthew  K.1 aMossavar-Rahmani, Yasmin 1 aMelamed, Michal  L.0 tNutrients.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110922373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01375naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010700170300001600277520040500293592002800698653001400726653002300740653002900763653001600792653001800808653001100826700001500837773012700852856008500979852000901064655001201073IND60125459220221120134806.0151103e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012545922DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-112.2.2682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfonina, Olga M.10aDicranum dispersum (Dicranaceae) and Sciuro-hypnum ornellanum (Brachytheciaceae), new to North America  ap. 268-272.  aTwo species, Dicranum dispersum and Sciuro-hypnum ornellanum, are reported for the first time from North America.

In this work, we study the contact interaction between two floating oil lenses on the surface of immiscible water. The contact interaction between the two floating oil lenses can be divided into three different regimes: (a) the collision involving deformation for low-viscous oils, (b) the direct coalescence for high-viscous oils, and (c) the coexistence (noncoalescence) of oil lenses at relatively high temperatures. The temperature dependence of the coalescence time for the coalescence of two silicone-oil lenses of large viscosities follows the Arrhenius equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3adroplets 3aequations 3aindustry 3aliquids 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apollution control 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aYang, Fuqian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6277-30820 tLangmuir.g2018 Sept. 13, v. 34, no. 40 p.11992-12001dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b021873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245008400165300001800249500001900267520093300286592002801219650002101247650001201268650001801280650002101298650001701319653002301336653003101359653000801390653001401398700001601412700001201428773013701440856008701577852000901664655001201673IND60717867720221119221544.0210114e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071786772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wei10aArabinogalactan in banana: Chemical characterization and pharmaceutical effects  ap. 1059-1065.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is generally recognized that banana has diverse health benefits. However, most of the molecules responsible for the health benefits remain unknown. In this work, an important polysaccharide was extracted from banana and purified. The molecular weight was determined to be 526.2 kDa. It was identified by chemical and spectroscopic methods as arabinogalactan with β-D-(1→6)-galactan as backbone. This arabinogalactan was comprised of three monosaccharides, including Ara, Gal and GlcA with a relatively molar ratio of 5.8: 5.9: 1.0. The side chains were identified to be α-L-Araf-(1→, β-D-GlcpA-(1→, α-L-Araf-(1→5)-α-L-Araf-(1→ and α-D-Galp-(1→3)-α-L-Araf-(1→. They were linked to β-D-(1→6)-galactan at O-3, respectively. The putative structure was drawn as below. This arabinogalactan could induce NO production. It could also inhibit ROS production with a dose-dependent behaviour.

WEWT, like water extracts of green tea (WEGT) and water extracts of Pu-erh tea (WEPT), demonstrates a marked inhibition of the oxidation of liposome, albumin and LDLmodel systems. WEWT protects against H2O2-induced cytotoxicity, in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of ROS generation and MDA formation by WEWT in H2O2-induced Clone 9 cells parallels the effects on cell viability. Moreover, GSH and antioxidant enzymes may play an important role in the protective effect that is associated with H2O2-induced oxidative stress. The HPLC-DAD and HPLC–MS/MS analysis, shows that sixteen bioactive compounds are present in WEWT, which may partially account for its protective effect against oxidative insult. These results suggest that the mechanism of the protective actions of WEWT is related to its antioxidant potential and the maintenance of the normal redox status of the cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acytotoxicity 3aenzymes 3agreen tea 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aviability 3awhite tea 0aAntioxidant enzyme 0aGlutathione 0aOxidative stress 0aWhite tea1 aChyau, Charng-Cherng1 aLee, Chia-Pu1 aChu, Heuy-Ling1 aChang, Lee-Wen1 aDuh, Pin-Der0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 141, no. 4 p.4107-4114dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.06.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011100170300001600281520091500297592002801212653001301240653001901253653001501272653001001287653002901297653001101326653000901337653001401346653000801360700002201368700002201390700002201412773012701434856008501561852000901646655001201655IND60125459420221120134739.0151103e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012545942DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-112.2.2782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarraÍÍn, Juan10aPhylogenetic affinities and conservation status of the Chilean endemic Costesia spongiosa (Gigaspermaceae)  ap. 278-286.  aCostesia spongiosa is known only from central Chile. The recent discovery of several small populations prompted an examination of diagnostic morphological features and the sampling of DNA for surveying the chloroplast genome for a 71-kb inversion diagnostic of the Funariales and Encalyptales, and for reconstructing the phylogenetic affinities of this monospecific genus. The species is fully illustrated and mapped. The affinities of Costesia to the Gigaspermaceae are here confirmed based on morphology and corroborated by chloroplast sequence data. Molecular data suggest that Costesia is most closely related to Oedipodiella and Chamaebryum. Although the species is locally common, it has disappeared from several localities and seems now confined mostly to a protected area. We propose that Costesia spongiosa be included as the first Chilean endemic bryophyte in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCostesia 0aGigaspermaceae 0aFunariidae 0aChile 0aLa Campana National Park 0atrnL-F 0arps4 0aphylogeny 0aSEM1 aHerrera, Fernanda1 aBudke, Jessica M.1 aGoffinet, Bernard0 tBryologist.g2009 June, v. 112, no. 2 p.278-286dThe American Bryological and Lichenological Society, Incx0007-27457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1639%2F0007-2745-112.2.2783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01346naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009700158300001600255520046900271592002800740653002700768653002600795653002000821653001500841653001200856773011600868856007500984852000901059655001201068IND60128421920221117111213.0151115e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012842192DNAL7 a10.2326/osj.5.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTHINH, Vu Tien10aBird species richness and diversity in relation to vegetation in Bavi National Park, Vietnam  ap. 121-125.  aI studied the relationships between bird community and vegetation in Bavi National Park, Vietnam, during August and September 2004.

Previous attempts to determine the causes of such declines have indicated correlations between predator populations, the presence of unpalatable algae or high midsummer water temperatures, and the reduction or disappearance of the daphnid populations. In this study, in situ life table experiments were performed to assess the influence of natural food and temperature conditions on population growth. A weekly sampling program showed that D. pulicaria was dielly concentrated, after early summer, at depths between the anaerobic hypolimnion and the warmer epilimnion, consistent with previous information indicating it to be a cold—water species. However, in situ life table data showed that D. pulicaria was capable of surviving in epilimnetic water up to 27°C, although reproduction was greatly reduced for a 6—day period in mid—July. This reduction in reproduction appeared to be the result of an interaction of high temperatures, declining standing crops of small algae and increasing amounts of Anabaena, Ceratium and Volvox. Daphnia galeata mendotae did not show any adverse response to these mid—July algae—temperature conditions. Analysis of predator gut contents suggested that both daphnids were heavily preyed upon by bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus). Shifts in the size structure of the daphnid populations were also consistent with intense size—selective predation by bluegills, as was the tendency for the age distribution of parthenogenic eggs to become skewed to younger eggs as the midsummer decline proceeded. Differences in body size, ephippial production and habitat preferences between the 2 species are also consistent with the hypothesis that planktivory is a strong selective force in their evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aDaphnia galeata 3aLepomis macrochirus 3aVolvox 3aalgae 3abody size 3acrops 3adigestive system 3aeggs 3aevolution 3ahabitat preferences 3alakes 3alife tables 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3areproduction 3asummer 3awater temperature 3aMichigan0 tEcology.g1979 Feb., v. 60, no. 1 p.165-179dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19364783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245016000179300001600339520127100355592002801626650001601654650001301670650001301683650001001696650001301706650001101719650001401730650001001744651001001754653000801764653000601772653000601778653000601784653000601790653000601796653000601802653000601808653000601814653000601820653000701826653000801833653000901841653000901850653001401859653002701873653001701900653003001917653002701947700002101974700002001995700003002015700002102045700002302066700002002089773011502109856008502224852000902309655001202318IND60570459120221120032828.0190412e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057045912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgbemabiese, Chantal Ama10aWhole genome characterisation of a porcine-like human reassortant G26P[19] Rotavirus A strain detected in a child hospitalised for diarrhoea in Nepal, 2007  ap. 164-169.  aA rare G26 Rotavirus A strain RVA/Human-wt/NPL/07N1760/2007/G26P[19] was detected in a child hospitalised for acute diarrhoea in Kathmandu, Nepal. The complete genome of 07N1760 was determined in order to explore its evolutionary history as well as examine its relationship to a Vietnamese strain RVA/Human-wt/VNM/30378/2009/G26P[19], the only G26 strain whose complete genotype constellation is known. The genotype constellation of 07N1760 was G26-P[19]-I12-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1, a unique constellation identical to that of the Vietnamese 30378 except the VP6 gene. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both strains were unrelated at the lineage level despite their similar genotype constellation. The I12 VP6 gene of 07N1760 was highly divergent from the six currently deposited I12 sequences in the GenBank. Except for its NSP2 gene, the remaining genes of 07N1760 shared lineages with porcine and porcine-like human RVA genes. The NSP2 gene belonged to a human RVA N1 lineage which was distinct from typical porcine and porcine-like human lineages. In conclusion, the Nepali G26P[19] strain 07N1760 was a porcine RVA strain which derived an NSP2 gene from a human Wa-like RVA strain by intra-genotype reassortment probably after transmission to the human host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus A 3achildren 3adiarrhea 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3aswine 3aNepal 0aRVA 0aI 0aR 0aC 0aM 0aA 0aN 0aT 0aE 0aH 0aVP 0aNSP 0aMEGA 0aViPR 0aRotavirus 0aMolecular epidemiology 0aReassortment 0aInterspecies transmission 0aAcute diarrhoea, Nepal1 aNakagomi, Toyoko1 aGauchan, Punita1 aSherchand, Jeevan Bahadur1 aPandey, Basu Dev1 aCunliffe, Nigel A.1 aNakagomi, Osamu0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2017 Oct., v. 54 p.164-169dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011900158300001800277520038600295592002800681650001500709650002700724650002300751650001300774650001500787650000900802700001800811700028600829700001501115700015601130773013401286856007401420852000901494655001201503IND60659526520221123025124.0190823e20120716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065952652DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc30879g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamada, Kenji10aStrong two-photon absorption and its saturation of a self-organized dimer of an ethynylene-linked porphyrin tandem  ap. 7988-7990.  aThe two-photon absorption properties of a self-organized dimer of a free-base and zinc(ii) porphyrins tandem linked with an ethynylene group and terminated by imidazolyl and phenylethynyl groups were investigated.

Land-use change to bamboo (Phyllostachys praecox) cultivation that later entails organic material mulching combined with chemical fertilizer application will inevitably influence soil N mineralization (Nₘᵢₙ) and availability dynamics. However, the soil Nₘᵢₙ rates associated with various N fractions of P. praecox in response to land-use change and mulching are not well understood. The present study aimed to understand the effects of land-use change to P. praecox bamboo cultivation and organic material mulching on soil Nₘᵢₙ and availability. Soil properties and organic N fractions were measured in a P. praecox field planted on former paddy fields, a mulched P. praecox field, and a rice (Oryza sativa L.) field. Soil Nₘᵢₙ was determined using a batch incubation method, with mathematical models used to predict soil Nₘᵢₙ kinetics and potential. The conversion from a paddy field to P. praecox plantation decreased the soil pH, soil total N, and soil organic matter (SOM) content significantly (p < 0.05); the mulching method induced further soil acidification. The mulching treatment significantly augmented the SOM content by 7.08% compared with the no-mulching treatment (p < 0.05), but it decreased soil hydrolyzable N and increased the nonhydrolyzable N (NHN) content. Both the Nₘᵢₙ rate and cumulative mineralized N were lowest in the mulched bamboo field. The kinetics of Nₘᵢₙ was best described by the ‘two-pool model’ and ‘special model’. The Pearson’s correlation analysis and the Mantel test suggested soil pH was the dominant factor controlling the soil cumulative mineralized N and mineralization potential in the bamboo fields. These findings could help us better understand the N cycling and N availability under mulching conditions for shifts in land use, and provide a scientific basis for the sustainable management of bamboo plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aPhyllostachys violascens 3abamboos 3afertilizer application 3aland use change 3amineral fertilizers 3amineralization 3amulching 3anitrogen 3apaddies 3arice 3asoil acidification 3asoil organic nitrogen 3asoil pH 3atotal nitrogen1 aSun, Xiao 1 aGao, Jianshuang 1 aZhuang, Shunyao 0 tForests.g2021 Aug. 19, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120811093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01068naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245004500177300001600222520021100238592002800449653001800477653001700495653001800512653001700530700002200547773012700569856008500696852000900781655001200790IND60125459720221120143907.0151103e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012545972DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-112.2.3012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCâmara, Paulo E.

Hot-H₂O extraction of C. morifolium tea showed that most flavonoids and caffeoylquinic acids dissolved out at 30 min, with 20.977 and 8.958 mg/g GW indicated that C. morifolium, which is used in food and tea, is rich in flavonoids and carotenoids. The results improve our understanding of flavonoid biosynthesis and the mechanisms responsible for flower color.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum morifolium 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3aextraction 3aflower color 3afood chemistry 3akaempferol 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3atea 0aChrysanthemum morifolium Ramat 0aLC-mass spectrometry metabolomics 0aCaffeoylquinic acids 0aFlavonoids 0aFlower color1 aLiu, Jing1 aDong, Gangqiang1 aZhang, Xueting1 aLiu, Yan1 aSun, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5675-04661 aLiu, An0 tFood chemistry.g2021 May 15, v. 344 p.128733-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1287333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008600164300002000250520137600270592002801646650001201674650001501686650001301701650001901714650002501733650001501758650001901773650000901792650001501801650002301816650001401839650001201853650001801865650001501883651001301898700002301911700002701934700005501961773014202016856007902158852000902237655001202246IND60621589120221119103829.0181120e20181019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062158912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b035872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBird, Darcy L.10aSteady-State Land Cover but Non-Steady-State Major Ion Chemistry in Urban Streams  ap. 13015-13026.  aSources of many major ions in urban streams remain ambiguous, particularly for ions unrelated to deicing salt use, and temporal patterns in concentrations are unstudied. We used 16 years of water chemistry data based on weekly samples from the Baltimore, MD, USA, metropolitan area and the Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season approach to investigate connections between major ions, land cover, and time. All watersheds were underlain by silicate bedrock, contained no regulated point sources, and had stable land cover. Major ion concentrations were higher with greater urban land cover. Notably, concentrations of most ions increased with time in (sub)urban streams and had higher annual variability than in watersheds without impervious surface cover. Nonpoint source contributions from deicing salt and concrete were the predominant influences on major ion concentrations and produced stream chemistry that was distinctly different from forested streams. The novel finding that concentrations of most major ions were not only elevated but increasing in urban streams even with no substantial changes in land cover during the study period has important implications for ecosystem health and water quality, particularly given recent work demonstrating the high correlation between elevated ion concentrations and changes in freshwater biotic communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3abiocenosis 3aconcrete 3adeicing agents 3aenvironmental health 3afreshwater 3ahydrochemistry 3aions 3aland cover 3ametropolitan areas 3asilicates 3astreams 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aMaryland1 aGroffman, Peter M.1 aSalice, Christopher J.1 aMoore, Joel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5546-96100 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Oct. 19, v. 52, no. 22 p.13015-13026dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b035873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245017900169300002000348520151800368592002801886650001301914650001501927650001601942650002301958650001101981650003001992700002202022700006202044773013802106856008002244852000902324655001202333IND60657170920221120183633.0190816e20190722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065717092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b056922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemille, Trevor B.10aPeriodic Arrays of Dewetted Silver Nanostructures on Sapphire and Quartz: Effect of Substrate Truncation on the Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance and Near-Field Enhancement  ap. 19879-19886.  aSubstrate-supported plasmonic nanostructures are distinct from their colloidal counterparts, in that they are surrounded by an asymmetric dielectric environment composed of the substrate material and the surrounding ambient. Such environments inevitably lead to plasmonic resonances and near-fields that differ from those of solution-dispersed structures. The most straightforward method for fabricating substrate-based plasmonic nanostructures is through the solid-state dewetting of ultrathin films. This process typically leads to nanostructures with an asymmetric geometry due to an apparent truncation by the substrate to an otherwise symmetric structure. While changes to the plasmonic properties resulting from the substrate-imposed dielectric environment are well studied, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of substrate truncation is lacking. Here, a study of the plasmonic properties of substrate-truncated Ag nanospheres is presented, where, through experiment and simulation, the influence of substrate truncation on plasmonic resonances and the associated near-fields are elucidated. It is shown that increases to the degree of truncation give rise to a substantial red shift and strengthening of the dipole resonance, a weakening of the quadrupole resonance, and a strengthening of the near-field intensities near the nanostructure–substrate interface. The study contributes to the understanding needed to rationally design nanostructure–substrate systems for on-chip plasmonic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ananosilver 3ananospheres 3aphysical chemistry 3aquartz 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aHughes, Robert A.1 aNeretina, Svetlana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6889-43840 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 22, v. 123, no. 32 p.19879-19886dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b056923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015300171300002000324520133300344592002801677650001501705650002801720650001201748650001201760650002801772650001501800650000901815650001401824650002501838650002401863650003001887700007301917700002101990700006302011773011702074856008402191852000902275655001202284IND60615189720221118073335.0181009e20180914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061518972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b023972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacconi, Alessio12aA Comparative Study of Phosphatidylcholine versus Phosphatidylserine-Based Solid Supported Membranes for the Preparation of Liposome-Rich Interfaces  ap. 12183-12190.  aSolid supported membranes (SSMs) are usually formed by an hybrid octadecanethiol/phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayer supported by a gold electrode. Recently, it was shown that phosphatidylserine (PS) in place of PC can promote a more effective accumulation of lipid vesicles on the SSM surface when Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions are present in the external environment. Here we performed a detailed comparative study of the vesicle adsorption process onto PC- and PS-SSMs by employing surface plasmon resonance (SPR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). SPR analysis has demonstrated a higher affinity of the PS-SSM surface for the phospholipid vesicles. Both SPR and EIS measurements suggest that adsorption of lipid vesicles on the PC-SSM tends to a saturating value, whereas a continuous and progressive vesicle adsorption occurs on the PS-SSM surface following subsequent liposome additions. AFM analysis pointed out a systematic flattening of the adsorbed vesicles on the PS-SSM surface. We interpreted our results as due to the strong coordinating action of the high amount of divalent cations accumulated at the negatively charged PS-SSM surface, whereas a lower amount of cations is present on the dipolar PC-SSM surface, which can therefore adsorb only a limited number of vesicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3acalcium 3acations 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3agold 3amagnesium 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylserines 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aTadini-Buoninsegni, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5594-25541 aTiribilli, Bruno1 aMargheri, Giancarlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8265-19470 tLangmuir.g2018 Sept. 14, v. 34, no. 40 p.12183-12190dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b023973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009200165300001600257520122900273592002801502650002101530650002701551650002701578650002901605650001301634650002001647650001901667650001801686650001401704650001401718650001901732650001201751650001601763650002101779650001301800653002201813653001201835653001101847653001801858653001501876700002201891700001801913700001701931700002001948700002201968700002201990773010202012856008202114852000902196655001202205IND60605722320221122012925.0180723e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060572232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarvey, Mary10aTitania nanotube photocatalysts for effectively treating waterborne microbial pathogens  ap. 631-639.  aPhotocatalysts have been identified as a potential material for the efficient decontamination of lethal bacteria from drinking water. Compared to the traditional spherical powders, TiO2 nanotube photocatalysts possess a more efficient structure due to the high-aspect ratio and effective light harvest and improved electron/hole trap properties. The impact of various calcination temperatures and phase content on the antibacterial effect on Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been investigated. Studies show that high levels (99.9–99.99%) of bacterial inactivation were achieved for all species. Significantly higher levels of bacterial toxicity were achieved with the as prepared nanotubes and nanotubes annealed at 200°C and 400°C. This is explained as the higher percentages of anatase phase present in the sample. Synthesised nanotubes proved more antibacterial than titania P25 commercial nanoparticles. The order of sensitivity from most sensitive to least sensitive was found to be in the following order: E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. typhimurium. In addition, bacteria were found to be more susceptible to the inactivation while in the stationary (dormant) phase of growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3adecontamination 3adrinking water 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3apathogens 3aphotocatalysts 3apowders 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 0aTitania nanotubes 0aAnatase 0aRutile 0aAntibacterial 0aPathogenic1 aPanaitescu, Eugen1 aMenon, Latika1 aByrne, Ciara1 aDervin, Saoirse1 aHinder, Steven J.1 aPillai, Suresh C.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2016 Dec., v. 344 p.631-639dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009100170300001400261520101000275592002801285650001401313650001601327650001801343650001101361650001501372650002501387700002301412700002101435773012901456856008201585852000901667655001201676IND60560872120180425000000.0170111e20170111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056087212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b035962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWehinger, Gregor D.10aContact Modifications for CFD Simulations of Fixed-Bed Reactors: Cylindrical Particles  ap. 87-99.  aOne of the major issues for particle-resolved CFD simulations of fixed beds are particle–particle and particle–wall contacts. A fixed bed of cylinders is studied with different local contact modifications (i.e., caps and bridges method for line and area contacts, and caps and united method for overlaps resulting from composite DEM particles). Effects are analyzed regarding pressure drop, local velocity, and local heat transfer for 191 < Reₚ < 763. Modeling particle–wall contacts is becoming more important with increasing Reₚ. Contact modifications inside the bed are becoming less important because convective heat transfer is dominant. The stable caps method shows promising results in comparison with heat-transfer predictions. However, it overestimates convective heat transfer in the contact regions for high flow rates. The bridges method shows good results for pressure drop and heat-transfer predictions. A difficulty remains the choice of the thermal conductivity of these bridges.  aPublisher supplied data 3acylinders 3aengineering 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3aprediction 3athermal conductivity1 aFütterer, Carsten1 aKraume, Matthias0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 56, no. 1 p.87-99dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b035963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009100177300001600268520124500284592002801529596000601557596000601563650002301569650001101592650001601603650001701619650001701636650001401653650001201667650001301679650001501692650001901707650001901726650001901745650001701764650001401781650001701795650001801812650001301830653003101843653002301874653001901897700003501916700002901951700002901980700004002009700003202049700002402081700002402105700005202129773014502181856008602326852000902412655001202421IND60765778520221120190231.0220202e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076577852DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2021.20179532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmaro de Sales, Ramon10aTannery Sludge Applied in High Doses in Elephant Grass as an Alternative Fertilization  ap. 494-506.  aTannery sludge has great potential for use in agriculture, however it is a potentially toxic waste, and it is necessary to establish the ideal dose for each crop. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of fertilization with liquid tannery sludge on growth, chlorophyll a fluorescence and gas exchange of Pennisetum purpureum in two production cycles. A 2 × 6 + 1 split plot scheme was used, where the first factor was composed of two productive cycles, the second factor different fertilizations doses: 0, 30, 70, 110, 150, 190 t ha⁻¹ of liquid tannery sludge and an additional treatment with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium control. Plant height, number of leaves and tillers, canopy and stem diameter, leaf area, dry matter, chlorophyll index (SPAD), chlorophyll a fluorescence and gas exchange were evaluated. The highest production of total dry matter was observed in the second production cycle. The range between 72–100 t ha⁻¹ of liquid tannery sludge showed the greatest gains in growth and production of elephant grass. At doses above 150 t ha⁻¹ of liquid tannery sludge, the photochemical apparatus begins to show possible damage to the photosystem II (PSII) and reductions in gas exchange.  aPublisher supplied data  a.  a. 3aCenchrus purpureus 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3aleaf area 3aliquids 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aplant analysis 3aplant height 3apotassium 3asoil science 3atannery waste 3atoxicity 0aPennisetum purpureum Schum 0aquantum efficiency 0asustainability1 aHonorato Salla, Paulo Henrique1 ada Silva Berilli, Sávio1 aAmaro de Salles, Rodrigo1 aCândido Gabriel Berilli, Ana Paula1 aPereira Rodrigues, Weverton1 aSiman, Felipe Cunha1 aMassi Ferraz, Tiago1 aMazzei Moura de Assis Figueiredo, Fábio Afonso0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 Feb. 21, v. 53, no. 4 p.494-506dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2021.20179533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010100166520105400267592002801321650002401349650001501373650001801388650002001406650001001426650001401436650001301450650001901463650000901482650002101491650002101512650001501533650001101548650001301559650001501572650001401587650001701601650001701618653000701635653000701642653000801649653000701657653000801664653000801672653001101680653001001691653000801701653000801709653000801717653000701725653000801732653000901740653000801749653000701757653001301764653003301777653000901810653001201819653001601831700001401847700001501861700001801876700001301894700001501907700001301922700001701935700001601952700005801968773009902026856008702125852000902212655001202221IND60719440520221118024524.0220606e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071944052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1287352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Meng10aMapping and IgE-binding capacity analysis of heat/digested stable epitopes of mud crab allergens  aMud crab (Scylla paramamosain) is widely consumed after thermal processing. It is necessary to comprehensively evaluate of the allergenic potential and epitopes of allergens in high temperature–pressure (HTP) treated S. paramamosain. Tropomyosin and arginine kinase presented higher prevalence (30.77% and 42.13%) than the other three important crab allergens by component-resolved diagnosis. The surface expression of basophils CD63 and CD203c were decreased in HTP treated crab, an effect that was even more evident after digestion and absorption by the intestinal Caco-2 cell model. Of the 35 stable epitope, six were for the first time identified in shellfish. Seven heat/digested stable peptides of tropomyosin retained IgE-binding capacity and were shown to interact with MHC-II. Five epitopes (amino acids 19–29, 99–109, 153–162, 170–188 and 211–221) were the first identified in crab. The study provides insight into prevention and therapy of crab allergy, as well as helps to reduce crab allergenicity during thermal processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScylla paramamosain 3aabsorption 3aallergenicity 3aarginine kinase 3acrabs 3adigestion 3aepitopes 3afood chemistry 3aheat 3ahuman cell lines 3ahypersensitivity 3aintestines 3amodels 3apeptides 3aprevalence 3ashellfish 3atherapeutics 3atropomyosins 0aAK 0aAP 0aBAT 0aBL 0aCRD 0aHTP 0aiELISA 0aLAD-2 0aMLC 0aSCP 0aSGF 0aSI 0aSIF 0asIgE 0aTIM 0aTM 0aAllergen 0aComponent-resolved diagnosis 0aCrab 0aEpitope 0aTropomyosin1 aHuan, Fei1 aLi, Mengsi1 aHan, Tianjiao1 aXia, Fei1 aYang, Yang1 aQingmei,1 aChen, Guixia1 aCao, Minjie1 aLiu, Guangming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8689-05040 tFood chemistry.g2021 May 15, v. 344 p.128735-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1287353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04515naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017900165300001400344520214300358592002802501650002202529650001602551650002502567650002902592650002802621650002102649650002502670650001702695650001602712650001302728650001802741650002302759650002302782650002302805650002902828650002002857650002002877650002102897650001402918650002302932650001902955650001402974650002002988650003003008650001503038650002003053650001303073650002003086650001203106650002603118650001403144650002103158650001903179650001603198650001103214650002503225650001003250650001603260653002503276653001503301653001103316653001503327653002503342653002003367653002303387700001603410700001903426700001503445700001703460700001903477773011003496856008203606852000903688655001203697IND60728472620221120032900.0210619e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072847262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2021.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Wenxiang10aEffects of dietary synbiotics supplementation methods on growth, intestinal health, non-specific immunity and disease resistance of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei  ap. 46-55.  aThe present study aims to investigate the effects of dietary synbiotics supplementation methods on growth, feed utilization, hepatopancreas and intestinal histology, non-specific immunity and microbiota community of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). A control diet was designed to contain 18% fish meal (CON), and then 3 g kg⁻¹ synbiotics (Bioture, consisting of Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, β-glucan and mannan oligosaccharide, etc) was supplemented to the control diet with three methods, directly adding in diets for pelleting (DAP), spraying diets after pelleting at once (SDA), spraying diets before feeding every day (SDE). Shrimp with initial body weight of 1.5 ± 0.12 g were fed one of the four diets for 56 days. The results showed that dietary synbiotics significantly increased the weight gain (WG), apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) of crude protein (CP) and dry matter (DM), hepatopancreatic protease activity and decreased feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P < 0.05). Among the three synbiotics-added diets, SDE group showed the best growth with significantly higher WG than DAP group (P < 0.05). Serum activities of total superoxide dismutase, catalase, acid phosphatase, lysozyme and alkaline phosphatase of synbiotics-added groups were significantly higher, and serum malondialdehyde level was significantly lower than those of the control (P < 0.05). The intestinal villus width and villus number were also increased by the supplementation of synbiotics. The cumulative mortality was reduced in the three synbiotics-added groups after challenging with Vibrio parahaemolyticus (P < 0.05), and SDE group showed a significantly lower mortality than the control and DAP groups (P < 0.05). In intestinal microbiota composition, the abundance of Lactococcus tended to increase and Vibro tended to decreased in SDA and SDE groups. In conclusion, dietary synbiotics improved the growth, feed utilization, intestine health and non-specific immunity of Pacific white shrimp, and spraying synbiotics on diet presented better performance than adding synbiotics in diet for pelleting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aLactococcus 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abeta-glucans 3abody weight 3acatalase 3acrude protein 3adigestible protein 3adisease resistance 3adry matter content 3adry matter digestibility 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afeed supplements 3afish meal 3agrowth performance 3ahepatopancreas 3ahistology 3ainnate immunity 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aliveweight gain 3alysozyme 3amalondialdehyde 3amannans 3amicrobial communities 3amortality 3aoligosaccharides 3apelleted feeds 3aproteinases 3ashrimp 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avilli 3aweight gain 0aPacific white shrimp 0aSynbiotics 0aGrowth 0aMicroflora 0aIntestinal histology 0aImmune response 0aDisease resistance1 aLi, Xiaoqin1 aZhang, Chunyan1 aWang, Jing1 aCai, Youwang1 aLeng, Xiangjun0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2021 May, v. 112 p.46-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2021.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007600170300001600246520054200262592002800804653001400832653001200846653001600858653002200874653001700896653001300913700002200926700002000948700001900968773012700987856008501114852000901199655001201208IND60125460020221123040241.0151103e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012546002DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-112.2.3252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz, Jesúús10aGrimmia horrida (Grimmiaceae), a new species from the Iberian Peninsula  ap. 325-328.  aGrimmia horrida, a new species from the NW of the Iberian Peninsula is described and illustrated.

Among 122 eligible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, 65 met the inclusion criteria. Combined EN and PN was administered for 21 days, wherein over the first 3&ndash;5 days of treatment, trophic enteral nutrition (300 kcal/day) was used with an energy increase of up to 1500 kcal. An EN was administered using a nasogastric tube or, in case of intolerance, using a naso-jejunal tube. For PN, the &ldquo;All in One&rdquo; system was used according to individually prepared admixtures (ESPEN Guidelines). In addition to routine blood measurement (i.e., ALAT, ASPAT, GGTP, creatinine, lipid profile), the following parameters were assessed: adiponectin, leptin, (hs)TNF-&alpha;, hsIL-6 and hsIL-10, TSH, NT-proBNP, serum vitamin B12 concentration, and tHcy. The results showed a considerable improvement in all clinically significant parameters (p < 0.05), showing the benefits and importance of short-term well-balanced EN combined with PN for nutritional and clinical status in IBD patients with active disease. The daily work at hospitals with active IBD patients demonstrates the potential of continued administration of home-based nutrition by patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadiponectin 3ablood serum 3acolitis 3acreatinine 3aenergy 3aenteral feeding 3aguidelines 3ahospitals 3aleptin 3alipid composition 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 3athyrotropin 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avitamin B121 aKarczewski, Jacek 1 aSwora-Cwynar, Ewelina 1 aDobrowolska, Agnieszka 1 aStelmach-Mardas, Marta 0 tNutrients.g2019 Sept. 18, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110922463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011900170300001800289500001900307520135800326592002801684650004401712650001501756650001501771650001501786650001201801650001901813650001101832650000701843650001101850650002001861650002301881650001701904650001901921650001501940653001801955700002301973773013701996856008702133852000902220655001202229IND60717868520221119221556.0210114e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071786852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIşık, Birol10aAdsorption of methylene blue on sodium alginate–flax seed ash beads: Isotherm, kinetic and thermodynamic studies  ap. 1156-1167.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present study, the adsorptive removal of methylene blue (MB) from wastewater was studied using the novel composite prepared by sodium alginate (SA) and flax seed ash (FS). The adsorption of MB was carried out using the composite beads consisting of different weight amounts of FS at different pH values and temperatures using different dye concentrations. The characterization studies of the composite beads were performed using Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Barrett-Joyner-Hallenda (BET-BJH) analyses. BET and BJH surface area values of SA-FS adsorbent beads were found to be 45.01 m²/g and 14.35 m²/g, respectively. During the studies, it was determined that the adsorption percentage of MB reached the maximum with 90% at pH = 7 and 50 °C. Furthermore, Langmuir model fits well for the adsorption of MB using SA-FS with different FS ratios, SA, and FS adsorbents. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained from Langmuir model was found to be 333.3 mg/g for SA-FS-2 composite beads at pH = 7 and 50 °C. The adsorption kinetics were interpreted well by pseudo-second order model for SA, FS and SA-FS adsorbents. The calculated thermodynamic parameters indicated that MB adsorption by FS, SA, and SA-FS were spontaneous and an endothermic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aendothermy 3alinseed 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3apH 3asodium 3asodium alginate 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3athermodynamics 3awastewater 0aFlax seed ash1 aUğraşkan, Volkan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 167 p.1156-1167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04135naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245024300174300001600417520216800433592002802601650003302629650002402662650002702686650002102713650001402734650002302748650002102771650001702792650001202809650001302821650001102834650002302845650001902868650002202887650001202909650001402921650001302935651001502948653002502963653001802988653001303006653001703019653001803036653001303054653001203067653001403079653001603093653001403109700002603123700002603149700002303175700002303198700002203221700001903243700002503262773011603287856008503403852000903488655001203497IND60570459920221120040416.0201206e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057045992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, Herakles A.10aRemarkable richness of trypanosomes in tsetse flies (Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes) from the Gorongosa National Park and Niassa National Reserve of Mozambique revealed by fluorescent fragment length barcoding (FFLB)  ap. 370-379.  aTrypanosomes of African wild ungulates transmitted by tsetse flies can cause human and livestock diseases. However, trypanosome diversity in wild tsetse flies remains greatly underestimated. We employed FFLB (fluorescent fragment length barcoding) for surveys of trypanosomes in tsetse flies (3086) from the Gorongosa National Park (GNP) and Niassa National Reserve (NNR) in Mozambique (MZ), identified as Glossina morsitans morsitans (GNP/NNR=77.6%/90.5%) and Glossina pallidipes (22.4%/9.5%). Trypanosomes were microscopically detected in 8.3% of tsetse guts. FFLB of gut samples revealed (GNP/NNR): Trypanosoma congolense of Savannah (27%/63%), Kilifi (16.7%/29.7%) and Forest (1.0%/0.3%) genetic groups; T. simiae Tsavo (36.5%/6.1%); T. simiae (22.2%/17.7%); T. godfreyi (18.2%/7.0%); subgenus Trypanozoon (20.2%/25.7%); T. vivax/T. vivax-like (1.5%/5.2%); T. suis/T. suis-like (9.4%/11.9%). Tsetse proboscises exhibited similar species composition, but most prevalent species were (GNP/NNR): T. simiae (21.9%/28%), T. b. brucei (19.2%/31.7%), and T. vivax/T. vivax-like (19.2%/28.6%). Flies harboring mixtures of trypanosomes were common (~ 64%), and combinations of more than four trypanosomes were especially abundant in the pristine NNR. The non-pathogenic T. theileri was found in 2.5% while FFLB profiles of unknown species were detected in 19% of flies examined. This is the first report on molecular diversity of tsetse flies and their trypanosomes in MZ; all trypanosomes pathogenic for ungulates were detected, but no human pathogens were detected. Overall, two species of tsetse flies harbor 12 species/genotypes of trypanosomes. This notable species richness was likely uncovered because flies were captured in wildlife reserves and surveyed using the method of FFLB able to identify, with high sensitivity and accuracy, known and novel trypanosomes. Our findings importantly improve the knowledge on trypanosome diversity in tsetse flies, revealed the greatest species richness so far reported in tsetse fly of any African country, and indicate the existence of a hidden trypanosome diversity to be discovered in African wildlife protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlossina morsitans morsitans 3aGlossina pallidipes 3aTrypanosoma congolense 3aanimal pathogens 3abarcoding 3aconservation areas 3adigestive system 3afluorescence 3aforests 3agenotype 3ahumans 3alivestock diseases 3anational parks 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aungulates 3awildlife 3aMozambique 0aAfrican trypanosomes 0aDNA barcoding 0aWildlife 0aTsetse flies 0aT. congolense 0aT. vivax 0aT. suis 0aT. brucei 0aT. godfreyi 0aT. simiae1 aRodrigues, Carla M.F.1 aRodrigues, Adriana C.1 aPereira, Dagmar L.1 aPereira, Carlos L.1 aCamargo, Erney P.1 aHamilton, P.B.1 aTeixeira, Marta M.G.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 Sept., v. 63 p.370-379dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245007300178300001600251520168800267592002801955653001501983653001301998653001602011653001602027653001202043700003202055773012702087856008502214852000902299655001202308IND60125460320221122081645.0151103e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012546032DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-112.2.3422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerced-Alejandro, Amelia12aA developmental sequence for paraphyses in Neckeropsis (Neckeraceae)  ap. 342-353.  aSome species of Neckeropsis have leaf-like structures that develop on the perichaetia after fertilization of the archegonia. It has been suggested that these structures are either ligulate perichaetial leaves or multiseriate paraphyses. Using light microscopy, a detailed morphological and ontogenetic description was done for the paraphyses in the reproductive branches of N. disticha. Important developmental stages were also described for nine other species of Neckeropsis (N. exserta, N. lepineana, N. nitidula, N. obtusata, N. nano-disticha, N. crinita, N. undulata, N. fimbriata and N. andamana) to document the development of the different types of paraphyses. Transitions between uniseriate and multiseriate paraphyses were documented at different stages in the development of the fertilized branch. These were interpreted as a transition series similar to the heteroblastic sequence in branch leaves; where the uniseriate and multiseriate paraphyses correspond to the juvenile and mature stages, respectively. Of the nine species, five possess multiseriate paraphyses that are fully developed at different points of the progression series. In N. nano-disticha and N. crinita the paraphyses are thinner and fully developed at early mature stage, while in N. undulata and N. disticha the fully developed paraphyses are narrowly ligulate and represent the middle mature stage in the developmental sequence. In Neckeropsis andamana and N. fimbriata the paraphyses are ligulate to lanceolate and correspond to the late mature stage. These results provide ontogenetic data for paraphyses, and could establish the states and direction of this character for a phylogenetic analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 0aParaphyses 0aontogeny 0aNeckeropsis 0aperichaetia 0aramenta1 aJesúús, Inéés Sastre-De0 tBryologist.g2009 June, v. 112, no. 2 p.342-353dThe American Bryological and Lichenological Society, Incx0007-27457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1639%2F0007-2745-112.2.3423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03785naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245009100163520212200254592002802376650001202404650001802416650001502434650001202449650001702461650001202478650002302490650002902513650001502542650002602557650003002583650001302613650001502626650001302641650003302654650001802687650001502705650001402720650001902734650002402753650001502777650001602792650001902808650001702827650002102844700002202865700002402887700002402911700002002935700002102955700001902976773012802995856007503123852000903198655001203207IND60703778720221116231012.0200721e20191224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070377872DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120100802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDittrich, Andreas 10aModelling Distributions of Rove Beetles in Mountainous Areas Using Remote Sensing Data  aMountain ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots that are increasingly threatened by climate and land use/land cover changes. Long-term biodiversity monitoring programs provide unique insights into resulting adverse impacts on plant and animal species distribution. Species distribution models (SDMs) in combination with satellite remote sensing (SRS) data offer the opportunity to analyze shifts of species distributions in response to these changes in a spatially explicit way. Here, we predicted the presence probability of three different rove beetles in a mountainous protected area (Gran Paradiso National Park, GPNP) using environmental variables derived from Landsat and Aster Global Digital Elevation Model data and an ensemble modelling approach based on five different model algorithms (maximum entropy, random forest, generalized boosting models, generalized additive models, and generalized linear models). The objectives of the study were (1) to evaluate the potential of SRS data for predicting the presence of species dependent on local-scale environmental parameters at two different time periods, (2) to analyze shifts in species distributions between the years, and (3) to identify the most important species-specific SRS predictor variables. All ensemble models showed area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics values above 0.7 and true skills statistics (TSS) values above 0.4, highlighting the great potential of SRS data. While only a small proportion of the total area was predicted as highly suitable for each species, our results suggest an increase of suitable habitat over time for the species Platydracus stercorarius and Ocypus ophthalmicus, and an opposite trend for Dinothenarus fossor. Vegetation cover was the most important predictor variable in the majority of the SDMs across all three study species. To better account for intra- and inter-annual variability of population dynamics as well as environmental conditions, a continuation of the monitoring program in GPNP as well as the employment of SRS with higher spatial and temporal resolution is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aStaphylinidae 3aalgorithms 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aconservation areas 3adigital elevation models 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3amountains 3anational parks 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3avegetation cover1 aRoilo, Stephanie 1 aSonnenschein, Ruth 1 aCerrato, Cristiana 1 aEwald, Michael 1 aViterbi, Ramona 1 aCord, Anna  F.0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Dec. 24, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120100803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245015400162300002000316520141400336592002801750650001701778650001701795650002301812650004901835650001101884650001801895650001301913650002201926650002201948650001401970650002401984650001902008650002102027700001902048700005402067700005802121700001902179700001902198700001602217700001202233773014202245856007902387852000902466655001202475IND60621589620221119104100.0181120e20181029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062158962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b037892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qianqian14aThe Regular/Persistent Free Radicals and Associated Reaction Mechanism for the Degradation of 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene over Different MnO₂ Polymorphs  ap. 13351-13360.  aThe role of regular/persistent free radicals on the catalytic activity of K⁺-tuned MnO₂ tunnel structures is poorly understood to date. Herein, three MnO₂ polymorphs (α-, β-, and δ-MnO₂) were synthesized and examined toward the degradation of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (1,2,4-TrCBz) at 300 °C. δ-MnO₂, with a two-dimensional-layered tunnel structure tuned by K⁺, exhibited the highest activity among the three MnO₂ polymorphs. The electron spin resonance spectroscopy results confirmed that δ-MnO₂ featured the most abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS: O₂–•, •OH, and ¹O₂), followed by α-MnO₂ (O₂–• and ¹O₂), and β-MnO₂ (O₂–•), being supported by the calculated energy barrier. It was, intriguingly, noted that persistent organic free radicals, newly recognized as emerging surface-stabilized compound, were remarkably detected in α- and β-MnO₂/1,2,4-TrCBz systems but not in more reactive δ-MnO₂/1,2,4-TrCBz system. These might contribute to discrepant oxidative degradation process. During the oxidative process, intermediates, including benzoic acid and glycerol, formed via attack by ROS. Upon further attack, these intermediates fragmented into smaller molecules such as formic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. The present findings give deeper insights into the role of free radicals on the catalytic degradation of chlorinated aromatics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzoic acid 3abutyric acid 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3afree radicals 3aglycerol 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amanganese dioxide 3apotassium 3areaction mechanisms 3asinglet oxygen 3asuperoxide anion1 aHuang, Xinchen1 aSu, Guijin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6719-82641 aZheng, Minghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5270-67591 aHuang, Chunhua1 aWang, Mengjing1 aMa, Chunyan1 aWei, Da0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 52, no. 22 p.13351-13360dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b037893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245009400161300001600255520122900271592002801500650002501528650001201553650002201565650001001587650001201597650001401609650003901623650002401662650002001686650002901706650001001735653002701745653001101772653001201783700001601795700002101811700001901832700001401851700001301865700001701878700001701895700001801912700001501930700001901945700001201964700001701976700001701993700002102010700002002031773009702051856007702148852000902225655001202234IND60644552720221122022455.0190516s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064455272DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2017-02462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yan-Jie10aAlternative splicing results in a lack of starch synthase IIa-D in Chinese wheat landrace  ap. 201-208.  aWe evaluated the SGP-1 protein composition of 368 Chinese wheat landraces using SDS-PAGE. The SGP-D1 null type was identified in three accessions (Xiaoqingmang, Pushanbamai, and P119). An 18-bp deletion and 9-bp variation were found at the junction region of the 7th intron and 8th exon, leading to deletion of the intron–exon junction recognition site AG when aligned the 8261-bp DNA sequence of TaSSIIa-D in Pushanbamai with that of Chinese Spring. Four cDNA types with mis-spliced isoforms were subsequently detected through amplification of TaSSIIa-D cDNAs. Among these, nine type II cDNAs with a 16-bp deletion in the 8th exon were detected, indicating that the major transcriptional pattern of TaSSIIa in Pushanbamai is type II. In the type IV cDNA, a 97-bp sequence remains undeleted in the end of the 5th exon. The amylose content in Pushanbamai was significantly higher than that in all control lines under field conditions, which suggested that deletion of SGP-D1 has an efficient impact on amylose content. As the TaSSIIa gene plays an important role in regulating the content of amylose, it is anticipated that these natural variants of TaSSIIa-D will provide useful resources for quality improvement in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative splicing 3aamylose 3acomplementary DNA 3aexons 3aintrons 3alandraces 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein composition 3astarch synthase 3atranscription (genetics) 3awheat 0aChinese wheat landrace 0astarch 0aTaSSIIa1 aYang, Qiang1 aZhong, Xiao-Juan1 aTang, Hua-Ping1 aDeng, Mei1 aMa, Jian1 aQi, Peng-Fei1 aWang, Ji-Rui1 aChen, Guo-Yue1 aLiu, Ya-Xi1 aLu, Zhen-Xiang1 aLi, Wei1 aLan, Xiu-Jin1 aWei, Yuming,1 aZheng, You-Liang1 aJiang, Qian-Tao0 tGenome.g2018, v. 61, no. 3 p.201-208dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl41235x1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2017-02463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245009700203300002000300520119300320592002801513650001101541650001901552650002101571650001901592650002201611650001101633650002901644650002101673650001501694650001101709650001201720651001801732700001901750700001601769700001701785700002101802773014201823856007901965852000902044655001202053IND60621589720221119104030.0181120e20181018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062158972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b038342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabacan, Oytun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9141-887210aUnintended Effects of Residential Energy Storage on Emissions from the Electric Power System  ap. 13600-13608.  aIn many jurisdictions, policy-makers are seeking to decentralize the electric power system while also promoting deep reductions in the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). We examine the potential roles for residential energy storage (RES), a technology thought to be at the epicenter of these twin revolutions. We model the impact of grid-connected RES operation on electricity costs and GHG emissions for households in 16 of the largest U.S. utility service territories under 3 plausible operational modes. Regardless of operation mode, RES mostly increases emissions when users seek to minimize their electricity cost. When operated with the goal of minimizing emissions, RES can reduce average household emissions by 2.2–6.4%, implying a cost equivalent of $180 to $5160 per metric ton of carbon dioxide avoided. While RES is costly compared with many other emission-control measures, tariffs that internalize the social cost of carbon would reduce emissions by 0.1–5.9% relative to cost-minimizing operation. Policy-makers should be careful about assuming that decentralization will clean the electric power system, especially if it proceeds without carbon-mindful tariff reforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adecentralization 3aelectric power 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahouseholds 3amodels 3atariffs 3aUnited States1 aAbdulla, Ahmed1 aHanna, Ryan1 aKleissl, Jan1 aVictor, David G.0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Oct. 18, v. 52, no. 22 p.13600-13608dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b038343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016900164300001200333520138600345592002801731650003701759650001301796650001301809650002001822650004101842650001301883650001301896650001301909650003201922650001301954650002501967650002201992650003702014653003202051653002802083653002002111653001802131700001402149700001802163700002102181773011002202856008402312852000902396655001202405IND60605722720221122043233.0180723e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060572272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Siyan10aPreparation and evaluation of amino modified graphene solid-phase microextraction fiber and its application to the determination of synthetic musks in water samples  ap. 1-7.  aIn the current study, amino modified (NH2-modified) graphene was developed as a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coating for the first time. The structure of the NH2-modified graphene was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The fiber was fabricated using xylene-diluted silicone sealant as an adhesion agent. The performance and feasibility of the NH2-modified graphene fiber was evaluated through autosampler-assisted direct immersion (DI) SPME followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the analysis of five synthetic musks (muscone, galaxolide, musk-xylene, tonalide and musk-ketone) in aqueous samples. The results showed that the prepared fiber had good thermal stability, excellent solvent resistance and a long service lifetime (more than 200 replicate extraction cycles). The proposed autosampler-assisted DI-SPME-GC/MS method showed low limits of detection (0.46–5.96ngL⁻¹), wide linear ranges (5–500ngL⁻¹), and acceptable reproducibility (relative standard deviation, RSD<12%). Finally, the method was successfully applied to the analysis of synthetic musks in environmental water samples with good recoveries (82.3–112%) and satisfactory precisions (RSD<9.9%). These results indicated that the NH2-modified graphene provided a promising alternative in sample pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3acoatings 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agraphene 3asealants 3asilicone 3asolid phase microextraction 3asolvents 3astatistical analysis 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aSolid-phase microextraction 0aAmino modified graphene 0aSynthetic musks 0aWater samples1 aZhu, Fang1 aJiang, Ruifen1 aOuyang, Gangfeng0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 1429 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002900181245006500210506007600275520132000351592002801671506003701699650002301736650002301759650003301782650001601815650001301831650001501844650002101859650001101880650002201891651001601913700002801929700001901957700002001976700002301996700002802019700003102047773012302078856007402201852000902275655001202284IND60670137520221207133108.0190925e20190918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067013752DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110922482doi7 aPMC67694952pmcid7 a315405252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeltzer, Helle  Margrete10aEnvironmental Sustainability Perspectives of the Nordic Diet  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a&ldquo;The Nordic diet&rdquo; is an umbrella term that encompasses any interpretation that combines Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs) with local Nordic foods. The five Nordic countries have collaborated on Nordic Nutrition Recommendations for forty years, including FBDGs, so their national guidelines are similar. The countries also share similar public health issues, including widespread nonconformity to the guidelines, although in different ways. The aim of this concept paper is to discuss environmental sustainability aspects of the Nordic diet, describe the status of and make suggestions for the inclusion of sustainability in future work on the Nordic diet. We exploit the sustainability&ndash;health synergy. A food intake more in line with the current FBDGs, which emphasises more plant-based and less animal-based foods, is necessary for high environmental sustainability. In turn, sustainability is an important motivator for health-promoting dietary shifts. Policy development requires long-term efforts. Since the Nordic diet can be considered a further development and improvement of old, traditional diets, there is huge potential to formulate a Nordic diet that benefits both human and planetary health. It is time for concerted engagement and actions&mdash;a new Nordic nutrition transition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDietary Guidelines 3aanimal-based foods 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afood intake 3afoodways 3aguidelines 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aScandinavia1 aBrantsæter, Anne  Lise1 aTrolle, Ellen 1 aEneroth, Hanna 1 aFogelholm, Mikael 1 aYdersbond, Trond  Arild1 aBirgisdottir, Bryndis  Eva0 tNutrients.g2019 Sept. 18, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110922483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01355naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245012400173300001600297520033800313592002800651653001500679653001500694653002000709653001600729653001700745653001500762653002400777700001900801773012700820856008500947852000901032655001201041IND60125460620221122081700.0151103e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012546062DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-112.2.3632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKocourkováá, Jana10aGelatinopsis acarosporicola (Helotiaceae), a new lichenicolous fungus on Acarospora socialis from western North America  ap. 363-367.  aThe new lichenicolous fungus, Gelatinopsis acarosporicola, is described from southern California in western North America, where it grows on Acarospora socialis.

Satellite remote sensing images are the most important data source for urban geographical maps. However, for optical satellite remote sensing images with high spatial resolution, certain inevitable factors, including cloud, haze, and cloud shadow, severely degrade the image quality. Moreover, the geometrical and radiometric differences amongst multiple high-spatial-resolution images are difficult to eliminate. In this study, we propose a robust and efficient procedure for generating high-resolution and high-quality seamless satellite imagery for large-scale urban regions. This procedure consists of image registration, cloud detection, thin/thick cloud removal, pansharpening, and mosaicking processes. Methodologically, a spatially adaptive method considering the variation of atmospheric scattering, and a stepwise replacement method based on local moment matching are proposed for removing thin and thick clouds, respectively. The effectiveness is demonstrated by a successful case of generating a 0.91-m-resolution image of the main city zone in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, using images obtained from the Chinese Beijing-2 and Gaofen-2 high-resolution satellites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3aland use 3aradiometry 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aurban areas 3aurban planning 3aChina1 aLi, Zhiwei 1 aFeng, Ruitao 1 aLuo, Shuang 1 aZhang, Chi 1 aJiang, Menghui 1 aShen, Huanfeng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Dec. 24, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120100813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04918naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002600137245007500163300001600238500001500254520370000269592002803969650001503997650001104012650001004023650001204033650001804045650001304063650000904076650002004085650001304105650001504118650001004133650002304143650001404166650001204180650001104192650001104203650001604214650002004230651001204250653001004262773009604272856007104368852000904439655001204448IND60518647020221121052825.0160418e197904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051864702DNAL7 a10.2307/19376692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiddleton, Alex L. A.10aInfluence of Age and Habitat on Reproduction by the American Goldfinch  ap. 418-432.  a2019-12-06  aDuring the summers of 1968—1975 the breeding biology of a color—marked population of goldfinches was studied in natural, nursery, and city habitats at Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Nesting began in early July, the mean date for the laying of the first egg laid each year varying by only 7 days and the mean date for the 1st clutches by 2.6 days. Old ♀ ♀ (birds in their 2nd breeding seasons or older) were mainly responsible for early nesting, and the percentage of such birds involved with breeding became less as the season progressed. The height of nesting occurred in the latter half of July, and no new nests were begun after August. The largest clutches (mean 5.3 eggs) were laid by old ♀ ♀, which in turn laid a higher percentage of 6—and—7—egg clutches than did presumed 1st—year birds. The age of the @M may also influence clutch—size since the largest recorded clutches (mean 5.6 eggs) belonged to old ♂ ♂ paired with old ♀ ♀. Habitat also affected clutch—size, the nursery having the highest (5.6 eggs) which was followed by the city (5.2 eggs) and finally by the natural habitat (5.0 eggs). The differences in clutch—size may have been influenced by the age structure of the breeding populations in each habitat, by differences in time of nesting and breeding population density, and by effects of cowbird parasitism. Clutch—size diminished with season, July clutches being significantly larger than August clutches. Nesting records suggest that 6.0 eggs forms the most productive clutch—size for the American Goldfinch. Old ♀ ♀ had a higher success, both in terms of numbers of young fledged/nest and ratio of successful nests, than presumed 1st—time nesters. Age of ♂ ♂ may also affect nesting success, as in matings between old ♂ ♂ and old ♀ ♀ all chicks that hatched fledged, and a greater number of fertile eggs was produced in this mating combination than in any other. Fledging and nesting success were highest in the city, followed by the natural and nursery areas. City nests suffered a lower predation rate than those in the other 2 habitats, but a higher percentage of city nests was abandoned. Overall, the city was the most successful nesting habitat. In the natural habitat 74.1 of nests were built in shrubs, trees being used exclusively in the nursery and city. Maple was the most commonly used tree in all 3 habitats; whereas 67.9% of all nests built in maple failed in the natural area, only 22.2% failed the city. Heights above ground at which nests were built also increased with reliance on trees. City nests were significantly higher than those in the other 2 habitats. Six 2nd broods were raised from the 9 nests in which second broods were attempted. Old ♂ ♂ were known to have been responsible for 6 of these 9 nests. The latest date for the laying of a second clutch following the rearing of a first brood was 16 August. In all but 2 nests the 2nd clutch was laid before the first brood left the nest. Replacement clutches were laid by ♀ ♀ that had lost the 1st nest. The mean time between the loss of the 1st nest and the laying of the 1st egg of the new clutch was 6.9 days. The latest date on which the 1st egg of a replacement clutch was laid was 21 August. All replacement clutches were smaller than 1st clutches. Renesting proved successful in 60% of the cases. Whereas double—brooded birds produced a man of 7.3 fledglings/pair, renesting birds produced 2.8 fledglings/pair. Banding data showed that goldfinches commonly changed mates from year to year. Whereas ♂ ♂ were likely to change their nesting area, ♀ ♀ remained faithful to their original nesting area in subsequent years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasitism 3ashrubs 3anests 3arearing 3aage structure 3abreeding 3aeggs 3aegg substitutes 3ahabitats 3afledglings 3atrees 3apopulation density 3apredation 3anesting 3asummer 3achicks 3aclutch size 3abreeding season 3aOntario 0abirds0 tEcology.g1979 Apr., v. 60, no. 2 p.418-432dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19376693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010000162300001600262520166200278592002801940650002501968650001501993650001602008650002102024650001002045650003402055650001302089650001002102650001402112650001402126650001702140650001402157650004302171650005202214650001002266650001602276650001402292650001502306650002102321653001902342653001002361653001002371653001802381700001702399700001402416700001502430700001502445700001502460700001802475700002002493773009802513856007702611852000902688655001202697IND60644552920221122022008.0190516s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064455292DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2017-02542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yingzhen10aGenome-wide identification, evolution, and expression analysis of the KT/HAK/KUP family in pear  ap. 755-765.  aThe K⁺ transporter/high-affinity K⁺/K⁺ uptake (KT/HAK/KUP) family, as one of the largest K⁺ transporter families in higher plants, plays an essential role in plant growth, mineral element absorption, salt stress tolerance, and other physiological processes. However, little is known about this family in pear (Pyrus). Here, we identified 20 K⁺ transporter genes in pear (P. bretschneideri) using genome-wide analysis. Their gene structure, chromosomal distribution, conserved motifs, phylogenetics, duplication events, and expression patterns were also examined. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that PbrKT/HAK/KUP genes were clustered into three major groups (Groups I–III). Among the 20 PbrKT/HAK/KUP genes, 18 were mapped to nine chromosomes and two to scaffolds. Four WGD/segmental gene pairs were identified, indicating that WGD/segmental duplication may have contributed to the expansion of the KT/HAK/KUP family in pear. Among the four pairs of WGD/segmentally duplicated genes, both members of three pairs had been subjected to purifying selection, whereas the fourth pair had been subjected to positive selection. Furthermore, phenotypic experiments showed that the growth of pear seedlings was affected by potassium deficiency treatment. Expression patterns of 20 PbrKT/HAK/KUP genes in roots were further assayed with qRT-PCR. PbrHAK1 and PbrHAK12/16 were significantly expressed in response to K⁺ deficiency, suggesting that these genes are crucial for K⁺ uptake in pear, especially under the condition of K⁺ starvation. Our results provide a foundation for further study on the function of KT/HAK/KUP genes in pear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrus bretschneideri 3aabsorption 3achromosomes 3agene duplication 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3aminerals 3apears 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3astarvation 3astress tolerance 0aK+ transporter 0aPyrus 0amotif 0aK+ starvation1 aLü, Jiahong1 aChen, Dan1 aZhang, Jun1 aQi, Kaijie1 aCheng, Rui1 aZhang, Huping1 aZhang, Shaoling0 tGenome.g2018, v. 61, no. 10 p.755-765dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl41235x1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2017-02543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01253naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011100159300001800270520028100288592002800569650002700597650002300624650001500647650001700662700001700679700001800696700002100714773013300735856007400868852000900942655001200951IND60659527420221123025337.0190823e20120523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065952742DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc30926b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsui, Hisato10aMolecular assembly composed of a dendrimer template and block polypeptides through stereocomplex formation  ap. 6181-6183.  aA 2nd generation polyamideamine (PAMAM) dendrimer bearing right-handed helices to its eight terminals was shown to accommodate eight left-handed helices via stereocomplex formation to generate molecular assemblies of disk structure with 13–14 nm diameter and 6 nm thickness.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3adendrimers 3apolypeptides1 aUeda, Motoki1 aMakino, Akira1 aKimura, Shunsaku0 tChemical communications.g2012 May 23, v. 48, no. 49 p.6181-6183dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc30926b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007200172300001600244520080800260592002801068650002801096650002301124650001201147650001501159650001801174650002101192650002601213653002401239653003001263653002101293653003001314700002301344700002201367700001801389773011701407856008601524852000901610655001201619IND60570460420221123015633.0180905e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057046042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, Tsuyoshi10aPurification of monoclonal antibodies entirely in flow-through mode  ap. 110-116.  aA depth filter is widely used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing process.

The host cell protein clearance was comparable to that of protein A affinity chromatography, which is generally used as a first capture step in monoclonal antibody purification. In addition, a combination of different depth filters showed enhanced purification. Additional flow-through purification is possible without any sample preparation, and a biopharmaceutical-quality purity level (<100ppm for host cell protein and <5% for high molecular weight species) can be attained.

We manipulated four factors that could influence individual recognition cues: the mother queen, the environment during the immature stage, the environment during the early adult stage, and worker age. We also simulated the action of natural enemies on colonies tested for discrimination of such worker characteristics. All factors that we tested affected responses of the discriminating workers, which could recognize sisters, nieces and unrelated workers. Previous exposure of unrelated callow bees to the odor of the host nest greatly increased chances of acceptance by the host colony. Probability of acceptance decreased, however, with increasing age of introduced bees or increasing disturbance of the host colony. These complexities in patterns of nestmate recognition and nest defense are adequately explained from the standpoint of inclusive fitness of the discriminating workers. Differences in nestmate recognition and worker egg laying among Meliponini are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelipona 3aadults 3abrood cells 3aeggs 3anatural enemies 3anestmate recognition 3aodors 3aoviposition 3aprobability 3asisters 3astingless bees 3atropics 3aworker insects1 aRoubik, D.

We postulated that these defined monodisperse aggregations can be adjusted in terms of the coverage, that is, how efficiently can a spherical surface (, hydrophobic domain) be covered with identical caps (hydrophilic headgroup). We carried out small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), as well as titration calorimetry and dynamic light scattering (DLS), to observe the morphologies of the mixtures of these two components. The calorimetry showed a 1:1 stoichiometric exothermic reaction with a rather large binding constant. This means that, once the twin is formed from QACal7 and SCal7, these components hardly separate. SAXS showed that the spherical micelles changed to cylindrical ones and then to vesicle shapes as the composition reached a ratio of 1:1. At some intermediate compositions, mixtures of cylinders and plates (or spheres) were observed, which were confirmed by dynamic light scattering. We assume that the twin has a larger packing parameter than the individuals because of the cancellation of the charges between the sulfonic and the amine groups, and thus, the increase of the twin composition induces the entire morphology change, as expected from the packing parameter principle. In the present case, the coverage may be a secondary factor determining the morphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acalorimetry 3aheat production 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asurfactants 3atitration1 aFujii, Shota1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6594-52111 aTakahashi, Rintaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2168-94361 aSakurai, Kazuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9737-00610 tLangmuir.g2018 Sept. 18, v. 34, no. 40 p.12109-12115dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b025423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245013900162300002000301520166500321592002801986650002202014650001902036650000902055650002602064650001302090650002802103650001802131650001002149650001302159650001502172650003702187650002602224650001402250650002002264650001202284650001902296651001002315700001602325700001402341700001802355700001302373700001702386700005302403700001602456700005102472773014202523856007902665852000902744655001202753IND60599993920221121171518.0180702e20171219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059999392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b036812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Senrong10aTrophodynamics of Organic Pollutants in Pelagic and Benthic Food Webs of Lake Dianchi: Importance of Ingested Sediment As Uptake Route  ap. 14135-14143.  aHabitat is of great importance in determining the trophic transfer of pollutants in freshwater ecosystems; however, the major factors influencing chemical trophodynamics in pelagic and benthic food webs remain unclear. This study investigated the levels of p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and substituted PAHs (s-PAHs) in 2 plankton species, 6 invertebrate species, and 10 fish species collected from Lake Dianchi in southern China. Relatively high concentrations of PAHs and s-PAHs were detected with total concentrations of 11.4–1400 ng/g wet weight (ww) and 5.3–115 ng/g ww, respectively. Stable isotope analysis and stomach content analysis were applied to quantitatively determine the trophic level of individual organisms and discriminate between pelagic and benthic pathways, and the trophodynamics of the detected compounds in the two food webs were assessed. P,p′-DDE was found to exhibit relatively higher trophic magnification rate in the pelagic food web than in the benthic food web. In contrast, PAHs and s-PAHs exhibited greater dilution rates along the trophic levels in the pelagic food web. The lower species differences of pollutants accumulated in benthic organisms compared to pelagic organisms is attributable to extra uptake via ingested sediment in benthos. The average uptake proportions of PAHs and s-PAHs via ingested sediment in benthic biotas were estimated to be 31–77%, and that of p,p′-DDE was 46%. The uptake routes are of importance for assessing the trophic magnification potentials of organic pollutants, especially in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic organisms 3aeutrophication 3afish 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific variation 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3aplankton 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aquantitative analysis 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3astomach 3atrophic levels 3aChina1 aWang, Beili1 aLiu, Hang1 aGao, Shixiong1 aLi, Tong1 aWang, Shuran1 aLiu, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8181-10801 aLiu, Xueqin1 aWan, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1312-62540 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2017 Dec. 19, v. 51, no. 24 p.14135-14143dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b036813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01846naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002200166245014500188300001600333520068500349592002801034653002701062653001801089653002201107653001901129653002001148700002001168700002101188700001801209700001901227700002301246773011601269856011401385852000901499655001201508IND60128423620221117111939.0151115e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012842362DNAL7 a10.2326/1347-0558(2006)5[187:TFROBA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawakami, Kazuto,14aThe foraging ranges of Black-footed Albatross Diomedea nigripes breeding in the Bonin Islands, southern Japan, as determined by GPS tracking  ap. 187-191.  aThe foraging movements of six Black-footed Albatross Diomedea nigripes (an endangered species) breeding in the Mukojima Islands (a subset of the Bonin Islands) were successfully tracked over a period of two weeks using back-mounted global positioning system (GPS) data loggers (GDBL-II) during the nest-guarding period.

This was closely related to the inhibition of the electrostatic interaction on the formation of large protein aggregates during heat treatment (90 °C, 30 min). Specially, the CMC1.2 (the degree of substitution was 1.2) with higher charge density showed stronger interference than CMC0.7 (the degree of substitution was 0.7) for the gel network structure and properties. Moreover, the addition of salt ions could enhance the gel strength. Meanwhile, the coarseness and microstructure pore size were also increased with enhancing of ionic strength, resulting in a significant decrease in the WH. The effective permeability coefficient (k₁) and water flux coefficient (k₂) of gels have a significant positive correlation with their network pore size, indicated that the regulation of WH of hydrogel mainly depended on controlling the pore size of its microstructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agel strength 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogels 3aionic strength 3amicrostructure 3amodulus of elasticity 3aovalbumin 3apH 3apermeability 3aporosity 3atexture 0aPore size 0aCharge density1 aLi, Ya1 aLi, Bin1 aGeng, Fang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 167 p.1230-1240dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245005200179300001400231520168000245592002801925650001701953650002901970650001701999650002402016650001102040650002002051650001902071650002002090650002202110650001602132700002502148700002402173700002102197700002302218773009502241856005502336852000902391655001202400IND4484443720221120182315.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448444372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2907.2011.00184.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSTEYAERT, Sam M.

We determined that many aspects of the reproduction of the brown bear remain unclear, including (i) biological aspects, such as hormone and oestrous cycling, sperm competition, mate choice, sexually selected infanticide, etc. and (ii) human impacts on the mating system, occurring when humans alter population size and structure, through, for example, hunting or habitat degradation. 3 We considered three mating system classification frameworks from the literature (Emlen & Oring 1977, CluttonâBrock 1989, Shuster & Wade 2003) and applied various brown bear populations to them. We did this (i) to document the plasticity of the mating system of the brown bear, and (ii) to find commonalities among the reported mating system classifications in order to provide a general and common classification of the brown bear's mating system. 4 The mating system of the brown bear can, in general, be classed as âpolygamousâ. Subclassifications can nevertheless be valuable on smaller spatial scales. 5 Within the polygamous mating system of the brown bear, biological aspects and human impacts can influence reproductive strategies at the individual and population level. Mating system classification frameworks often lack a common terminology, which contributes to the variety of published classifications of the mating system of the brown bear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus arctos 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3ahabitat destruction 3ahumans 3amating behavior 3amating systems 3apopulation size 3asperm competition 3aterminology1 aENDRESTÃL, Anders1 aHackländer, Klaus,1 aSwenson, Jon E.,1 aZEDROSSER, Andreas0 tMammal review.g2012 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.12-34dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-18387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2907.2011.00184.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01371naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245014100178300001800319520025300337592002800590650001700618650001200635650001000647650001600657651001200673653001000685653001300695653001000708653001100718653001600729700002400745700002100769773012600790856008400916852000901000655001201009IND60161775920221121223127.0150612e20150726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6016177592DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2014.9747062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGwiazdowicz, Dariusz J.10aDescription of Orthadenella coulsoni sp. nov.

The economics of tiger farming in China  ap. 721-728.  aTigers are a threatened species that might soon disappear in the wild. Not only are tigers threatened by deteriorating and declining habitat, but poachers continue to kill tigers for traditional medicine, decoration pieces and so on. Although international trade in tiger products has been banned since 1987 and domestic trade within China since 1993, tigers continue to be poached and Chinese entrepreneurs have established tiger farms in anticipation of their demise. While China desires to permit sale of tiger products from captive-bred tigers, this is opposed on the grounds that it likely encourages illegal killing. Instead, wildlife conservationists lobby for more spending on anti-poaching and trade-ban enforcement. In this study, a mathematical bioeconomic model is used to investigate the issue. Simulation results indicate that, unless range states are characterized by institutions (rule of law and low corruption) similar to those found in the richest countries, reliance on enforcement alone is insufficient to guarantee survival of wild tigers. Likewise, even though conservation payments could protect wild tigers, the inability to enforce contracts militates against this. Our model indicates that wild tigers can be protected by permitting sale of products from tiger farms, although this likely requires the granting of an exclusive license to sellers. Finally, it is possible to tradeoff enforcement effort and sale of products from captive-bred animals, but such tradeoffs are worsened by deteriorating tiger habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera tigris 3aanimals 3abioeconomic models 3adomestic trade 3adomestication 3aentrepreneurship 3afarming systems 3afarms 3ahabitats 3ainternational trade 3athreatened species 3atraditional medicine 3awildlife 3aChina1 avan Kooten, G.

Joule heating/ESA has not been previously demonstrated in graphene based structures. Various forms of graphene have been previously evaluated for their use as a CO₂ adsorbent, but most of these studies have focused on graphene oxide powders and films. We utilize both pristine graphene and rGO; we also highlight regeneration through Joule heating in contrast to heating under vacuum or by pressure swing. The amount of CO₂ captured by graphene films and rGO aerogels was 0.52 ± 0.02 and 0.94 ± 0.02 g of CO₂ per g of adsorbate, respectively. This adsorption capacity of pristine graphene films and rGO aerogels was found to be stable over multiple samples and multiple cycles of adsorption and electrical current stimulated desorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaerogels 3acarbon dioxide 3adesorption 3aelectric current 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aheat 3apowders1 aIrin, Fahmida1 aParviz, Dorsa1 aAndrew Jackson, W.1 aGreen, Micah J.0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 03, v. 6, no. 49 p.43401-43407dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra01792d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245018100180300001600361520105700377592002801434650004401462650001001506650002101516650001501537650002201552650001301574650001501587650002801602650001701630650000901647650002701656650001301683650002401696650003301720650001701753650001601770650001901786650001201805653002101817653002001838653001501858653001701873653001701890653002401907700006601931700003001997700006102027773010202088856008502190852000902275655001202284IND60684581620221122062457.0200405e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068458162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.01.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKharrazi, Seyyedeh Maryam12aA novel post-modification of powdered activated carbon prepared from lignocellulosic waste through thermal tension treatment to enhance the porosity and heavy metals adsorption  ap. 358-368.  aModification of activated carbon is considered as an effective process to enhance its adsorptive characteristics. The KOH activated carbons prepared from elm tree waste were treated by a novel and green method using thermal tension by successive washing with 80 °C, 95 °C and 2 °C water to enhance the pore development and adsorption of Cr (VI) and Pb (II) from aqueous solutions. The activated carbons were characterized by Fourier-transform-infrared-spectroscopy, N₂-adsorption/desorption and scanning-electron-microscopy. The simulation of thermal stress using a finite-element-analysis implied that the quick temperature changes might cause the formation of cracks leading to enhancement of porosity. The BET surface area was increased from 465 to 1085 m²/g after post-modification of the activated carbon. The maximum adsorption capacity was achieved 232.56 and 113.63 mg/g for Pb (II) and Cr (VI), respectively. The thermal tension could be used as an efficient process to improve the adsorptive properties of the activated carbons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aUlmus 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achromium 3adesorption 3afinite element analysis 3aheavy metals 3alead 3alignocellulosic wastes 3aporosity 3apotassium hydroxide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3awashing 0aActivated carbon 0aThermal tension 0aSimulation 0aSurface area 0aHeavy metals 0aAdsorption capacity1 aMirghaffari, Nourollah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3779-09501 aDastgerdi, Mohammad Mehdi1 aSoleimani, Mohsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0417-44220 tPowder technology.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 366 p.358-368dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.01.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008500167300001600252520181800268536011902086592002802205650001302233650002102246650002302267650001702290650002802307650001102335650001502346650001402361650002002375650003102395650001802426650000902444650001802453650001102471650001102482650001902493650001302512650001502525650004302540650001202583650002602595650002902621650001802650650002002668650002102688653002102709653002202730700001602752773010402768856008602872852000902958655001202967IND60792962720221121004703.0220914e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079296272DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2022.20721482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChi, Yu Jie10aGene expression of the white-rot fungus Lenzites gibbosa during wood degradation  ap. 841-856.  aTo determine the wood degradation mechanism and its key genes and biological processes of Lenzites gibbosa, we sequenced 15 transcriptomes of mycelial samples under woody environment at 3, 5, 7, and 11 d (D3, D5, D7, and D11) and nonwoody environment (control). All the transcripts were annotated as much as possible in eight databases to determine their function. The key genes and biological processes relating to wood degradation were predicted and screened. The expression of 11 key genes during wood degradation after 5 d of sawdust treatment was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 2069 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained in 10 differential groups. Comparing wood with nonwood treatment condition, the key genes were those participating in oxidation-reduction process, they were oxidoreductase and peroxidase genes and their regulator genes; these genes mainly focused on the three biological processes of carbohydrate metabolism, lignin catabolism, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism. The mostly enriched subcategories in molecular function were oxidoreductase activity, peroxidase activity, and heme binding in Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. One cellulose and hemicellulose degradation pathway and seven pathways related to lignin-derived aromatic compound degradation or the later degradation of lignin were found. In conclusion, during the process of L. gibbosa growing on wood, gene expression at the transcriptional level indicated that lignin catabolism and hyphal growth were promoted, but the metabolism of carbon and carbohydrates including cellulose in lignocellulose in overall trend was inhibited to some extent. The results have important reference value for the study of degradation mechanism of wood white rot.  aThis work was financially supported by a grant from Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province (2016006).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLenzites 3aLeptidea sinapis 3aaromatic compounds 3abiosynthesis 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acarbon 3acatabolism 3acellulose 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3aheme 3ahemicellulose 3ahyphae 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amycelium 3aperoxidase 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asawdust 3asecondary metabolites 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3awhite-rot fungi 3awood degradation 0aLenzites gibbosa 0alignin catabolism1 aZhang, Jian0 tMycologia.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 114, no. 5 p.841-856dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2022.20721483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245016300173300001600336520207900352592002802431650001502459650001402474650001502488650001002503650001102513650001402524650001402538650001702552650001402569700002102583773009502604856004802699852000902747655001202756IND50062845220221121155506.0130323e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006284522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-012-9594-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessinger, Susanna M.14aThe influence of host demography, pathogen virulence, and relationships with pathogen virulence on the evolution of pathogen transmission in a spatial context  ap. 353-380.  aA major challenge in evolutionary ecology is to explain extensive natural variation in transmission rates and virulence across pathogens. Host and pathogen ecology is a potentially important source of that variation. Theory of its effects has been developed through the study of non-spatial models, but host population spatial structure has been shown to influence evolutionary outcomes. To date, the effects of basic host and pathogen demography on pathogen evolution have not been thoroughly explored in a spatial context. Here we use simulations to show that space produces novel predictions of the influence of the shape of the pathogen’s transmission–virulence tradeoff, as well as host reproduction and mortality, on the pathogen’s evolutionary stable transmission rate. Importantly, non-spatial models predict that neither the slope of linear transmission–virulence relationships, nor the host reproduction rate will influence pathogen evolution, and that host mortality will only influence it when there is a transmission–virulence tradeoff. We show that this is not the case in a spatial context, and identify the ecological conditions under which spatial effects are most influential. Thus, these results may help explain observed natural variation among pathogens unexplainable by non-spatial models, and provide guidance about when space should be considered. We additionally evaluate the ability of existing analytical approaches to predict the influence of ecology, namely spatial moment equations closed with an improved pair approximation (IPA). The IPA is known to have limited accuracy, but here we show that in the context of pathogens the limitations are substantial: in many cases, IPA incorrectly predicts evolution to pathogen-driven extinction. Despite these limitations, we suggest that the impact of ecology can still be understood within the conceptual framework arising from spatial moment equations, that of “self-shading’’, whereby the spread of highly transmissible pathogens is impeded by local depletion of susceptible hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademography 3aequations 3aextinction 3ahosts 3amodels 3amortality 3apathogens 3areproduction 3avirulence1 aOstling, Annette0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2013 Mar., v. 27, no. 2 p.353-380dSpringer-Verlagx0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-012-9594-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008400171300001200255520147700267592002801744650002101772650001701793650001101810650000701821650000901828650001901837700005501856700002401911773015101935856008302086852000902169655001202178IND60731836820221123034819.0210802e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073183682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09002-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurhan, Seda Bahar10aImpact of heating season on the soil pollution in Kirklareli province of Turkey  ap. 209.  aThis study, conducted in Kirklareli city centre, aims to analyse heavy metal pollution in soil due to heating season (HS). For this purpose, 86 soil samples were taken from the identified locations with a depth of 0–10 cm before (43 samples in September 2015) and after (43 samples in April 2016) HS. Besides, 10 soil samples (5 samples before the HS and 5 samples after the HS) were collected to determine the contamination level from 50 cm deep soil as a reference value. Collected soil samples were tested for Zn, Cu, Co, Pb, Ni, Cr, Hg and Cd metal concentration as well as pH values. Both seasons showed similar results in the soil samples in terms of mean metal concentration levels in the following order: Zn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Co > Pb > Cd > Hg. The mean concentration values of all the metals were higher after the HS than the levels before the HS. The study also attempted to determine anthropogenic metal input. An increase was observed in anthropogenic metal input after the HS when compared with before HS. Geoaccumulation index (Igₑₒ) was employed to determine the degree of metal pollution, while the contamination factor (Cf) was used to determine the level of contamination. The overall degree of pollution was identified using the degree of contamination (Cd) and modified degree of contamination (mCd). Besides, the positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model used to find the possible sources of heavy metals in soil samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3aheavy metals 3amodels 3apH 3asoil 3asoil pollution1 aOruc, Ilker1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0359-86961 aÖzdemir, Hüseyin,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 Apr., v. 193, no. 4 p.209-209dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09002-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009400167300001600261520138300277592002801660650001901688650001701707650002601724650002301750650001401773650001201787650002601799650001601825650001101841650001501852650001301867650001801880650001901898650000901917650001901926650002201945651001001967700001101977700001501988700001402003700001202017700001302029700002302042700001602065700001902081700001302100773009602113856008602209852000902295655001202304IND60086301620221120224520.0141101e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008630162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Jie10aAssessment of net ecosystem services of plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation in China  ap. 740-748.  aPlastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation is rapidly expanding in China and elsewhere worldwide. In order to comprehensively understand the impacts of plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation on agricultural ecosystem services and dis-services, we developed an assessment framework for the net ecosystem services and used China as a case study. Our results showed that, compared to conventional vegetable cultivation, plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation has higher fresh vegetable production, greater CO₂ fixation (3.61t CO₂ ha⁻¹yr⁻¹), better soil retention (23.1tha⁻¹yr⁻¹), and requires less irrigation (2132m³waterha⁻¹yr⁻¹), maintains similar soil fertility, but also has higher NO₃ ⁻ accumulation and N₂O emissions. In 2004, plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation in China provided an overall net economic benefit of 67,956yuanha–¹yr⁻¹ (8.28yuan=1 USD in 2004), where 68,240yuanha⁻¹yr⁻¹ represented ecosystem services and 284yuanha⁻¹yr⁻¹ for dis-services. The transition from conventional vegetable cultivation to plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation resulted in a net economic benefit of 24,248yuanha⁻¹yr⁻¹. A cost-benefit analysis suggests that plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation in China has the potential to optimize social benefits in addition to increasing annual economic income to farmers directly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3acost benefit analysis 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3afarmers 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3aincome 3airrigation 3anitrates 3anitrous oxide 3asocial benefit 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3avegetable growing 3aChina1 aWu, Xu1 aLiu, Anqin1 aWang, Yan1 aXu, Bin1 aYang, Wu1 aMeyerson, Laura A.1 aGu, Baojing1 aPeng, Changhui1 aGe, Ying0 tEcological economics.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 70, no. 4 p.740-748dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04292naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012600167520262000293592002802913650001302941650001602954650001602970650001102986650001802997650001703015650001603032650002503048650001003073650001703083650001103100650002103111650000903132650002403141650001203165650001803177651001003195653001603205653002303221653002103244653002303265653002003288700002303308700001703331700001603348700001603364700001903380700001603399700001603415700001403431700001903445700002203464773012403486856008303610852000903693655001203702IND60763906920221118062802.0220207e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076390692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2022.1078732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Jianwei10aDweller and tunneler dung beetles synergistically accelerate decomposition of cattle and horse dung in a semi-arid steppe  aAboveground and belowground invertebrates play a key role in decomposition of organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems. Dung beetles are well known for their functions in breaking down and transporting ungulate dung into soils thus promoting dung decomposition. However, the effects of functionally different dung beetles on the decomposition processes of the dung from different ungulates remain less explored. We did an in situ experiment using the 'dung and soil' mesocosm to investigate the separate and combined effects of two functionally contrasting dung beetle species, a dweller Aphodius sordecens and a tunneler Onthophagus gibbulus, on the decomposition processes of the dung from horse and cattle. We determined the changes in dung mass, dung C and N contents, microbial respiration from the 'dung and soil' mesocosm or from the soil beneath the dung pats, and examined the amount of dung balls transferred by beetles into different soil layers, under five dung beetle treatments (C – soil, no dung nor beetles; D – dung on soil with no beetles; DB - dung on soil with dweller beetles; TB - dung on soil with tunneler beetles; DTB - dung on soil with dweller and tunneler beetles) were applied to the dung of two major grazers with different digestive systems in native steppes in northern China, over a two-month period following dung deposition. We found that (1) tunneler beetles (in TB and DTB) significantly enhanced the dry mass loss of cattle dung but not horse dung. (2) Dung C and N contents declined more rapidly with the presence of any dung beetle species (DB-DTB) than that without (D); and dung N content showed different decreasing rates between horse and cattle dung in different decomposition periods. (3) The presence of the two functionally contrasting dung beetle species together had a synergistic, positive effect on soil microbial respiration and thus on the decomposition rate of soil organic matter; however, no significant effects of beetles on net microbial respiration was detected in the 'dung + soil' mesocosm. (4) The direct effect of dung beetles on dung mass loss was stronger for cattle dung than for horse dung. In contrast, the decline in moisture content of horse dung with decomposition time affected the microbial respiration in dung, and thus indirectly affected the dry mass loss and the C and N contents. Our results suggest it critically important to incorporate the functions of soil invertebrates into nutrient cycling models to improve their accuracy, and to promote invertebrate diversity in grazed grassland to maintain ecosystem health and services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphodius 3aOnthophagus 3aagriculture 3acattle 3acattle manure 3adung beetles 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental health 3afeces 3ahorse manure 3ahorses 3anitrogen content 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3asteppes 3awater content 3aChina 0aDung beetle 0aDung decomposition 0aNutrient release 0aMicrobial activity 0aZoogeochemistry1 aLi, Frank Yonghong1 aWang, Yadong1 aWang, Yanan1 aLiu, Xinmin1 aZhang, Junzhen1 aWang, Zhiyi1 aLi, Yanlong1 aWang, Hao1 aYang, Zhaoping1 aPotter, Murray A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2022 May 01, v. 329 p.107873-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.1078733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245009500153300001400248500002000262520150600282592002801788650003101816650001801847650001301865650001601878650000901894650001601903650001601919650001601935650001501951650001701966650004101983650002802024650005202052650001602104650001602120650001902136650001402155650001102169650001802180650001302198700001702211700001602228700002802244700001702272700001502289700001702304773010502321856007302426852000902499655001202508IND60548341120221118135114.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054834112DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.124412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lin10aInduced maize salt tolerance by rhizosphere inoculation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR9  ap. 34-44.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSalt stress reduces plant growth and is now becoming one of the most important factors restricting agricultural productivity. Inoculation of plant growth‐promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been shown to confer plant tolerance against abiotic stress, but the detailed mechanisms of how this occurs remain unclear. In this study, hydroponic experiments indicated that the PGPR strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR9 could help maize plants tolerate salt stress. After exposure to salt stress for 20 days, SQR9 significantly promoted the growth of maize seedlings and enhanced the chlorophyll content compared with the control. Additional analysis showed that the involved mechanisms could be the enhanced total soluble sugar content for decreasing cell destruction, improved peroxidase/catalase activity and glutathione content for scavenging reactive oxygen species, and reduced Na⁺ levels in the plant to decrease Na⁺ toxicity. These physiological appearances were further confirmed by the upregulation of RBCS, RBCL, H⁺‐PPase, HKT1, NHX1, NHX2 and NHX3, as well as downregulation of NCED expression, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction. However, SQR9 counteracted the increase of abscisic acid in response to salt stress. In summary, these results show that SQR9 confers plant salt tolerance by protecting the plant cells and managing Na⁺ homeostasis. Hence, it can be used in salt stress prone areas, thereby promoting agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aabscisic acid 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3aglutathione 3ahomeostasis 3ahydroponics 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3areactive oxygen species 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asodium 3asugar content 3atoxicity1 aLiu, Yunpeng1 aWu, Gengwei1 aVeronican Njeri, Kimani1 aShen, Qirong1 aZhang, Nan1 aZhang, Ruifu0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2016 Sept., v. 158, no. 1 p.34-44dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.124413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009800172300001600270520122800286592002801514650001901542650002001561650001901581650001601600650002401616650001501640650000901655650001901664650001801683650001501701650002001716650002001736650001701756651001001773651001401783651001201797651001301809651001601822651001301838651001801851651001201869700001901881773009601900856008601996852000902082655001202091IND60086301720221120224541.0141101e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008630172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapagain, A.K.14aThe blue, green and grey water footprint of rice from production and consumption perspectives  ap. 749-758.  aThe paper makes a global assessment of the green, blue and grey water footprint of rice, using a higher spatial resolution and local data on actual irrigation. The national water footprint of rice production and consumption is estimated using international trade and domestic production data. The global water footprint of rice production is 784km³/year with an average of 1325m³/t which is 48% green, 44% blue, and 8% grey. There is also 1025m³/t of percolation in rice production. The ratio of green to blue water varies greatly over time and space. In India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and the Philippines, the green water fraction is substantially larger than the blue one, whereas in the USA and Pakistan the blue water footprint is 4 times more than the green component. The virtual water flows related to international rice trade was 31km³/year. The consumption of rice products in the EU27 is responsible for the annual evaporation of 2279Mm³ of water and polluted return flows of 178Mm³ around the globe, mainly in India, Thailand, the USA and Pakistan. The water footprint of rice consumption creates relatively low stress on the water resources in India compared to that in the USA and Pakistan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acrop production 3adomestic trade 3aevaporation 3ainternational trade 3airrigation 3arice 3aspace and time 3avirtual water 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awater resources 3awater stress 3aIndia 3aIndonesia 3aMyanmar 3aPakistan 3aPhilippines 3aThailand 3aUnited States 3aVietnam1 aHoekstra, A.Y.0 tEcological economics.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 70, no. 4 p.749-758dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03724naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014600172300001600318520140700334536063901741592002802380650001402408650001802422650001302440650001802453650001202471650001502483650002602498650001002524650001402534650001402548651001102562653001802573653001202591653001502603653002402618653002802642653001702670653001502687653001502702700002802717700002302745700002302768700002402791700003202815700002602847700002102873700001902894700002202913773010402935856008603039961001203125852000903137655001203146IND60792962920221120234858.0220914e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079296292DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2022.20846722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbinghaus, Malte10aReinstatement and phylogenetic allocation of the palm rust genus Cerradoa in the Pucciniaceae, and establishment of Pseudocerradoa, gen. nov.  ap. 868-886.  aThe genus Cerradoa (type species Cerradoa palmaea) was established in 1978 by Hennen and Ono and named after the Brazilian Cerrado biome. The holotype collected in Planaltina, Federal District, Brazil, belonged to the first rust fungus reported on palms (Arecaceae). For decades, the status of Cerradoa as a distinct genus has been regarded as doubtful, representing a synonym of Edythea (Uropyxidaceae) starting with the second edition of the Illustrated Genera of Rust Fungi in 1983. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses, as well as our morphological investigations, allowed us to reject this synonymy, leading to the reinstatement of Cerradoa within the Pucciniaceae. Cerradoa, together with morphologically similar genera such as the newly established Pseudocerradoa with two species (Ps. paullula and Ps. rhaphidophorae) infecting araceous hosts, the fern rust Desmella, and also P. engleriana, could not be assigned to any of the seven identified major lineages within the Pucciniaceae. Edythea, instead of being maintained as a member of the Uropyxidaceae, was herein placed in Pucciniaceae, shown phylogenetically in close relationship to Cumminsiella mirabilissima, both infecting the Berberidaceae. Additionally, our extensive phylogenetic analyses add guidance for future taxonomic revisions in the highly polyphyletic genus Puccinia and other established taxa within the family Pucciniaceae.  aM.E. was financially supported by Ruhr University Bochum through grant RUB Researchschool PLUS B-2018-03-005.

In this study 45 bacteria were isolated from samples contaminated with petrochemical residues, from which 21 were obtained from Landfarming soil contaminated with oily sludge, 11 were obtained from petrochemical industry effluents and 13 were originated directly from oily sludge. The metabolization capability of different carbon sources, growth capacity and tolerance, biosurfactant production and enzymes detection were determined. A preliminary selection carried out through the analysis of capability for degrading hydrocarbons showed that 22% of the isolates were able to degrade all carbon sources employed. On the other hand, in 36% of the isolates, the degradation of the oily sludge started within 18–48 h. Those isolates were considered as the most efficient ones. Twenty isolates, identified based on partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, were pre-selected. These isolates showed ability for growing in a medium containing 1% of oily sludge as the sole carbon source, tolerance in a medium containing up to 30% of oily sludge, ability for biosurfactant production, and expression of enzymes involved in degradation of aliphatic and aromatic compounds. Five bacteria, identified as Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila BB5, Bacillus megaterium BB6, Bacillus cibi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus BS20 were shown to be promising for use as inoculum in bioremediation processes (bioaugmentation) of areas contaminated with petrochemical residues since they can use oily sludge as the sole carbon source and produce biosurfactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus megaterium 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStenotrophomonas 3aaromatic compounds 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3acarbon 3aeffluents 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahydrocarbons 3aindustry 3apolluted soils 3aribosomal RNA 3asampling 3asludge 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aHydrocarbonsxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSurface-Active Agentsxmetabolism1 aHollenbach, Emanuel B.1 aMaboni, Franciele1 aCamargo, Flávio A.

Given the abnormal lipid profile observed in VL patients, we examined the status of serum lipids in an experimental murine model of VL. The murine VL liver displayed altered expression of lipid metabolic genes, many of which are direct or indirect targets of the liver-specific microRNA-122. Concomitant reduction of miR-122 expression was observed in VL liver. High serum cholesterol caused resistance to L. donovani infection, while downregulation of miR-122 is coupled with low serum cholesterol in VL mice. Exosomes secreted by the infective parasites caused reduction in miR-122 activity in hepatic cells. Leishmania surface glycoprotein gp63, a Zn-metalloprotease, targets pre-miRNA processor Dicer1 to prevent miRNP formation in L. donovani-interacting hepatic cells. Conversely, restoration of miR-122 or Dicer1 levels in VL mouse liver increased serum cholesterol and reduced liver parasite burden.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania donovani 3aanimal models 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3aexosomes 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amice 3amicroRNA 3aparasites 3apatients 3aspleen 3avisceral leishmaniasis1 aBose, Mainak1 aRāẏa, Śyāmala,1 aBhattacharyya, Suvendra N.0 tCell host & microbe.g2013 Mar. 13, v. 13, no. 3 p.277-288dElsevier Inc.x1931-31287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2013.02.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245010200168300002000270520160400290592002801894650002201922650001101944650002001955650002901975650003802004650001102042650001402053650001702067650004202084650001902126650000902145650001502154650002502169650001402194650001302208650001502221650001302236650001102249700002202260700001902282700002402301773012402325856007402449852000902523655001202532IND60640420420221120102311.0190504e20160407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064042042DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra01802e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAitipamula, Srinivasulu10aNovel solid forms of oxaprozin: cocrystals and an extended release drug–drug salt of salbutamol  ap. 34110-34119.  aOxaprozin (OXP) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug mainly used to relieve the inflammation, swelling, and joint pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. OXP shows poor aqueous solubility (0.0325 mg mL⁻¹) that limits its bioavailability. The current study was aimed at identifying novel solid forms that could impact the physicochemical properties of OXP. Our solid form screening resulted in cocrystals with 4,4′-bipyridine and 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane and molecular salts with piperazine, 2-amino-3-picoline, and an antiasthmatic drug, salbutamol (SAL). Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction techniques were employed to characterize the salts and cocrystals, and stability of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts was evaluated by storing at accelerated test conditions and slurry and dynamic vapour sorption techniques. Evaluation of the solubility and dissolution rate of piperazine and SAL salts revealed a modest effect of salt formation on the physicochemical properties of the OXP. The OXP⁻–SAL⁺–H salt provides an alternative solution to the short half-life of existing SAL formulations, which need to be dosed frequently to maintain therapeutic plasma levels. The drug–drug salt dissolves much slower compared to SAL and could potentially be developed as controlled release formulations of SAL. In addition, the presence of OXP as an integral part of the molecular salt enables exploitation of the molecular salt as a novel composition for development of combination drug therapy for treating inflammation associated with asthma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aasthma 3abioavailability 3acombination drug therapy 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethane 3ahalf life 3ainflammation 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aosteoarthritis 3apain 3apiperazine 3arheumatoid arthritis 3ascreening 3aslurries 3asolubility 3asorption 3avapors1 aWong, Annie B.

W07201 (5 p.  a1 Geostatistics has become the dominant tool for probabilistic estimation of properties of heterogeneous formations at points where data are not available. Ordinary kriging, the starting point in the development of other geostatistical techniques, has a number of serious limitations, chief among which is the intrinsic hypothesis of the (second-order) stationarity of the underlying random field. Attempts to overcome this limitation have led to the development of ever more complex flavors of kriging. We pursue an opposite strategy that consists of finding the simplest possible technique that is adequate for the task of facies delineation. Guided by the principle of parsimony, we identify nearest-neighbor classification (NNC) as a viable alternative to geostatistics among deterministic techniques. We demonstrate that when used for the purpose of facies delineation, NNC, which has no fitting parameters and operational assumptions, outperforms indicator kriging, which has several parameters. 3ageostatistics 3akriging 3aprediction 0aliterature reviews 0afacies delineation 0anearest-neighbor classification1 aWohlberg, B.1 aGuadagnini, A.0 tWater resources research.g2007 July, v. 43, no. 7 p.W07201 (5 p-W07201 (5 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/02/14  aOther US 7aarticle03004naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245011900161300002100280520160100301650001201902650002901914650001601943650001201959650002401971650002201995650001602017650001902033650001802052650002402070650001402094650001502108650001702123650001502140650002002155651001202175653004302187700002002230700001602250700001702266700001502283700002002298773010002318852000902418930003302427945002502460946001302485655001202498IND4390392420221118122403.0070416e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439039242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFutter, M.N.10aModeling the mechanisms that control in-stream dissolved organic carbon dynamics in upland and forested catchments  ap. W02424 (16 p.  a1 We present a new, process-based model of soil and stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC): the Integrated Catchments Model for Carbon (INCA-C). INCA-C is the first model of DOC cycling to explicitly include effects of different land cover types, hydrological flow paths, in-soil carbon biogeochemistry, and surface water processes on in-stream DOC concentrations. It can be calibrated using only routinely available monitoring data. INCA-C simulates daily DOC concentrations over a period of years to decades. Sources, sinks, and transformation of solid and dissolved organic carbon in peat and forest soils, wetlands, and streams as well as organic carbon mineralization in stream waters are modeled. INCA-C is designed to be applied to natural and seminatural forested and peat-dominated catchments in boreal and temperate regions. Simulations at two forested catchments showed that seasonal and interannual patterns of DOC concentration could be modeled using climate-related parameters alone. A sensitivity analysis showed that model predictions were dependent on the mass of organic carbon in the soil and that in-soil process rates were dependent on soil moisture status. Sensitive rate coefficients in the model included those for organic carbon sorption and desorption and DOC mineralization in the soil. The model was also sensitive to the amount of litter fall. Our results show the importance of climate variability in controlling surface water DOC concentrations and suggest the need for further research on the mechanisms controlling production and consumption of DOC in soils. 3astreams 3adissolved organic carbon 3astream flow 3asolutes 3amathematical models 3ahydrologic models 3acalibration 3asoil nutrients 3asurface water 3aforested watersheds 3apeatlands 3apeat soils 3aforest soils 3asoil water 3abiogeochemistry 3aOntario 0aIntegrated Catchments Model for Carbon1 aButterfield, D.1 aCosby, B.J.1 aDillon, P.J.1 aWade, A.J.1 aWhitehead, P.G.0 tWater resources research.g2007 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.W02424 (16 p-W02424 (16 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080521b20080606c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/05/06  aOther US 7aarticle02612naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245009500162300002100257520144600278650001101724650002201735650002301757650001101780650001501791650002301806650002401829650002201853650002001875650001901895650001801914651001301932653003301945653001601978700001601994773010002010852000902110930003302119945002502152946001302177655001202190IND4390392620221118122358.0070416e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439039262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aClayton, J.A.10aSpatial and temporal variations in bed load transport intensity in a gravel bed river bend  ap. W02426 (13 p.  a1 Variability in bed load sediment transport is investigated for a bend of the Colorado River in Rocky Mountain National Park. Data from 190 bed load samples taken at 50 to 125% bankfull flow at a large number of locations throughout the reach indicate that the fine and coarse fractions of the load are differentially routed, such that fine grains are swept inward over the point bar, while coarse grains are routed outward toward the pool. At bankfull flow, all size fractions of the available sediment are transported throughout the bend, but the median grain size of the bed load increases with distance toward the outer bank. This differential routing decreases slightly with increasing discharge beyond bankfull, as indicated by a shift in the locus of coarse particle transport from the outside of the bend inward to the channel center. Furthermore, while fine sediments are fully mobile throughout the bend, partial mobility of the coarse fractions of the load transitions to full mobility toward the bend's outer region. These patterns are flow dependent; with increasing discharge the distribution of excess Shields stress becomes more uniform, resulting in reduced variability in bed load transport rates across the channel. These variations in transport intensity lead to a volumetric balance of transported sediment between the inner and outer regions of the channel, which thereby promotes the geomorphic stability of the bend. 3arivers 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3agravel 3awater flow 3asediment transport 3amathematical models 3ahydrologic models 3astream channels 3anational parks 3ageomorphology 3aColorado 0aRocky Mountain National Park 0ariver bends1 aPitlick, J.0 tWater resources research.g2007 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.W02426 (13 p-W02426 (13 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080521b20080606c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/05/06  aOther US 7aarticle02327naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245017000134300001400304500002400318520106600342650002601408650001701434650001101451650002501462650001601487650002301503650002101526650001001547651001301557651001701570700002401587700002501611700002101636700002401657700002301681700002201704773008301726852000901809856011101818655001201929IND4461923520221118122358.0111004s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446192352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrasier, Kathryn J.10aResidents' Perceptions of Community and Environmental Impacts From Development of Natural Gas in the Marcellus Shale: A Comparison of Pennsylvania and New York Cases  ap. 32-61.  aIncludes references  aCommunities experiencing rapid growth due to energy development ('boomtowns') have reported positive and negative impacts on community and individual well-being. The perceptions of impacts vary according to stage of energy development as well as experience with extractive industries. Development of the Marcellus Shale provides an opportunity to examine these impacts over time and across geographic and historical contexts. This paper describes case study research in Pennsylvania and New York to document preliminary impacts of development occurring there. Cases vary by level of development and previous extractive history. The study finds that, in areas with low population density, higher levels of development lead to a broader awareness of natural gas impacts, both positive and negative.

W01416 (13 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 A fully coupled, integrated surface water/groundwater model was used to study hydrologic controls on lake-groundwater interaction in the subhumid, Boreal Plains of northern Alberta, Canada. Findings from a previous water budget study indicate that lakes on the outwash landscape capture groundwater as a major source of water input and function as evaporation windows. Transient hydrologic responses of a flow-through style lake and outwash groundwater flow system were simulated for a three-dimensional model. Hydraulic heads, surface water depth, and the corresponding exchange fluxes between the surface and the subsurface were all simulated simultaneously and compared to field observations for the summers of 2002 and 2003. Replication of the transient flow regime required an anisotropy ratio of 10:1 for the outwash deposits and inclusion of riparian peatlands, which control lake-groundwater interaction and maintain surface water on permeable northern landscapes. Spatially and temporally variable evapotranspiration governed the water table configuration and lake-groundwater seepage patterns. 3atemporal variation 3aestimation 3asimulation models 3aevapotranspiration 3athroughfall 3alakes 3aspatial distribution 3asediment deposition 3aseepage 3apeatlands 3asubhumid zones 3asummer 3ariparian areas 3aspatial variation 3asurface water 3agroundwater 3asubsurface flow 3ahydrologic models 3aAlberta 0awater flow1 aMendoza, C.A.1 aDevito, K.J.0 tWater resources research.g2007 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.W01416 (13 p-W01416 (13 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/13  aOther US 7aarticle03082naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100002300178245013500201300002100336500001500357520160700372650001501979650002301994650001002017650001102027650001502038650002102053650003502074650002102109650001502130650000902145650001402154650002002168650001902188650001102207650002302218650001102241650002202252651001302274653002602287653001102313653001802324700001802342773010002360852000902460930003302469945002502502946001302527655001202540IND4390390420221118122440.0070416e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439039042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJayawickreme, D.H.10aEvaluating the influence of land cover on seasonal water budgets using Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) rainfall and streamflow data  ap. W02408 (11 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 Accurate estimates of fluxes between different components of the hydrosphere are needed for water resources management at the watershed scale. Runoff and evapotranspiration are critical fluxes that are heavily influenced by land cover characteristics; however, our understanding of the interactions between land cover attributes and these fluid fluxes is generally limited by inadequate regional data to capture variations in both climatic conditions and landscape characteristics. This limitation is largely avoided by integrating data from Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) precipitation systems with widely available streamflow, land cover, and other Geographic Information System data sets. Such data integration facilitates development of rapid and reliable methods for estimating hydrologic fluxes at desirable temporal and spatial scales. In this study, we calculate ratios of streamflow to NEXRAD rainfall over the peak growing season for 40 watersheds across Michigan and use these to evaluate the landscape factors that influence groundwater recharge rates. Results indicate that ratios of streamflow and baseflow to rainfall are strongly influenced by land cover attributes. Stream baseflow analyses indicate that approximately 5% of the July to September rainfall becomes recharge in high-intensity agriculture (>70%) watersheds compared to 15% in moderate-intensity agriculture (<50%) watersheds across our study region during the same period. A strong negative correlation was also found between intensive agriculture and the streamflow:rainfall ratio during summer and early fall periods. 3aestimation 3aevapotranspiration 3aradar 3aautumn 3alandscapes 3awater management 3ageographic information systems 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds 3arain 3abase flow 3atemperate zones 3aremote sensing 3asummer 3aseasonal variation 3arunoff 3ahydrologic models 3aMichigan 0aNext Generation Radar 0aNEXRAD 0awater balance1 aHyndman, D.W.0 tWater resources research.g2007 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.W02408 (11 p-W02408 (11 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080521b20080606c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/04/24  aOther US 7aarticle02010naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245011500143300002100258520102400279650000901303650001501312650002001327650001601347650001601363650001601379650000901395650001501404651001601419700001701435700001601452773010001468852000901568930003301577945002501610946001301635655001201648IND4390389520221118122427.0070416e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439038952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W01420 (23 p.  a1 Extensive data recorded from storm systems passing over the well-instrumented 21.4 km2 Goodwin Creek watershed in northern Mississippi are used to highlight uncertainties associated with the measurement of surface rainfall, focusing on data quality control, gauge calibration, out-of-level gauge orifices, and wind effects on rain gauge catch. Assessment of the wind effect on gauge catch is central to the presented analyses, including an in-depth evaluation of a recent technique for estimating the rainfall undercatch by means of wind and raindrop size information. Our findings emphasize that quantification of the wind effect on rain gauge catch is difficult because of uncertainties associated with measuring rainfall, drop size distribution, and the wind at gauge rim height. On the basis of our evaluation the sophisticated wind effect correction technique that makes use of raindrop size and wind information is much less effective than traditional methods based on rainfall rate and wind observations alone. 3arain 3awatersheds 3aquality control 3ameasurement 3acalibration 3arain gauges 3awind 3aestimation 3aMississippi1 aBurges, S.J.1 aSteiner, M.0 tWater resources research.g2007 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.W01420 (23 p-W01420 (23 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/13  aOther US 7aarticle03054naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001500178245011100193300002100304500001500325520159500340650002301935650001401958650001101972650001501983650001801998650000902016650002102025650001502046650001602061650001402077650002402091650001502115650002202130650001902152650002502171650002502196650001502221653002402236700001802260700001302278700002502291700001602316773010002332852000902432930003302441945002502474946001302499655001202512IND4398130020221118123050.0071121e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439813002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W06404 (17 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 In this paper we extend previous mathematical results on the probabilistic modeling of base flows driven by spatial and temporal fluctuations of soil moisture and affected by intermittent rainfall forcings and by heterogeneous transport, soil, and vegetation properties. Rainfall is modeled as a zero-dimensional marked Poisson process with exponentially distributed intensity, and various descriptors of spatial heterogeneity are used. The master equation for the probability distribution (pdf) of the base flow (here epitomized by the mean daily flow rate in suitably sized catchments) and its moment-generating function are derived by coupling soil moisture balances with a traveltime formulation of transport. Exact solutions for the flow moments are derived in the following cases: (1) two tributary areas in parallel, (2) the rigorous extension to N subbasins, and (3) a simplified geomorphic arrangement of subbasins. Base flow statistics obtained by naive spatial averages of heterogeneous properties exhibit the same mean of the exact solution but may significantly overestimate higher-order moments. Relatively wet climate conditions seem to enhance the effects of the heterogeneity of soil, vegetation, transport, and geomorphic properties, particularly for low-stage flow regimes. The probabilistic structure of the base flow is explicitly linked to relevant climatic and geomorphologic features in addition to the spatial distribution of soil and vegetation properties, with possible ecohydrological implications on long-term water and nutrient mass balances in river basins. 3atemporal variation 3alimnology 3arivers 3astormwater 3ageomorphology 3aflow 3aclimatic factors 3awatersheds 3ariver water 3abase flow 3awatershed hydrology 3asoil water 3aspatial variation 3arain intensity 3astochastic processes 3aprobabilistic models 3avegetation 0amathematical models1 aPorporato, A.1 aDaly, E.1 aRodriguez-Iturbe, I.1 aRinaldo, A.0 tWater resources research.g2007 June, v. 43, no. 6 p.W06404 (17 p-W06404 (17 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDd6CTe2008/03/30  aOther US 7aarticle02767naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245011600176300002100292500001500313520151800328650001501846650002201861650001601883650003901899650001401938650001501952650002101967650001701988650002102005650002002026650002202046650001502068653003002083653001302113700001502126773010002141852000902241930003302250945002502283946001302308655001202321IND4397537620221118123112.0071105e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439753762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aIden, S.C.10aFree-form estimation of the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties by inverse modeling using global optimization  ap. W07451 (12 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 Inverse modeling is a powerful technique for identifying the hydraulic properties of unsaturated porous media. However, the selection of an appropriate parameterization of the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity function remains a challenge. In this article, we present an improved algorithm for estimating these two relationships without assigning an a priori shape to them. The approach uses cubic Hermite interpolation and a global optimization strategy. A multilevel routine identifies the adequate number of degrees of freedom by balancing model performance, the statistical interaction of the estimated model parameters, and their number. A first-order uncertainty analysis provides a quantitative measure of how well the soil hydraulic properties can be identified in different ranges of pressure head. This offers great potential for designing optimal experimental procedures for identifying the hydraulic properties of porous media. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for the evaluation of multistep outflow experiments by investigating synthetic data sets and real measurements. The free-form approach yields optimal model parameters that show only moderate correlation, indicating well-posed inverse problems. Since parameterization errors are almost completely avoided, the algorithm is well suited to identifying other error sources in unsaturated flow problems, e.g., limitations in the applicability of the Richards equation or problems caused by spatial heterogeneity. 3aestimation 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity 3aequations 3aalgorithms 3amodel validation 3aporous media 3aunsaturated flow 3asubsurface flow 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 0asoil hydraulic properties 0aoutflows1 aDurner, W.0 tWater resources research.g2007 July, v. 43, no. 7 p.W07451 (12 p-W07451 (12 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle02643naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245014300175300002100318500001500339520136000354650001801714650002601732650001501758650002201773650002501795650001501820650000901835650001901844650002501863650001101888650002501899650002201924651001201946653001401958653001101972700002201983773010002005852000902105930003302114945002502147946001302172655001202185IND4398130620221118122956.0071121e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439813062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W06410 (15 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 The probabilistic nature of rainfall and surface runoff events forms the basis of hydrologic design. Two defining characteristics of rainfall events, average intensity and duration, are selected to construct the probabilistic structure of storms using Gumbel's bivariate exponential distribution. This bivariate stochastic rainfall model is then utilized to derive the probabilistic structure of surface runoff using the Soil Conservation Service rainfall runoff model. The zero-runoff probability, mean, and standard deviation of rainfall excess are evaluated. Copulas serve as an alternative way to derive zero-runoff probability. The results indicate that the dependence between average intensity and duration has a significant effect on statistical properties of rainfall excess. The advantage of using copulas for complicated multivariate stochastic models is demonstrated. The proposed model is associated with land use and soil type information from the geographic information system to produce maps of statistical properties of rainfall excess. A case study of model application is performed for the state of Indiana, United States. Results show that while the mean and standard deviation of rainfall excess increase with curve number, these quantities are very sensitive to the dependence between average intensity and duration of storm events. 3aoverland flow 3astormwater management 3astormwater 3arainfall duration 3aprobability analysis 3asoil types 3arain 3arain intensity 3astochastic processes 3astorms 3aprobabilistic models 3ahydrologic models 3aIndiana 0ahydrology 0arunoff1 aGovindaraju, R.S.0 tWater resources research.g2007 June, v. 43, no. 6 p.W06410 (15 p-W06410 (15 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDd6CTe2008/04/05  aOther US 7aarticle02729naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245009600161300002100257500001500278520154300293650002201836650002301858650002001881650001901901650001001920650001001930650002101940650002201961650000901983650002401992650001502016651001502031653001502046700001302061700001502074700001402089773010002103852000902203930003302212945002502245946001302270655001202283IND4397533520221118123001.0071105e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439753352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCantelli, A.10aNumerical model linking bed and bank evolution of incisional channel created by dam removal  ap. W07436 (16 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 This paper is devoted to a morphodynamic model of incision into a reservoir deposit driven by partial or total removal of the associated dam. The model considers the erosional processes upstream of the position of the former dam, rather then the deposition that occurs downstream. A theory is developed to predict the evolution of both the width and depth of the incisional channel that develops as erosion progresses. The theory is implemented in a numerical model, which is tested against and verified with flume experiments on sudden, complete removal of a dam. In these experiments a channel of a given initial width is allowed to freely incise into a noncohesive reservoir deposit after sudden dam removal. These experiments show a phenomenon that we refer to as "erosional narrowing." That is, as a channel of a given initial width rapidly incises into the deposit, it can become narrower. As the rate of incision slows, this short period of rapid narrowing is followed by a longer period of widening. In the model the incisional channel is abstracted to a trapezoidal channel with well-defined bed and bank regions, both of which are allowed to erode. Balance between bed and bank erosion plays a key role in the morphodynamics of the channel. More specifically, rapid erosion of the bed can cause the channel to narrow even as bank erosion progresses. As the rate of bed erosion slows, bank erosion causes channel widening. This observed pattern is explained in the context of a theoretical model tested against the experiments. 3asimulation models 3asediment transport 3astream channels 3achannelization 3adepth 3awidth 3adams (hydrology) 3ahydrologic models 3asilt 3asediment deposition 3aprediction 3aCalifornia 0areservoirs1 aWong, M.1 aParker, G.1 aPaola, C.0 tWater resources research.g2007 July, v. 43, no. 7 p.W07436 (16 p-W07436 (16 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle02079naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001900161245008900180300002100269520094800290650002501238650002201263650001201285650001601297650001101313650001301324650001301337650002201350650001501372650001701387650001801404651001201422653002701434700001601461773010001477852000901577930003301586945002501619946001301644655001201657IND4397532920221118123034.0071105e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439753292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWhitaker, A.C.10aAnalysis of flow competence in an alluvial gravel bed stream, Dupuyer Creek, Montana  ap. W07433 (16 p.  a1 Critical shear stress and unit discharge flow competence models were tested against coarse bed load data from Dupuyer Creek, Montana, United States. Maximum particle sizes sampled (D(max)) and D50 to D90 percentiles in the bed load grain size distribution were well correlated with both shear stress and unit discharge. Bed load grain sizes became coarser with increasing flow strength. For the D(max) curve, Shields dimensionless parameter for the surface D50 was estimated at 0.044, and the exponent for relative particle size (D(i)/D50) was -0.59. In the unit discharge criterion the critical flow to entrain the surface D50 was poorly predicted. Flow competence relationships based on D(max) are prone to the influence of outliers and sample mass variability. The mean of the three largest particles, D(max) (3), is more sensitive to changes in flow strength than the D50 to D90 bed load grain sizes, and may represent a good compromise. 3astochastic processes 3ahydrologic models 3astreams 3astream flow 3agravel 3avariance 3aalluvium 3asimulation models 3aprediction 3ashear stress 3aparticle size 3aMontana 0aflow competence models1 aPotts, D.F.0 tWater resources research.g2007 July, v. 43, no. 7 p.W07433 (16 p-W07433 (16 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle02262naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002200144245006700166300002100233500001500254520111900269650001701388650001501405650001601420650002201436650002101458650001901479650002101498650002501519650001501544651001501559653001701574653003201591653002201623700001501645773010001660852000901760930003301769945002501802946001301827655001201840IND4384361920221118122821.0061013e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438436192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W08403 (10 p.  a2019-12-05  aWater managers are turning increasingly to market solutions to meet new environmental demands for water in fully allocated systems. This paper presents a three-stage probabilistic optimization model that identifies least cost strategies for staged seasonal water purchases for an environmental water acquisition program given hydrologic, operational, and biological uncertainties. Multistage linear programming is used to minimize the expected cost of long-term, spot, and option water purchases used to meet uncertain environmental demands. Results prescribe the location, timing, and type of optimal water purchases and illustrate how least cost strategies change as information becomes available during the year.

W10402 (12 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 From imaging spectrometer data, we simultaneously estimate the abundance of the three phases of water in an environment that includes melting snow, basing the analysis on the spectral shift in the absorption coefficient between water vapor, liquid water, and ice at 940, 980, and 1030 nm respectively. We apply a spectral fitting algorithm that measures the expressed abundance of the three phases of water to a data set acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Mount Rainier, Washington, on 14 June 1996. Precipitable water vapor varies from 1 mm over the summit of Mount Rainier to 10 mm over the lower valleys to the northwest. Equivalent path absorption of liquid water varies from 0 to 13 mm, with the zero values over rocky areas and high-elevation snow and the high values associated with liquid water held in vegetation canopies and in melting snow. Ice abundance varies from 0 to 30 mm equivalent path absorption in the snow- and glacier-covered portions of Mount Rainier. The water and ice abundances are related to the amount of liquid water and the sizes of the ice grains in the near-surface layer. Precision of the estimates, calculated over locally homogeneous areas, indicates an uncertainty of better than 1.5% for all three phases, except for liquid water in vegetation, where an optimally homogeneous site was not found. The analysis supports new strategies for hydrological research and applications as imaging spectrometers become more available. 3atemporal variation 3aestimation 3acanopy 3awater vapor 3aabsorption 3aspectrometers 3aspatial distribution 3aglaciers 3awater 3aspatial variation 3aice 3aaltitude 3ameasurement 3aalgorithms 3asnowmelt 0aWashington1 aPainter, T.H.1 aRoberts, D.A.1 aDozier, J.0 tWater resources research.g2006 Oct., v. 42, no. 10 p.W10402 (12 p-W10402 (12 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/14  aOther US 7aarticle02691naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001800178245013400196300002000330500001500350520133200365650002301697650002401720650002301744650001401767650002101781650001501802650002501817650001201842650002201854650001101876650001501887653001801902653001801920700001701938700001601955700001601971700001701987700001402004773009902018852000902117930003302126945002502159946001302184655001202197IND4387578620221118122856.0070205e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438757862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W10403 (8 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 Since its launch in March 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission has been measuring the global time variations of the Earth's gravity field with a current resolution of approximately 500 km. Especially over the continents, these measurements represent the integrated land water mass, including surface waters (lakes, wetlands and rivers), soil moisture, groundwater, and snow cover. In this study, we use the GRACE land water solutions computed by Ramillien et al. (2005a) through an iterative inversion of monthly geoids from April 2002 to May 2004 to estimate time series of basin-scale regional evapotranspiration rate and associated uncertainties. Evapotranspiration is determined by integrating and solving the water mass balance equation, which relates land water storage (from GRACE), precipitation data (from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre), runoff (from a global land surface model), and evapotranspiration (the unknown). We further examine the sensibility of the computation when using different model runoff. Evapotranspiration results are compared to outputs of four different global land surface models. The overall satisfactory agreement between GRACE-derived and model-based evapotranspiration prove the ability of GRACE to provide realistic estimates of this parameter. 3atemporal variation 3amathematical models 3aevapotranspiration 3aequations 3amodel validation 3awatersheds 3atime series analysis 3agravity 3ahydrologic models 3arunoff 3asatellites 0aprecipitation 0awater balance1 aFrappart, F.1 aGuntner, A.1 aNgo-Duc, T.1 aCazenave, A.1 aLaval, K.0 tWater resources research.g2006 Oct., v. 42, no. 10 p.W10403 (8 p-W10403 (8 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/14  aOther US 7aarticle03137naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245016500179300002100344500001500365520189300380650001502273650001602288650001402304650001302318650001202331650002202343650001602365650002202381650001502403651001302418653002302431653001602454653003602470700001702506773010002523852000902623930003302632945002502665946001302690655001202703IND4384359820221118122846.0061013e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438435982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWellman, T.P.10aEvaluating uncertainty in predicting spatially variable representative elementary scales in fractured aquifers, with application to Turkey Creek Basin, Colorado  ap. W08410 (21 p.  a2019-12-05  aComputational limitations and sparse field data often mandate use of continuum representation for modeling hydrologic processes in large-scale fractured aquifers. Selecting appropriate element size is of primary importance because continuum approximation is not valid for all scales. The traditional approach is to select elements by identifying a single representative elementary scale (RES) for the region of interest. Recent advances indicate RES may be spatially variable, prompting unanswered questions regarding the ability of sparse data to spatially resolve continuum equivalents in fractured aquifers. We address this uncertainty of estimating RES using two techniques. In one technique we employ data-conditioned realizations generated by sequential Gaussian simulation. For the other we develop a new approach using conditioned random walks and nonparametric bootstrapping (CRWN). We evaluate the effectiveness of each method under three fracture densities, three data sets, and two groups of RES analysis parameters. In sum, 18 separate RES analyses are evaluated, which indicate RES magnitudes may be reasonably bounded using uncertainty analysis, even for limited data sets and complex fracture structure. In addition, we conduct a field study to estimate RES magnitudes and resulting uncertainty for Turkey Creek Basin, a crystalline fractured rock aquifer located 30 km southwest of Denver, Colorado. Analyses indicate RES does not correlate to rock type or local relief in several instances but is generally lower within incised creek valleys and higher along mountain fronts. Results of this study suggest that (1) CRWN is an effective and computationally efficient method to estimate uncertainty, (2) RES predictions are well constrained using uncertainty analysis, and (3) for aquifers such as Turkey Creek Basin, spatial variability of RES is significant and complex. 3aestimation 3auncertainty 3amountains 3aaquifers 3astreams 3aspatial variation 3ameasurement 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 3aColorado 0afractured aquifers 0amethodology 0arepresentative elementary scale1 aPoeter, E.P.0 tWater resources research.g2006 Aug., v. 42, no. 8 p.W08410 (21 p-W08410 (21 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle02691naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001100144245012900155300002100284520154700305650002201852650001601874650002101890650001401911650001701925650002801942650001701970650001301987653002002000653002302020653003502043700001802078700001702096773010002113852000902213930003302222945002502255946001302280655001202293IND4384359020221118122907.0061013e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438435902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMa, J.12aA mixed finite element technique based on implicit discretization of faults for permeability upscaling in fault damage zones  ap. W08413 (12 p.  aNatural fault damage zones (FDZs) are often composed of complex arrays containing many thin faults. To account for FDZs in large-scale models, it is necessary to represent the flow effects of these many small faults by some form of upscaling. The explicit discretization of the geometry and topology of these thin faults and of the rock matrix typically leads to meshes comprising large numbers of elements, making it difficult to solve the flow equations efficiently. This paper proposes a practical technique based on the mixed finite element method (MFEM), permitting the permeability upscaling in two-dimensional fault damage zones that contain thin and isotropic low-permeability faults. This technique utilizes an implicit discretization scheme that is similar in principle to those used for discrete fracture networks. The scheme described here treats flow across faults accurately, but, unlike the schemes used for fractures, it neglects the flow along the faults because intrafault volumetric flow in thin faults is very small. This approach allows for a simpler numerical discretization and a reduction in numerical calculation effort. The scheme can be readily implemented in a standard mixed finite element code. Compared with the same MFEM based on an explicit discretization scheme, the two techniques are shown to produce results that agree closely. The implicit technique is shown to be more efficient than the explicit technique for a typical fault damage zone model. This technique is readily extendable to three dimensions. 3ahydrologic models 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aequations 3apermeability 3afinite element analysis 3ahydrogeology 3atopology 0ageologic faults 0afault damage zones 0amixed finite element technique1 aCouples, G.D.1 aHarris, S.D.0 tWater resources research.g2006 Aug., v. 42, no. 8 p.W08413 (12 p-W08413 (12 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle01923naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245005100144300002000195500001500215520082200230650002301052650002201075650001101097650002001108650001101128650001201139650001701151650002101168650001101189650002201200650001501222651001001237651002201247651001101269653001801280653001301298773009801311852000901409930003301418945002501451946001301476655001201489IND4390385120221118123150.0070416e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439038512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W01202 (6 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 Long memory is a hydrological property that can lead to prolonged droughts or the temporal clustering of extreme floods in a river. Analyses of 28 long (up to 145 years), continuous instrumental runoff series from six European, American, and African rivers reveal that this effect increases downstream. Simulations reproduce the increase qualitatively and show that a river network aggregates short-memory precipitation and converts it into long-memory runoff. In view of projected changes in climate and the hydrological cycle, these findings show that decadal-scale variations in drought or flood risk can be predicted for individual rivers, with higher predictability downstream. Spatial aggregation may also explain the emergence of long memory in other networks, such as the brain or those formed by computers. 3atemporal variation 3asimulation models 3arivers 3ahydrologic data 3afloods 3adrought 3aspatial data 3ahydrologic cycle 3arunoff 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 3aEgypt 3aMississippi River 3aEurope 0aprecipitation 0anetworks0 tWater resources research.g2007 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.W01202 (6 p-W01202 (6 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/12  aOther US 7aarticle02053naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001200144245011100156300002000267500001500287520090400302650001501206650002401221650001101245650002401256650001201280650001401292650001301306650001701319650002201336650001501358651003101373653001601404653001501420700001801435773009801453852000901551930003301560945002501593946001301618655001201631IND4390385020221118124005.0070416e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439038502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W01201 (8 p.  a2019-12-05  a1 Base flow recession information is helpful for regional estimation of low-flow characteristics. However, analyses that exploit such information generally require a continuous record of streamflow at the estimation site to characterize base flow recession. Here we propose a simple method for characterizing base flow recession at low-flow partial record stream gauges (i.e., sites with very few streamflow measurements under low-streamflow conditions), and we use that characterization as the basis for a practical new approach to low-flow regression. In a case study the introduction of a base flow recession time constant, estimated from a single pair of strategically timed streamflow measurements, approximately halves the root-mean-square estimation error relative to that of a conventional drainage area regression.

We constructed S. pombe mutants lacking neutral trehalase activity by gene replacement at the newly defined ntp1+ locus. Analysis of these mutants revealed that a twofold increase in trehalose accumulation enhanced acquired thermoresistance, and marked salt tolerance characterized their ability to grow in liquid and solid media. Analysis of the expression of the trehalase gene under heat shock and osmotic upshift revealed the transcriptional activation of ntp1+ in response to both stresses. 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3atrehalase 3amutants 3aenzyme activity 3asalinity 3atrehalose 3acytochemistry 3aheat stress 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3agene expression 3amutagenesis 2aCulture Media 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aHot Temperature 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aRNA, Fungalxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSchizosaccharomycesxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aTrehalasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrehalosexmetabolism 0astress 0aprotection1 aSoto, T.1 aFernandez, J.1 aVicente-Soler, J.1 aGacto, M.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 Mar., v. 180, no. 5 p.1342-1345x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02396naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010700123300001800230520111300248650001601361650002201377650002401399650002501423650002501448650001801473650002001491650002001511650001201531650002801543650002901571650003501600650002701635653001201662653004101674653002801715653002001743700001901763700001601782773008401798852000901882930003301891945001301924946001301937655001201950IND2180701520221118124001.0981028e199803  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218070152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehm, J.10aProduction of 1-ketose in transgenic yeast expressing a fructosyltransferase from Aspergillus foetidus  ap. 1305-1310.  aSucrose-inducible secretory sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST) from Aspergillus foetidus has been purified and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence determination. The enzyme is extensively glycosylated, and the active form is probably represented by a dimer of identical subunits with an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa as judged from mobility in seminative acrylamide gels. The enzyme catalyzes fructosyl transfer from sucrose to sucrose producing glucose and 1-kestose. Oligosaccharides with a higher degree of polymerization are not obtained with sucrose as the substrate. The cDNA encoding the A. foetidus 1-SST has been cloned and sequenced. Sequence homology was found to be highest to levanases, but no hydrolytic activity was observed when levan was incubated with the enzyme. Expression of the cloned gene in an invertase-deficient mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in 1-kestose production, with 6-kestose and neokestose being side products of the reaction. Products were well distinguishable from those formed by yeast transformants expressing a cytosolic invertase. 3aAspergillus 3acomplementary DNA 3ahexosyltransferases 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene transfer 3agene expression 3aenzyme activity 3akestose 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenetic transformation 0acloning 0asucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/aj004931 aWillmitzer, L.1 aHeyer, A.G.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 Mar., v. 180, no. 5 p.1305-1310x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03883naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245020500165300001800370520125200388650002901640650001501669650001801684650001801702650001201720650001201732650001601744650001101760650001201771650002401783650002001807650001701827650002501844650002001869650001301889650001401902650002201916650002801938650002801966650003801994650002302032650002302055650004102078650005302119650004202172650002002214650003602234650002502270650003002295650002402325650005002349650003402399650001302433650003002446650002602476650002702502650005202529650003802581650002202619650001702641653001402658653001402672653001202686653002902698700001802727700001802745700001702763700001702780700001702797700001402814700002202828700001502850773008402865852000902949930003302958945001302991946001303004655001203017IND2180806920221118124032.0981104e199803  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218080692DNAL7 a95159082pmid7 aPMC1070392pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRam, A.F.J.10aLoss of the plasma membrane-bound protein Gas1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in the release of beta 1,3-glucan into the medium and induces a compensation mechanism to ensure cell wall integrity  ap. 1418-1424.  aDeletion of GASI/GGPI/CWH52 results in a lower beta-glucan content of the cell wall and swollen, more spherical cells (L. Popolo, M. Vai, E. Gatti. S. Porello, P. Bonfante, R. Balestrini, and L. Alberghina, J. Bacteriol. 175:1879-1885, 1993; A. F. J. Ram, S. S. C. Brekelmans, L. J. W. M. Oehlen, and F.M. Klis, FEBS Lett. 358:165-170, 1995). We show here that gas 1 delta cells release beta 1,3-glucan into the medium. Western analysis of the medium proteins with beta 1,3-glucan- and beta 1,6-glucan-specific antibodies showed further that at least some of the released beta 1,3-glucan was linked to protein as part of a beta 1,3-glucan-beta 1,6-glucan-protein complex. These data indicate that Gas1p might play a role in the retention of beta 1,3-glucan and/or beta-glucosylated proteins. Interestingly, the defective incorporation of beta 1,3-glucan in the cell wall was accompanied by an increase in chitin and mannan content in the cell wall, an enhanced expression of cell wall protein 1 (Cwp1p), and an increase in beta 1,3-glucan synthase activity, probably caused by the induced expression of Fks2p. It is proposed that the cell wall weakening caused by the loss of Gas1p induces a set of compensatory reactions to ensure cell integrity. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acell walls 3aglycoproteins 3acytochemistry 3aglucose 3amannose 3aglucosamine 3achitin 3amannans 3ahexosyltransferases 3aenzyme activity 3abeta-glucans 3acell wall components 3aplasma membrane 3amutation 3aphenotype 2aBlotting, Western 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aCell Wallxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChitinxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCulture Media, Conditionedxanalysis 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFungal Proteinsxanalysisxsecretion. 2aGene Expression 2aGlucansximmunologyxsecretion. 2aGlucosyltransferases 2aGlycoproteinsxsecretion. 2aMannansxmetabolism 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlasmids 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Fungalxanalysis 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Deletion 2abeta-Glucans 0adeletions 0astructure 0arelease 0abeta-1,3-glucan synthase1 aKapteyn, J.C.1 aMontijn, R.C.1 aCaro, L.H.P.1 aDouwes, J.E.1 aBaginsky, W.1 aMazur, P.1 aEnde, H. van den.1 aKlis, F.M.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 Mar., v. 180, no. 6 p.1418-1424x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04018naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245012200163300001600285500001500301520162600316650002001942650002101962650002401983650002502007650002502032650001202057650002302069650002502092650004602117650002002163650001702183650006202200650002402262650002302286650001802309650006302327650002302390650003802413650001902451650003302470650002002503650002102523650003902544650002802583650006302611650002102674650005702695650002702752650003402779653001702813653001202830653003002842653002502872653003502897653002802932653001902960653002302979700002103002700001403023700001503037700001503052700001503067700001603082773008203098852000903180930003303189945001303222946001303235655001203248IND2137960220221118124118.0980803e199802  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213796022DNAL7 a94578702pmid7 aPMC1069342pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBekal, S.10aPurification of Leuconostoc mesenteroides citrate lyase and cloning and characterization of the citCDEFG gene cluster  ap. 647-654.  a2019-12-05  aA citrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.6) was purified 25-fold from Leuconostoc mesenteroides and was shown to contain three subunits. The first 42 amino acids of the beta subunit were identified, as well as an internal peptide sequence spanning some 20 amino acids into the beta subunit. Using degenerated primers from these sequences, we amplified a 1.2-kb DNA fragment by PCR from Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris. This fragment was used as a probe for screening a Leuconostoc genomic bank to identify the structural genes. The 2.7-kb gene cluster encoding citrate lyase of L. mesenteroides is organized in three open reading frames, citD, citE, and citF, encoding, respectively, the three citrate lyase subunits gamma (acyl carrier protein [ACP]), beta (citryl-S-ACP lyase; EC 4.1.3.34), and alpha (citrate:acetyl-ACP transferase; EC 2.8.3.10). The gene (citC) encoding the citrate lyase ligase (EC 6.2.1.22) was localized in the region upstream of citD. Protein comparisons show similarities with the citrate lyase ligase and citrate lyase of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Downstream of the citrate lyase cluster, a 1.4-kb open reading frame encoding a 52-kDa protein was found. The deduced protein is similar to CitG of the other bacteria, and its function remains unknown. Expression of the citCDEFG gene cluster in Escherichia coli led to the detection of a citrate lyase activity only in the presence of acetyl coenzyme A, which is a structural analog of the prosthetic group. This shows that the acetyl-ACP group of the citrate lyase form in E. coli is not complete or not linked to the protein. 3aoxo-acid-lyases 3astructural genes 3arestriction mapping 3aacyl carrier protein 3aamino acid sequences 3aligases 3abacterial proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris 3aenzyme activity 3atransferases 2aAcyl Carrier Proteinxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbon-Sulfur Ligasesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCoenzyme A-Transferasesxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aLeuconostocxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultienzyme Complexesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMultigene Family 2aOxo-Acid-Lyasesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0apurification 0acloning 0aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 0acitrate lyase ligase 0acitrate:acetyl-acp transferase 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u10621 0acitryl-s-acp lyase1 aBeeumen, J. van.1 aSamyn, B.1 aGarmyn, D.1 aHenini, S.1 aDivies, C.1 aPrevost, H.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 Feb., v. 180, no. 3 p.647-654x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02902naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009600125300001800221500001500239520154500254650002801799650002201827650002101849650001301870650002501883650001701908650001301925650002501938650002401963650000701987650002501994650002002019650001202039650002902051653001602080653002802096653001802124653001402142653001502156653001502171653003102186700001402217700001302231773008402244852000902328930003302337945001302370946001302383655001202396IND2195906020221118124204.0981209e199804  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219590602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNilsen, T.13aAn exported induced peptide regulates bacteriocin production in Enterococcus faecium CTC492  ap. 1848-1854.  a2019-12-05  aProduction of the bacteriocins enterocin A and enterocin B in Enterococcus faecium CTC492 was dependent on the presence of an extracellular peptide produced by the strain itself. This induction factor (EntF) was purified, and amino acid sequencing combined with DNA sequencing of the corresponding gene identified it as a peptide of 25 amino acids. The gene encodes a prepeptide of 41 amino acids, including a 16-amino-acid leader peptide of the double-glycine type. Environmental factors influenced the level of bacteriocin production in E. faecium CTC492. The optimal pH for bacteriocin production was 6.2. At pH 5.5, growth was slow, and very little bacteriocin was formed. The presence of NaCl or ethanol (EtOH) was also inhibitory to bacteriocin production, and at high concentrations of these solutes, no bacteriocin production was observed. The induction factor induced its own synthesis, and by dilution of the culture 10(6) times or more, nonproducing cultures were obtained. Bacteriocin production was induced in these cultures by addition of EntF. The response was linear, and low bacteriocin production could be induced by about 10(-17) M EntF. The response was attenuated by low pH or the presence of high concentrations of NaCl or EtOH, and 300 times more EntF was needed to induce detectable bacteriocin production in the presence of 6.5% NaCl. High levels of bacteriocin production in cultures grown at low pH or in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl or EtOH were obtained by addition of sufficient amounts of EntF. 3aPediococcus pentosaceus 3aprotein synthesis 3astructural genes 3asalinity 3aEnterococcus faecium 3abacteriocins 3apeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3aLactobacillus sakei 3apH 3anucleotide sequences 3asodium chloride 3aethanol 3aantibacterial properties 0aPediococcus 0amolecular sequence data 0aLactobacillus 0aentf gene 0aprecursors 0aregulation 0aenterocin induction factor1 aNes, I.F.1 aHolo, H.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 Apr., v. 180, no. 7 p.1848-1854x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03830naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245015300167300001800320500001500338520150600353650003101859650002701890650001801917650002001935650002501955650003001980650002502010650002002035650002502055650002202080650002002102650002102122650002402143650002302167650001202190650004002202650004402242650002002286650002502306650004902331650002802380650003102408650005402439650004802493650003002541650006002571650003302631650006602664650002702730650002302757650003402780650003402814650002402848653003202872653001802904700001502922700001502937700001602952773008402968852000903052930003303061945001303094946001303107655001203120IND2180807020221118124151.0981104e199803  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218080702DNAL7 a95159102pmid7 aPMC1070412pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindeberg, M.10aExternal loops at the C terminus of Erwinia chrysanthemi pectate lyase C are required for species-specific secretion through the out type II pathway  ap. 1431-1437.  a2019-12-05  aThe type II secretion system (main terminal branch of the general secretion pathway) is used by diverse gram-negative bacteria to secrete extracellular proteins. Proteins secreted by this pathway are synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide which is removed upon translocation across the inner membrane, but the signals which target the mature proteins for secretion across the outer membrane are unknown. The plant pathogens Erwinia chrysanthemi and Erwinia carotovora secrete several isozymes of pectate lyase (Pel) by the out-encoded type II pathway. However, these two bacteria cannot secrete Pels encoded by heterologously expressed pel genes from the other species, suggesting the existence of species-specific secretion signals within these proteins. The functional cluster of E. chrysanthemi out genes carried on cosmid pCPP2OO6 enables Escherichia coli to secrete E. chrysanthemi, but not E. carotovora, Pels. We exploited the high sequence similarity between E. chrysanthemi PelC and E. carotovora Pel1 to construct 15 hybrid proteins in which different regions of PelC were replaced with homologous sequences from Pel1. The differential secretion of these hybrid proteins by E. coli (pCPP2OO6) revealed M118 to D175 and V215 to C329 as regions required for species-specific secretion of PelC. We propose that the primary targeting signal is contained within the external loops formed by G274 to C329 but is dependent on residues in M118 to D170 and V215 to G274 for proper positioning. 3aPectobacterium carotovorum 3agenetic transformation 3apectate lyase 3arecombinant DNA 3arecombinant proteins 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aErwinia chrysanthemi 3aprotein secretion 3aenzyme activity 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCosmids 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aIsoelectric Focusing 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPectobacterium carotovorumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDickeya chrysanthemixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolysaccharide-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 0aPectobacterium chrysanthemi 0agene splicing1 aBoyd, C.M.1 aKeen, N.T.1 aCollmer, A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 Mar., v. 180, no. 6 p.1431-1437x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04261naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001600175245014300191300001600334500002400350520249300374650001902867650001902886650001902905650002002924650001302944650002402957650002402981650002003005650002303025650001703048650002003065650001803085650002903103650001103132650001103143650001103154650001303165650001503178650001103193650001103204650002103215650001803236650001603254651001003270700001703280700001703297700001203314700001603326700001903342773009603361852000903457856008803466930003303554945002503587946001103612655001203623IND4410148320140724000000.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441014832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ100 0aJ2001 aBastida, F.10aApplication of fresh and composted organic wastes modifies structure, size and activity of soil microbial community under semiarid climate  ap. 318-329.  aIncludes references  aAlthough the application of organic amendments is considered a suitable tool for improving soil fertility, few studies have been conducted in semiarid climates to evaluate the joint effect of such practice on the structure and function of the soil's microbial community. The aim of this work therefore was to make a comparative study of the effect of organic materials of differing degrees of stabilization (a sewage sludge and a compost made from the same) on the size, activity and structure of the microbial community in a semiarid soil. In samples taken in spring, summer and autumn over a 2-year period we analysed parameters that indicate the size of the microbial community [microbial biomass C (MBC)], its general activity (ATP and respiration) and specific activity related to the N, P and C cycles in the soil (urease, phosphatase and β-glucosidase, respectively). Two years after the organic amendment, the structure of the microbial community was studied by analysing phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). At the end of the experiment, the MBC of the compost and sludge-treated soils was 489 and 463mgCmic kg⁻¹, respectively, while the MBC of the control soils was 247mgCmic kg⁻¹. Over the 2-year period, the higher β-glucosidase, urease and alkaline phosphatase activities of compost and sludge-treated soils reflected higher substrate availability in these plots compared to the control plots. Indeed, plant abundance increased by about 25% with organic amendments. Whereas the bacterial to fungal ratio of signature PLFAs did not change, the ratio of monounsaturated/saturated and the ratio of Gram⁺/Gram⁻ of the different treatments indicated that a different bacterial community developed 2 years after amendment with compost and sludge. Thus, factor analysis via PLFAs showed a change in microbial community structure in amended soils versus control soil. It can be concluded that microbial biomass and activity of degraded semiarid soils can be improved by the addition of organic materials of differing degrees of stabilization (compost and sewage sludge). Compost-amended soils showed the highest carbon contents, while in general no differences in activity or microbial biomass where found between compost or sludge treatments. Although phytotoxic substances in sewage sludge might negatively affect plant development, the similar density of plant cover developed in sludge and compost-treated soils suggests that any phytotoxic substances had been degraded. 3asemiarid soils 3asemiarid zones 3aorganic wastes 3asoil amendments 3acomposts 3asoil microorganisms 3acommunity structure 3apopulation size 3amicrobial activity 3asoil enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3asewage sludge 3asoil chemical properties 3aspring 3asummer 3aautumn 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3acarbon 3aurease 3abeta-glucosidase 3aphospholipids 3afatty acids 3aSpain1 aKandeler, E.1 aMoreno, J.L.1 aRos, M.1 aGarcía, C.1 aHernández, T.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2008 Oct., v. 40, no. 2 p.318-329dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.05.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20110511b20110603c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/04/13  aNon-US 7aarticle04075naa a2200865 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245013000164300001800294500001500312520149000327650001801817650001701835650001601852650002101868650001201889650001501901650001701916650002501933650002001958650001601978650000901994650002602003650002502029650001202054650002802066650001702094650001402111650002102125650002402146650007402170650001802244650002302262650003002285650002602315650004602341650003902387650001802426650001102444650002402455650002702479650003502506650002802541650004902569650002602618650002802644650001702672650001402689650004002703650003402743650002402777653001302801653002102814653002802835653002802863653001202891653002402903653002702927653001602954700001602970700001902986700001803005700002103023773008503044852000903129930003303138945001303171946001303184655001203197IND2196325420221118124125.0990107e199806  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219632542DNAL7 a96209502pmid7 aPMC1078012pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, H.F.14aThe developmentally regulated alb1 gene of Aspergillus fumigatus: its role in modulation of conidial morphology and virulence  ap. 3031-3038.  a2019-12-05  aAspergillus fumigatus, an important opportunistic pathogen which commonly affects neutropenic patients, produces conidia with a bluish-green color. We identified a gene, alb1, which is required for conidial pigmentation. The alb1 gene encodes a putative polyketide synthase, and disruption of alb1 resulted in an albino conidial phenotype. Expression of alb1 is developmentally regulated, and the 7-kb transcript is detected only during the conidiation stage. The alb1 mutation was found to block 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxpnaphtthalene production, indicating that alb1 is involved in dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin biosynthesis. Scanning electron microscopy studies showed that the alb1 disruptant exhibited a smooth conidial surface, whereas, complementation of the alb1 deletion restored the echinulate wild-type surface. Disruption of alb1 resulted in a significant increase in C3 binding on conidial surfaces, and the conidia of the alb1 disruptant were ingested by human neutrophils at a higher rate than were those of the wild type. The alb1-complemented strain producing bluish-green conidia exhibited inefficient C3 binding and neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis quantitatively similar to those of the wild type. Importantly, the alb1 disruptant had a statistically significant loss of virulence compared to the wild-type and alb1-complemented strains in a murine model. Then results suggest that disruption of alb1 causes pleiotropic effects on conidial morphology and fungal virulence. 3amessenger RNA 3abiosynthesis 3asporulation 3astructural genes 3aconidia 3acomplement 3apigmentation 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aneutrophils 3amice 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3anucleotide sequences 3amutants 3agenetic complementation 3aphagocytosis 3avirulence 3aacyltransferases 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillus fumigatusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aComplement C3xmetabolism 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMelaninsxbiosynthesis 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultienzyme Complexesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNaphtholsxmetabolism 2aNeutrophilsximmunology 2aPhagocytosis 2aPhenotype 2aPigmentationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aVirulencexgenetics 0amelanins 0agenbank/af025541 0amolecular sequence data 0aexperimental infections 0abinding 0apolyketide synthase 0aanatomy and morphology 0aconidiation1 aChang, Y.C.1 aWashburn, R.G.1 aWheeler, M.H.1 aKwon-Chung, K.J.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 June, v. 180, no. 12 p.3031-3038x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03533naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245010500168300001800273520168100291650002901972650002602001650002402027650002002051650003202071650002102103650002102124650002102145650002902166650001802195650003502213650002502248650003102273650008702304650003002391650002002421650006402441650002702505650001702532650002402549650007502573650002702648653001502675653001702690653002002707653001902727700001602746700001302762700001702775773008302792852000902875930003302884945001302917946001302930655001202943IND2196194720221118124119.0981229e199805  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219619472DNAL7 a95731912pmid7 aPMC1071812pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarberhaus, F.10aPromoter selectivity of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum RpoH transcription factors in vivo and in vitro  ap. 2395-2401.  aExpression of the dnaKJ and groESL1 heat shock operons of Bradyrhizobium japonicum depends on a sigma 32-like transcription factor. Three such factors (RpoH1, RpoH2, and RpoH3) have previously been identified in this organism. We report here that they direct transcription from some but not all sigma 32-type promoters when the respective rpoH genes are expressed in Escherichia coli. All three RpoH factors were purified as soluble C-terminally histidine-tagged proteins, although the bulk of overproduced RpoH3 was insoluble. The purified proteins were recognized by an anti-E. coli sigma 32 serum. While RpoH1 and RpoH2 productively interacted with E. coli core RNA polymerase and produced E. coli groE transcript in vitro, RpoH3 was unable to do so. B. japonicum core RNA polymerase was prepared and reconstituted with the RpoH proteins. Again, RpoH1 and RpoH2 were active, and they initiated transcription at the B. japonicum groESL1 and dnaKJ promoters. In all cases, the in vitro start site was shown to be identical to the start site determined in vivo. Promoter competition experiments revealed that the B. japonicum dnaKJ and groESL1 promoters were suboptimal for the transcription by RpoH1- or RpoH2-containing RNA polymerase from B. japonicum. In a mixture of different templates, the E. coli groESL promoter was preferred over any other promoter. Differences were observed in the specificities of both sigma factors toward B. japonicum rpoH-dependent promoters. We conclude that the primary function of RpoH2 is to supply the cell with DnaKJ under normal growth conditions wheras RpoH1 is responsible mainly for increasing the level of GroESL1 after a heat shock. 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3atranscription factors 3aheat shock proteins 3agene expression 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3abinding proteins 3aEscherichia coli 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 3abinding sites 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBinding, Competitive 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aProtein Binding 2aRecombinant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRhizobiaceaexgenetics 2aSigma Factor 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0ainitiation 0asigma factor 0agroesl promoter 0adnakj promoter1 aKowarik, M.1 aBeck, C.1 aHennecke, H.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 May, v. 180, no. 9 p.2395-2401x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03381naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245012800165300001800293500001500311520127100326650002101597650001401618650002401632650002501656650002001681650002301701650001901724650002101743650002101764650002401785650001201809650004801821650001801869650002301887650002901910650003101939650002101970650002801991650002402019650003002043650002502073650002902098650003402127650002402161653001202185653002102197653002102218653001702239653002802256653002102284653002102305653001302326653002102339653002102360653002102381653002502402653002102427700001302448700001702461700001802478773008302496852000902579930003302588945001302621946001302634655001202647IND2196194620221118124108.0981229e199805  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219619462DNAL7 a95731882pmid7 aPMC1071782pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraig, H.R.10aCloning and characterization of a gene encoding the major surface protein of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis  ap. 2373-2378.  a2019-12-05  aThe maternally inherited intracellular symbiont Wolbachia pipientis is well known for inducing a variety of reproductive abnormalities in the diverse arthropod hosts it infects. It has been implicated in causing cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, and the feminization of genetic males in different hosts. The molecular mechanisms by which this fastidious intracellular bacterium causes these reproductive and developmental abnormalities have not yet been determined. In this paper, we report on (i) the purification of one of the most abundantly expressed Wolbachia proteins from infected Drosophila eggs and (ii) the subsequent cloning and characterization of the gene (wsp) that encodes it. The functionality of the wsp promoter region was also successfully tested in Escherichia coli. Comparison of sequences of this gene from different strains of Wolbachia revealed a high level of variability. This sequence variation correlated with the ability of certain Wolbachia strains to induce or rescue the cytoplasmic incompatibility phenotype in infected insects. As such, this gene will be a very useful tool for Wolbachia strain typing and phylogenetic analysis, as well as understanding the molecular basis of the interaction of Wolbachia with its host. 3astructural genes 3asymbionts 3aWolbachia pipientis 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3abacterial proteins 3acell membranes 3apromoter regions 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDrosophilaxmicrobiology 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMothsxmicrobiology 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aRickettsiaceaexgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 0acloning 0agenbank/af020069 0agenbank/af020070 0apurification 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af020066 0agenbakn/af020065 0awsp gene 0agenbank/af020065 0agenbank/af020068 0agenbank/af020075 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/af0200671 aZhou, W.1 aDobson, S.L.1 aN'Neill, S.L.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 May, v. 180, no. 9 p.2373-2378x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03846naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245013000166300001800296500001500314520152500329650001701854650002801871650001801899650001701917650002101934650002401955650001101979650002501990650002302015650002002038650002102058650002402079650003302103650001802136650003102154650002602185650002302211650003002234650002102264650002702285650006302312650002802375650001102403650002702414650003402441650002602475650001502501650002302516650002602539653001202565653001302577653001902590653001102609653002102620653002802641653001402669653002002683653002702703653003602730653002502766653001402791700001702805700001502822700001702837700001702854700001802871773008302889852000902972930003302981945001303014946001303027655001203040IND2196194320221118124211.0981229e199805  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219619432DNAL7 a95731802pmid7 aPMC1071702pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaillou, S.10aCloning, sequence analysis, and characterization of the genes involved in isoprimeverose metabolism in Lactobacillus pentosus  ap. 2312-2320.  a2019-12-05  aTwo genes, xylP and xylQ, from the xylose regulon of Lactobacillus pentosus were cloned and sequenced. Together with the repressor gene of the regulon, xylR, the xylPQ genes form an operon which is inducible by xylose and which is transcribed from a promoter located 145 bp upstream of xylP. A putative xylR binding site (xylO) and a cre-like element, mediating CcpA-dependent catabolite repression, were found in the promoter region. L. pentosus mutants in which both xylP and xylP and xylQ (LPE1) or only xylQ (LPE2) was inactivated retained the ability to ferment xylose but were impaired in their ability to ferment isoprimeverose (alpha-D-xylopyranosyl(1,6)-D-glucopyranose. Disruption of xylQ resulted specifically in the loss of a membrane-associated alpha-xylosidase activity when LPE1 or LPE2 cells were grown on xylose. In the membrane fraction of wild-type bacteria, alpha-xylosidase could catalyze the hydrolysis of isoprimeverose and p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-xylopyranoside with apparent Km and Vmax values of 0.2 mM and 446 nmol/min/mg of protein, and 1.3 mM and 54 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. The enzyme could also hydrolyze the alpha-xylosidic linkage in xyloglucan oligosaccharides, but neither methyl-alpha-D-xylopyranoside nor alpha-glucosides were substrates. Glucose repressed the synthesis of alpha-xylosidase fivefold, and 80% of this repression was released in an L. pentosus delta ccpA mutant. The alpha-xylosidase gene was also expressed in the absence of xylose when xylR was disrupted. 3aglycosidases 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aLactobacillus 3afermentation 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3axylose 3aamino acid sequences 3abacterial proteins 3aenzyme activity 3apromoter regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxgenetics 2aCell Compartmentation 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDisaccharidesxmetabolism 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGlycosidesxmetabolism 2aLactobacillusxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOperon 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aSymporters 2aXylosexmetabolism 2aXylosidasesxgenetics 0acloning 0apermease 0agenbank/u89276 0asugars 0aalpha-xylosidase 0amolecular sequence data 0axylq gene 0aoperator region 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aisoprimeverose cation symporter 0anucleotide sequences 0axylp gene1 aLokman, B.C.1 aLeer, R.J.1 aPosthuma, C.1 aPostma, P.W.1 aPouwels, P.H.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1998 May, v. 180, no. 9 p.2312-2320x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03126naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002100175245012700196300001600323500002400339520168300363650003702046650002202083650002002105650001002125650002102135650002302156650002202179650001402201650001502215650002702230650002602257651001002283653002502293653002402318700001702342700002302359773009602382852000902478856008802487930003302575945002502608946001102633655001202644IND4410148420140724000000.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441014842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aP010 0aF5001 aShah, Manzoor A.10aMycorrhizal source and neighbour identity differently influence Anthemis cotula L. invasion in the Kashmir Himalaya, India  ap. 330-337.  aIncludes references  aWhilst the importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in invasive spread of some alien plant species has been recently established, it is unclear how such plants respond to AMF from different geographical sources. Besides, influence of different co-occurring plant species on the AMF-mediated invasiveness of alien species, though rarely investigated, is pivotal to the explicit understanding of the feedback between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and alien plant invasions. We therefore examined the influence of local (Kashmir Himalyan isolates) and foreign (isolates from Rajasthan, India) AMF on invasiveness of alien Anthemis cotula vis-à-vis the effect of three common co-occurring neighbours, Conyza canadensis, Galinsoga parviflora and Sisymbrium loeselii. Field studies revealed high incidence of Arum-type mycorrhizal colonization in natural populations of A. cotula and the pot trials confirmed the reliance of its invasiveness on AMF with the more favourable effect of local than foreign AMF. The mycorrhizal colonization intensity in field populations of A. cotula was strongly influenced by neighbour identity with major reduction recorded in the presence of S. loeselii (a cruciferous non-host) in comparison to other con-familial neighbours. Pot experiments confirmed the differential effect of co-occurring species on A. cotula's invasive traits. These results signify that the facilitative role of AMF communities in invasion by some alien plants is contingent upon neighbour identity and the present approach provides not only a framework for further examination of the invasive plant-soil biota feedback, but also many important management implications. 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aAnthemis cotula 3aweeds 3ainvasive species 3aindigenous species 3aConyza canadensis 3aGalinsoga 3aSisymbrium 3amicrobial colonization 3afield experimentation 3aIndia 0aGalinsoga parviflora 0aSisymbrium loeselii1 aReshi, Zafar1 aRashīd, ʻIrfān.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2008 Oct., v. 40, no. 2 p.330-337dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.06.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20110511b20110603c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/04/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02650naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002300154245010900177300001600286500002400302520146300326650001601789650001801805650002701823650001501850650001301865650001201878650002001890650002401910700002101934700002301955773012101978852000902099856008502108930003302193945002502226946001302251655001202264IND4410188120221118124208.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441018812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-008-1288-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aMohsen-Nia, Mohsen10aMeasuring and Modeling Liquid-Liquid Equilibria for a Soybean Oil, Oleic Acid, Ethanol, and Water System  ap. 973-978.  aIncludes references  aVegetable oils can be deacidified by liquid-liquid extraction based on differences in polarity between triglycerides and fatty acids and differences in solubility. Information on the equilibrium between the phases of such systems is important for designing separation processes. The present paper reports experimental data for the extraction of fatty acid from soybean oil by (ethanol + water) as a mixed-solvent for system of soybean oil + oleic acid + ethanol + water at 30 °C at different water contents. The liquid-liquid equilibrium data of the systems were used to obtain interaction parameters in the universal quasi-chemical theory (UNIQUAC) activity coefficient model. These parameters can be used to predict equilibrium data of ternary and quaternary systems. The deviations between experimental and calculated compositions in both phases for each system using this model were calculated. The distribution coefficients and the selectivity factors of solvents for extraction of fatty acid from oil at 30 °C were calculated. Increasing of the water content as the co-solvent decreased the distribution coefficients and increased the selectivity factors of mixed-solvents, therefore considering the economical and practical aspects the optimum water content may be used for extracting oleic acid from soybean oil. We concluded that (ethanol + water) as a mixed-solvent can be used for extracting fatty acids from edible oils in a normal temperature. 3asoybean oil 3avegetable oil 3afatty acid composition 3aoleic acid 3asolvents 3aethanol 3adeacidification 3amathematical models1 aModarress, Hamid1 aNabavi, Hamid Reza0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2008 Oct., v. 85, no. 10 p.973-978dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-008-1288-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20081106b20081206c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/11/06  aOther US 7aarticle02363naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001700163245007500180300001600255500002400271520119200295650001301487650001401500650001701514650001401531650001301545650001801558653002101576700001501597700002201612700001301634700002001647773012101667852000901788856008501797930003301882945002501915946001301940655001201953IND4410187320221118124154.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441018732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-008-1281-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ5001 aDo, T.-A.

The objective of this study is to understand the functionality of limonene in decreasing the viscosity and the hardness of chocolate, a fat (cocoa butter)-based particulate suspension. This study shows that chocolate hardness was decreased because limonene mixes with cocoa butter, affects its crystallization pattern and decreases its solid fat content. After checking that limonene does not significantly affect the continuous phase volume fraction, we show that limonene decreases chocolate viscosity by decreasing the viscosity of the continuous phase, cocoa butter. The addition of low quantities of limonene in cocoa butter leads to a great decrease in the liquid fat viscosity. The dependence of the viscosity on the ratio of cocoa butter to limonene analyzed using Kay's equation seems to indicate that limonene mixes with and within the cocoa butter triglycerides, diluting the fat and leading to a decrease in the overall fat viscosity. 3alimonene 3achocolate 3acocoa butter 3aviscosity 3ahardness 3alipid content 0areduced fat food1 aVieira, J.1 aHargreaves, J.

Using institutional organisation theory as a background this paper analyses corporate responsibility reporting in the world's ten largest pulp and paper companies, representing 25% of global production capacity. The studied companies have their headquarters in Japan, the Nordic countries or North America, and have very different geographical and cultural bases and variable company product portfolios ranging from wood-based products and printing papers to packaging boards and consumer goods. Both quantitative and qualitative economic, environmental and social metrics from the annual and social responsibility reports of the companies were analysed regarding institutionalised, culture-specific and company-specific characteristics. The results showed that regulated financial and environmental reporting leaves little flexibility for company-specific diversification in reporting. Only a few regional characteristics were identified, mainly in social responsibility reporting, while the reporting largely reflected a general North American-Nordic type of corporate responsibility and the globalisation trend of the studied companies. Regardless of the many challenges in the assessment of corporate responsibility, the concepts discussed in this paper are potentially useful tools for helping to achieve sustainable development in the pulp and paper industry. 3apulp and paper industry 3acorporations 3aenvironmental protection 3asustainable development 3ageographical variation 3aqualitative analysis 3aJapan 3aScandinavia 3aUnited States 0acorporate transparency 0acorporate reporting 0ainstitutional organization theory 0asocial responsibility 0aeconomic responsibility1 aToppinen, Anne0 tForest policy and economics.g2008 Oct., v. 10, no. 7-8 p.500-506dElsevier Sciencex1389-93417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2008.05.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20081205b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/12/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01824naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012900129300001600258500001500274520089600289650002301185650002601208650001901234650001601253653001501269653001901284700001901303700002001322700001701342773008401359852000901443939003301452946001301485655001201498IND9202949220221118123559.0920511e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920294922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbouzied, M.M.10aReactivity of deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin) monoclonal antibody towards putative trichothecene precursors and shunt metabolites  ap. 288-290.  a2019-12-04  aThe reactivity of deoxynivalenol (DON) monoclonal antibody 6F5 towards trichothecenes and Fusarium metabolites associated with DON and T-2 toxin biosynthesis was assessed by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using concentrations required to inhibit antibody binding to a DON hemisuccinate ovalbumin conjugate solid phase by 50% as a basis of comparison, isotrichodermin, 3-acetyl DON, 15-deacetylcalonectrin. and 3.15-dideacetylcalonectrin were 647, 362, 247, and 209% cross-reactive relative to DON, respectively. Isotrichodermol, sambucinol, and 7,8-dihydroxycalonectrin reacted to a lesser extent. The results suggested that the C3, C4, and C15 positions were immunodominant on determining binding to the DON monoclonal antibody. The antibody should be useful in detecting both production of these metabolites in Fusarium cultures as well as their occurrence in foods and feeds. 3afood contamination 3amonoclonal antibodies 3adeoxynivalenol 3ametabolites 0aprecursors 0atrichothecenes1 aBeremand, M.N.1 aMcCormick, S.P.1 aPestka, J.J.0 tJournal of food protection.g1991 Apr., v. 54, no. 4 p.288-290x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03328naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245010100142300001800243520133600261650001101597650002001608650001701628650002001645650002501665650002001690650002401710650001201734650001901746650001801765650007001783650003901853650002001892650001701912650001301929650004001942650003201982650003102014650002902045650001502074650002802089650002202117650004002139650002402179650003302203650002702236653002302263653001202286653002802298653001902326653001902345653001602364700001702380700001502397700001602412700001602428700001602444700001502460700001702475773009502492852000902587939003302596946001302629655001202642IND9202949520221118123556.0920511e19920215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920294952DNAL7 a17377542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDozin, B.10aExpression, regulation, and tissue distribution of the Ch21 protein during chicken embryogenesis  ap. 2979-2985.  aThe Ch21 protein is one of the marker proteins whose synthesis and secretion by differentiating tibia chondrocytes is progressively increased during chicken embryogenesis (Descalzi-Cancedda, F., Manduca, P., Tacchetti, C., Fossa, P., Quarto, R. and Cancedda, R. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 107, 2455-2463). We report the corresponding full-length cDNA sequence and the complete primary structure of the protein, which contains a 20-residue signal peptide. The synthesis of the protein is directed by a 1450-base mRNA characterized by an unusually long 5'-untranslated leader sequence and is regulated only at the transcriptional level as shown by run-off transcription assays. During differentiation, maximal expression of the protein characterizes stage II hypertrophic chondrocytes. In situ hybridization on embryo sections reveals that the protein is expressed by several structures derived from the chondrogenic lineage and that, in addition, it is a major translational product in granulocytes. High cell density largely influences the expression of the Ch21 protein in chondrocyte cultures. When embryonic avian cells of different origin are grown to confluency the expression of the Ch21 protein is observed in only some of the cell lines. Thus quiescence per se is not the primary factor determining the expression of the protein. 3achicks 3aembryo (animal) 3achondrocytes 3aanimal proteins 3acell differentiation 3agene expression 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAvian Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCartilagexembryologyxphysiology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aChick Embryo 2aChickens 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFatty Acid-Binding Proteins 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGranulocytesxphysiology 2aLipocalins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Specificity 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxgenetics. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSkin Physiological Phenomena 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0amarkers 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m37611 0agenbank/m55644 0aembl/m376111 aDescalzi, F.1 aBriata, L.1 aHayashi, M.1 aGentili, C.1 aHayashi, K.1 aQuarto, R.1 aCancedda, R.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1992 Feb. 15, v. 267, no. 5 p.2979-2985x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01265naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245003300130300001600163500006600179520038500245650001000630650001400640650002200654650002500676650002000701650001200721650002300733651001100756700001600767700001900783773007200802852000900874939003300883946001100916655001200927IND9202934020221118123653.0920511e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920293402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, D.C.10aNeolignans from Aniba ferrea  ap. 271-273.  aPart 95 in the series 'The Chemistry of Brazilian Lauraceae.'  aThe presence of benzyl benzoates as well as of bicyclo[3.2.1]octanoid and hydrobenzofuranoid neolignans in Aniba ferrea was confirmed by the isolation of additional representatives of this class of natural products.

Cross-sectional data were collected from a sample of 1934 Flemish consumers through an on-line survey. The respondents rated 45 health statements referring to people's motives for pursuing health. The survey also assessed information on several aspects of ready meal consumption, i.e. consumption frequency, beliefs and attitudes toward ready meals and ready meal buying criteria. Based on a two-step cluster analysis, we identified five distinct subgroups in the sample, according to their HRMO: health is about energy (Energetic Experimenters), emotional well-being/enjoying life (Harmonious Enjoyers), social responsibility/physical well-being (Normative Carers), achievement/outward appearance (Conscious Experts) and autonomy (Rationalists). Ready meal consumption patterns differed between these segments, with Energetic Experimenters and Conscious Experts showing significantly more positive attitudes, stronger beliefs and both higher penetration and consumption frequency related to ready meals, compared to Harmonious Enjoyers, Normative Carers and Rationalists. These findings may relate to the individualistic versus altruistic health orientation perspective of the identified segments, and are valuable in the context of improving consumer-oriented product development, positioning and marketing of ready meals. 3amotivation 3afood intake 3aclassification 3afood purchasing 3ahealth beliefs 3aconsumer surveys 3aconsumer attitudes 3adietary surveys 3aready-to-cook foods 2aAdult 2aAttitude to Health 2aChoice Behavior 2aCluster Analysis 2aCommunity Participation. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology. 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMarketingxmethods 2aMass Media 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotivation 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aYoung Adult 3aBelgium 0aBelgium 0aconsumer behavior 0adiet 0aattitudes and opinions 0aprepared foods 0aconsumers1 aVerbeke, Wim1 aVan Kenhove, Patrick0 tAppetite.g2008 Nov., v. 51, no. 3 p.704-712dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.06.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20081105b20081206c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03473naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175100002000184245008300204300001600287500002400303500001500327520129100342650001901633650000801652650002101660650001001681650001501691650002301706650001501729650002301744650002301767650002101790650001601811650002001827650002001847650001501867650002301882650002801905650006001933650001101993650002002004650005202024650001102076650000902087650004902096650001502145650001802160650001702178650001602195650004202211650005002253650001602303651002102319651002602340653002602366653003202392653001602424700002002440700002002460773008202480852000902562856008702571930003302658945002502691946001102716655001202727IND4410141520221118124131.0080912e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441014152DNAL7 a185849122pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.05.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aŞanlier, Nevin13aAn evaluation of eating disorders among a group of Turkish university students  ap. 641-645.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe prevalence of eating disorders has been increasing in the last 20 years, not only in developed countries, but also in less developed countries such as Turkey. This study was conducted among 610 university students, 338 males and 272 females who are between 17 and 23 years old, in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to determine eating disorders among the young. The data regarding the eating disorders and self-evaluation were assessed according to the EAT-40 test and the Body Cathexis Scale. The scores received from the eating attitudes test were low among the underweight (18.9±9.7) and higher among the overweight (21.6±15.9). Eating disorders risks are more prevalent among females compared to males (P <0.001). 17.2% of the underweight and 21.2% of the overweight are at higher risk of eating disorders. There was a positive correlation between the eating attitudes test scores and young people's body weight, BMI, mid-upper arm and waist circumferences, while a negative correlation was determined between the body cathexis scores and these variables. The authors believe that educating young people about healthy nutrition and monitoring them through longitudinal research studies will be helpful to prevent eating disorders, which are significant in terms of public health. 3ahuman diseases 3amen 3aeating disorders 3awomen 3aoverweight 3adisease prevalence 3abody image 3aat-risk population 3agender differences 3acollege students 3aunderweight 3ahuman nutrition 3abody mass index 2aAdolescent 2aAttitude to Health 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxepidemiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aHealth Behavior 2aHealth Promotionxorganization & administration 2aHumans 2aMale 2aObesityxepidemiologyxetiologyxpsychology. 2aPrevalence 2aPublic Health 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 2aStudentsxstatistics & numerical data 2aThinnessxepidemiologyxetiologyxpsychology. 2aYoung Adult 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkeyxepidemiology. 0adiet-related diseases 0aanthropometric measurements 0arisk groups1 aYabanci, Nurcan1 aAlyakut, Ömür0 tAppetite.g2008 Nov., v. 51, no. 3 p.641-645dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.05.0583Available from publisher's Web site  a20081105b20081206c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02763naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245017100125300001800296500001500314520135500329650002101684650002501705650002101730650002501751650002901776650002101805650001901826650001201845650001501857650001601872653001901888653002301907653001201930653001801942653004801960653001902008653001502027653002802042653002502070653001402095700002002109773008402129852000902213930003302222945001302255946001302268655001202281IND2058612020221118124117.0970724e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205861202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubner, A.12aA fusion promoter created by a new insertion sequence, IS1490, activates transcription of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid catabolic genes in Bacillus cepacia AC1100  ap. 2727-2723.  a2019-12-05  aTransposition and transcriptional activation by insertion sequences in Burkholderia cepacia AC1100 were investigated. Two closely related new elements, IS1413 and IS1490, were identified and characterized. These elements are not highly related to other insertion sequences identified in AC1100 or other B. cepacia isolates. Based on their structures and the sequences of the inverted terminal repeats and the putative transposase protein, the insertion elements (IS elements) are similar to IST2 of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and several related elements. All the IS elements that have been identified in this strain are found in multiple copies (10 to 40), and they have high-level promoter activity capable of stimulating transcription from a distance up to 500 bp from a target gene. Strain AC1100 was originally isolated after prolonged selection for the ability to utilize the herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) as a sole carbon source. Three IS elements are located near the first gene of the 2,4,5-T catabolic pathway, tftA. IS1490 inserted 110 bp upstream of tftA and created a fusion promoter responsible for constitutive transcription of the gene. Our results confirm the hypothesis that IS elements play a central role in transcription of 2,4,5-T genes and likely have stimulated rapid evolution of the metabolic pathway. 3apromoter regions 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3astructural genes 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3aPseudomonadaceae 3abiodegradation 3a2,4,5-T 3aoxygenases 3atransposons 0agenbank/u58191 0agenetic regulation 0aenzymes 0atransposition 0a2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid oxygenase 0agenbank/u80795 0atranposase 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0atfta gene1 aHendrickson, W.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Apr., v. 179, no. 8 p.2727-2723x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04325naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002100149245011500170300001800285500001500303520215700318650001802475650002102493650002402514650000902538650002202547650000802569650001902577650002502596650001502621650001402636650001402650650002102664650002402685650003102709650002902740650001802769650003202787650003302819650002302852650003602875650003302911650006402944650002203008650002803030650003703058650002403095650001403119650004503133650004103178650001403219653001203233653001003245653001903255653001403274653002303288653001903311653002503330653002803355653001103383700001603394700001703410773008403427852000903511930003303520945001303553946001303566655001203579IND2059161120221118124030.0970826e199703  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205916112DNAL7 a90686312pmid7 aPMC1789092pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPontarollo, R.A.10aCloning and characterization of bacteriophage-like DNA from Haemophilus somnus homologous to phages P2 and HP1  ap. 1872-1879.  a2019-12-05  aIn an attempt to identify and characterize components of a heme uptake system of Haemophilus somnus, an Escherichia coli cosmid library of H. somnus genomic DNA was screened for the ability to bind hemin (Hmb+). The Hmb+ phenotype was associated with a 7,814-hp HindIII fragment of H. somnus DNA that was subcloned and sequenced. Thirteen open reading frames (orfs) were identified, all transcribed in one direction, and transposon mutagenesis identified orf7 as the gene associated with the Hmb+ phenotype. Orf7 (178 amino acids) has extensive homology with the lysozymes of bacteriophages P-A2, P21, P22, PZA, phi-29, phi-cML3, T4, or HP1. The orf7 gene complemented the lytic function of the K gene of phage P2 and the R gene of phage A. A lysozyme assay using supernatants from whole-cell lysates of E. coli cultures harboring plasmid pRAP501 or pGCH2 (both of which express the orf7 gene product) exhibited significant levels of lysozyme activity. The orf6 gene upstream of orf7 has the dual start motif common to the holins encoded by lambdoid S genes, and the orf6 gene product has significant homology to the holins of phages HP1 and P21, when expressed from a tac promoter, the orf6 gene product caused immediate cell death without lysis, while cultures expressing the orf7 gene product grew at normal rates but lysed immediately after the addition of chloroform. Based on this data, we concluded that the Hmb+ phenotype was an artifact resulting from the expression of cloned lysis genes which were detrimental to the E. coli host. The DNA flanking the cloned lysis genes contains orfs that are similar to structural and DNA packaging genes of phage P2. Polyclonal antiserum against Orf2, which is homologous to the major capsid precursor protein (gpN) of phage P2, detected a 40,000-Mr protein expressed from pRAP401 but did-not detect Orf2 in H. somnus lysates. The phage-like DNA was detected in the serum-susceptible preputial strains HS-124P and HS-127P but was absent from the serum-resistant preputial strains HS-20P and HS-22P. Elucidation of a potential role for this cryptic prophage in the H. somnus life cycle requires more study. 3acoat proteins 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3aheme 3aHaemophilus somni 3aDNA 3abacteriophages 3aamino acid sequences 3aproviruses 3acytolysis 3avirulence 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacteriophage P2xgenetics 2aBacteriophagesxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aBlood Bactericidal Activity 2aCapsidxchemistryxgenetics. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Viralxanalysisxgenetics. 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHaemophilusxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicityxvirology. 2aHeminxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMuramidasexchemistryxgenetics. 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPhenotype 2aProtein Precursorsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aViral Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aVirulence 0acloning 0ahemin 0agenbank/u28154 0aprophages 0aHaemophilus somnus 0aviral proteins 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0auptake1 aRioux, C.R.1 aPotter, A.A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Mar., v. 179, no. 6 p.1872-1879x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03206naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002400175245008600199300001800285500002400303500001500327520154900342650001701891650002001908650001701928650001101945650002001956650001601976650001501992650002102007650002302028650002502051650001302076650002302089650002102112650001002133651001102143651002502154653001002179653002002189653002002209653001102229653001502240653002502255700003502280700002502315773011002340852000902450856008802459930003302547945002502580946001102605655001202616IND4410143920221118124035.0080912e20081001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441014392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2008.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK110 0aB2001 aFyllas, Nikolaos M.10aRegeneration dynamics of a mixed Mediterranean pine forest in the absence of fire  ap. 1552-1559.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study is to determine the competing regeneration and expansion patterns of two co-occurring pine species (Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra ssp. pallasiana), in a transitional montane Mediterranean zone. We measured the regeneration density of all woody species in 102 randomly located stands along an altitudinal gradient on the island of Lesbos, Greece. Individuals of pines were assigned to different size classes. Topographic factors (altitude, aspect, and soil depth) and light availability (through hemispherical photographs) were measured for each stand. Statistical analyses were applied to explore the effect of each factor on recruitment density of the competing pine species, and to elucidate patterns of interaction. Canopy openness was the most important parameter controlling the recruitment of P. brutia, while the regeneration density of P. nigra was mainly related to canopy openness and heat load. An idiosyncratic response of the recruitment vigour of the two species was identified along gradients of shade and drought stress. The decline in P. nigra recruitment density with drought conditions underlines threats to its population maintenance even in the absence of fire. On the other hand P. brutia seems to be a stronger invader in transitional zones. The studied species could be considered typical representatives of the two most widely distributed pine functional types across the Mediterranean basin, and our results agree with the theoretical ability of such species to maintain and expand their populations. 3aPinus brutia 3asolar radiation 3aforest trees 3acanopy 3amontane forests 3aPinus nigra 3asoil depth 3avegetation cover 3apopulation density 3anatural regeneration 3aaltitude 3acolonizing ability 3astand basal area 3alight 3aGreece 3aMediterranean region 0aslope 0astand dominance 0acanopy openness 0aaspect 0abasal area 0avegetation structure1 aDimitrakopoulos, Panayiotis G.1 aTroumbis, Andreas Y.0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 Oct. 1, v. 256, no. 8 p.1552-1559dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2008.06.0463Available from publisher's Web site  a20081103b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03808naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100003100175245011400206300001800320500002400338500001500362520204900377650002802426650001202454650001702466650002502483650002102508650001202529650001502541650001802556650001602574650002102590650002502611650002602636650002002662651001302682651001102695653002402706653002702730653003702757653001702794653003702811653003102848653001802879653001902897700002402916773011202940852000903052856008803061930003303149945002503182946001103207655001203218IND4410144320221118124120.0080912e20080920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441014432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2008.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK110 0aF300 0aK1301 aFreitas, Joberto Veloso de10aApplying ecological knowledge to decisions about seed tree retention in selective logging in tropical forests  ap. 1434-1442.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn production forests in the moist tropics, trees are selected for felling or retention primarily by species and size. Tree regeneration requirements and forest stand responses to harvesting are often ignored, and consequently, the regeneration of the residual forest is not ensured. We developed and tested an alternative approach to tree selection, where seed trees were retained as a proportion of harvestable trees, with the proportion defined as a function of species' ecological attributes and local abundance (100ha), in contrast to the conventional approach which retained 10% of harvestable trees, uniformly across commercial species at the compartmental scale (1000ha). The study was conducted in Democracia Project, a forest management operation in Amazonas, Brazil. The conventional approach failed to retain any seed trees at the 100ha block scale for 7 of 37 commercial species, whereas the alternative approach retained a minimum number of seed trees per 100ha block for all commercial species. The conventional approach resulted in the retention of relatively high proportions of potential seed trees for common species (e.g., 22% for Eperua oleifera and 36% for Maquira sclerophila) that are shade bearers and recruit readily at the site; alternately, for species with constraints to regeneration, it retained relatively low proportions (e.g., 2% for Dinizia excelsa and Hymenolobium nitidum). The alternative approach effectively retained lower proportions of common species (e.g., 10% for E. oleifera and 13% for M. sclerophila) and relatively high proportions of species with regeneration constraints (e.g., 20% for D. excelsa and 16% for H. nitidum). Our study demonstrates that it is feasible to implement at an operational scale, species-specific retention rules that take into account local abundance when inventory data are digitised and spatially explicit. Monitoring regeneration in the residual stands over time will provide the evidence to assess the ecological benefits of the adoption of our alternative approach. 3ainterspecific variation 3alogging 3aforest trees 3aeven-aged management 3atropical forests 3atropics 3aseed trees 3aforest stands 3amethodology 3astand management 3anatural regeneration 3asilvicultural systems 3adecision making 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aspecies differences 0areduced impact logging 0aretention systems (silviculture) 0asilviculture 0aselection systems (silviculture) 0aspecies-specific retention 0aplant ecology 0aforest ecology1 aPinard, Michelle A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 Sept. 20, v. 256, no. 7 p.1434-1442dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2008.03.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20081104b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/04  aNon-US 7aarticle04021naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002000182245010700202300001700309500002400326500001500350520186200365650002202227650001502249650002002264650001802284650001202302650002302314650001502337650001702352650001302369650003102382650002202413650002802435650001102463650006002474650003102534650002202565650003602587650002302623650002002646650002302666651001602689651001402705651001402719651001602733653002302749653002102772653001802793653006102811700002502872700001802897700003102915700001502946700001602961700001602977700001802993700001903011773009203030852000903122856008503131930003303216945002503249946001303274655001203287IND4410146920221118124037.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441014692DNAL7 a187082792pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2008.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aGillanders, Lyn10aAuSPEN clinical practice guideline for home parenteral nutrition patients in Australia and New Zealand  ap. 998-1012.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: Evidence based guidelines for home parenteral nutrition (HPN) were commissioned by the Australasian Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (AuSPEN) and developed by a multidisciplinary group. The guidelines make recommendations in four domains: patient selection, patient training, formulation and monitoring regimens, and preventing and managing complications. Methods: The Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation guideline process was used to focus questions and identify evidence by systematic literature reviews of meta-analyses and randomized control trials in the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, and Cinahl to mid-2007. Where no randomized control trial evidence was found, the search was broadened to observational studies and expert opinion from related national and international guidelines as assessed by a validated appraisal process. Results: Selection of patients must assess individual risk/benefit and medical ethics. Patient training should be undertaken within a structured framework. Access devices should be selected for lowest risk of complications, including occlusion, sepsis, and breakage and be managed by early diagnosis and treatment. HPN should be formulated according to individual patient requirements by professionals with relevant skills and training. Pumps and ancillary products should conform to quality standards. Other intravenous medications may be prescribed provided these are reviewed for compatibility and effects on metabolic status. Conclusion: Overall there is a lack of randomized control trials to provide high-quality evidence-based guidance but graded recommendations can be made. Multidisciplinary teams in centers with HPN management expertise are required for optimal care. This guideline should improve outcomes and quality of life for HPN patients in Australia and New Zealand. 3apatient education 3amonitoring 3arisk management 3ameta-analysis 3afunding 3aparenteral feeding 3aguidelines 3apatient care 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3adisease diagnosis 2aEvidence-Based Medicine 2aHumans 2aParenteral Nutrition, Homexadverse effectsxstandards. 2aPatient Education as Topic 2aPatient Selection 2aPractice Patterns, Physicians'. 2aPrimary Prevention 2aRisk Assessment 2aSocieties, Medical 3aNew Zealand 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0aNew Zealand 0aliterature reviews 0ahome health care 0acomplications 0aAustralasian Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition1 aAngstmann, Katherina1 aBall, Patrick1 aChapman-Kiddell, Christine1 aHardy, Gil1 aHope, Janet1 aSmith, Ross1 aStrauss, Boyd1 aRussell, David0 tNutrition.g2008 Oct., v. 24, no. 10 p.998-1012dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2008.06.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090115b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/12/18  aOther US 7aarticle02782naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245011000163300001800273500001500291520092000306650002701226650003001253650002101283650001401304650002401318650002501342650002001367650001701387650002101404650002401425650006001449650001801509650002301527650006501550650003201615650004401647650002001691650002101711650006001732650002801792653001301820653003201833653002801865653002501893653001901918700001601937700001501953700001701968700001601985700001502001773008402016852000902100930003302109945001302142946001302155655001202168IND2060188620221118124051.0971020e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206018862DNAL7 a91502422pmid7 aPMC1791252pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidhu, H.10aDNA sequencing and expression of the formyl coenzyme A transferase gene, frc, from Oxalobacter formigenes  ap. 3378-3381.  a2019-12-05  aOxalic acid, a highly toxic by-product of metabolism, is catabolized by a limited number of bacterial species utilizing an activation-decarboxylation reaction which yields formate and CO2.frc, the gene encoding formyl coenzyme A transferase, an enzyme which transfers a coenzyme A moiety to activate oxalic acid, was cloned from the bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes. DNA sequencing revealed a single open reading frame of 1,284 bp capable of encoding a 428-amino-acid protein. A presumed promoter region and a rho-independent termination sequence suggest that this gene is part of a monocistronic operon. A PCR fragment containing the open reading frame, when overexpressed in Escherichia coli, produced a product exhibiting enzymatic activity similar to the purified native enzyme.

Mutations in virB11 affecting protein function were mapped near the amino terminus (Q6L, P13L and E25G), Just upstream of a region encoding a Walker A nucleotide-binding site (F154H;L155M), and within the Walker A motif (P170L, K175Q, and delta GKT174-176). The K175Q and delta GKT174-176 mutant proteins partitioned almost exclusively with the cytoplasmic membrane, suggesting that an activity associated with nucleotide binding could modulate the affinity of VirB11 for the cytoplasmic membrane. The virB11F154H;L155M allele was transdominant over wild-type virB11 in a merodiploid assay, providing strong evidence that at least one form of VirB11 functions as a homo- or heteromultimer. An allele with a deletion of the first half of the gene, virB11 delta 1-156, was transdominant in a merodiploid assay, indicating that the C-terminal half of VirB11 contains a protein interaction domain. Products of both virB11 delta 1-156 and virB11 delta 158-343, which synthesizes the N-terminal half of VirB11, associated tightly with the A. tumefaciens membrane, suggesting that both halves of VirB11 contain membrane interaction determinants. 3aalleles 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aKalanchoe daigremontiana 3acell membranes 3abinding sites 3acytochemistry 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3avirulence 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxenzymologyxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Compartmentation 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aProtein Binding 2aSequence Deletion 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aVirulence Factors 0acytoplasmic membranes 0amembrane interaction domains 0acell envelopes 0aprotein interaction domains 0amutagenesis 0adeletions 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0aBryophyllum daigremontianum1 aSpudich, G.M.1 aChristie, P.J.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Feb., v. 179, no. 3 p.583-591x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02933naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168072000900186072000900195072000900204100001800213245015100231300001600382500002400398500001500422506007600437520115200513506003701665650001201702650002301714650001001737650001301747650002101760650002801781650002201809650001601831650001201847650001401859650002501873653003801898653001501936700002001951700001301971700002001984700001902004700002002023700002202043700002202065773009102087852000902178856008502187930003302272945002502305946001302330655001202343IND4410146420221207142537.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441014642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2008.04.0062doi7 aPMC26563642pmcid7 a185858972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT300 0aX3801 aBeck, Justine10aCirculating oxidized low-density lipoproteins are associated with overweight, obesity, and low serum carotenoids in older community-dwelling women  ap. 964-968.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aObjective: The objective of this study was to determine whether total serum carotenoids, α-tocopherol, selenium, and obesity were independently associated with oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) in moderately to severely disabled older women living in the community. Methods: Serum ox-LDLs, carotenoids, α-tocopherol, and selenium were measured in a population-based sample of 543 moderately to severely disabled women >=65 y in the Women's Health and Aging Study I in Baltimore, Maryland. Results: Total serum carotenoids, smoking, overweight (body mass index 25-29.9 kg/m²), and obesity (body mass index >=30 mg/kg²) were significantly associated with the ox-LDL/LDL cholesterol ratio after adjusting for age, C-reactive protein, and chronic diseases. α-Tocopherol and selenium were not significantly associated with the ox-LDL/LDL cholesterol ratio. Conclusion: Older women who are overweight or obese or who have low total serum carotenoids are more likely to have higher lipoprotein oxidation. Weight reduction in overweight/obese women and increased intake of carotenoid-rich foods may potentially reduce lipoprotein oxidation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelderly 3anutritional status 3awomen 3aselenium 3aalpha-tocopherol 3alow density lipoprotein 3aelderly nutrition 3acarotenoids 3aobesity 3aoxidation 3anutrition assessment 0aoxidized low-density lipoproteins 0aoverweight1 aFerrucci, Luigi1 aSun, Kai1 aFried, Linda P.1 aVaradhan, Ravi1 aWalston, Jeremy1 aGuralnik, Jack M.1 aSemba, Richard D.0 tNutrition.g2008 Oct., v. 24, no. 10 p.964-968dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2008.04.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090115b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/12/18  aOther US 7aarticle02504naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245010500162300001800267520046200285650002800747650002300775650001600798650002100814650002500835650002500860650002000885650001800905650002900923650002000952650002400972650002300996650001801019650002301037650002101060650004201081650002101123650006001144650004101204650002801245650002101273650003301294650003401327650003601361650002701397653002801424653001901452653001901471653001401490653001401504653002401518700001701542700001901559700001601578700001501594700001301609700001701622700001601639773008301655852000901738930003301747945001301780946001301793655001201806IND2059933520221118123851.0970926e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205993352DNAL7 a91399252pmid7 aPMC1790712pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayo, B.10aCloning and characterization of cspL and cspP, two cold-inducible genes from Lactobacillus plantarum  ap. 3039-3042.  aTwo cold shock genes, cspL and cspP, have been cloned from two Lactobacillus plantarum strains.

This start site may be used by two different promoters since the expression of a glnB-lacZ fusion was high in the presence of ammonia and enhanced under conditions of nitrogen limitation in the wild-type strain. The increase was not observed in rpoN or ntrC mutants. In addition, this fusion was overexpressed under both growth conditions, in the glnB mutant strain, suggesting that PII negatively regulates its own expression. A DNA motif, similar to a sigma 54-dependent promoter consensus, was found in the 5' nontranscribed region. Thus, the glnBA seems to be transcribed from a sigma 54-dependent promoter that operates under conditions of nitrogen limitation and from another uncharacterized promoter in the presence of ammonia. Both glnB and glnBA mutant strains derepress their nitrogenase in the free-living state, but only the glnBA mutant, auxotrophic for glutamine, does not utilize molecular nitrogen for growth. The level of GS adenylylation is not affected in the glnB mutant as compared to that in the wild type. Under symbiotic conditions, the glnB and glnBA mutant strains induced Fix- nodules on Sesbania rostrata roots. PII is the first example in A. caulinodans of a protein required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation but dispensable in bacteria growing in the free-living state. 3amessenger RNA 3anitrogen fixation 3arecombinant DNA 3astructural genes 3aSesbania rostrata 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3abeta-galactosidase 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aoperon 3abacterial proteins 3areporter genes 3amutants 3anitrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3aRhizobiaceae 3apromoter regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenes, Regulator 2aGlutamate-Ammonia Ligasexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aPII Nitrogen Regulatory Proteins 2aRhizobiaceaexgenetics 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/y102131 aDesnoues, N.1 aElmerich, C.1 aKaminski, P.A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 June, v. 179, no. 11 p.3580-3587x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03842naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245014100165300001800306520192300324650002902247650003102276650002002307650000702327650001502334650001402349650001702363650000902380650001902389650001602408650002002424650002102444650001802465650002402483650001402507650003502521650005602556650003102612650002302643650003102666650002802697650003202725650002802757650006602785650003302851650003302884650004002917650001602957653001502973653001402988653001403002700001603016700001803032773008603050852000903136930003303145945001303178946001303191655001203204IND2062324320221118123908.0980309e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206232432DNAL7 a92870082pmid7 aPMC1794242pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChauhan, S.10aMetals control activity and expression of the heme biosynthesis enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase in Bradyrhizobium japonicum  ap. 5516-5520.  aThe heme biosynthesis enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) requires magnesium or zinc for activity, depending on the organism, and the heme moiety contains iron. Thus, metals are important for heme formation in at least two different ways. Bradyrhizobium japonicum ALAD* is an engineered derivative of wild-type ALAD that requires Zn2+ for activity rather than Mg2+ (S. Chauhan and M. R. O'Brian, J. Biol. Chem. 270: 19823-19827, 1995). The pH optimum for ALAD* activity was over 3.5 units lower than for that of the wild-type enzyme, and ALAD* activity was inhibited by lead and cadmium, as reported for the zinc-containing dehydratases of animals. In addition, ALAD* was significantly more thermostable than ALAD; the temperature optima are 50 and 37 degrees C, respectively. These observations strongly suggest that the metal contributes to both catalysis and structure, and this conclusion may be extrapolated to ALADs in general. Although iron did not affect the activity of the preformed protein, enzyme assays and immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the iron concentration in which the cells were grown had a strong positive effect on ALAD activity and the protein level. RNase protection analysis showed that the transcript quantity of hemB, the gene encoding ALAD, was iron dependent; thus, iron regulates hemB at the mRNA level. Induction of hemB mRNA in response to iron was rapid, suggesting that the factor(s) needed to mediate iron control was present in iron-limited cells and did not need to be synthesized de novo. ALAD protein levels and enzyme activities were similar in cells of the wild type and a heme-defective strain, indicating that control by iron is not an indirect effect of the cellular heme status. We conclude that the heme biosynthetic pathway is coordinated with cellular iron levels and that this control may prevent the accumulation of toxic porphyrin intermediates. 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3a5-aminolevulinate synthase 3aenzyme activity 3apH 3ametal ions 3amagnesium 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aheat stability 3atemperature 3agene expression 3astructural genes 3amessenger RNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChlorides 2aFerric Compoundsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxdrug effects 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aHemexbiosynthesis 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMagnesiumxpharmacology 2aMetals, Heavyxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPorphobilinogen Synthasexbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Bacterialxbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aRhizobiaceaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTemperature 0aregulation 0ahemb gene 0ahemh gene1 aTitus, D.E.1 aO'Brian, M.R.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Sept., v. 179, no. 17 p.5516-5520x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02868naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002600149245018000175300001800355520079300373650002301166650002101189650002301210650001601233650002501249650002501274650002001299650001801319650002401337650003301361650001801394650003101412650002301443650002101466650003001487650005401517650003101571650002401602650003301626650002801659650002901687650002901716650003201745650002701777650003401804650003601838653002301874653002401897653001901921653001401940653002801954700001701982700001901999700001702018700001702035773008602052852000902138930003302147945001302180946001302193655001202206IND2062324620221118123837.0980309e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206232462DNAL7 a92870182pmid7 aPMC1794342pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapot-Chartier, M.P.10aCharacterization of cspB, a cold-shock-inducible gene from Lactococcus lactis, and evidence for a family of genes homologous to the Escherichia coli cspA major cold shock gene  ap. 5589-5593.  aUpon temperature downshift, the major cold shock protein CspA is highly induced in Escherichia coli. This protein being conserved in other bacteria, we used a PCR-based approach with a pair of degenerate primers derived from highly conserved regions of the CspA-related proteins to evidence the presence of at least three related genes in Lactococcus lactis. One of them, cspB, was cloned and sequenced. It encodes a 66-residue protein which possesses 60% sequence identity with E. coli CspA. Following a cold shock from 30 to 15 degrees , the level of the cspB mRNA transcript increased, as shown by Northern blot hybridization. In addition, induction of cspB-directed beta-galactosidase activity was observed. These results indicate that the L. lactis cspB gene is cold shock inducible. 3aLactococcus lactis 3astructural genes 3abacterial proteins 3acold stress 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCold Temperature 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxphysiology 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aHeat-Shock Proteins 2aLactococcus lactisxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteins 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0agenetic regulation 0acold shock proteins 0agenbank/y10181 0acspb gene 0amolecular sequence data1 aSchouler, C.1 aLepeuple, A.S.1 aGripon, J.C.1 aChopin, M.C.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Sept., v. 179, no. 17 p.5589-5593x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03229naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245010300162300001800265520158600283650002901869650001301898650001301911650001001924650001701934650002401951650001501975650002601990650002002016650001802036650003002054650005902084650002802143650006102171650003102232650004602263650006802309650003802377650002602415650003802441653001402479700002302493700001402516700001602530773008502546852000902631930003302640945001302673946001302686655001202699IND2061147120221118123932.0980108e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206114712DNAL7 a92442842pmid7 aPMC1793432pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBony, M.10aLocalization and cell surface anchoring of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae flocculation protein Flo1p  ap. 4929-4936.  aThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae FLO1 gene encodes a large 1,536-amino-acid serine- and threonine-rich protein involved in flocculation. We have assessed the localization of Flo1p by immunoelectron microscopy, and in this study we show that this protein is located in the external mannoprotein layer of the cell wall, at the plasma membrane level and in the periplasm. The protein was also visualized in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the nuclear envelope, indicating that it was secreted through the secretory pathway. The protein was detected by Western blotting in cell wall extracts as a high-molecular-mass (> 200 kDa) polydisperse material obviously as a result of extensive N and probably O glycosylation. Flo1p was extracted from cell walls in large amounts by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that it is noncovalently anchored to the cell wall network. The membranous forms of Flo1p were shown to be solubilized by phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment, suggesting that Flo1p is glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored to this organelle. The expression of truncated forms with the hydrophobic C-terminal domain deleted led to the secretion of the protein in the culture medium. The hydrophobic C terminus, which is a putative GPI anchoring domain, is therefore necessary for the attachment of Flo1p in the cell wall. Deletion analysis also revealed that the N-terminal domain of Flo1p was essential for cellular aggregation. On the whole, our data indicate that Flo1p is a true cell wall protein which plays a direct role in cell-cell interaction. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aproteins 3aadhesion 3acells 3aflocculation 3aimmunocytochemistry 3acell walls 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aplasma membrane 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMannose-Binding Lectins 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Immunoelectron 2aPhosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSubcellular Fractions 2aType C Phospholipasesxmetabolism 0aperiplasm1 aThines-Sempoux, D.1 aBarre, P.1 aBlondin, B.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Aug., v. 179, no. 15 p.4929-4936x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03661naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002200149245014500171300001800316500001500334520166500349650002702014650001802041650002402059650001402083650001802097650001402115650001302129650002502142650001002167650001502177650002402192650001202216650002502228650001802253650001902271650002502290650002102315650005402336650002602390650002802416650002402444650001402468650001302482650003902495650002302534650003402557653001902591653002002610653001902630653001302649653002802662653002502690653002802715653001902743653001902762700001302781700001602794773008502810852000902895930003302904945001302937946001302950655001202963IND2061146620221118123920.0980108e199708  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206114662DNAL7 a92442642pmid7 aPMC1793232pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Ham, R.C.H.J.10aPutative evolutionary origin of plasmids carrying the genes involved in leucine biosynthesis in Buchnera aphidicola (endosymbiont of aphids)  ap. 4768-4777.  a2019-12-05  aAn 8.5-kb plasmid encoding genes (leuABCD) involved in leucine biosynthesis and a small plasmid of 1.74 kb of yet unknown function were found in the intracellular symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, of two divergent aphid species, Thelaxes suberi and Tetraneura caerulescens, respectively. The leuABCD-carrying plasmid (pBTs1) was amplified from total aphid DNA by inverse long PCR, using outwardly oriented oligonucleotide primers specific to leuA. The resulting 8.2-kb PCR fragment as well as the 1.74-kb plasmid (pBTc1) were cloned and sequenced. pBTs1 differed from a previously described B. aphidicola plasmid (pRPE) of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi by the presence of a small heat shock gene (ibp) and in the order of the leuABCD and repA genes. Comparison of both leucine plasmids to the small plasmid pBTc1 revealed extensive similarity with respect to putative replication functions as well as in the presence of a highly conserved open reading frame that was found to be homologous to Escherichia coli YqhA and Haemophilus influenzae HI0507 and which may encode an integral membrane protein. The three B. aphidicola plasmids most likely evolved from a common ancestral replicon, which in turn may be distantly related to IncFII plasmids. Phylogenetic affiliations of the B. aphidicola strains of the two aphid species were assessed by sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes. Evaluation of the distribution of the leuABCD-encoding plasmids within a phylogenetic framework suggests independent origins for pBTs1 and pRPE from an ancestral replicon resembling pBTc1. The implications for symbiotic essential amino acid biosynthesis and provisioning are discussed. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aribosomal RNA 3aopen reading frames 3asymbionts 3aribosomal DNA 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3aTetraneura 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxmicrobiology 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Ribosomal 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aLeucinexbiosynthesis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPhylogeny 2aPlasmids 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aReplication Origin 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0agenbank/y11966 0athelaxes suberi 0agenbank/y11972 0athelaxes 0atetraneura caerulescens 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/y11974 0agenbank/y119731 aMoya, A.1 aLatorre, A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Aug., v. 179, no. 15 p.4768-4777x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02522naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245007600167300001800243500001500261520033300276650002900609650002000638650002100658650002900679650002500708650002000733650002300753650001200776650002600788650001900814650002800833650002000861650002100881650002100902650003400923650003300957650002500990650003001015650004201045650002101087650003301108650004101141650005801182650003601240650002801276650002901304650002501333650002201358650003701380650001401417650003601431653001401467653002801481653001601509653002501525653001901550700001601569700001701585700001501602700001801617773008501635852000901720930003301729945001301762946001301775655001201788IND2061120620221118123855.0980107e199707  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206112062DNAL7 a92262752pmid7 aPMC1793012pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenelli, E.M.10aEvidence for two possible glnB-type genes in Herbaspirillum seropedicae  ap. 4623-4626.  a2019-12-05  aTwo glnB-like genes have been isolated from Herbaspirillum seropedicae by complementation of the Klebsiella pneumoniae glnB502 mutant for growth on nitrate.

Monnet, M. Nardi, A. Chopin, M.-C. Chopin, and J.-C. Gripon, J. Biol. Chem. 269:32070-32076, 1994]) is located on the lactose-proteinase plasmid of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris NCDO763. Use of the pepF1 gene as a probe with different strains showed that pepF1 is present on the chromosome of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403, whereas there is a second, homologous gene, pepF2 on the chromosome of strain NCDO763. From hybridization, PCR amplification, and sequencing experiments, we deduced that (i) pepF1 and pepF2 exhibit 80% identity and encode two proteins which are 84% identical and (ii) pepF2 is included in an operon composed of three open reading frames and is transcribed from two promoters. The protein, encoded by the gene located downstream of pepF2, shows significant homology with methyltransferases. Analysis of the sequences flanking pepF1 and pepF2 indicates that only a part of the pepF2 operon is present on the plasmid of strain NCDO763, while the operon is intact on the chromosome of strain IL1403. Traces of several recombination events are visible on the lactose-proteinase plasmid. This suggests that the duplication of pepF occurred by recombination from the chromosome of an L. lactis subsp. lactis strain followed by gene transfer. We discuss the possible functions of PepF and the role of its amplification. 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3astructural genes 3achromosomes 3aopen reading frames 3aplasmids 3aamino acid sequences 3apeptidases 3achromosome mapping 3aoperon 3agenetic recombination 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aLactococcus lactisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aLactosexgenetics 2aMetalloendopeptidasesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOperon 2aPlasmids 2aRecombination, Genetic 0aduplication 0aoligopeptidase 0agenbank/x99798 0apepf1 gene 0agenbank/x99710 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0apepf2 gene1 aRenault, P.1 aMonney, V.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 July, v. 179, no. 13 p.4164-4171x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01714naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245008100163300001800244500001500262520051300277650001700790650002000807650001300827650002700840650002000867650006200887650001700949650004100966650006901007650002601076653001701102700001601119700001501135773008601150852000901236930003301245945001301278946001301291655001201304IND2063271420221118123901.0980421e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206327142DNAL7 a92944612pmid7 aPMC1794932pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, L.10aPurification of the Azotobacter vinelandii nifV-encoded homocitrate synthase  ap. 5963-5966.  a2019-12-05  aThe nifV gene product (NifV) from Azotobacter vinelandii was recombinantly expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and purified.

Following random mutagenesis of dctD, 55 independent mutant forms of DctD that failed to activate transcription from a dctA'-'lacZ reporter gene in Escherichia coli were selected, and the amino acid substitutions were determined for these mutant proteins. Amino acid substitutions were distributed throughout the central domain of the protein, the domain responsible for transcription activation, but most of the substitutions occurred within three highly conserved regions of the protein. Selected mutant proteins were purified, and their activities were studied in vitro. All of the purified mutant proteins appeared to have normal DNA-binding activity and interacted with sigma 54 and core RNA polymerase, as determined from protein cross-linking assays. Proteins with amino acid substitutions in a region spanning amino acid positions 222 to 225 retained their ATPase activities, whereas proteins with substitutions in other regions had little or no ATPase activity. Taken together, these data suggest that the region that encompasses amino acid residues 222 through 225 probably functions in coupling the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to open complex formation rather than as a major determinant for binding to RNA polymerase. 3atranscription factors 3aDNA 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3amutants 3ahydrolysis 3aDNA-binding domains 3aenzyme activity 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteins 2aBinding Sites 2aDNA Footprinting 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerasesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Binding 2aSequence Deletion 2aSigma Factorxgenetics 2aSinorhizobium melilotixgenetics 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0abinding 0atranscriptional activators 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aHoover, T.R.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Sept., v. 179, no. 18 p.5812-5819x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02771naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100001900199245009400218300001400312500002400326520100900350650001101359650001601370650002301386650001701409650001501426650002201441650001701463650002901480650002001509650002001529650002901549650001701578650005101595650002701646650002201673650002001695650001301715650006401728650002401792653002201816700001901838700002301857700001901880773012301899852000902022856009302031930003302124945002502157946001102182655001202193IND4410137120221118123754.0080912e20080930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441013712DNAL7 a185991422pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2008.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ124 0aQ504 0aQ1041 aHjortmo, Sofia10aBiofortification of folates in white wheat bread by selection of yeast strain and process  ap. 32-36.  aIncludes references  aWe here demonstrate that folate content in yeast fermented food can be dramatically increased by using a proper (i) yeast strain and (ii) cultivation procedure for the selected strain prior to food fermentation. Folate levels were 3 to 5-fold higher in white wheat bread leavened with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CBS7764, cultured in defined medium and harvested in the respiro-fermentative phase of growth prior to dough preparation (135-139 μg/100 dry matter), compared to white wheat bread leavened with commercial Baker's yeast (27-43 μg/100 g). The commercial Baker's yeast strain had been industrially produced, using a fed-batch process, thereafter compressed and stored in the refrigerator until bakings were initiated. This strategy is an attractive alternative to fortification of bread with synthetically produced folic acid. By using a high folate producing strain cultured a suitable way folate levels obtained were in accordance with folic acid content in fortified cereal products. 3abreads 3abread dough 3afood fortification 3abakers yeast 3afolic acid 3adough development 3afermentation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afortified foods 2aBreadxanalysis 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aFermentation 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood, Fortified 2aKinetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSpecies Specificity 0afood fermentation1 aPatring, Johan1 aJastrebova, Jelena1 aAndlid, Thomas0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2008 Sept. 30, v. 127, no. 1-2 p.32-36dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2008.06.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20081105b20081206c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03671naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002600149245008600175300001800261500001500279520130600294650002101600650001701621650002101638650002401659650002001683650002601703650003701729650001801766650001301784650001701797650002501814650002901839650001901868650001501887650002001902650001201922650001701934650001101951650001201962650001201974650002401986650003802010650002402048650004602072650005702118650001802175650004202193650002102235650002902256650002502285650004602310650004102356650002802397650003002425650002902455650002702484650002502511653002802536653001402564653001902578653001502597653002502612700002502637700001602662700001802678700001602696773008502712852000902797930003302806945001302839946001302852655001202865IND2081492920221118123809.0980511e199710  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND208149292DNAL7 a93352742pmid7 aPMC1795412pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoupil-Feuillerat, N.10aDual role of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis  ap. 6285-6293.  a2019-12-05  aThe alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase gene aldB is clustered with the genes for the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. It can be transcribed with BCAA genes under isoleucine regulation or independently of BCAA synthesis under the control of its own promoter. The product of aldB is responsible for leucine sensibility under valine starvation. In the presence of more than 10 micromolar leucine, the alpha-acetolactate produced by the biosynthetic acetohydroxy acid synthase IlvBN is transformed to acetoin by AldB and, consequently, is not available for valine synthesis. AldB is also involved in acetoin formation in the 2,3-butanediol pathway, initiated by the catabolic acetolactate synthase, AlsS. The differences in the genetic organization, the expression, and the kinetics parameters of these enzymes between L. lactis and Klebsiella terrigena, Bacillus subtilis, or Leuconostoc oenos suggest that this pathway plays a different role in the metabolism in these bacteria. Thus, the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase from L. lactis plays a dual role in the cell: (i) as key regulator of valine and leucine biosynthesis, by controlling the acetolactate flux by a shift to catabolism; and (ii) as an enzyme catalyzing the second step of the 2,3-butanediol pathway. 3apromoter regions 3afermentation 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3agene expression 3aamino acid metabolism 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3amessenger RNA 3adiacetyl 3apyruvic acid 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3acarboxy-lyases 3aisoleucine 3aenzyme activity 3aleucine 3abiosynthesis 3avaline 3amutants 3aacetoin 2aAcetoinxmetabolism 2aAcetolactate Synthasexmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxbiosynthesis 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCarboxy-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aIsoleucinexbiosynthesis 2aLactatesxmetabolism 2aLactococcus lactisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aLeucinexbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aPyruvic Acidxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aValinexbiosynthesis 0amolecular sequence data 0aaldb gene 0agenbank/u92974 0ametabolism 0anucleotide sequences1 aCocaign-Bousquet, M.1 aGodon, J.J.1 aEhrlich, S.D.1 aRenault, P.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1997 Oct., v. 179, no. 20 p.6285-6293x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03205naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100002400193245008500217300001600302500002400318500001500342520107500357650001601432650002401448650001401472650001601486650002501502650002101527650001501548650002001563650002301583650001601606650001201622650001601634650002301650650002001673650002101693650002201714650002801736650002801764650001101792650004001803650005601843650003401899650003301933650004201966650001102008650001602019650003202035650003402067651001102101653002202112653000902134653001302143653002202156653002202178700002402200773008202224852000902306856008702315930003302402945002502435946001102460655001202471IND4410140720221118123746.0080912e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441014072DNAL7 a184993002pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aE720 0aX1001 aScholderer, Joachim14aThe dynamics of consumer behaviour : On habit, discontent, and other fish to fry  ap. 576-591.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRecent research has drawn attention to the role of past behaviour and habit in the overall structure of consumer behaviour. We argue that in cross-sectional data past behaviour and habit must be confounded with present beliefs and attitudes when the behaviour in question has been enacted numerous times before. To disentangle the effects, longitudinal data were collected from a large panel of Norwegian consumers (effective N =4184) in 1996, 2000, and 2004. Cross-lagged panel analysis indicated that higher consumption of traditional seafood led to increasingly negative evaluations of the product supply. These negative evaluations, in turn, prompted substitution of traditional seafood with newly available, processed seafood products and an increasing dominance of aqua-cultured species. The theoretical discussion focuses on the inability of static models of consumer behaviour (in particular, the theory of planned behaviour) to capture such dynamic effects. Marketing and policy implications related to the changing structure of the seafood market are outlined. 3afood intake 3amathematical models 3alean fish 3afrozen fish 3alongitudinal studies 3aconsumer surveys 3afatty fish 3aprocessed foods 3aconsumer attitudes 3afarmed fish 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aAttitude to Health 2aChoice Behavior 2aCommercextrends 2aConsumer Behavior 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aFish Productsxanalysisxstandards. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxprevention & control. 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology. 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSeafoodxanalysisxstandards. 3aNorway 0aconsumer behavior 0adiet 0aseafoods 0ainternal barriers 0aexternal barriers1 aTrondsen, Torbjørn0 tAppetite.g2008 Nov., v. 51, no. 3 p.576-591dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.04.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20081105b20081206c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/10/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03737naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008900146300001600235520176600251650001602017650001102033650001702044650001802061650002002079650002002099650002402119650001802143650001602161650001302177650003902190650005602229650001202285650003502297650003302332650002502365650004102390650004302431650004802474650004702522650000902569650003102578650002302609650002602632650002902658650006702687650002202754650003902776650003002815653001202845653003102857700002002888700001802908700001702926700001802943773008302961852000903044939003303053946001303086655001203099IND9202905320221118123823.0920511e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920290532DNAL7 a15482032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoseley, W.M.10aRecombinant bovine somatotropin improves growth performance in finishing beef steers  ap. 412-425.  aThe objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of various doses of rbST on ADG and feed efficiency (FE) and to describe carcass composition changes in finishing beef steers. In Exp. 1, 96 crossbred beef steers (393 kg) received daily i.m. injections of buffer or 33, 100, or 300 microgram/kg of BW of rbst (0ST, 33ST, 1OOST, 300ST). In Exp. 2, 200 crossbred beef steers (417 kg) received daily i.m. injections of buffer or 8.25, 16.5, 33, or 66 microgram/kg of BW of rbST (0ST, 8.25ST, 16.5ST, 33ST, 66ST). Treatments were administered until steer BW per pen averaged 540 kg in Exp. 1 and 560 kg in Exp. 2. An 86% concentrate:14% roughage diet was fed once daily (CP: 16.5% in Exp. 1, 20.2% in Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, growth performance of steers receiving rbst was dose-dependent; ADG changed linearly (P = .01), DMI decreased linearly (P = .03), and FE changed quadratically (P < .03). The 33ST steers responded with improved ADG and FE, 100ST with improved FE, and 300ST with lower ADG and poorer FE, compared with 0ST. In Exp. 2, the ADG response was quadratic (P = .01), DMI decreased linearly (P = .003), and FE improved quadratically (P = .004) with increasing dose of rbst. Steers receiving 16.5ST and 33ST responded with improved ADG and FE, whereas steers receiving 8.25ST and 66ST responded with improved FE but not ADG relative to 0ST steers. In Exp. 1 and 2, rbST administration altered carcass composition by increasing carcass protein and decreasing carcass fat. Our results indicate that a daily dose between 16.5 and 33 microgram/kg of BW was required to optimize both ADG and FE in finishing beef steers; however, the dose response for changes in carcass chemical composition had not attained a plateau even at 300 microgram/kg of BW. 3abeef cattle 3asteers 3asomatotropin 3adose response 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3acarcass composition 3acarcass yield 3ablood serum 3aabomasum 2aAbomasumxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aAdipose Tissuexdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxdrug effects 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aGrowth Hormonexbloodxpharmacology. 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMale 2aMeatxanalysisxstandards. 2aMuscle Development 2aMusclesxdrug effects 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aPituitary Gland, Anteriorxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aRandom Allocation 2aRecombinant Proteinsxpharmacology 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0alesions 0ainsulin-like growth factor1 aPaulissen, J.B.1 aGoodwin, M.C.1 aAlaniz, G.R.1 aClaflin, W.H.0 tJournal of animal science.g1992 Feb., v. 70, no. 2 p.412-425x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02984naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245022000144300001600364520142500380650001001805650001401815650002001829650001401849650002101863650001901884650001501903650001101918650001601929650002401945650003401969650001202003650001402015650003602029650002502065650001102090650004302101650002402144650001402168650002402182650004002206650002202246650002202268700001702290700002102307773008302328852000902411939003302420946001302453655001202466IND9202906720221118123656.0920511e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920290672DNAL7 a15482152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, C.A.10aEffects of exogenous estradiol-17 beta on luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and estradiol-17 beta concentrations before and after prostaglandin F2 alpha-induced termination of pregnancy and pseudopregnancy in gilts  ap. 518-524.  aThis study evaluated the influence of exogenous estradiol-170 (E2) administration on LH concentrations and the number of animals returning to estrus after the termination of pregnancy or pseudopregnancy in gilts. Gilts were mated (pregnant; n = 11) on the 1st d of estrus or received 5 mg of estradiol valerate i.m. at d 11 to 15 after the onset of estrus (pseudopregnant; n = 9). Gilts were treated with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha, 15 and 10 mg) at 12-h intervals on d 44 of pregnancy or pseudopregnancy. The day of abortion or luteolysis (progesterone < .2 ng/mL) was considered d 0. Six pregnant and four pseudopregnant gilts received s.c. an E2 capsule (24 mg of E2) on d -20 and additional E2 capsules on d -13 and -6. The E2 capsules were removed on the day after PGF2 alpha, administration. Blood samples were collected at 12-h intervals from d -21 to -3, at 6-h intervals from d -2 to 21 or the onset of estrus, and at 15-min intervals for 8 h on d -2, 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 18. After each 8-h sampling period, gilts were treated i.v. with GnRH at .5 microgram/kg of BW and blood samples collected at 10-min intervals for 3 h. A greater (P < .05) proportion of sham-treated gilts than of E2-treated gilts exhibited a preovulatory-like LH surge after abortion/luteolysis. It was evident that E2 supplementation before luteolysis reduced the ability of pregnant and pseudopregnant gilts to return to estrus. 3agilts 3aestradiol 3apseudopregnancy 3apregnancy 3ainduced abortion 3aprostaglandins 3aluteolysis 3aestrus 3ablood serum 3aluteinizing hormone 2aAbortion, Inducedxveterinary 2aAnimals 2aDinoprost 2aEstradiolxbloodxpharmacology. 2aEstrusxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aLuteinizing Hormonexbloodxsecretion. 2aOvaryxdrug effects 2aPregnancy 2aProgesteronexblood 2aPseudopregnancyxbloodxveterinary. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSwinexphysiology1 aAlmond, G.W.1 aEsbenshade, K.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g1992 Feb., v. 70, no. 2 p.518-524x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02467naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245006800145300001600213500002300229520096300252650002001215650001601235650001801251650002401269650002001293650001101313650002401324650002201348650001901370650001201389650001101401650004901412650001401461650001201475650007201487650006301559650001301622650006301635651001801698651001801716653002301734653002101757700001601778700001701794773008301811852000901894939003301903946001301936655001201949IND9202907620221118123738.0920511e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920290762DNAL7 a13477672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByford, R.L.12aA review of ectoparasites and their effect on cattle production  ap. 597-602.  aLiterature review.  aLosses in livestock production due to ectoparasite infestations exceed $2.26 billion annually. Over 50 species of ectoparasites infest cattle throughout the United States. The horn fly, Haematobia irritans (L.), is the most important and widespread of the five to six major pest species of pastured cattle in the southern region. Results from the examination of production traits from cattle under ectoparasite burdens have been variable, ranging from no effect to significant reductions in weight gains. Because of this inconsistency, specific physiological and nutritional responses in cattle infested or not infested with horn flies have been examined. Data have shown significant differences in nitrogen retention, blood cortisol concentrations, vital signs, water consumption, and urine production. Implications are that total energy balance is altered when an animal is exposed to ectoparasite infestations, thereby resulting in decreased productivity. 3ameat production 3abeef cattle 3aectoparasites 3aHaematobia irritans 3aliveweight gain 3acalves 3anitrogen metabolism 3ablood composition 3aweaning weight 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxeconomicsxphysiopathology. 2aCulicidae 2aDiptera 2aEctoparasitic Infestationsxeconomicsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aLice Infestationsxeconomicsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aMuscidae 2aTick Infestationsxeconomicsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0aliterature reviews 0agrazing behavior1 aCraig, M.E.1 aCrosby, B.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g1992 Feb., v. 70, no. 2 p.597-602x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01629naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009300125300001400218520073000232650001500962650001000977650002000987650002101007650003101028650003601059700001601095700001401111700001401125700001401139700001501153773007001168852000901238939003301247946001101280655001201291IND9202929420221118123740.0920508e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920292942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomoda, M.12aA reticuloendothelial system-activating glycan from the roots of Astragalus membranaceus  ap. 63-66.  aFrom the hot water extract of the roots of Astragalus membranaceus, a glycan, designated as AMem-P, has been isolated by treatment with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide followed by column chromatography on Toyopearl HW60F and Con A-Sepharose columns.

The Pda6 gene was mapped by electrophoretic karyotype analysis to a small meiotically unstable chromosome that is dispensable for normal growth. Such traits are typical of B chromosomes. The strains of Nectria studied here have no sequences that are homologous to the Pda family other than Pda6 and therefore demonstrate that unique, functional genes can be found on B chromosomes.

The latter group was divided into equal numbers of adolescents who were employed, unemployed, school students, and college students. The Offer Self-image Questionnaire for Adolescents was used to measure self-concept. Other measures used were the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hopelessness Scale of Beck et al., and the Rotter Internal External Loctus of Control Scale. These were used to examine the relationship between deficits in self-concept and psychopathology. Environmental factory such as family relationships, employment, school achievement, and friendships were also examined. It was found that homeless adolescents demonstrated significant deficts in five areas of self-concept and a specific pattern of deficits was related to hopelessness. Results were discussed with reference to the theory that acting-out behavior mitigates the impact of affective disturbance on self concept. 3asexual behavior 3ahouseholds 3afamily problems 3aattitudes and opinions 3ahomeless people 3aemployment 3aself-esteem 3ajuvenile delinquency 3aadolescents 0amoral values 0asocial interaction 0aself reliance 0aaspirations 0aeducational opportunities 0arelationships 0aself-perception 0afamily relations0 tJournal of youth and adolescence.g1991 Oct., v. 20, no. 5 p.545-560x0047-28917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF015406373Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01349naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006900124300001600193520038700209650001600596650001600612650001900628650001900647650002400666650002200690650002200712650002800734650002200762650001800784650001100802650002500813700001400838773008000852852000900932939003300941946001300974655001200987IND9202901720221118124056.0920511s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920290172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Y.Z.10aVariation of the phenolic hydroxyl group content in wood lignins  ap. 467-472.  aThe phenolic hydroxyl group content of wood lignin has been determined in situ by a periodate oxidation method for four softwood and six hardwood species.

Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose) was used as a control substrate. When untreated bagasse and bagasse alkali-treated at room temperature were used, appreciable cellulase activity was found (0.085 and 0.090 IU/ml, respectively), but activity was lower than when Avicel was used (0.163 IU/ml). Enzyme yields were 16, 19 and 22 IU/g cellulose consumed, respectively. Cellulase activity was not detected when bagasse alkali-treated at 100 degrees C was used. The biomass yield was about 30% lower when bagasse was used as a substrate than when Avicel was used. The yield was higher when bagasse was alkali-treated than when untreated bagasse was used, although the difference was small. The biomass yield was 0.78 g biomass per g cellulose consumed for alkali-treated bagasse at room temperature versus 0.50 g/g for bagasse alkali-treated at 100 degrees C, 0.57 g/g for untreated bagasse and 0.67 g/g for Avicel. It was concluded that untreated bagasse is as good a substrate for cellulase and biomass production as bagasse alkali-treated at room temperature. 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aalkali treatment 3aambient temperature 3abiomass production 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afermentation 3apH 3asugarcane bagasse1 aFerrer, A.1 aLedesma, A.0 tBioresource technology.g1996 July, v. 57, no. 1 p.13-18x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01633naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007700125300001400202520066900216650001600885650002000901650002600921650001600947650002300963650001900986650001101005650001801016650000901034650002001043650001901063700001801082700001501100773007801115852000901193930003301202945001301235946001101248655001201259IND2055266020221118123854.0970206e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205526602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSastre, I.10aInfluence of the application of sewage sludge on soil microbial activity  ap. 19-23.  aMicrobial populations and enzyme activities in a soil amended with sewage sludge in a long-term field experiment were studied in relation to the decomposition of organic matter Two kinds of sewage sludges were applied to the soil at rates of 50 and 100 tons/ha/year for 8 years.

We report that PGRN bound directly to tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) and disturbed the TNFα-TNFR interaction. PGRN-deficient mice were susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis, and administration of PGRN reversed inflammatory arthritis. Atsttrin, an engineered protein composed of three PGRN fragments, exhibited selective TNFR binding. PGRN and Atsttrin prevented inflammation in multiple arthritis mouse models and inhibited TNFα-activated intracellular signaling. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PGRN is a ligand of TNFR, an antagonist of TNFα signaling, and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis in mice. They also suggest new potential therapeutic interventions for various TNFα-mediated pathologies and conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3acarcinogenesis 3aembryogenesis 3ainflammation 3aligands 3amice 3areceptors 3arheumatoid arthritis 3atissue repair 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aLu, Yi1 aTian, Qing-Yun1 aZhang, Yan1 aGuo, Feng-Jin1 aLiu, Guang-Yi1 aSyed, Nabeel Muzaffar1 aLai, Yongjie1 aLin, Edward Alan1 aKong, Li1 aSu, Jeffrey1 aYin, Fangfang1 aDing, Ai-Hao1 aZanin-Zhorov, Alexandra1 aDustin, Michael L.1 aTao, Jian1 aCraft, Joseph1 aYin, Zhinan1 aFeng, Jian Q.1 aAbramson, Steven B.1 aYu, Xiu-Ping1 aLiu, Chuan-ju0 tScience.g2011 Apr. 22, v. 332, no. 6028 p.478-484dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11992143Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110424  aOther US 7aarticle02130naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009000126300001600216520118900232650001201421650001101433650001601444650001001460650000901470650002301479650001101502650001101513650001301524650001001537650001301547650001101560650000901571700001801580773008001598852000901678930003301687945001301720946001101733655001201744IND2056033720221118115447.0970319e199608  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205603372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, R.L.10aOptimization of a wood-waste-fuelled, indirectly fired gas turbine cogeneration plant  ap. 117-126.  aCogeneration of electricity and heat for drying lumber has been proposed, utilizing the wood-waste fuel generated as a byproduct of the sawmilling process. In older sawmills this has been achieved using conventional boilers and steam turbines to produce both electricity and process heat. The current use of steam systems on the small-scale of most sawmills is not usually economic, however. This paper presents the results of a study which examined the optimization of a gas-turbine-based cogeneration system, which eliminates the need for steam generation and distribution. Several systems which utilize an indirectly fired gas turbine have been analyzed to determine the optimum arrangement from an economic and technical point of view. Linear programming was used to determine the most attractive option economically. The overall conclusion drawn is that cogeneration is an economically attractive option for disposing of wood wastes for those sawmills which require large amounts of process heat, typically of the order of 20 MW, or more. In general it was found that cash flow was maximized when the cogeneration system was sized to meet the thermal requirements of the sawmill. 3aboilers 3adrying 3aelectricity 3afuels 3aheat 3alinear programming 3alumber 3asawing 3asawmills 3asteam 3aturbines 3awastes 3awood1 aZaradic, A.M.0 tBioresource technology.g1996 Aug., v. 57, no. 2 p.117-126x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01791naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245008300164300001600247520062500263650001300888650001500901650002600916650001300942650001200955650001100967700002100978700001600999700002001015700001801035700001901053700002101072700002001093700001701113773012501130852000901255856008301264939003301347946001301380655001201393IND4457091620221118115420.0110423e20110422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445709162DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12015782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeurohr, Gabriel12aA Midzone-Based Ruler Adjusts Chromosome Compaction to Anaphase Spindle Length  ap. 465-468.  aPartitioning of chromatids during mitosis requires that chromosome compaction and spindle length scale appropriately with each other. However, it is not clear whether chromosome condensation and spindle elongation are linked. Here, we find that yeast cells could cope with a 45% increase in the length of their longest chromosome arm by increasing its condensation. The spindle midzone, aurora/Ipl1 activity, and Ser10 of histone H3 mediated this response. Thus, the anaphase spindle may function as a ruler to adapt the condensation of chromatids, promoting their segregation regardless of chromosome or spindle length. 3aanaphase 3achromatids 3achromosome morphology 3ahistones 3amitosis 3ayeasts1 aNaegeli, Andreas1 aTitos, Iris1 aTheler, Dominik1 aGreber, Basil1 aDíez, Javier.1 aGabaldón, Toni.1 aMendoza, Manuel1 aBarral, Yves0 tScience.g2011 Apr. 22, v. 332, no. 6028 p.465-468dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12015783Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110424  aOther US 7aarticle02312naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010600125300001400231520105300245650003001298650001701328650002101345650001501366650001901381650001801400650002201418650001501440650001701455650002001472650001601492650002501508650001301533650000701546650001601553650001901569650002001588650001801608650001101626650001601637650001101653700002201664773007801686852000901764930003301773945001301806946001101819655001201830IND2058221620221118115506.0970707e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205822162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhamed, J.10aChemical and microbial changes in fish viscera during fermentation ensiling at different temperatures  ap. 45-46.  aFermentation ensiling of fresh water fish viscera with 10% (w/w) molasses, 0.5% (v/w) propionic acid and 0.02% (w/w) ethoxyquin at 26 +/- 2 degrees C and 37 degrees C was investigated.

The rise in temperature which occurred as composting progressed was accompanied by an increase in ammonia and volatile fatty acid production. This overall pattern was observed in all four mixes, whereby the concentrations of ammonia and volatile fatty acids increased rapidly and then declined gradually over the course of monitoring. The changes in their concentrations over time proved to be a reliable indicator of the progress of the composting process. Ammonia emissions from the composting piles were reduced by the additions of peat moss, vermiculite, and alder, in comparison to the headspace ammonia level for the fir mix. The results indicated that ammonia management during the composting process could be easily accomplished by the use of suitable amendments or bulking agents. Peat moss and vermiculite were found to be good amendments for fish composting and alder was found to be a good bulking agent. 3aSphagnum 3aammonia 3abulking agents 3acomposting 3aemissions 3afish 3afish waste 3aheadspace analysis 3amonitoring 3atemperature 3avermiculite 3avolatile fatty acids1 aJones, L.1 aLau, A.K.1 aWalkemeyer, S.1 aEgan, B.1 aHolbek, N.0 tBioresource technology.g1997 , v. 59, no. 2/3 p.163-168x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01725naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008600127300001600213520064800229650002200877650002700899650002000926650002300946650001900969650001200988650001401000650001101014650001401025650001401039650001901053650001001072650001301082700002201095700003901117700001501156773007801171852000901249930003301258945001301291946001101304655001201315IND2058322520221118115823.0970710e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205832252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarmegam, N.10aIndigenous-plant extracts as larvicidal agents against Culex quinquefasciatus Say  ap. 137-140.  aBioassay studies of the laboratory-colonised larvae (LCL) and field-collected larvae (FCL) of Culex quinquefasciatus with five different concentrations of 12 different plant extracts (petroleum ether solvent) showed that the extracts of Argemone mexicana, Jatropha curcus, Pergularia extensa and Withania somnifera had acute toxicity.

An array of 6mx6m plots was used, allowing spreading to be carried out by full-size agricultural machinery. The factors investigated were crop type (grass and wheat), soil type (sandy loam and clay), sludge type (sludges from two different paper mills, designated A and D), method of sludge application (surface spreading of dewatered sludge, surface spreading of undewatered sludge and subsurface injection of undewatered sludge) and rate of sludge application (5 and 10 t DM/ha in the first season and 10 and 20 t DM/ha in the second and third seasons: in all cases applied each September). Soil condition was assessed in detail both at the beginning of the experiment before any sludge was spread and after the end of the third season. All plots received mineral nitrogen fertiliser in amounts according to normal farming practice, ie. no 'credit' was given for any N, P or K content of the sludge. Several statistically significant differences in crop yield were found. The most pronounced difference was that Sludge A gave greater yields than did Sludge D. This effect was found for two seasons (1992 and 1993) for grass on clay soil as well as for one season (1992) for winter wheat on sandy loam soil (although in this last case yields were abnormally low). The cause of this effect was believed to be chemical differences between Sludges A and D, but they must be subtle ones because the only major chemical differences evident from the analyses were in the C/N ratios, the potassium and the lead contents, and in all three cases there was evidence that these particular chemical differences were not the cause of differences in crop yield. The second most pronounced effect was found with the wheat on clay soil. In all three seasons, there was a significant effect on yield of method of sludge application. The level of significance differed from year to year: in 1991 and 1993 it was weak but in 1992 it was very strong. In all three seasons, surface spreading of undewatered sludge gave the highest yields. The physical reason behind this effect may be differences in the distribution of sludge in the topsoil after sludge spread by the three different methods had been ploughed in prior to sowing the wheat. In most cases, topsoil condition, as assessed by the percentage of organic carbon, was significantly improved as a result of mill-sludge applications over 3 years. For example, grass plots on clay soil which received the higher rates of sludge application by injection had at the end of the experiment 2.99% organic carbon (Sludge D) and 3.15% organic carbon (Sludge A), while for the corresponding control plots, duplicate measurements gave 2.60 and 2.63%. In other, physical, tests to assess topsoil condition (e.g measuring vol% air capacity, vol% total pore space and vol% total available water), it was found that, on the plots selected (all of which were wheat plots), spreading mill sludge over 3 years significantly improved the topsoil condition for the clay soil, but hardly did so on the sandy loam soil. The general conclusions from this work were that although a number of statistically significant differences in crop yield were found, none of these was large in absolute terms, and that significant improvements in topsoil condition were found in most cases, particularly when this was assessed by measuring the percent organic carbon. Therefore, when developing any strategy for persuading farmers to accept paper-mill sludges on their land, the case should be based mainly on the potential improvements in soil condition, perhaps arguing that increases in crop yield should follow from successive improvements in soil condition over a number of years. Such a benefit ought in due course to be particularly evident in very dry seasons. 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3aair 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acredit 3acrop yield 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afertilizer rates 3agrasses 3alead 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aplowing 3apotassium 3apulp and paper mills 3asandy loam soils 3asludge 3asoil quality 3asowing 3atopsoil 3awinter wheat1 aKirkpatrick, N.1 aScotford, I.M.1 aWhite, R.P.1 aBurton, R.G.O.0 tBioresource technology.g1997 Apr., v. 60, no. 1 p.73-80x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02325naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245013100180300001800311500001500329520083400344650002101178650002101199650002201220650002001242650001501262650001501277650002001292650001901312650002101331650001901352650001501371650002401386650002001410650001101430650002101441650003101462650002101493650003001514650002101544653000901565700001301574700001601587700001801603773008401621852000901705930003301714945002501747946001101772655001201783IND4377405320221118115859.0060124e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437740532DNAL7 a159789902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effect of adsorption on contact time, concentration of MG and adsorbent dosage of the samples treated or carbonized at different temperatures were investigated. The results reveal that the optimum carbonization temperature is 500 degrees C in order to obtain adsorption capacity that is comparable to the commercial activated carbon for the husks treated by H3PO4. It is interesting to note that MG adsorbed preferably on carbon-rich than on silica rich-sites. It is found that the behaviour of H3PO4 treated absorbent followed both the Langmuir and Freundlich models while NaOH treated best fitted to only the Langmuir model. 3aactivated carbon 3asodium hydroxide 3awaste utilization 3aphosphoric acid 3arice hulls 3aadsorbents 3amalachite green 3aheat treatment 3aalkali treatment 3aacid treatment 2aAdsorption 2aCharcoalxchemistry 2aHot Temperature 2aOryza. 2aPhosphoric Acids 2aRosaniline Dyesxchemistry 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aSilicon Dioxidexanalysis 2aSodium Hydroxide 0adyes1 aSaad, B.1 aShaidan, S.1 aRizal, E.S.S.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 Sept., v. 96, no. 14 p.1578-1583x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01661naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001100146245006300157300001800220500001500238520049200253650001800745650002700763650001400790650002100804650001800825650002100843650002600864650004100890650002600931650002100957651001000978653002800988653002601016700001101042700001201053773008401065852000901149930003301158945002501191946001101216655001201227IND4377406920221118114619.0060124e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437740692DNAL7 a159369412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYildiz, U.C.10aMechanical properties and decay resistance of wood-polymer composites prepared from fast growing species in Turkey  ap. 1003-1011.  a2019-12-05  aSome mechanical properties of wood-polymer composites from maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) and poplar (Populus x. euramericana cv. I-214) wood were investigated. Three different monomers; styrene (ST), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene/methyl methacrylate (ST/MMA) mixture were used in preparation of wood-polymer composites (WPCs). Full-loading (FL), half-loading (HL) and quarter-loading (QL) were used as polymer content levels. Untreated pine and pine-polymer composite samples were tested in compression strength parallel to grain and static bending strength. WPCs mechanical properties increased compared to untreated wood. The polymer had greater effect on the strengths of the ST/MMA treated pine than on the ST and MMA treated pine samples. Increasing of the mechanical properties should improve the structural competitiveness of WPCs made from fast growing-low density woods. Weight losses due to fungal attack for pine and poplar-polymer composites were also determined. Although polymers at full and half loading levels helped decreasing weight losses due to both fungi for each wood species, weight losses were still found to be higher. 3acompressibility 3adecay resistance 3astyrene 3abending strength 3abrown-rot fungi 3awhite-rot fungi 3aConiophora puteana 3aPopulus canadensis 3aPinus pinaster 3aCoriolus versicolor 3acomposite wood products 2aCompressive Strength 2aFungixphysiology 2aManufactured Materialsxanalysis 2aMaterials Testing 2aMechanics 2aPinusxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aPopulusxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aTensile Strength 2aWood 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkey 0amethyl methacrylate 0amechanical properties 0astrength (mechanics)1 aYildiz, S.1 aGezer, E.D.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 June, v. 96, no. 9 p.1003-1011x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03764naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163072001700180072001700197100001400214245014600228300001800374520209400392650002102486650001602507650002602523650002002549650002502569650002002594650002102614650002402635650001902659650001702678650001502695650002302710650002502733650001202758650001102770650003802781650004802819650001902867650002202886650002002908650003502928650001702963651001002980651001002990700001403000773008203014852000903096930003303105945002503138946001103163655001203174IND4377408120221118114556.0060124e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437740812DNAL7 a156681982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSingh, G.10aGrowth of Dalbergia sissoo in desert regions of western India using municipal effluent and the subsequent changes in soil and plant chemistry  ap. 1019-1028.  aIncreasing demand for fodder and fuelwood and the scarcity of a good quality water in arid areas has resulted in a search for an alternative source of water for biomass production. An experiment utilizing municipal effluent in growing Dalbergia sissoo was conducted. Five treatments included T1, municipal effluent at 1 PET (Potential evapo-transpiration) (without plant); T2, municipal effluent at 1/2 PET; T3, municipal effluent at 1PET; T4, municipal effluent at 2 PET; and T5, canal water at 1 PET. Observations included plant height, collar diameter at one-month intervals and plant mineral composition, mineral uptake and changes in soil properties at 24 months of plant age. Application of municipal effluent produced better growth in D. sissoo seedlings. Concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) were greater in seedlings irrigated with municipal effluent than those of the seedlings irrigated by the treatment T5, and positively related with the quantity of irrigation. The concentrations were greatest in foliage compared to the other parts of seedling, with the exception of Cu concentration. Application of municipal effluents resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the concentrations of soil K, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, whereas NH4-N and PO4-P availability increased by 8.1- and 4.5-fold, respectively. The increase in soil organic carbon was only observed in treatments T3 and T4. The accumulations of soil NO3-N, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were more in lower soil layers but the other soil parameters showed their greatest values in the upper soil layer. Irrigation using municipal effluent did not result in toxicity to the seedlings before the age of 24 months. The results suggest that municipal effluent could be utilized, as an important source of water and nutrients in growing D. sissoo to increase biomass production in the needs of suburban dwellers. However, a preliminary treatment to reduce excess NH4-N and PO4-P will be required before application to the plantation. 3aDalbergia sissoo 3atree growth 3awastewater irrigation 3asewage effluent 3awastewater treatment 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient content 3asoil organic matter 3asoil fertility 3adesert soils 3aarid soils 3amultipurpose trees 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBiomass 2aCities 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDalbergiaxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aDesert Climate 2aSewagexchemistry 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Supply 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aBhati, M.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 June, v. 96, no. 9 p.1019-1028x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02960naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245011600178300001800294520158700312650002001899650001901919650002201938650002101960650001901981650001802000650001702018650001202035650003002047650004302077650002502120650002802145650002902173650002502202650003402227650003002261653002302291700001602314773008202330852000902412930003302421945002502454946001102479655001202490IND4377408720221118114606.0060124e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437740872DNAL7 a156682032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGarg, V.K.10aVermistabilization of textile mill sludge spiked with poultry droppings by an epigeic earthworm Eisenia foetida  ap. 1063-1071.  aInvestigations were made to explore the potential of an epigeic earthworm Eisenia foetida to transform textile mill sludge spiked with poultry droppings in to value added product, i.e., vermicompost. The growth and reproduction of E. foetida was monitored in a range of different feed mixtures for 77 days in the laboratory under controlled experimental conditions. The maximum growth was recorded in 100% cow dung (CD). Replacement of poultry droppings by cow dung in feed mixtures and vice versa had little or no effect on worm growth rate and reproduction potential. Worms grew and reproduced favourably in 70% poultry droppings (PD) + 30% solid textile mill sludge (STMS) and 60% PD + 40% STMS feed mixtures. Greater percentage of STMS in the feed mixture significantly affected the biomass gain and cocoon production. Net weight gain by earthworms in 100% CD was 2.9-18.2 fold higher than different STMS containing feed mixtures. The mean number of cocoon production was between 23.4 +/- 4.65 (in 100% CD) and 3.6 +/- 1.04 (in 50% PD + 50% STMS) cocoons earthworm(-1) for different feed mixtures tested. Vermicomposting resulted in significant reduction in C:N ratio and increase in nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Total potassium, total calcium and heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Pb and Cd) contents were lower in the final product than initial feed mixtures. Our trials demonstrated vermicomposting as an alternate technology for the recycling and environmentally safe disposal/management of textile mill sludge using an epigeic earthworm E. foetida if mixed with poultry droppings. 3avermicomposting 3aEisenia fetida 3aindustrial wastes 3atextile industry 3apoultry manure 3aanimal growth 3areproduction 2aAnimals 2aBioreactorsxparasitology 2aIndustrial Wastexprevention & control 2aManurexparasitology 2aOligochaetaxphysiology 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aSewagexparasitology 2aSoilxanalysisxparasitology. 2aTextile Industryxmethods 0avermistabilization1 aKaushik, P.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 June, v. 96, no. 9 p.1063-1071x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02879naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001400180245016400194300001600358500001500374520103300389650001601422650002201438650001901460650001801479650001201497650001001509650001301519650002301532650002701555650002601582650001501608650001501623650001501638650001901653650001201672650003401684650005001718650001601768650001101784650001101795650004601806650003301852650003001885650002001915650002201935650002801957653001801985653002402003653003602027700002102063773007902084852000902163930003302172945002502205946001102230655001202241IND4377535920221118114615.0060131e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437753592DNAL7 a156275642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The resulting composts were evaluated as organic phosphate fertilizers for cowpea plants in pot experiments. The results showed that the maximum amount of soluble phosphorous (1000 ppm) was produced in composts inoculated with A. niger + T. viride with or without FYM. Any of the produced composts was much better than superphosphate fertilizer in providing the growing cowpea plants with phosphorous. Fertilization of the cowpea plants with the compost inoculated with FYM + A. niger + T. viride resulted in maximum amount of phosphorous uptake (295 ppm). The highest phosphate dissolving fungi numbers in rhizosphere soils of cowpea plants were obtained after fertilization with composts which received A. niger and T. viride treatments, while the highest phosphate dissolving bacterial numbers were found after fertilization with composts which received FYM treatments. 3arhizosphere 3aAspergillus niger 3aanimal manures 3asoil bacteria 3acowpeas 3aVigna 3acomposts 3aTrichoderma viride 3afertilizer application 3anutrient availability 3arice straw 3aphosphorus 3acomposting 3arock phosphate 2aAnimals 2aAspergillus nigerxphysiology 2aFabaceaexgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aFertilizers 2aManure 2aOryza. 2aPhosphatesxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aPhosphorusxpharmacokinetics 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aRefuse Disposal 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTrichodermaxphysiology 0aHypocrea rufa 0aorganic fertilizers 0aphosphate-solubulizing bacteria1 aAbdel-Motaal, H.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 May, v. 96, no. 8 p.929-935x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/05/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02038naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014200127300001200269520098800281650002401269650001901293650001601312650002101328650001001349650001901359650001201378650001301390650001301403650003401416650003301450650002001483700001901503773007601522852000901598930003301607945001301640946001101653655001201664IND2058459420221118114550.0970716e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205845942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPallerla, S.10aCharacterization of a Ca-alginate-immobilized Trametes versicolor bioreactor for decolorization and AOX reduction of paper mill effluents  ap. 1-8.  aThe reduction of color and adsorbable organic halides (AOX) from the kraft bleach plant effluents was investigated using a laboratory-scale fungal bioreactor.

A successful startup of the pilot (10.74 m3) non-thermostated UASB-reactor treating raw cheese-whey wastewaters at ambient temperatures (ca. 24 degrees C) has been completed in 3 months. Further exploitation of the reactor at the design OLR of 6.5 g COD/l.day showed its good operational stability with the TE close to 95% on the basis of total COD. After a proper start-up, the UASB-reactors can cope with preacidificated cheese-whey wastewaters (pH of about 4) even at elevated OLR that eliminates the necessity of alkalinity supplementation. 3aalkalinity 3aambient temperature 3acheese whey 3achemical oxygen demand 3apH 3awastewater1 aMartinez, E.P.1 aMartinez, J.R.0 tBioresource technology.g1997 Apr., v. 60, no. 1 p.59-65x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01286naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008400126300001400210520039400224650003200618650001200650650001100662650001100673650001000684650001700694650000900711650000900720650001400729650001300743650001100756650001300767773007800780852000900858930003300867945001300900946001100913655001200924IND2058521620221118114616.0970718e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205852162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalih, A.M.10aInfluence of heavy-metals toxicity on the growth of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  ap. 81-90.  aThe effect of Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni and Co on the growth of Phanerochaete chrysosporium in Czapek-Dox liquid medium at different concentrations of these heavy metals was investigated.

Fungi continuously destroy nematodes in virtually all soils because of their constant association with nematodes in the rhizosphere. A large number of fungi are known to trap or prey on nematodes but the most important genera include Paecilomyces, Verticillium, Hirsutella, Nematophthora, Arthrobotrys, Drechmeria, Fusarium and Monacrosporium. Application of some of these fungi has given very interesting results. There is an urgent need to develop some easy technologies for formulation and mass production of fungi at a commercial scale for field application. Some of these fungi may be used in integrated nematode management programmes despite some obstacles. 3aArthrobotrys 3aFusarium 3aHirsutella 3aNematoda 3aPaecilomyces 3aVerticillium 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3afungi 3aparasitism 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3arhizosphere 3asoil1 aMahmood, I.0 tBioresource technology.g1996 Dec., v. 58, no. 3 p.229-239x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01693naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245006700169300001300236520079900249650001801048650001701066650001301083650001601096650001401112650001301126773010701139852000901246856009201255939003301347946001101380655001201391IND4457119820221118114608.0110423e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445711982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02242.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirby, Ralph10aChromosome diversity and similarity within the Actinomycetales  ap. 1-10.  aMany chromosomes from Actinomycetales, an order within the Actinobacteria, have been sequenced over the last 10 years and the pace is increasing. This group of Gram-positive and high G+C% bacteria is economically and medically important. However, this group of organisms also is just about the only order in the kingdom Bacteria to have a relatively high proportion of linear chromosomes. Chromosome topology varies within the order according to the genera. Streptomyces, Kitasatospora and Rhodococcus, at least as chromosome sequencing stands at present, have a very high proportion of linear chromosomes, whereas most other genera seem to have circular chromosomes. This review examines chromosome topology across the Actinomycetales and how this affects our concepts of chromosome evolution. 3aKitasatospora 3aStreptomyces 3abacteria 3achromosomes 3aevolution 3atopology0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2011 June, v. 319, no. 1 p.1-10dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02242.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110424  aNon-US 7aarticle02220naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006000130300001600190520131600206650003201522650001601554650002201570650001801592650001201610650001201622650001301634650002101647650001101668700002401679700002101703773008001724852000901804930003301813945001301846946001101859655001201870IND2059084120221118114550.0970820e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205908412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubio Perez, R.10aChlorophenol degradation by Phanerochaete chrysosporium  ap. 207-213.  aDegradation of chlorophenols by P. chrysosporium in static cultures has been studied. The influences of mycelium acclimation, co-substrate concentration and nitrogen source on phenol degradation were analyzed. With non-acclimated mycelium the maximal concentrations degraded were 150 ppm of o-chorophenol and 100 ppm of the isomers m- and p-chlorophenol. The substituted ortho-position on the aromatic ring was the preferred attack position. Meta- and para-positions were less reactive and resulted in a slower degradation rate than the ortho position. Nevertheless, with acclimated mycelium, an increase in the ability to degrade chlorophenol and a higher reactivity in meta- and para-positions were observed (degraded chlorophenol increased by up to 70% for the o-isomer and 50% for the m- and p-isomers with respect to non-acclimated mycelium). A decrease in glucose concentration caused a decrease in chlorophenol degradation rate. Twelve days were needed for complete degradation of o-chlorophenol with 10 g/l of glucose and 22 days when glucose concentration was decreased to 2.5 g/L. The reduction of ammonium tartrate caused a greater lag time, but not a decrease in chlorophenol degradation rate. Replacement of ammonium tartrate by ammonium chloride caused a decrease in chlorophenol degradation rate. 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aacclimation 3aammonium chloride 3achlorophenols 3aglucose 3aisomers 3amycelium 3anitrogen content 3aphenol1 aGonzalez Benito, G.1 aPena Miranda, M.0 tBioresource technology.g1997 June, v. 60, no. 3 p.207-213x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02114naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245008800146300001800234500013900252500001500391520088700406650001301293650001201306650001401318650001801332650001501350650001701365650001701382650001701399650002501416650002101441650001701462653001501479653002301494653001701517773007801534852000901612930003301621945002501654946001301679655001201692IND4406328720221118114951.0080602e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440632872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Inflammation is necessary to cope with damaging agents and is crucial for survival, particularly to cope with acute inflammation during our reproductive years. But chronic exposure to a variety of antigens, especially to some viruses such as cytomegalovirus, for a period much longer than that predicted by evolution, induces a chronic low-grade inflammatory status that contributes to age-associated morbidity and mortality. This condition carries the proposed name "inflammaging". Centenarians are unique in that, despite high levels of pro-inflammatory markers, they also exhibit anti-inflammatory markers that may delay disease onset. The key to successful aging and longevity is to decrease chronic inflammation without compromising an acute response when exposed to pathogens. 3aimmunity 3aelderly 3alongevity 3ahematopoiesis 3abiomarkers 3ainflammation 3arisk factors 3ahuman health 3abiochemical pathways 3achronic diseases 3amitochondria 0asenescence 0aliterature reviews 0ainflammaging0 tNutrition reviews.g2007 Dec., v. 65, no. 12 p.S173-S176x0029-66437nnas  aDNAL  a20080814b20080905c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/08/06  aOther US 7aarticle02578naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245009900144300001800243500013900261500001500400520127300415650001901688650002201707650001301729650001201742650002301754650001701777650001701794650001901811650002501830650002101855650001001876650001401886650001601900653001501916653002301931653002001954773007801974852000902052930003302061945002502094946001302119655001202132IND4406332320221118115033.0080602e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440633232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Patients with AD lose their most human qualities--reasoning, abstraction, language, and memory. The brain plaques that Alois Alzheimer first described 100 years ago have inspired the search for genetic alterations that underlie AD. Four genes have been unequivocally implicated to date in inherited forms of AD, where mutations or natural variations in these genes cause excessive accumulation of the amyloid fi-protein, the building block of amyloid plaques. This aggregation leads to subsequent neuronal degeneration in brain regions important for memory and cognition. The discovery of the genes involved in the mechanisms of amyloid β-protein build-up in AD, coupled with cell culture and animal models of their involved pathways, has led to the development of specific pharmacological strategies to lower amyloid fi-protein levels as a way of treating or preventing all forms of the disease. While hard work lies ahead, the movement from basic research to the clinic in AD represents a triumph of reductionist biology applied to the most complex of all biological systems, the human cerebral cortex. 3ahuman diseases 3aAlzheimer disease 3aetiology 3aelderly 3adisease prevention 3ainflammation 3atherapeutics 3ahuman genetics 3abiochemical pathways 3achronic diseases 3agenes 3acognition 3aamyloidosis 0asenescence 0aliterature reviews 0aamyloid cascade0 tNutrition reviews.g2007 Dec., v. 65, no. 12 p.S239-S243x0029-66437nnas  aDNAL  a20080814b20080905c00000000  aINDd1CTe2008/08/06  aOther US 7aarticle01992naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110100001600130245002700146300001800173500013900191500001500330520091400345650001301259650001201272650001901284650001701303650001401320650002101334650001201355650001001367653001501377653002001392653002301412653002201435653002001457700001701477773007801494852000901572946001301581655001201594IND4406332520221118115005.0080602s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440633252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Inadequate sleep and sleep deprivation cause numerous neurobe-havioral and physiological changes. A number of recent studies have reported associations between disrupted sleep/sleep deprivation and inflammatory responses, although the physiological mechanisms underlying these relationships remain unclear. Alterations in sleep due to lifestyle factors, the aging process, and disease states have all been associated with increases in a range of inflammatory markers. Several of these inflammatory processes have been associated with reduced health status (e.g., C-reactive protein and cardiovascular disease). Thus, maintaining adequate sleep duration and quality through good sleep habits and treatment of sleep disorders may reduce inflammatory processes associated with aging and increase the wellness phenotype. 3aimmunity 3aelderly 3ahuman diseases 3ainflammation 3acytokines 3achronic diseases 3aobesity 3asleep 0asenescence 0aneurophysiology 0aliterature reviews 0asleep deprivation 0asleep disorders1 aDinges, D.F.0 tNutrition reviews.g2007 Dec., v. 65, no. 12 p.S244-S252x0029-66437nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02170naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171072001700188100001900205245005700224300001600281520044500297650001500742650002100757650000900778650002100787650002300808650002300831650003500854650001000889650002200899650001400921650001900935650001700954650002300971650004500994650005001039650002401089650001101113650001101124650004201135650004201177650001401219650002101233653002301254653001701277653002201294700001701316773007501333852000901408856009201417930003301509945002501542946001301567655001201580IND4406335920221118114701.0080602e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440633592DNAL7 a182891802pmid7 a10.1111/j.1753-4887.2008.00020.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fine root growth can be observed through minirhizotrons (MRs), tubes installed in the field. We compared the use of fixed-wall (F-wall) MRs, 5.6 cm in diam., and pressurized-wall (P-wall) MRs, 9.6 cm in diam., with an inner cylinder and an outer wall of plastic sheeting kept under constant air pressure. Root growth was measured with a micro-video camera for 3 yr in eight crop species growing on Pachic Haplustoll soil: canola, Brassica rapa L.; crambe, Crambe abysinnica Hochst. ex R.E. Fries; dry bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L.; dry pea, Pisum sativum L.; safflower, Carthamus tinctoris L.; spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L.; soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr.; and sunflower, Helianthus anuus L. Midpoint depths of root length density profiles measured with P-wall MRs were on average 20% greater than those from F-wall MRs, and maximum rooting depths observed were 15% greater with P-wall than with F-wall MRs. Fixed-wall MRs were forced into tight access holes to establish soil contact while the expectedly more uniform interfaces of P-wall MRs apparently allowed more root penetration. Averages of total root lengths (TRL) over rootzones and of root length per MR area (for upper halves of rootzones) measured by F-wall MRs were 47 and 32% greater, respectively, than those measured by P-wall MRs. This is attributed to greater clarity and visibility in F-wall MRs compared with P-wall MRs. Significantly more effort is required to build and maintain P-wall MRs compared with F-wall MRs, but P-wall MRs could be considered for use in problem soils with swelling clay content, stoniness, or gravel. In soils with fine-textured, difficult subsoils, use of P-wall MRs to supplement F-wall MRs could increase the accuracy of root growth depth measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3apressure 3arhizosphere 3asoil depth 3aroot growth 3alength 3adensity 3aresearch equipment 3aroots 3acrops1 aTanaka, Donald L.1 aHanson, Jonathan D.0 tAgronomy journal.g2005 Sept., v. 97, no. 5 p.1367-1373dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/37113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2004.02093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01632naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245017100162300001600333520056200349592002800911650001400939650001400953650002900967653003100996653002301027653002601050700001801076773015001094856007701244852000901321655001201330IND60521589220221120211737.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052158922DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-04182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Kh.

The functionalized MSNs with a proper particle size were synthesized and attached to a recombinant construct (pDNA) containing cryIAb gene under the control of MPI promoter (pPZP122:MPI:cryIAb:MSN [pDNA: MSN]) following transformation of tomato plants through injection of the pDNA: MSN complex into tomato red fruit at early ripening stage and then, putative transgenic seeds were collected. As an initial selection, gentamicin-resistant seedlings of T₁ (24.24%) and T₂ (61.37%) plants were identified. The transgene integration and expression were confirmed through the PCR, RT-PCR, and western blot approaches in the selected seedlings. PCR analysis showed that transformation frequency was equal to 10.71% in T₁ plants. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed the transcript expression of cryIAb in all the T₁ and T₂ PCR-positive plants. Western blot analysis confirmed the existence of CryIAb protein in the leaves of T₂ putative transgenic plants. Accordingly, the results demonstrated that the transgene has more likely integrated into the tomato genome through homologous recombination. Bioassay was carried out for further assessment of the plant responses to Tuta absoluta resulting in an enhanced tolerance of the plant. In conclusion, the MSN-mediated stable transformation system under the MPI as an inducible promoter can be used as a suitable alternative for conventional genetic transformation methods due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, cost and time-effectiveness, and positive effect on the plant defense against pathogens and pests.  aPublisher supplied data  a93033715cIran National Science Foundation 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aTuta absoluta 3aWestern blotting 3abioassays 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acorn 3afruits 3agenetic transformation 3ahomologous recombination 3aparticle size 3aporous media 3aproteinase inhibitors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asilica 3atomatoes 3atransgenes1 aShirzadian-Khorramabad, Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8413-62411 aKazemzad, Mahmood1 aSohani, Mohammad Mehdi1 akhajehali, Jahangir0 t3 Biotech.g2020 Aug., v. 10, no. 8 p.370-370dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02359-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013300166300001400299520181000313592002802123596005002151650002302201650002302224650002402247650001102271650001002282650001402292650002302306650001202329650001202341650002102353650001402374650000902388650002702397650001402424650001202438650001402450650001402464650002102478650001702499650001002516650001402526650001302540650001802553650001002571650003302581700002702614700001402641700001602655700001802671773010802689856008202797852000902879655001202888IND60681803420221120085306.0200118e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068180342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-019-09970-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shengyong10aPoor infectivity of Beauveria bassiana to eggs and immatures causes the failure of suppression on Tetranychus urticae population  ap. 81-90.  aThe entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana, is capable of infecting pest mites, while the effect on different mite stages has rarely been reported. The present study evaluates the effect of several B. bassiana isolates (GZGY-1-3, LNSZ-26, SDDZ-9, XJWLMQ-32, SCWJ-2 and JXJGS-1) on Tetranychus urticae by a series of assays and observations. A potted bean plant assay indicated the fungal sprays resulted in greater reduction of adult T. urticae populations, but poor suppression in eggs and immature stages. During the one-month experiment, the different fungal isolates reduced the numbers of T. urticae eggs, immatures and adults by 38.7–55.2, 3.7–18.7 and 61.0–72.1%, respectively. Laboratory bioassays showed their corrected mortalities were 2.7–3.8, 17.5–25.8 and 63.2–71.2%, respectively, at seven days days post-fungal treatment. Fecundity of female mites was significantly reduced after fungal spray due to the lethal effect on females, while egg hatchability was not affected. Light microscopy observations indicated fungal outgrowths were evident in mite cadavers, but were not visible on eggs. Scanning electronic microscopy observations demonstrated fungal mycelia grew prolifically from the adult mite 60 h following fungal spray, although no symptoms of fungal infection were exhibited in most immature cadavers. Despite the fact that fungal conidia were able to adhere to and germinate on eggshells, and the germ tubes elongated on the shell surface, they were never observed to penetrate the eggs. Our results demonstrating that the failure to control T. urticae on bean plants using B. bassiana, which we attributed to its poor infectivity to mite eggs and immature stages, may provide useful information in future attempts to develop effective mite control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  a31501704cNatural Science Foundation of China 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aTetranychus urticae 3aadults 3abeans 3abioassays 3abiological control 3acadaver 3aconidia 3aegg hatchability 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afecundity 3afemales 3agerm tube 3aimmatures 3alight microscopy 3amite control 3amites 3amortality 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apests 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aSarkar, Shovon Chandra1 aLv, Jiale1 aXu, Xuenong1 aLei, Zhongren0 tBioControl.g2020 Feb., v. 65, no. 1 p.81-90dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870036x1386-61417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-019-09970-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002100158245012600179300001600305500001500321520151200336592002801848650001601876650002201892650002401914650002101938650002201959650001801981650002301999650000702022650002602029650001902055650001202074650003602086650003902122650002302161650002402184650003602208650001402244650002002258650003102278650001802309650002002327650003102347650002202378650002502400650002402425650001502449650002202464650003302486650003202519650005902551650001702610650006602627653001302693653003402706700001702740700002002757700002202777700002002799700002002819773012802839856004002967852000903007655001203016IND50064227020221122224441.0130327e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006422702DNAL7 a227778412pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.57602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuo, Xiu‐Ying10aFormation of soy protein isolate–dextran conjugates by moderate Maillard reaction in macromolecular crowding conditions  ap. 316-323.  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Several methods have been reported for the conjugation of proteins with polysaccharides. Protein–polysaccharide conjugates can be formed by traditional dry heating, but this process is not attractive from an industrial viewpoint, and no commercial conjugates have been manufactured in this way. In the present study, in order to develop a more practical reaction method, macromolecular crowding was used to attach polysaccharides to proteins. RESULTS: Soy protein isolate–dextran conjugates (SDCs) were prepared via the initial stage of the Maillard reaction in macromolecular crowding conditions. The impact of various processing conditions on the formation of SDCs was investigated. The optimal conditions chosen from the experiments were a soy protein isolate/dextran ratio of 1:1 (w/w), a pH of 6.5, a reaction temperature of 60 °C and a reaction time of 30 h. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the secondary and tertiary structures of the conjugates were changed significantly. Structural flexibility increased, allowing better display of their functional characteristics. The conjugates had a composition with various sizes, especially macromolecules, according to gel permeation chromatography. Thermal analysis showed that the thermal stability of the conjugates was improved. CONCLUSION: The production of SDCs under macromolecular crowding conditions appears to be an effective and promising technique, representing an advance over classic protein glycosylation methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3asoy protein isolate 3athermal analysis 3aMaillard reaction 3aglycosylation 3agel chromatography 3apH 3afunctional properties 3aheat treatment 3adextran 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aCircular Dichroism 2aDextransxchemistry 2aDietary Carbohydratesxanalysis 2aEmulsions 2aFood Technology 2aFood, Formulatedxanalysis 2aGlycosylation 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMaillard Reaction 2aMechanical Phenomena 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPliability 2aProtein Stability 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSoybean Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aTime Factors 2aPlant Proteins, Dietaryxchemistryxisolation & purification. 0aproteins 0agel permeation chromatography1 aQi, Jun‐Ru1 aYin, Shou‐Wei1 aYang, Xiao‐Quan1 aZhu, Jian‐Hua1 aHuang, Li‐Xin0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2013 Jan., v. 93, no. 2 p.316-323dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5760  aDNAL 7aarticle04372naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002100162245011400183300001600297520258500313592002802898650001302926650001602939650000902955650001702964650000902981650001902990650002403009650002103033650001803054650002103072650001203093650002803105650002803133650001203161650002203173650001603195650001403211650005903225650001203284650002803296650003103324650000903355650002303364650001103387650003303398650003903431650003203470650001403502650003403516700001903550700001803569773009703587856007703684852000903761655001203770IND60083377220221120183356.0141101e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008337722DNAL7 a222813322pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-45292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoenberg, K.M.10aEffects of plane of nutrition and feed deprivation on insulin responses in dairy cattle during late gestation  ap. 670-682.  aNonlactating Holstein cows (n=12) in late pregnancy were used to determine effects of plane of nutrition followed by feed deprivation on metabolic responses to insulin. Beginning 48 d before expected parturition, cows were fed to either a high plane (HP) or a low plane (LP) of nutrition (162 and 90% of calculated energy requirements, respectively). Cows were subjected to an intravenous glucose tolerance test [GTT; 0.25g of dextrose/kg of body weight (BW)] on d 14 of treatment and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC; 1μg/kg of BW/h) on d 15. Following 24h of feed removal, cows were subjected to a second GTT on d 17 and a second HEC on d 18 after 48h of feed removal. During the feeding period, plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations were higher for cows fed the LP diet compared with those fed the HP diet (163.6 vs. 73.1μEq/L), whereas plasma insulin was higher for cows fed the HP diet during the feeding period (11.1 vs. 5.2μIU/mL). Glucose areas under the curve during both GTT were higher for cows fed the LP diet than for those fed the HP diet (4,213 vs. 3,750mg/dL × 60min) and was higher during the GTT in the feed-deprived state (4,878 vs. 3,085mg/dL × 60min) than in the GTT during the fed state, suggesting slower clearance of glucose during negative energy balance either pre-or post-feed deprivation. This corresponded with a higher dextrose infusion rate during the fed-state HEC than during the feed-deprived-state HEC (203.3 vs. 90.1 mL/h). Plasma NEFA decreased at a faster rate following GTT during feed deprivation compared with that during the fed state (8.7 vs. 2.9%/min). Suppression of NEFA was highest for cows fed the HP diet during the GTT conducted during feed deprivation, and lowest for cows fed the HP diet during the fed-state GTT (68.6 vs. 50.3% decrease from basal). Plasma insulin responses to GTT were affected by feed deprivation such that cows had a much lower insulin response to GTT by 24h after feed removal (995 vs. 3,957μIU/mL × 60min). During the fed-state HEC, circulating concentrations of NEFA were 21% below basal for cows fed the HP diet and 62% below basal for cows fed the LP diet; during feed deprivation, NEFA were 79 and 59% below basal for the HP and LP diets, respectively (diet × HEC). Cows that are fed below energy requirements or are feed deprived have slower clearance of glucose and greater NEFA responses to glucose challenge. Additionally, feed deprivation had a large effect on insulin secretion. Overall, effects of feed deprivation were larger than effects of plane of nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abody weight 3acows 3adairy cattle 3adiet 3aenergy balance 3aenergy requirements 3afeed deprivation 3afeeding level 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3aglucose clamp technique 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3aparturition 3apregnancy 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCattlexbloodxphysiology. 2aDiet 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aGlucose Tolerance Testxveterinary 2aInsulinxbloodxphysiology. 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxphysiology1 aEhrhardt, R.M.1 aOverton, T.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Feb., v. 95, no. 2 p.670-682dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-45293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04308naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245012200183300001800305520226500323592002802588650003002616650003502646650001202681650001302693650001102706650001102717650002102728650001302749650001902762650001802781650001602799650003002815650001702845650001702862650000902879650001502888650000902903650001402912650001102926650001302937650001502950650003102965650001702996650002503013650002403038650001603062650001803078650001603096650001003112650000903122650003303131650002903164650002703193650002803220650002303248650002503271650004103296651001103337700002003348700002203368773011803390856008103508852000903589655001203598IND60080307320221120085121.0141014e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008030732DNAL7 a248653862pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3829-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAğca, Necat10aAssessment of ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, and heavy metal pollution in groundwater from Amik Plain, southern Turkey  ap. 5921-5934.  aAmik Plain is one of the most important agricultural areas of Turkey. Because the groundwater resources have been used not only for irrigation but also for drinking purpose, groundwater resources play a vital role in this area. However, there exist no or a very limited number of studies on groundwater quality and its physicochemical and heavy metal composition for Amik Plain. This study aimed to assess groundwater of Amik Plain in terms of human health and suitability for irrigation based on physicochemical variables, heavy metals, and their spatial distribution. A total of 92 groundwater samples were collected from wells and were analyzed for temperature (T), salt content (SC), dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium (NH₄ ⁺), nitrate (NO₃ ⁻), and phosphorus (P) and such heavy metals as cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). The temperature, SC, DO, NH₄ ⁺, and NO₃ ⁻ parameters were measured in situ immediately with YSI Professional plus instrument (Pro Plus). Water depth was taken from owner of the wells. Heavy metal analyses were carried out in triplicate using inductively coupled atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). The ICP-AES was calibrated for all the metals by running different concentrations of standard solutions. Descriptive statistical analyses were calculated to characterize distribution of physicochemical properties and heavy metal contents of groundwater. Correlation analysis was used to assess the possible relationships among heavy metals and physicochemical properties of the groundwater. Spatial variability in groundwater parameters were determined by geostatistical methods. Result shows that the highest and lowest coefficient of variation occurred for NO₃ ⁻ and T, respectively. Mean water table depth was 92.1 m, and only 12 of all the samples exceeded the desirable limit of 50 mg/L for NO₃ ⁻ content. The metal concentrations showed a dominance in the order of Fe > Mn > Ni > Cr > Cu > Zn > Co > Cd > Pb. All the samples had much higher Cd concentration than the guideline value for drinking water while Cu and Fe concentrations were below the guideline limit recommended by WHO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adissolved oxygen 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3ageostatistics 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3airon 3airrigation 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3anitrates 3aphosphorus 3aphysicochemical properties 3asalt content 3astatistical analysis 3asurface water level 3atemperature 3awater quality 3awater table 3awells 3azinc 2aAmmonium Compoundsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGroundwaterxchemistry 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aPhosphatesxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0aTurkey1 aKaranlık, Sema1 aÖdemiş, Berkant0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 Sept., v. 186, no. 9 p.5921-5934dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3829-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05789naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005400149245007900203520358100282592002803863596008303891650002403974650002503998650002304023650001904046650003204065650002304097650002004120650003604140650001504176650001204191650002004203650002004223650001204243650001804255650000904273650001104282650000904293650001604302650001104318650001004329650001004339650001704349650003304366650001404399650001204413650001304425650001804438650001404456650003104470650001404501650001504515650001504530650002204545650002204567651001004589653001404599653002104613700001304634700001704647700001704664700001304681700005504694700001504749700005504764773013104819856008404950852000905034655001205043IND60782400520221118042323.0220708e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078240052DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-21-1771-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, G.-Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2392-328110aFirst Report of Aspergillus flavus Causing Fruit Rot on Kiwifruit in China  aIn October 2020, fruit rot symptoms were detected on kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis var. deliciosa ‘Xuxiang’) in southwestern Shaanxi (Hanzhong municipality, 107.27° E, 33.23° N) in China. During the harvest period, mature kiwifruit exhibited soft rot and brown lesions. The symptoms were similar to those reported for Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum spp., Fusarium avenaceum, and Rhizopus oryzae, which cause fruit rot on kiwifruit (Feng et al. 2019; Kim et al. 2018; Li et al. 2017; Zhao et al. 2020). The symptoms were observed in approximately 15% of the fruit in six kiwifruit orchards (31 ha in total). Ten samples of symptomatic tissue, approximately 1 cm² in size, were sterilized in 2% NaOCl for 30 s and washed twice with sterilized water. The pathogen was isolated from all collected samples via culturing on PDA medium, which contained 50 µg/ml of chloramphenicol, at 28°C. Green powdery colonies were detected after 5 days. A total of 12 isolates were obtained via single-spore isolation. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS), elongation factor 1-α (EF1-α), and RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2) genes were amplified using ITS5/ITS4, A_EF1_F/A_EF1_R, and RPB2-5F/RPB2-7cR (NJC03) or RPB2-7cF/RPB2-11aR (NJC04) primers, respectively. Eleven isolates shared the same sequences (NJC03), MZ801787 (ITS), MZ701709 (EF1-α), and MZ701707 (RPB2), while one of the isolates provided different sequences (NJC04), OK618459 (ITS), OK634020 (EF1-α), and OL331017 (RPB2). The obtained ITS sequences shared >99% homology to the ITS gene from Aspergillus flavus KU20018.4 (MT487825), the EF1-α sequences shared 100% homology to the EF1-α gene from A. flavus clinical2342 (KP054370), and the RPB2 sequences shared >99% homology to the RPB2 genes from A. flavus PW3170 (LC000581) and A. flavus NRRL3357 (XM_041293948). A molecular phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA7 with reference to Aspergillus strains. Microscope observations of all the isolates showed the presence of septate mycelium and circular unicellular conidia (2 to 4 µm in diameter) and conidiophores and agreed with the morphology of A. flavus (Horn 2005). The pathogenicity of all isolates was screened using intact and wounded Xuxiang kiwifruits (10 kiwifruits were used for each combination with three replicates), which were purchased from a local market. An isolate solution of 1 × 10⁶ spores/ml (10 µl) was used for the inoculation. Sterilized water was used in the control experiment. Inoculated kiwifruits were stored at 26°C and 60% relative humidity for 10 days. Rot lesions in the wounded kiwifruits were totally covered by green mycelia, while the lesions on the intact kiwifruits were similar to the symptoms observed in the field. The pathogen was recovered, and its identity was confirmed by sequence analysis of ITS, EF1-α, and RPB2, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. A. flavus is known to be an important fungal pathogen of corn, cotton, and peanuts (Zhang et al. 2020). During recent years, A. flavus was reported to cause fruit rot on grapes (Ghuffar et al. 2020) and was identified on almond, fig, organic spelt, and pistachio (Krulj et al. 2017; Ortega-Beltran et al. 2019). The presence of A. flavus in food products is an issue of global concern due to A. flavus being able to produce carcinogenic aflatoxin (Maxwell et al. 2021). As far as we know, this is the first report of A. flavus causing fruit rot on kiwifruit. This report will help to understand the distribution of A. flavus in crops and the food safety hazards that are present in China.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801697a3201101306a3217170148cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aActinidia deliciosa 3aAlternaria alternata 3aAspergillus flavus 3aColletotrichum 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aFusarium avenaceum 3aRhizopus oryzae 3aTriticum aestivum subsp. spelta 3aaflatoxins 3aalmonds 3acarcinogenicity 3achloramphenicol 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3acorn 3acotton 3afigs 3afood safety 3afruits 3afungi 3agenes 3aharvest date 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3akiwifruit 3amarkets 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3apistachios 3aplant rots 3arelative humidity 3asequence analysis 3aChina 0aaflatoxin 0afungal pathogens1 aWang, X.1 aChen, T.

In this study, we made extensive bioinformatics analysis to gain functional and structural insight into PeCHS and PeCHI proteins. The phylogenetic distribution of PeCHS and PeCHI genes encoding proteins demonstrated the close evolutionary relationship with different CHS and CHI proteins of other dicot plants. MicroRNA target analysis showed miR169n and 3p miR5053 targeting PeCHS gene while miR169c-3p and miR4248 are targeting PeCHI gene, respectively. Three-dimensional structural models of PeCHS and PeCHI proteins were elucidated by homology modeling with Ramachandran plots showing the excellent geometry of the proteins structure. Molecular docking revealed that cinnamoyl-coa and naringenin chalcone substrates are strongly bound to PeCHS and PeCHI proteins, respectively. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 30 ns, further yielded stability checks of ligands in the binding pocket and behavior of protein complexes. Thus MD simulation and interaction fraction analysis showed the stable conformation of PeCHS and PeCHI proteins with their respective substrates during theee simulation. Our study provides first-hand structural prospective of PeCHS and PeCHI proteins towards understanding the mechanism of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in P. emblica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllanthus emblica 3abiochemical pathways 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3achalcone 3achalcone isomerase 3agenes 3ageometry 3aligands 3amicroRNA 3amolecular dynamics 3anaringenin 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aphylogeny1 aSharma, Mansi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4026-54981 aChaubey, Swaroopa Nand1 aKumar, Avneesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8907-90470 t3 Biotech.g2020 Aug., v. 10, no. 8 p.373-373dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02367-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010800170300001400278520104500292592002801337596007301365650002201438650001501460650002301475650003001498650002201528650002201550650001601572650001501588650001701603650001601620650001101636651001401647651001101661651002201672651001201694651001301706651001001719700002101729700001801750700002101768700002101789700002201810700001901832700002001851773010801871856008201979961001302061852000902074655001202083IND60681803620221120085418.0200118e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068180362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-019-09985-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJourdan, Mireille10aGenetic variability in the parasitic fly, Sarcophaga villeneuveana, in south-western Europe and Morocco  ap. 59-70.  aThe snail, Cochlicella acuta (Müller), is an introduced pest of grain crops in southern Australia, and native to Europe and north-west Africa. Parasitoid flies (Sarcophaga villeneuveana (Enderlein)) have previously been sourced from France to attempt biological control of the pest in Australia, but have failed. Cochlicella acuta has three mitochondrial lineages (CO1 & 16S based) within its native distribution. The snails now found in Australia belong to just one of these lineages. Their origins most likely lie in the southern Iberian Peninsula or Morocco, not in France. We collected S. villeneuveana attacking C. acuta in France, Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Australia. Genetic structure (CO1) was not found within the fly that aligned with the lineages recorded for the snail host in the same regions. However, geographical patterns were detected amongst haplotypes of S. villeneuveana which encourage further, better targeted searches in Morocco and the southern Iberian Peninsula for a more effective biological control agent(s).  aPublisher supplied data  aDAS00095, DAS00134cGrains Research and Development Corporation (AU) 3aCochlicella acuta 3aSarcophaga 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3agrain crops 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3aparasitoids 3asnails 3aAustralia 3aFrance 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMorocco 3aPortugal 3aSpain1 aThomann, Thierry1 aRichet, René1 aFendane, Yassine1 aGhamizi, Mohamed1 aBon, Marie-Claude1 aSheppard, Andy1 aBaker, Geoff H.0 tBioControl.g2020 Feb., v. 65, no. 1 p.59-70dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870036x1386-61417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-019-09985-73Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009700173300001000270520182500280592002802105650001902133650002402152650000902176650001002185650002002195650001102215650001502226650001102241650001302252651001402265700002302279700003702302700002602339773011702365856008302482852000902565655001202574IND60725523320221116211705.0220112e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552332DNAL7 a10.1186/s13028-021-00569-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDauparaitė, Evelina10aAnthelmintic resistance of horse strongyle nematodes to ivermectin and pyrantel in Lithuania  ap. 5.  aBACKGROUND: With intensive use of anthelmintic drugs in recent decades, anthelmintic resistance (AR) in horse nematodes is becoming a growing issue in many countries. However, there is little available information about the parasites, treatment practices or AR in the horse population in Lithuania. The aim of this study was to assess the current situation of AR on horse farms in Lithuania. The study was conducted in 25 stables on horses with a strongyle faecal egg count (FEC) of ≥ 200 eggs per gram. A faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) was performed on each farm after administration of ivermectin (IVM) or pyrantel (PYR). RESULTS: The efficacy of IVM was comparatively high, with 98.8% of 250 horses having a zero egg count 14 days after treatment. Two conditions were used to interpret the FECRT results for PYR: firstly, resistance was determined when FECR was < 90% and the lower 95% confidence interval (LCL) was < 80%, and secondly when in addition the upper confidence level (UCL) was < 95%. Under the first condition, resistance against PYR was found in five stables (25% of all tested herds), while when considering the UCL as well, resistance was only detected in two stables (8%). The FEC showed a significant (P < 0.01) difference between the treatment and control groups. Only cyathostomin larvae were detected in larval cultures derived from strongyle-positive faecal samples collected 14 days after treatment of a test group with PYR. CONCLUSIONS: This in vivo study showed that PYR resistance is prevalent on horse farms in Lithuania, while the efficacy of IVM still appears to be unaffected. However, further studies of ivermectin resistance are needed. These findings should guide the implementation of more sustainable management of strongyle infections in horses in Lithuania.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyathostominae 3aconfidence interval 3aeggs 3afarms 3afecal egg count 3ahorses 3aivermectin 3alarvae 3apyrantel 3aLithuania1 aKupčinskas, Tomas1 aSamson-Himmelstjerna, Georg von,1 aPetkevičius, Saulius0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2021 Dec., v. 63, no. 1 p.5-5dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-021-00569-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245013600203506007600339520132900415592002801744596003201772596006101804596002701865596004301892506003701935650003601972650001602008650001502024650001302039650002902052650002202081650000902103650001402112650003502126650001402161650001402175650005202189650003502241650001902276650001402295650001202309651001302321700005902334700006102393700006202454700005602516773009002572856007602662852000902738655001202747IND60624352720221207081626.0181203e20180902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062435272DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/10687582doi7 aPMC61391962pmcid7 a302458872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawal, Nafi’u10aPropagation and Molecular Characterization of Bioreactor Adapted Very Virulent Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Isolates of Malaysia  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo Malaysian very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) strains UPM0081 (also known as B00/81) and UPM190 (also known as UPM04/190) isolated from local IBD outbreaks in 2000 and 2004, respectively, were separately passaged for 12 consecutive times in 11-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs (CEE) via the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) route. The CEE passage 8 (EP8) isolates were passaged once in BGM-70 cell line yielding UPM0081EP8BGMP1 and UPM190EP8BGMP1, while the EP12 isolates were passaged 15 times in BGM-70 cell line yielding UPM0081EP12BGMP15 and UPM190EP12BGMP15 using T25 tissue culture flask.

The form of nitrogen nutrition remarkably affects IRT1 expression in roots. IRT1 has an activity of transporting Ni²⁺ into root cells. Therefore, nitrogen-form may affect Ni accumulation and toxicity in plants. The assumption was investigated in this study. METHODS: The Arabidopsis plants were treated in Ni-contained growth solutions with either nitrate (NO₃ ⁻) or ammonium (NH₄ ⁺) as the sole N source. After 7-day treatments, Ni concentration, IRT1 expression, Ni-induced toxic symptoms and oxidative stress in plants were analyzed. RESULTS: The NO₃ ⁻-fed plants contained a higher Ni concentration, had a greater IRT1 expression in roots, and developed more severe toxic symptoms in the youngest fully expanded leaves, compared with the NH₄ ⁺-fed plants. The Ni-induced growth inhibition was also more significant in NO₃ ⁻-fed plants. Interestingly, Ni exposure resulted in greater hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and superoxide radical (O₂ . ⁻) accumulations, more severe lipid peroxidation and more cell death in NO₃ ⁻-fed plants, whereas the opposite was true for NH₄ ⁺-fed plants. Furthermore, the Ni-enhanced peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were greater in NO₃ ⁻-fed plants CONCLUSION: NO₃ ⁻ nutrition promotes Ni uptake, and enhances Ni-induced growth inhibition and oxidative stress in plants compared with NH₄ ⁺ nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acell death 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3anickel 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aplant stress 3aroots 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity1 aWang, Nai Shan1 aHu, Xu Jun1 aLin, Xian Yong1 aFeng, Ying1 aJin, Chong Wei0 tPlant and soil.g2013 Oct., v. 371, no. 1-2 p.105-115dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-013-1682-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245008100170300001600251520120000267592002801467650001401495650001301509650001501522650001201537650000901549650000901558650001301567650001301580650002001593650001401613650001501627650001301642650001101655650001901666700001501685700001701700773013301717856005701850852000901907655001201916IND4473487920221118051316.0120727e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447348792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1990.tb02221.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, J. A.,10aResponses of Sphagnum species to atmospheric nitrogen and sulphur deposition  ap. 255-265.  aThe responses of Sphagnum species to atmospheric pollution by sulphur and nitrogen oxides are reviewed. An explanation of the tolerance of sulphur dioxide in Sphagnum cuspidatum is provided. This involves an exclusion mechanism by the oxidation of bisulphite ions to less toxic sulphate ions catalysed by the presence of iron and possibly other metals on the cell wall cationâexchange sites. Tolerance is influenced by changing the iron content of the plants. A similar mechanism may account for sulphur dioxide tolerance in Sphagnum recurvum. Evidence for a close coupling of nitrate assimilation with the atmospheric nitrogen supply in ombrotrophic Sphagnum species in unpolluted regions is reviewed, and this coupling is shown to be lost in polluted environments with high atmospheric nitrogen supply. The potential effects of a supraâoptimal atmospheric nitrogen supply to Sphagnum species on the ecology of mires is discussed. The effects of nitrogen and sulphur pollutants on Sphagnum species are used to make broad generalizations as to how other bryophyte species might respond to these pollutants and to explain known effects of atmospheric pollution on bryophyte communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryopsida 3aSphagnum 3acell walls 3aecology 3aions 3airon 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3asulfates 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide1 aBAXTER, R.1 aEmes, M.

Pouzar fungal treatment (dilutions 1:100, 1:200, 1:400) and control (cutting only) was studied for three years. The efficacy of the fungal treatment was defined as capability to prevent sprouting of birch (Betula pendula Roth. and B. pubescens Ehrh.). The fungal treatment resulted in higher stump mortality and lower number of sprouts but it did not have a clear effect on the maximum height of stump sprouts. However, mortalities obtained in this study (34.1%, 26.8%, and 25.6% for dilutions 1:100, 1:200, and 1:400, respectively) were notably lower compared to previous studies which indicate that the accuracy of the spreading mechanism was not satisfactory. We conclude that it is possible to decrease stump sprouting with the fully mechanized fungal treatment but putting this implementation into practice needs more testing to increase efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data  a720712 — EFFORTE — H2020-BBI-PPP-2015-02/H2020-BBI-PPP-2015-2-1cEU/EFFORTE 3aBetula pendula 3aBetula pubescens 3aChondrostereum purpureum 3abiological control 3acutting 3afungi 3amechanization 3amortality 3asprouting1 aHamberg, Leena1 aSaarinen, Veli-Matti1 aSaksa, Timo0 tBioControl.g2020 Feb., v. 65, no. 1 p.13-24dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870036x1386-61417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-019-09971-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011900163500001400282520161000296592002801906650003001934650002101964650001601985650002502001650001402026650001902040650002802059650002402087650003302111650003402144653002102178653003202199653000802231653000802239653000802247653000902255653001002264653001302274653000802287653001202295653000902307653000702316653000902323653000902332653000902341653001102350653000702361653000802368653001002376653001102386653000702397653000902404653000802413653000802421653000802429653000802437653000902445653000902454653000802463653000802471653000902479653001002488653001102498700001302509700001702522700001902539700001602558700001502574700001602589700005702605700005602662773009402718856008502812852000902897655001202906IND60704826220221120110019.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070482622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1532882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Na10aCardioprotective effect exerted by Timosaponin BⅡ through the regulation of endoplasmic stress-induced apoptosis  aNAL-light  aTimosaponin BⅡ (TBⅡ), one of the primary bioactive compounds from Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, possesses potential cardioprotective effects. However, the mechanism underlying TBⅡ-mediated cardioprotection, especially the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress, remains largely unknown.This study was designed to evaluate the role of TBⅡ in myocardial injury protection and explore its possible mechanisms.In vivo models of isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury and H₂O₂-induced cytotoxicty were established to investigate the effect of anti-myocardial injury of TBⅡ. The potential mechanisms were investigated in vitro and in vivo using multiple detection methods like electrocardiography, histo-pathological examination, JC-1 staining, TUNEL staining, ELISA technology, and western blot analysis.In vivo study revealed that TBⅡ improved electrocardiography and heart vacuolation, reduced myocyte apoptosis, and improved the antioxidant potential. In vitro investigation demonstrated that TBⅡ pretreatment inhibited ER stress-mediated apoptosis pathways. Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms revealed that TBⅡ prevented H₂O₂-induced H9c2 cardiomyocytes injury by the PI3K/Akt pathways, whereas the addition of LY294002, the pharmacologic antagonist of PI3K, attenuated TBⅡ-induced expression of apoptotic protein and cytoprotective effects.These results suggested that TBⅡ protects against myocardial injury in vitro and enhances cellular defense capacity by inhibiting ER stress-mediated apoptosis pathways in vivo by activating the PI3K/Akt pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnemarrhena asphodeloides 3aWestern blotting 3aantagonists 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3acardiomyocytes 3acardioprotective effect 3aelectrocardiography 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 0aTimosaponin BⅡ 0aAcute myocardial infarction 0aAkt 0aAMI 0aAST 0aATF6 0aBcl-2 0aβ-actin 0aCAT 0aCaspase 0aCHOP 0aCK 0aDMEM 0aDMSO 0aEDTA 0aeIF2α 0aER 0aFBS 0aGRP78 0aGSH-Px 0aHE 0aIRE1 0aJNK 0aLDH 0aMDA 0aPBS 0aPERK 0aPI3K 0aROS 0aSOD 0aTBST 0aTUNEL 0a∆Ψm1 aWang, Yi1 aWang, Wujing1 aZhong, Renxing1 aXia, Tianyi1 aDing, Zihe1 aYang, Yanni1 aZhong, Yanmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2074-80381 aShu, Zunpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6203-06170 tPhytomedicine.g2020 Nov., v. 78 p.153288-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1532883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01893naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011800166300001100284520067500295592002800970596004800998650001501046650001001061650001601071650002001087650001401107650001601121650001101137650001701148650001601165650001001181650002401191650001001215700001801225700005901243773010101302856008301403852000901486655001201495IND60725523420221116211523.0220309e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552342DNAL7 a10.1186/s13059-020-02234-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu Wei10aSuperTAD: robust detection of hierarchical topologically associated domains with optimized structural information  ap. 45.  aTopologically associating domains (TADs) are the organizational units of chromosome structures.

In comparison with seven state-of-art methods using two public datasets, from GM12878 and IMR90 cells, SuperTAD shows a significant enrichment of structural proteins around detected boundaries and histone modifications within TADs and displays a high consistency between various resolutions of identical Hi-C matrices.  aPublisher supplied data  a11257316cCity University of Hong Kong (HK) 3aalgorithms 3acells 3achromosomes 3adata collection 3adetection 3aexhibitions 3agenome 3ahistone code 3ainformation 3apaper 3astructural proteins 3atrees1 aWang, Meng Bo1 aLi, Shuai Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6246-63490 tGenome biology.g2021 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.45-45dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02234-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009900167300001600266500000900282520186600291592002802157650003002185650001202215650000902227650001802236650001202254650001702266650001102283650001402294650003102308650001602339650001302355650001002368650001902378650001602397650001602413650001502429651001202444651001702456651001602473651001402489651001302503651001002516700002202526700002202548700002302570773015702593856008202750852000902832655001202841IND60668334620221120055014.0191125e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066833462DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2015.05.02022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDere, Ashlee L.10aMineralogical Transformations and Soil Development in Shale across a Latitudinal Climosequence  ap. 623-636.  aepub  aTo investigate factors controlling soil formation, we established a climosequence as part of the Susquehanna-Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO) in central Pennsylvania, USA. Sites were located on organic matter-poor, iron-rich Silurian-aged shale in Wales, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Puerto Rico, although this last site is underlain by a younger shale. Across the climosequence, mean annual temperature (MAT) increases from 7 to 24°C and mean annual precipitation (MAP) ranges from 100 to 250 cm. Variations in soil characteristics along the climosequence, including depth, morphology, particle-size distribution, geochemistry, and bulk and clay mineralogy, were characterized to investigate the role of climate in controlling mineral transformations and soil formation. Overall, soil horizonation, depth, clay content, and chemical depletion increase with increasing temperature and precipitation, consistent with enhanced soil development and weathering processes in warmer and wetter locations. Secondary minerals are present at higher concentrations at the warmest sites of the climosequence; kaolinite increases from <5% at northern sites in Wales and Pennsylvania to 30% in Puerto Rico. The deepest observed weathering reaction is plagioclase feldspar dissolution followed by the transformation of chlorite and illite to vermiculite and hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite. Plagioclase, although constituting <12% of the initial shale mineralogy, may be the profile initiating reaction that begins shale bedrock transformation to weathered regolith. Weathering of the more abundant chlorite and illite minerals (∼70% of initial mineralogy), however, are more likely controlling regolith thickness. Climate appears to play a central role in driving soil formation and mineral weathering reactions across the climosequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abedrock 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aclimate 3ageochemistry 3aillite 3akaolinite 3aparticle size distribution 3aplagioclase 3aregolith 3ashale 3asoil formation 3atemperature 3avermiculite 3aweathering 3aAlabama 3aPennsylvania 3aPuerto Rico 3aTennessee 3aVirginia 3aWales1 aWhite, Timothy S.1 aApril, Richard H.1 aBrantley, Susan L.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2016 May, v. 80, no. 3 p.623-636dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2015.05.02023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245017300177500001900350520166300369592002802032650000802060650001402068650000902082650001702091650001102108650001802119650001702137650001402154650003202168650001302200650000902213650002002222650001902242650001602261650001902277650001502296650001102311651001702322653003602339653002402375653004402399653002602443653001602469700002202485700003102507700005602538700001802594700002802612773010402640856008502744852000902829655001202838IND60714828920221120171406.0210415e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071482892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1103392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhbarizadeh, Razegheh10aSuspended fine particulate matter (PM2.5), microplastics (MPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in air: Their possible relationships and health implications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExposure to fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) and their associated microcontaminants have been linked to increased harmful effects on the human health. In this study, the possible relationships between PM₂.₅, microplastics (MPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed in an urban area of Bushehr port, in the northern part of the Persian Gulf. Presence, sources, and health risks of MPs and PAHs in both normal and dusty days were also investigated. The median of PM₂.₅ and ƩPAHs were 52.8 μg/m³ and 14.1 ng/m³, respectively, indicating high pollution levels especially in dusty days. The mean level of MPs in urban suspended PM₂.₅ was 5.2 items/m³. Fragments were the most abundant shape of identified MPs and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the most plastic types in urban dust of Bushehr port. The results revealed that PM₂.₅ and MPs may possibly act as a carrier for airborne MPs and PAHs, respectively. In addition, the significant positive relationships between MPs, wind speed and wind direction, confirmed that the MPs transportation were highly controlled by atmospheric condition. Moreover, the source identification methods and trajectory analyses indicated that petrogenic sources from both proximal and distal origins play an important role in the level of PAHs. The results of chronic health risk evaluation via inhalation revealed that PM₂.₅-bound PAHs had high potential cancer risk in winter, while, the estimated risks for non-carcinogenic PAHs were not considerable. In the case of MPs, the assessment of human intake of MPs via inhalation highlighted the possible risks for habitants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abreathing 3adust 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amicroplastics 3aparticulates 3apollution 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3aresearch 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atransportation 3aurban areas 3awind direction 3awind speed 3awinter 3aPersian Gulf 0aFine particulate matter (PM2.5) 0aMicroplastics (MPs) 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aPossible relationship 0aHealth risk1 aDobaradaran, Sina1 aAmouei Torkmahalleh, Mehdi1 aSaeedi, Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3174-77431 aAibaghi, Roza1 aFaraji Ghasemi, Fatemeh0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Jan., v. 192 p.110339-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1103393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001500183245009400198506007600292520134300368592002801711596004001739506003701779650002001816650001701836650001501853650001801868650001101886651001001897700005601907700001501963700001501978700001901993700001702012773012202029856007602151852000902227655001202236IND60624352920221207094952.0181203e20180913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062435292DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/13247512doi7 aPMC61589782pmcid7 a303023002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jing10aDetermination of Phosphorus in Soil by ICP-OES Using an Improved Standard Addition Method  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, an improved standard addition method (ISAM) was developed for the determination of phosphorus in soil by ICP-OES based on the conventional standard addition method (CSAM) and calibration curve method (CCM). Certified standard soils were analyzed by the proposed ISAM method. The values obtained by ISAM method agreed with the certified values. Additionally, the results obtained by ISAM method were compared with those determined by the other two methods (CSAM and CCM). All the values obtained by the ISAM agreed with those from the other two methods. The detection limit, quantification limit, and recovery rate of each method were calculated, and the recovery rates of soil samples and the blank were all within the range of 90%–110%. Finally, the proposed method was applied to determine phosphorous in soil samples from Guangnan County, Yunnan Province, China, and the meadow soil from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. The relative errors between the results from ISAM and CCM were all within 10%, and t-test showed that the results between ISAM and CCM had no significant difference (P>0.05). Therefore, the proposed method overcame the matrix effect in some extent and was an acceptable method for the rapid and accurate batch analysis of P content in soil sample, especially batch samples with obvious matrix effect.  aPublisher supplied data  aDD20160324cChina Geological Survey0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adetection limit 3ameadow soils 3aphosphorus 3asoil sampling 3at-test 3aChina1 aBai, Jingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4169-90871 aLiu, Meiyu1 aChen, Yang1 aWang, Shoutong1 aYang, Qiyong0 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2018 Sept. 13, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/13247513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245010600202300001800308500001900326500002000345520146200365592002801827650002301855650001601878650001701894650001301911650001201924650001001936650002001946650002501966650001201991650001102003650001302014650001002027700002202037700002802059700003102087700006402118700006202182773015002244856007402394852000902468655001202477IND60737953420221117210020.0210520e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073795342DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.109612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXagoraris, Marinos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6237-617210aBotanical origin discrimination of Greek honeys: physicochemical parameters versus Raman spectroscopy  ap. 3319-3327.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The authenticity of honey is of high importance since it affects its commercial value. The discrimination of the origin of honey is of prime importance to reinforce consumer trust. In this study, four chemometric models were developed based on the physicochemical parameters according to European and Greek legislation and one using Raman spectroscopy to discriminate Greek honey samples from three commercial monofloral botanical sources. RESULTS: The results of physicochemical (glucose, fructose, electrical activity) parameters chemometric models showed that the percentage of correct recognition fluctuated from 92.2% to 93.8% with cross‐validation 90.6–92.2%, and the placement of test set was 79.0–84.3% successful. The addition of maltose content in the previous discrimination models did not significantly improve the discrimination. The corresponding percentages of the Raman chemometric model were 95.3%, 90.6%, and 84.3%. CONCLUSION: The five chemometric models developed presented similar and very satisfactory results. Given that the recording of Raman spectra is simple, fast, a minimal amount of sample is needed for the analysis, no solvent (environmentally friendly) is used, and no specialized personnel are required, we conclude that the chemometric model based on Raman spectroscopy is an efficient tool to discriminate the botanical origin of fir, pine, and thyme honey varieties. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aagriculture 3achemometrics 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahoney 3ahuman resources 3alaws and regulations 3amaltose 3amodels 3asolvents 3athyme1 aLazarou, Elisavet1 aKaparakou, Eleftheria H1 aAlissandrakis, Eleftherios1 aTarantilis, Petros A1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5853-47801 aPappas, Christos S1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5303-78250 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 June, v. 101, no. 8 p.3319-3327dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.109613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05725naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009400169520384200263592002804105596005804133650003004191650000804221650001004229650001804239650001604257650001504273650001804288650002204306650001204328650001704340650001004357650004504367650003304412650001504445650001104460650001304471650001804484650001404502650001404516650002204530650002404552650001104576650001204587651001004599653002404609653003404633653002004667653002204687700001204709700001304721700001704734700001704751700005104768700005604819773013104875856008405006852000905090655001205099IND60782400920221118042157.0220708e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078240092DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-21-1841-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xiaoqiao10aFirst Report of Colletotrichum fructicola Causing Anthracnose on Phoebe sheareri in China  aPhoebe sheareri (Hemsl.) Gamble is a high-value timber tree species with a wide range of uses, including for landscape afforestation because of its beautiful shape and luxuriant branches. Previous studies found that Neofusicum parvum can cause ulceration and necrosis on the main stems of P. sheareri (Chen et al. 2019) and branch wilt of P. zhennan (Zhu et al. 2019). In September 2019, anthracnose was observed on P. sheareri leaves in Lishui, Zhejiang province, China. The diseased leaves are characterized by dark brown lesions. The infection usually starts from the leaf tip or edge, and then the infected leaves turn yellow, wither, and finally fall off. The infection sometimes occurs on small twigs, causing the whole branch to wither. Plants from 15 plantations were surveyed, and the disease incidence was about 30%. Fifteen freshly infected leaves were collected and cut into small pieces (5 × 5 mm), sterilized in 75% ethanol solution for 30 s, and washed with sterile water three times. They were further sanitized in 2% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 to 3 min and dried in sterile filter paper after being washed with sterile water another three times. Leaf pieces were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25°C in the dark for 3 days. The fungal cultures were purified and a typical isolate (TJ01) was selected for further morphological characterization and DNA sequence comparison. The strain was initially grayish white, villous, and posteriorly grayish green, and it produced orange red spore clumps. Spores were single celled after maturation, oblong, and colorless, and 8.5 to 19.5 × 4.5 to 5.5 μm. Morphological characteristics were consistent with those in the genus Colletotrichum. DNA of the isolate was extracted, and sequence data were obtained and compared with those downloaded from GenBank. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS), intronic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), and calmodulin (CAL) genes were partially amplified and sequenced using the primer pairs ITS-1 + ITS-4, GDF + GDR, ACT-512F + ACT-783R, T1 + Bt2b, and CL1C + Cl2C, respectively (Fu et al. 2019). The resulting nucleotide sequences were individually subjected to BLAST searches in GenBank. The nucleotide sequences of ITS (MZ088144), GAPDH (MZ133607), ACT (MZ133608), TUB2 (MZ133609), and CAL (MZ133610) of the isolate showed 99.83% similarity to the ITS sequence (MN829453), 98.24% similarity to the GAPDH sequence (MN525875), 98.94% similarity to the ACT sequence (MK341539), 100% similarity to the TUB2 sequence (MG657352), and 100% similarity to the CAL sequence (MN525839). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 7 based on the tandem of five genes (ITS-GAPDH-ACT-TUB2-CAL). It revealed that the isolate resides in the clade of C. fructicola species. Inoculation was done on leaves of 10 P. sheareri plants in the field to verify its pathogenicity. Three healthy leaves of each plant were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol and dried. The leaves were punctured using a sterilized needle, inoculated with 5-mm-diameter PDA plugs excised from 7-day-old cultures, and wrapped with Parafilm. Nine pieces of healthy leaves inoculated with sterilized PDA plugs served as controls. Disease symptoms developed on all the C. fructicola-inoculated leaves 5 days after inoculation, and a yellow brown lesion became apparent 16 days later, whereas the control leaves remained asymptomatic. C. fructicola was reisolated from the lesions, but not from the control leaves, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. This fungus is a well-known pathogen and has led to anthracnose on many plant species globally. However, our study is the first report of C. fructicola causing anthracnose on P. sheareri worldwide, and its potential threat should be evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data  aY201431042cZhejiang Province Department of Education 3aColletotrichum fructicola 3aDNA 3aactin 3aafforestation 3aanthracnose 3acalmodulin 3aculture media 3adisease incidence 3aethanol 3aforest trees 3afungi 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3anecrosis 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3asodium hypochlorite 3aspores 3atubulin 3aChina 0aKoch’s postulates 0amorphological characteristics 0aPhoebe sheareri 0aphylogenetic tree1 aWu, Yan1 aLi, Yuan1 aLin, Haiping1 aMa, Liangjin1 aSu, Xiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7492-15801 aZhou, Xudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9580-90930 tPlant disease.g2022 July 01, v. 106, no. 7 p.1994-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-08-21-1841-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04293naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100003100183245017000214506007600384520202000460592002802480596008102508506003702589650001802626650001902644650002202663650002502685650001402710650001602724650001102740650002602751650001602777650001102793650001902804650002702823650001702850650001102867650001502878650002802893650001402921650002102935650002402956650001602980650001402996650002103010650001303031650001903044650002603063700002503089700002603114700002803140700002903168700002603197700002603223700005703249700005903306700006703365773010203432856007603534852000903610655001203619IND60624353020221207081641.0181203e20180627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062435302DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/13831862doi7 aPMC60402912pmcid7 a300506882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHusna Zulkrnin, Nor Shaida10aLarvicidal Effectiveness of Azolla pinnata against Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) with Its Effects on Larval Morphology and Visualization of Behavioural Response  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDengue is vector-borne diseases with 390 million infections per year extending over 120 countries of the world. Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is a primary vector for dengue viral infections for humans. Current focus on application of natural product against mosquito vectors has been the main priority for research due to its eco-safety. The extensive use of chemical insecticides has led to severe health problems, environmental pollution, toxic hazards to human and nontarget species, and development of insecticide resistance on mosquitoes. Azolla pinnata is an aquatic fern and predominantly used as feed in poultry industry and as fertilizer in agricultural field for enhancing the fertility of rice paddy soil. The present study was conducted to explore the larvicidal efficacy of A. pinnata using fresh and powdered form against late third-stage larvae (6 days, 5 mm in larvae body length) of Ae. aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae). The larvicidal bioassays were performed using World Health Organization standard larval susceptibility test method for different concentration for powdered and fresh A. pinnata. Powdered A. pinnata concentration used during larvicidal bioassay ranges from 500ppm to 2000ppm; meanwhile, fresh A. pinnata ranges from 500ppm to 9,000,000 ppm. The highest mortality was at 1853 ppm for powdered A. pinnata compared with fresh A. pinnata at 2,521,535 ppm, while the LC₅₀ for both powdered and fresh A. pinnata recorded at 1262 ppm and 1853 ppm, respectively. Finally, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant difference on Ae. aegypti larval mortality (F=30.439, df=1, p≤0.001) and concentration (F=20.002, df=1, p≤0.001) compared to powdered and fresh A. pinnata at 24-hour bioassay test. In conclusion, the powdered A. pinnata serves as a good larvicidal agent against Ae. aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and this study provided information on the lethal concentration that may have potential for a more eco-friendly Aedes mosquito control program.  aPublisher supplied data  aR/FRGS/A08.00/00425A/002/2017/000440cMinistry of Higher Education, Malaysia0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aAzolla pinnata 3aagricultural land 3aanalysis of variance 3abioassays 3abody length 3adengue 3aferns and fern allies 3afertilizers 3ahumans 3ainsect vectors 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3alarvae 3alarvicides 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3amosquito control 3anontarget organisms 3apaddy soils 3apollution 3apoultry industry 3atoxicity 3avector control 3avector-borne diseases1 aRozhan, Nurul Nadiah1 aZulkfili, Nur Amanina1 aRaihan Nik Yusoff, Nik,1 aRasat, Mohd Sukhairi Mat1 aAbdullah, Nor Hakimin1 aAhmad, Muhammad Iqbal1 aRājīv Ravi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4386-38101 aIshak, Intan H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8916-04511 aMohd Amin, Mohamad Faiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4283-19750 tJournal of parasitology research.g2018 June 27, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:21566x2090-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/13831863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011000168300001400278520102200292592002801314650001101342650001601353650001001369650001701379650001801396650001701414650001901431650001801450650001601468650001501484650000901499650002501508650001901533650002201552650002001574653002601594653001901620653002801639653002401667700002001691700002201711700001901733700002001752700002101772773010601793856008601899852000901985655001201994IND60540800420221118110022.0190318e20141013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054080042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.04.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Eun Hye10aAntitumor metastasis activity of pectic polysaccharide purified from the peels of Korean Citrus Hallabong  ap. 72-79.  aA polysaccharide fraction, HBE-III, was successfully purified in a high yield (40.4%) from its crude polysaccharide (HBE-0) which was prepared from pectinase hydrolysates of the peels of the Korean Citrus Hallabong. In experimental lung metastasis studies of Colon 26-M3.1 carcinoma cells, prophylactic administration of HBE-III significantly inhibited lung metastasis in a dose-dependent manner. In an in vitro cytotoxicity analysis, HBE-III (up to 1000μg/mL) did not affect the growth of Colon 26-M3.1 cells and normal cells. HBE-III enhanced production of IL-6 and IL-12 by murine peritoneal macrophages. In an assay for natural killer (NK) cell activity, HBE-III (1000μg/mouse, i.v.) significantly augmented NK cytotoxicity against Yac-1 tumor cells. The depletion of NK cells by injection of mouse anti-asialo GM1 serum abolished the inhibitory effect of HBE-III on lung metastasis of Colon 26-M3.1 cells. These data suggest that HBE-III may inhibit tumor metastasis via activation of macrophages and NK cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3ablood serum 3acolon 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3ahydrolysates 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3ametastasis 3amice 3anatural killer cells 3aneoplasm cells 3apolygalacturonase 3apolysaccharides 0aCitrus Hallabong peel 0aPolysaccharide 0aAntimetastasis activity 0aNatural killer cell1 aPark, Hye-Ryung1 aShin, Myoung-Sook1 aCho, Sun Young1 aChoi, Hyuk-Joon1 aShin, Kwang-Soon0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Oct. 13, v. 111 p.72-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.04.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245005700172300001600229500001900245500001100264520101100275592002801286650003001314650002101344650001101365650001101376650002201387650001701409700002301426700005901449700002001508700002201528700002101550700002701571773011101598856008301709852000901792655001201801IND60705353020221117110333.0200807e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070535302DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-020-00322-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDattola, Annunziata10aRole of Vitamins in Skin Health: a Systematic Review  ap. 226-235.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Skin is the main defense organ of the human body against external insults (ultraviolet radiations, infections by pathogenic microorganisms, and mechanical and chemical stress). The integrity and functions of the skin barrier are supported by an adequate supply of micronutrients, such as several vitamins. The purpose of this review was to analyze all vitamin-related skin problems. RECENT FINDINGS: The World Health Organization has estimated that more than 2 billion people worldwide experience deficiencies in the intake of essential vitamins and minerals; the percentage of adults all over the world using daily vitamin supplements, for treatment or prevention of chronic disease, has increased very rapidly in recent years. In this review, 65 studies have been selected in order to examine the role of the main vitamins and their derivatives involved in maintaining the well-being of the skin and their use as prophylactic and therapeutic agents in the management of skin disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3achronic diseases 3ahumans 3apeople 3asystematic review 3atherapeutics1 aSilvestri, Martina1 aBennardo, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0434-10271 aPassante, Maria1 aScali, Elisabetta1 aPatruno, Cataldo1 aNisticò, Steven Paul,0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2020 Sept., v. 9, no. 3 p.226-235dSpringer USwJournal:21580x2161-33117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-020-00322-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05133naa a2201081 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015300168500001400321520225500335592002802590650003202618650003402650650002102684650001902705650001502724650001802739650002102757650002502778650002302803650001602826650001202842650002002854650001802874650004302892650001602935650001902951650002502970650002402995650001703019650001203036650002203048650004303070650000903113650001703122650003703139650002103176650002103197650002503218653001703243653003203260653003403292653002303326653000803349653001003357653000803367653000803375653000803383653001003391653001003401653000803411653001003419653000803429653000803437653000903445653001403454653000803468653001003476653001003486653001003496653000803506653000703514653001103521653000903532653001403541653001103555653001103566653001003577653001003587653001003597653000903607653000703616653000803623653000903631653000703640653000903647653000803656700001703664700001403681700001703695700001703712700001703729700005103746700005403797773009403851856008503945852000904030655001204039IND60704826620221121061313.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070482662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1532922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Mengjiao10aHuang-Qi San ameliorates hyperlipidemia with obesity rats via activating brown adipocytes and converting white adipocytes into brown-like adipocytes  aNAL-light  aBrown adipose tissue (BAT) activation is a promising therapeutic target to treat hyperlipidemia with obesity. Huang-Qi San (HQS), an traditional Chinese medicine, can ameliorate hyperlipidemia with obesity, but its mechanism of action (MOA) is not understood.To articulate the MOA for HQS with animal models.The main chemical constituents of HQS were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based assay. Hyperlipidemia with obesity rat models induced by high-fat diet were employed in the study. The levels of the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured to evaluate the ability of HQS to ameliorate hyperlipidemia with obesity. Pathological analyses of organs were conducted with Oil Red O staining, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and transmission electron microscopy. The expression of mRNAs related to thermogenic genes, fatty acid oxidation-related genes and mitochondria biogenic genes were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. The protein expressions of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) were investigated by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Simultaneously, the protein expression of PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5A) was detected by western blot.HQS ameliorates metabolic disorder, lipid ectopic deposition, obesity and maintained glucose homeostasis in hyperlipidemia with obesity rats. HQS can significantly increase the number of mitochondria and reduced the size of the intracellular lipid droplets in BAT, and increase the expression of BAT activation-related genes (UCP1, PGC1α, PGC1β, Prdm16, CD137, TBX1, CPT1a, PPARα, Tfam, NRF1 and NRF2) in vivo. Furthermore, UCP1, PRDM16 and ATP5A proteins of BAT were increased.HQS can activate BAT and browning of S-WAT (subcutaneous white adipose tissue) through activating the PRDM16/PGC1α/UCP1 pathway, augmenting mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation to increase thermogenesis and energy expenditure, resulting in a significant amelioration of hyperlipidemia with obesity. Therefore, HQS is an effective therapeutic medicine for the treatment of hyperlipidemia with obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aWestern blotting 3abeta oxidation 3abiogenesis 3ablood glucose 3abrown adipocytes 3abrown adipose tissue 3aenergy expenditure 3afatty acids 3aglucose 3aheat production 3ahigh fat diet 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperlipidemia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amechanism of action 3amitochondria 3aobesity 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3atherapeutics 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atriacylglycerols 3awhite adipocytes 3awhite adipose tissue 0aHuang-Qi San 0aHyperlipidemia with obesity 0aWhite adipose tissue browning 0aAbbreviations: ALT 0aAST 0aATP5A 0aAUC 0aBAT 0aBMI 0aCpt1a 0aE-WAT 0aFPG 0aHDL-C 0aH&E 0aHFD 0aHPLC 0aHPLC-ELSD 0aHQS 0aHQS-H 0aHQS-L 0aLDL-C 0aMOA 0aNC 0aNRF1/2 0aOGTT 0aPGC1α/β 0aPPARα 0aPRDM16 0aP-WAT 0aQ-PCR 0aS-WAT 0aTBX1 0aTC 0aTEM 0aTfam 0aTG 0aUCP1 0aWAT1 aGuan, Zhuoji1 aGao, Ying1 aXing, Juling1 aZhou, Xinxin1 aWang, Chunyi1 aXu, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1075-03371 aLi, Weimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9377-72190 tPhytomedicine.g2020 Nov., v. 78 p.153292-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1532923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012400153300001800277500001900295500002000314520184900334592002802183596007902211596009802290596009102388596008602479650001602565650001202581650001502593650001902608650001102627650001402638650001702652650002602669650002602695650001902721650002302740650002902763650001902792651001002811700001802821700001402839700001902853700001802872700005702890700001302947773015002960856007403110852000903184655001203193IND60737953620221117205909.0210520e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073795362DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.109782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ye10aBagging and non‐bagging treatment on the dissipation and residue of four mixed application pesticides on banana fruit  ap. 3472-3480.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Bananas are vulnerable to disease and insect pests after producing fruit. In order to increase the yield and produce high‐quality fruit, the insecticides and fungicides are mixed and applied 2–3 times on banana, then the fruit is bagged. Buprofezin, imidacloprid, difenoconazole, and pyraclostrobin are widely used on banana. However, there is a lack of research on the effect of fruit bagging on pesticide dissipation and residues on bananas. RESULTS: A versatile liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method with modified QuEChERS sample preparation has been developed for the determination of buprofezin, imidacloprid, difenoconazole, and pyraclostrobin in bananas. The recovery of four pesticides was satisfactory (74.96–98.63%) with reasonable relative standard deviation (≤ 8.78%). In Hainan and Guangzhou, the half‐lives of the four pesticides were 4.68–13.9 and 5.63–20.4 days in non‐bagged and bagged bananas, respectively. The significance analysis of the half‐lives in the two sites showed that the dissipation rates of the three pesticides (imidacloprid, difenoconazole, pyraclostrobin) on whole bananas were significantly decreased by the effect of bagging (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the degradation of half‐life of buprofezin under bagging and without bagging (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The high vapor pressure and the non‐systemic property cause buprofezin to evaporate and dissipate the fastest among the four studied pesticides. The ultimate residues of four pesticides in bananas are lower than the maximum residue limits in China after three times of mixed applications under bagging or non‐bagging. The results provide scientific data for evaluating the safety of four pesticides in banana bagging. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD 0200206‐3cthe Major State Research Development Program of China  aKY[2014]287cthe Natural Science Research Project of Education Department of Guizhou Province  a111 Programcthe Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities of China  aD20023cthe Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities of China 3aagriculture 3abananas 3abuprofezin 3adifenoconazole 3afruits 3ahalf life 3aimidacloprid 3aliquid chromatography 3apesticide persistence 3apyraclostrobin 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry 3avapor pressure 3aChina1 aSong, Qingmei1 aWang, Fei1 aTang, Shouying1 aPan, Tingtiao1 aZhang, Yuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5494-37471 aHu, Deyu0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 June, v. 101, no. 8 p.3472-3480dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.109783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012800164300001600292520131500308592002801623650002501651650002301676650002301699650003001722650001901752650001201771650002701783650001801810650001601828650001901844650001401863650001801877650001401895650001401909700002601923700001801949700001801967700006901985773011002054856008202164852000902246655001202255IND60681804220221120041706.0200118e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068180422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-019-09983-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shaohui10aCompatibility of a microsclerotial granular formulation of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum with fungicides  ap. 113-123.  aThe compatibility of microsclerotial granules of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum (Petch) strain F52 with fungicides (chlorothalonil, iprodione, propiconazole, pyraclostrobin+metconazole, and propiconazole+trifloxystrobin) was determined. In vitro, chlorothalonil was not detrimental to conidial production and viability at all concentrations (1–1000 mg a.i. (active ingredient) l⁻¹). Iprodione reduced conidial production at ≥ 100 mg a.i. l⁻¹ but had no effect on viability. Propiconazole reduced conidial production at ≥ 10 mg a.i. l⁻¹ and reduced viability at 1000 mg a.i. l⁻¹. A pyraclostrobin+metconazole combination reduced conidial production at ≥ 10 mg a.i. l⁻¹ and viability at ≥ 100 mg a.i. l⁻¹. A propiconazole+trifloxystrobin combination reduced conidial production at all concentrations and viability at ≥ 100 mg a.i. l⁻¹. In the greenhouse, propiconazole suppressed colony forming unit (CFU) counts at both low and high rates. Chlorothalonil and iprodione had no inhibitory effect on fungal growth. The number of CFUs recovered did not differ significantly ten, 20 or 30 days after treatment.

Due to the decrease of the quantity and quality of habitats, this process causes the restriction of organisms to sometimes-specific microhabitats. The patterns of variation of the biodiversity along the environmental gradients, however, are still poorly understood. This study evaluated how urban gradients affect the diversity, specific composition and frequency of guild of the community of butterflies. Butterflies were collected in three transects continuously traversing the urban, rural and preserved habitats using baited traps and by active sampling. We found that the urban gradient acts as an environmental filter in the butterfly communities, reducing the richness and frequency of guilds of frugivorous butterflies, structuring the community through turnover, but without effects in the abundance. This study shows the importance of the urban gradients approach in the butterfly community and its applicability in the management of urban areas in order to include native vegetation along the gradients, aiming at increasing environmental heterogeneity, to preserve butterflies and maintain the ecosystem services and network interactions in altered landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abutterflies 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afrugivores 3aindigenous species 3aurban areas1 aBressan, Pedro1 aSantos, Ana Luíza1 aCornelissen, Tatiana0 tUrban ecosystems.g2020 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.723-730dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-020-00975-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245004400172300001600216500001900232500001100251520120300262592002801465650002201493650001301515650001701528650001601545650001801561650001201579700002301591700006101614773011101675856008301786852000901869655001201878IND60705353220221117110437.0200807e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070535322DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-020-00331-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlAmmar, Welayah A.10aFood and Mood: the Corresponsive Effect  ap. 296-308.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: The question whether food choice and eating behavior influence the mood or are influenced by the mood has been inquisitive to scientists and researchers. The purpose of this review is to support or refuse the argument that mood is affected by food or vice versa. RECENT FINDINGS: The association between food and mood has been comprehensively elucidated in this review based on several studies that include participants from different ages, cultural backgrounds, and health status. The correlation among food, mood, and diseases such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and depression was thoroughly investigated. The effect of different foods and nutrients on the mood was further explained. It is concluded that the mood significantly affects food intake and food choices. On the other hand, food also influences the mood, which affects the diseases either positively or negatively. Appropriate food choices play a significant role in mood enhancement. Advertisement is another crucial factor that negatively affects food choices and mood and contributes to many diseases. Understanding the interaction between food and mood can help to prevent or alleviate undesired health issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes mellitus 3aemotions 3afood choices 3afood intake 3ahealth status 3aobesity1 aAlbeesh, Fatima H.1 aKhattab, Rabie Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1715-970X0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2020 Sept., v. 9, no. 3 p.296-308dSpringer USwJournal:21580x2161-33117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-020-00331-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009800164300001600262520129300278592002801571650002801599650001101627650001601638650002801654650001301682650001201695650001401707650001201721650001901733650001601752651001401768700001701782700002101799773009001820856004801910852000901958655001201967IND50064977020221120235427.0130414e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006497702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-013-0291-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalcroft, M.10aOntogenic time and worker longevity in the Australian stingless bee, Austroplebeia australis   ap. 259-264.  aLittle is known about the biology and life cycle of the Australian stingless bee, Austroplebeia australis (Friese). The ontogenic times for developing offspring, as well as the longevity of adults, drive the overall life cycle of a social colony. The developmental times for brood within stingless bee species which build cluster-type nests, such as A. australis, are as yet unreported. A technique was developed whereby ‘donor’ brood cells were separated from the main brood cluster and ‘grafted’ into hive annexes, allowing workers from within the colony to access the brood ‘grafts’ for hygiene and maintenance activities, whilst enabling observation of developing brood. The mean ontogenic time for A. australis workers, maintained at ~27 °C, was 55 days, which is similar to that reported for other stingless bees. The maximum longevity of A. australis was determined by marking cohorts of worker bees within five colonies. Workers within all colonies demonstrated extended longevity, with an overall maximum longevity of 161 days, with the oldest bee living for 240 days. Extended longevity may result from evolutionary adaptations to the floral resource scarcity, which is regularly experienced in semi-arid, inland Australia, the natural habitat of A. australis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustroplebeia australis 3aadults 3abrood cells 3aevolutionary adaptation 3ahabitats 3ahygiene 3alongevity 3aprogeny 3astingless bees 3aworker bees 3aAustralia1 aHaigh, A.

In contrast, the better-known T. epicoccoides, though also a primary pathogen of Eucalyptus, causes less damage to trees in these areas. Although T. destructans is an aggressive pathogen, nothing is known about its infection biology. In this study, the conditions for infection and disease development caused by T. destructans and T. epicoccoides were evaluated and compared on a Eucalyptus grandis × E. urophylla hybrid clone. The optimal temperature for germination ranged from 25 to 30°C for T. destructans and 15 to 20°C for T. epicoccoides. The germination of these pathogens was favored under conditions of light and high levels of RH. Penetration by T. destructans and T. epicoccoides occurred via stomata, and the hyphae colonized the intercellular spaces of infected leaves. Symptoms were clearly visible 3 weeks after inoculation by both pathogens, and reproductive structures started to develop in substomatal cavities at 4 weeks after inoculation. The results of this study will facilitate the establishment of rapid screening trials based on artificial inoculations aimed at reducing the impact of disease caused by T. destructans.  aPublisher supplied data  cMondi Group, Tree Protection Co-operative Programme, Forestry South Africa, and the DST/NRF Centre of Excellence in Plant Health Biotechnology, South Africa  aDOCTORADO BECAS CHILE/2019–72200511cNational Agency for Research and Development Scholarship Program 3aEucalyptus grandis 3agermination 3ahybrids 3ahyphae 3aleaf blight 3apathogens 3atemperature 0aEucalyptus 0ainfection biology 0aTeratosphaeria leaf blight 0aTeratosphaeria leaf spot1 aWingfield, Michael J.1 aHammerbacher, Almuth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0262-26341 aNaidoo, Sanushka0 tPlant disease.g2022 July 01, v. 106, no. 7 p.1944-1951dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-09-21-1877-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03785naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011100171300001100282520226900293592002802562650002402590650001302614650002202627650001402649650001102663650002002674650001402694650002602708650000902734650003002743650001102773650001502784650001002799650001802809650001402827650002502841650002602866650002002892650001002912650002202922650002002944651001102964651001802975700001702993700001903010700002303029773011103052856008303163852000903246655001203255IND60725524020221116211906.0220502e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552402DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-021-04584-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFetene, Eyerusalem10aGlobal distribution, host range and prevalence of Trypanosoma vivax: a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 80.  aBACKGROUND: Trypanosomosis caused by Trypanosoma vivax is one of the diseases threatening the health and productivity of livestock in Africa and Latin America. Trypanosoma vivax is mainly transmitted by tsetse flies; however, the parasite has also acquired the ability to be transmitted mechanically by hematophagous dipterans. Understanding its distribution, host range and prevalence is a key step in local and global efforts to control the disease. METHODS: The study was conducted according to the methodological recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. A systematic literature search was conducted on three search engines, namely PubMed, Scopus and CAB Direct, to identify all publications reporting natural infection of T. vivax across the world. All the three search engines were screened using the search term Trypanosoma vivax without time and language restrictions. Publications on T. vivax that met our inclusion criteria were considered for systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULT: The study provides a global database of T. vivax, consisting of 899 records from 245 peer-reviewed articles in 41 countries. A total of 232, 6277 tests were performed on 97 different mammalian hosts, including a wide range of wild animals. Natural infections of T. vivax were recorded in 39 different African and Latin American countries and 47 mammalian host species. All the 245 articles were included into the qualitative analysis, while information from 186 cross-sectional studies was used in the quantitative analysis mainly to estimate the pooled prevalence. Pooled prevalence estimates of T. vivax in domestic buffalo, cattle, dog, dromedary camel, equine, pig, small ruminant and wild animals were 30.6%, 6.4%, 2.6%, 8.4%, 3.7%, 5.5%, 3.8% and 12.9%, respectively. Stratified according to the diagnostic method, the highest pooled prevalences were found with serological techniques in domesticated buffalo (57.6%) followed by equine (50.0%) and wild animals (49.3%). CONCLUSION: The study provides a comprehensive dataset on the geographical distribution and host range of T. vivax and demonstrates the potential of this parasite to invade other countries out of Africa and Latin America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aGlossina 3aTrypanosoma vivax 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adiagnostic techniques 3adogs 3ageographical distribution 3ahorses 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ameta-analysis 3aparasites 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3asmall ruminants 3aswine 3asystematic review 3atrypanosomiasis 3aAfrica 3aLatin America1 aLeta, Samson1 aRegassa, Fikru1 aBüscher, Philippe0 tParasites & vectors.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.80-80dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04584-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245014100158300001600299520142100315592002801736653001401764653000901778653001701787653001701804653001701821700001701838700001801855773012801873856007802001852000902079655001202088IND60517096020221118191836.0160328e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051709602DNAL7 a10.1139/cjpp-2013-00672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yan10aDoxazosin selectively potentiates contraction to serotonin via 5-HT2A receptors in longitudinal muscle strips of the rabbit gastric body  ap. 197-204.  aThe aims of this study were to examine the effects of doxazosin on contractile responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), carbachol, and histamine, and to compare them with those of prazosin, alfuzosin, and terazosin, and then characterize a pharmacological profile of the 5-HT-induced contractile response using preparations of isolated longitudinal muscle strips from the rabbit gastric body. The results from these preparations showed that the contraction response to 5-HT, but not to carbachol or histamine, was found to be dose-dependently potentiated by doxazosin and its enantiomers. The specific potentiation effect on 5-HT was not observed in the preparations that were treated with prazosin, terazosin, or alfuzosin. The contractile response to 5-HT and its potentiation by doxazosin were not affected by treatment with phenoxybenzamine. However, 5-HT-induced contraction was competitively antagonized by nefazodone (with pA₂ value of 8.64 ± 0.17), and was almost completely inhibited by treatment with indomethacin. In conclusion, doxazosin, but not prazosin, alfuzosin, or terazosin, selectively potentiates 5-HT-induced contraction in the rabbit gastric body strips via an α₁-adrenoceptor-independent mechanism, without chiral recognition of its enantiomers. Additionally, the contraction to 5-HT was found to be mediated via 5-HT₂A receptors, and was similar to PGs synthesis in the preparations.  aPublisher supplied data 0adoxazosin 0a5-HT 0apotentiation 0agastric body 0aindomethacin1 aCao, Xue-Bin1 aRen, Lei-Ming0 tCanadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology.g2013 Dec. 18, v. 92, no. 3 p.197-204dNRC Research Pressx1205-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2013-00673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245016500162300001400327520086500341592002801206650002101234650001501255650002301270650002301293650001601316650001601332650001501348650001601363650001301379650001201392650001901404700001801423700001401441700001501455700001601470700005601486773010801542856008201650852000901732655001201741IND60681804420221120053045.0200118e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068180442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-019-09984-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasso, R.14aThe establishment of a rearing technique for the fruit fly parasitoid Baryscapus silvestrii increases knowledge of biological, ecological and behavioural traits  ap. 47-57.  aWe have evaluated different rearing strategies of Baryscapus silvestrii (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a parasitoid of Bactrocera oleae (Diptera: Tephritidae), including the use of a factitious host, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), and in the process acquired new knowledge of the parasitoid’s biology.

The aim of this work was to determine the seroprevalence of BRSV in feedlot cattle of Argentina and the risk factors associated with the disease. Results showed a high individual seroprevalence of 78.64% (95% confidence interval adjusted [CI]=66.55–90.75%) against the virus. Positive association was found between the presence of high BRSV neutralizing antibody titers, and the following risk factors: cattle age, source of animals, presence of clinical respiratory signs and herd size. This work contributes to updating the understanding of its epidemiology in Argentinean feedlots and poses the need for reevaluating vaccination strategies against this virus in order to control infection and its impact on productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneutralization 3aseroprevalence 3afeedlots 3aBovine orthopneumovirus 3acattle 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aherd size 3afinancial economics 3aconfidence interval 3arisk factors 3aviruses 3aneutralizing antibodies 3avaccination 3aArgentina 0aBRSV 0aEpidemiology 0aSeroprevalence 0aRisk factors 0aBRSV 0aEpidemiología 0aSeroprevalencia 0aFactores de riesgo1 aPérez Aguirreburualde, María Sol1 aMargineda, Carlos1 aAznar, Natalia1 aSammarruco, Ayelen1 aDus Santos, María Jose1 aMozgovoj, Marina0 tRevista argentina microbiología.g2018 July,  Sept., v. 50, no. 3 p.275-279dElsevier España, S.L.U.aAsociación Argentina de MicrobiologíawJournal:23426x0325-75417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2017.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002400161245009000185300001600275500000900291520146600300592002801766650001201794650002201806650002001828650002301848650001201871650002201883650001001905650001201915650001001927650001301937650001501950650001301965650000701978650002401985650001502009651001702024651001102041651001402052773014802066856009602214852000902310655001202319IND60668335220221120062607.0191125e195310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066833522DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1953.03615995001700040025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodman, Kenneth V.10aBrown Forest, Polygenetic, and Congeliturbate Profiles of Potter County, Pennsylvania  ap. 399-402.  aepub  aA Brown Forest soil, soils having polygenetic profiles, and soils believed to have developed in materials formed by frost action and slope creep were mapped in Potter County, Pa., an area of normally well developed Podzol soils. Because of the complex conditions which existed at the margins of the continental glaciers, soil classification is difficult in these areas. Field observations and the following laboratory analyses were made: mechanical analyses, pH determinations, X-ray diffraction analyses, and exchangeable cation and base saturation determinations. The results show that the outstanding characteristics of the Brown Forest great soil group can be identified in units as small as a single soil type. The Brown Forest profile has a characteristic granular structure, brown color, and a variation in pH from nearly neutral to acid to alkaline from the surface downward. The presence of gibbsite, usually associated with tropical weathering, in the lower part of the Sweden (tentative) series suggests that it is of polygenetic nature and that the lower part of the profile formed prior to Wisconsin glaciation. The physical and chemical analyses of the congeliturbate profiles, as well as a lack of erratics and rounded sands and gravels, suggest that although till-like in nature, such profiles may have developed in materials formed as a result of frost action rather than glacial action. Further study is needed to substantiate this hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodzols 3aX-ray diffraction 3abase saturation 3abrown forest soils 3acations 3achemical analysis 3acolor 3aforests 3afrost 3agibbsite 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3apH 3asoil classification 3aweathering 3aPennsylvania 3aSweden 3aWisconsin0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1953 Oct., v. 17, no. 4 p.399-402dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1953.03615995001700040025x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007000167300001600237500001900253520220200272592002802474596008202502650002302584650001302607650001002620650003002630650002602660650001102686650001002697650002302707650001502730650001302745650002102758650002002779650002302799650003202822650001002854650001702864650001702881651001002898700001602908700002002924700002102944700002102965773010702986856008203093852000903175655001203184IND60701283520221120203350.0200710e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070128352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-020-00984-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoussa, Soulé10aDiversity and structure of urban forests of Sahel cities in Niger  ap. 851-864.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUrbanization in the Sahel is constantly competing with and greatly affecting the woody flora in urban areas. Urbanization can replace the species mix, leading to changes in plant community composition; however, there are limited studies that assess these attributes in Sahelian cities. This study assessed urban forests in Niamey and Maradi, two important cities of Niger, West Africa for differences between the cities and across LULC types in terms of species diversity and stand structure. Woody species were inventoried in 357 plots in urban forests located across seven land use/land cover types. Stem diameter at breast height of trees and shrubs ≥2.5 cm, total height and crown diameter were measured. Eighty-six species belonging to 69 genera with 33 families were inventoried in Niamey, while in Maradi 91 species belonging to 70 genera with 30 families were enumerated. Fabaceae was the dominant family in both cities. Azadirachta indica accounted for 41 and 54% of all stems in Niamey and Maradi. Residential areas had a higher species richness than other land uses. The majority of the species documented in the two cities were exotics representing 52% of all species encountered. Mean Shannon diversity index (H′) and standard deviation was 2.31 ± 0.43 for Niamey and 2.14 ± 0.74 for Maradi. The similarity index of the two cities was 70%. Urban forests of Maradi had significantly higher levels of species richness and evenness as well as tree density and canopy cover than urban forests of Niamey. Across LULC types, canopy cover varied significantly (p < 0.05) but basal area had a marginal variation whilst, stem density was not significantly different. There were significant positive relationships (p < 0.05) between species richness, basal area and canopy cover across the LULC types in both cities. The study shows that land use/land cover types influence the characteristics of urban forests and differences exist in diversity and stand structural characteristics of urban forests in the two cities. Future development of urban forests in the two cities must increase the planting of native species to improve their value for biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  a1cWest African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use 3aAzadirachta indica 3aFabaceae 3aSahel 3abiodiversity conservation 3abotanical composition 3acanopy 3aflora 3aindigenous species 3aland cover 3aland use 3aspecies richness 3astand structure 3astandard deviation 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aurbanization 3awoody plants 3aNiger1 aKuyah, Shem1 aKyereh, Boateng1 aTougiani, Abasse1 aMahamane, Saadou0 tUrban ecosystems.g2020 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.851-864dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-020-00984-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013200168300001600300520139000316592002801706650001801734650002601752650001501778650001801793650001601811650003801827650001701865650001701882650001701899650002301916650001601939650000901955650001101964650001601975650003701991650000902028650001602037650002302053650001402076650001702090650002102107650001702128651001402145653003502159653003902194653003602233653003902269653003502308653003302343653002602376653003702402700002202439700002202461700001602483773018002499856008202679852000902761655001202770IND60581739820221119194208.0200607e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058173982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2017.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustos, Carla P.10aSensibilidad a los antimicrobianos de aislamientos de Streptococcus equi subsp. equi de la provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina  ap. 295-300.  aStreptococcus equi subsp. equi is the etiologic agent of strangles, an infectious disease affecting the upper respiratory tract and head and neck lymph nodes of equines. Routine antimicrobial therapy includes penicillin (PEN) as antibiotic of first choice. Streptococci are usually susceptible to PEN and only a few antimicrobial studies had been performed. The aim of this work was to study the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of S. equi from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Ninety-two isolates were studied by the single disk method to PEN, cefotaxime, erythromycin (ERY), tetracycline, enrofloxacin (ENR), trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (TMS), ciprofloxacin, clindamycin (CLI), streptomycin (STR) and florfenicol. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to PEN and antibiotics with resistance and intermediate susceptibility were tested. High percentages of susceptibility were obtained by the disk diffusion method and MIC values of PEN, TMS and CLI were found to be under the breakpoint values. Resistant strains of ENR and STR with MIC₅₀, MIC₉₀ and MIC ranges above breakpoints were identified. These findings confirm that PEN may be used empirically because resistant strains were not found in Buenos Aires. Emphasis is placed on the rational use of antibiotics to achieve therapeutic success, to prevent chronicity, recurrence of infections and the emergence of resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus 3aantibiotic resistance 3acefotaxime 3aciprofloxacin 3aclindamycin 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3adrug therapy 3aenrofloxacin 3aerythromycin 3aetiological agents 3aflorfenicol 3ahead 3ahorses 3alymph nodes 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aneck 3apenicillins 3arespiratory system 3astrangles 3astreptomycin 3asulfamethoxazole 3atrimethoprim 3aArgentina 0aStreptococcus equi subsp. equi 0aSensibilidad a los antimicrobianos 0aMétodo de difusión con discos 0aConcentración inhibitoria mínima 0aStreptococcus equi subsp. equi 0aAntimicrobial susceptibility 0aDisk diffusion method 0aMinimum inhibitory concentration1 aMarfil, María J.1 aLanza, Natalia S.1 aGuida, Nora0 tRevista argentina microbiología.g2018 July,  Sept., v. 50, no. 3 p.295-300dElsevier España, S.L.U.aAsociación Argentina de MicrobiologíawJournal:23426x0325-75417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2017.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245010800210300001400318520085500332592002801187650002201215650001301237650001401250650003101264650001301295650002001308650001701328653002101345653002001366653002201386653002501408700001801433773010601451856008601557852000901643655001201652IND60540800920221118110053.0190318e20141013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054080092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.04.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnarr, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9384-534114aThe shear dependence of the methylcellulose gelation phenomena in aqueous solution and in ceramic paste  ap. 80-88.  aThe gelation temperature of methylcellulose (MC) in aqueous solutions as well as in aqueous ceramic paste depends on the applied shear. Rheological investigations in oscillation vs. shear mode show lower gelation temperature at low shear rates as for the corresponding angular frequencies. Above a critical shear rate the gelation temperature is shifted to higher temperatures. The paste extrusion process uses MC as a plasticizer and runs under high shear conditions. When extruding close to the gelation temperature of the MC in the paste, crack formation and other defects can occur. The upwards shift of the gelation temperature with increasing applied shear gives a larger temperature window during the extrusion process. The understanding of the shear influence on the gelation temperature is important to design the optimal process conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aceramics 3aextrusion 3agelatinization temperature 3agelation 3amethylcellulose 3aplasticizers 0aThermal gelation 0aMethylcellulose 0aCeramic extrusion 0aGelation temperature1 aBayer, Roland0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Oct. 13, v. 111 p.80-88dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.04.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015600165520196400321592002802285650001802313650001802331650001302349650002002362650002602382650001802408650001502426650001002441650002402451650002102475650001002496650001102506650002102517650001802538650003002556650002502586650001702611650001502628650002002643650002202663650001002685653001902695653002302714653002502737653002902762653001402791653001702805700001102822700001702833700001702850700001302867700001602880700001302896700001502909700001702924700001702941773011002958856008603068852000903154655001203163IND60714829620221120192323.0220103e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071482962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2020.1080302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Du12aA longitudinal study reveals the alterations of the Microtus fortis colonic microbiota during the natural resistance to Schistosoma japonicum infection  aThe gut microbiota has been demonstrated to associate with protection against helminth infection and mediate via microbial effects on the host humoral immunity. As a non-permissive host of Schistosoma japonicum, the Microtus fortis provides an ideal animal model to be investigated, because of its natural self-healing capability. Although researches on the systemic immunological responses have revealed that the host immune system contributes a lot to the resistance, the role of gut microbiome remains unclear. In this study, we exposed the M. fortis to the S.japonicum infection, carried out a longitudinal research (uninfected control, infected for 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 31 days) on their colonic microbiota based on the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The bacterial composition disclosed a disturbance-recovery alteration followed by the resistance to S. japonicum. The alpha diversity of colon microbiota was reduced after the infection, but it gradually recovered along with self-healing process. Further LEfSe analysis revealed that phyla shifted from Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, which were mainly driven by an increase of Ruminococcaceae and a depletion of Muribaculaceae in the family level along the Control-Infection-Recovery (CIR) process. We identified a temporary blooming of Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus in the mid infection stage (D14). As a recognized probiotics repository, we speculate the increased abundance of Lactobacillaceae in M. fortis colonic microbiota might relate to the natural resistance to the schistosome. Besides, potential microbial functions were also significantly changed in the resistance process. These results demonstrate the remarkable alterations of reed vole colonic microbiota in both community structure and potential functions along with the resistance to S. japonicum infection. The identified microbial biomarkers might offer new ways for drug development to conquer human schistosomiasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aLactobacillus 3aMicrotus 3aRuminococcaceae 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3acolon 3acommunity structure 3adrug development 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alongitudinal studies 3aparasitology 3aprobiotics 3aschistosomiasis 3aspecies diversity 3avoles 0aGut microbiota 0aHelminth infection 0aNon-permissive hosts 0a16S rRNA gene sequencing 0aReed vole 0aBlood flukes1 aHu, Qi1 aLiu, Xueduan1 aLiu, XinXing1 aGao, Fei1 aLiang, Yili1 aZou, Kai1 aSu, Zhijie1 aZhi, Wenling1 aZhou, Zhijun0 tExperimental parasitology.g2020 Dec., v. 219 p.108030-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2020.1080303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009700168300001600265520107300281592002801354650002901382650001101411650001501422650002601437650001501463650001001478650001601488650001201504650001801516650001401534650002001548650002601568650001401594650001401608650001301622650002601635650001701661650001201678653001101690653001501701653002901716653001101745653001601756653002901772700002101801700002501822700002501847700002401872700002201896700002701918700002401945700002001969773018001989856008202169852000902251655001202260IND60581739920221119194316.0200607e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058173992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2017.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaad, Emanuel J.10aStreptococcus agalactiae bacteremia in non-pregnant adult patients at two teaching hospitals  ap. 280-284.  aStreptococcus agalactiae or group B streptococcus (GBS) is a frequent pathogen in immunocompromised adults. The aim of this study was to determine the relative frequency, clinical presentation, antimicrobial susceptibility profile, and risk factors associated with GBS bacteremia in non-pregnant adult patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of blood cultures performed in two hospitals between the years 2009–2013. From 1110 bacteremia episodes, 13 were caused by GBS, all of which were susceptible to ampicillin. GBS bacteremia was more frequent in females and in patients older than 60 years of age. The most frequent comorbidities were chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure and neoplasia. History of appendectomy was detected in 53.8% of the patients, being the most relevant comorbidity for GBS bacteremia in the multivariate analysis (OR 4.13, p=0.012). The main presentations were primary bacteremia and soft tissue infection. GBS bacteremia was infrequent in our institution, and a history of appendectomy might be related to bacteremia occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aadults 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteremia 3ablood 3acomorbidity 3afemales 3aheart failure 3ahospitals 3akidney diseases 3amultivariate analysis 3aneoplasms 3apathogens 3apatients 3aretrospective studies 3arisk factors 3atissues 0aAdults 0aBacteremia 0aStreptococcus agalactiae 0aAdulto 0aBacteriemia 0aStreptococcus agalactiae1 aBaenas, Diego F.1 aBoisseau, Cecilia S.1 aGarcía, Mercedes J.1 aNúñez, Silvana A.1 aSanchez, Pablo E.1 aBalderramo, Domingo C.1 aHernández, Daniela1 aCaeiro, Juan P.0 tRevista argentina microbiología.g2018 July,  Sept., v. 50, no. 3 p.280-284dElsevier España, S.L.U.aAsociación Argentina de MicrobiologíawJournal:23426x0325-75417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2017.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012600204300001000330520183300340592002802173596005502201650002302256650002002279650001502299650001202314650001602326650002302342650002502365650001602390650001402406650001102420650001502431650001702446650002002463650002602483650002502509650001502534700003002549700002602579773012902605856008302734852000902817655001202826IND60725524520221116211813.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552452DNAL7 a10.1186/s13213-020-01618-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMtaki, Kulwa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6947-586210aSupplementing wastewater with NPK fertilizer as a cheap source of nutrients in cultivating live food (Chlorella vulgaris)  ap. 7.  aINTRODUCTION: The decline in fishery resources from the wild has led to an ever increasing focus on aquaculture in recent years. With increasing aquaculture of animal species, there is an increasing need for suitable microalgae in the production of these animals. However, cultivation of microalgae in expensive pure chemical media is one of the major challenges facing large-scale cultivation of microalgae. PURPOSE: The present study investigated the suitability of aquaculture wastewater (AWW) supplemented with NPK (nitrogen:phosphorus:potassium) fertilizer as a cheap source of nutrient to cultivate a microalga Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris). METHODS: C. vulgaris with an initial cell density of 0.8 × 10⁶ cells/mL was batch cultured in AWW supplemented with NPK at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 g/L and BBM for 20 days under laboratory conditions using 2000 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. The proximate composition, chlorophyll, minerals, and vitamins analysis of C. vulgaris biomass were done using standard analytical methods. RESULTS: The highest values in optical density (4.872 ± 0.025), dry cell weight (2.858 ± 0.015 g/L), specific growth rate (0.2097 ± 0.0038 day–¹), and biomass productivity (0.1701 ± 0.0007 g/L/day) were obtained in C. vulgaris grown in AWW + 1.0 NPK medium. The total chlorophyll, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate content of the microalgae biomass were in the range of 0.05–0.862%, 44.062–57.089%, 17.064–23.260%, and 15.217–21.896%, respectively. Furthermore, microalgae grown in AWW + 1.0 NPK showed good vitamin and mineral content compared to BBM grown alga. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that the AWW + 0.1 NPK, AWW + 0.5 NPK, and AWW + 1.0 NPK are potential growth media for C. vulgaris cultivation and can replace the BBM medium, which is very expensive and less accessible to users.  aPublisher supplied data  a51170071cSwedish International Cooperation Agency 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aNPK fertilizers 3aabsorbance 3aanimals 3aaquaculture 3abiomass production 3acarbohydrate content 3achlorophyll 3afisheries 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amicrobiology 3amineral content 3aproximate composition 3aspecific growth rate 3awastewater1 aKyewalyanga, Margareth S.1 aMtolera, Matern S.

Yields of corn and bromegrass roots also increased with temperature except for a decline in bromegrass roots when temperature was increased from 67° to 80° F. Tuber yields were usually higher at soil temperatures above 41° F., but the optimum temperature varied with nutrient treatment. The nutrient composition of the crops showed few consistent trends in relation to soil temperature. The P content of bromegrass and potato tops, however, increased with rising temperatures when the plants were grown without added P. Uptake of N, P, Ca, Mg and K by the crops usually increased with increasing temperature to at least 67° F. The uptake of P by the plants without addition of the nutrient, relative to the uptake obtained with addition, increased almost invariably with each increment in temperature. Water-use efficiency usually increased where N, P and K were added together and often decreased as soil temperatures increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus 3acalcium 3acorn 3acrop yield 3agreenhouse soils 3agreenhouses 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3apotatoes 3aroots 3asoil temperature 3atubers 3awater use efficiency1 aHalstead, R.

Research on this topic have traditionally focused on ecological impacts, with poor regards to the social components. The ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri is one of the most successful invaders and it is widely appreciated by the general public, being introduced through the pet trade. In this work we assessed whether long-term introduction, total population size and number of loud flight-calls affected social perception of this species in three populations from Italian cities. We used a visual survey (N = 414 questionnaires), which has been proven to be successful for testing attitudes on ring-necked parakeets. Tolerance towards this invasive species declined sharply with increasing number of loud calls by this species, thus providing support to the hypothesis of involvement of the ring-necked parakeet in noise pollution. Conversely, total population size and years since the first local introduction were not found out to be important variable determining social attitudes. Awareness on invasive species impacts is mostly obtained only when invasive populations are already affecting native biodiversity and human wellness, thus when management becomes challenging. Thus, at early invasion stages, intervention towards invasive species, particularly if charismatic, are often hampered by social public and animal right movements, especially in urban ecosystems. Educational campaigns on ecological and social impact by invasive alien species in urban ecosystems are therefore strongly recommended to implement effective management actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsittacula krameri 3abiodiversity 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3anoise pollution 3aparakeets 3apopulation size 3asocial impact 3asurveys 3atrade1 aOnorati, Gianluca1 aGiuntini, Silvia0 tUrban ecosystems.g2020 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.755-760dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-020-00954-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245013600183300001800319520163500337592002801972650002502000650000902025650001502034650001902049650001302068650002302081650001502104650001402119650002202133650002202155650001502177650001702192650002602209650001802235650001702253650004002270650001902310650004102329650001502370650004902385700001602434700001402450700001702464700001702481700001602498700001402514700001902528773012302547856008102670852000902751655001202760IND60080308420221121233115.0150216e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008030842DNAL7 a248329562pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-014-1666-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Pei-pei10aMetabolomic approach to optimizing and evaluating antibiotic treatment in the axenic culture of cyanobacterium Nostoc flagelliforme  ap. 2407-2418.  aThe application of antibiotic treatment with assistance of metabolomic approach in axenic isolation of cyanobacterium Nostoc flagelliforme was investigated. Seven antibiotics were tested at 1–100 mg L⁻¹, and order of tolerance of N. flagelliforme cells was obtained as kanamycin > ampicillin, tetracycline > chloromycetin, gentamicin > spectinomycin > streptomycin. Four antibiotics were selected based on differences in antibiotic sensitivity of N. flagelliforme and associated bacteria, and their effects on N. flagelliforme cells including the changes of metabolic activity with antibiotics and the metabolic recovery after removal were assessed by a metabolomic approach based on gas chromatography–mass spectrometry combined with multivariate analysis. The results showed that antibiotic treatment had affected cell metabolism as antibiotics treated cells were metabolically distinct from control cells, but the metabolic activity would be recovered via eliminating antibiotics and the sequence of metabolic recovery time needed was spectinomycin, gentamicin > ampicillin > kanamycin. The procedures of antibiotic treatment have been accordingly optimized as a consecutive treatment starting with spectinomycin, then gentamicin, ampicillin and lastly kanamycin, and proved to be highly effective in eliminating the bacteria as examined by agar plating method and light microscope examination. Our work presented a strategy to obtain axenic culture of N. flagelliforme and provided a method for evaluating and optimizing cyanobacteria purification process through diagnosing target species cellular state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc flagelliforme 3aagar 3aampicillin 3aaxenic culture 3abacteria 3agas chromatography 3agentamicin 3akanamycin 3alight microscopes 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolomics 3amultivariate analysis 3aspectinomycin 3astreptomycin 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aAxenic Culture 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMetabolome 2aNostocxchemistryxdrug effectsxmetabolism.1 aJia, Shi-ru1 aSun, Ying1 aTan, Zhi-lei1 aZhong, Cheng1 aDai, Yu-jie1 aTan, Ning1 aShen, Shi-gang0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2014 Sept., v. 30, no. 9 p.2407-2418dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-014-1666-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011900204300001100323520128200334592002801616596009401644596014101738596012401879596010002003596011502103650004402218650001602262650001502278650001602293650001602309650002102325650001502346650003702361650002202398650002602420650001502446650001302461650001402474650001502488650003302503650002302536700001902559700002002578700001502598700001802613700001302631700001502644700001802659700001702677773013902694856008202833852000902915655001202924IND60681804920221120053027.0200530e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068180492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-4399-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Jianping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5800-846512aA Reusable Biosorbent Using Ca-Alginate Immobilized Providencia vermicola for Pd(II) Recovery from Acidic Solution  ap. 36.  aThis study aimed to develop Ca-alginate immobilized Providencia vermicola as a reusable biosorbent to recover palladium ions from acidic solutions. To examine the adsorption characteristics and availability of Ca-alginate immobilized P. vermicola for Pd(II) recovery, several experiments such as SEM-EDX, FT-IR, isotherm, kinetics, fixed-bed columns, desorption, and reusability were conducted. The results of SEM-EDX and FT-IR analyses demonstrated that amino and carboxyl groups were the main contributors in the Pd(II) biosorption process and that hydroxyl and phosphate groups were also critical for Pd(II) adsorption. The adsorption isotherms could be well described by the Langmuir model, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 197.23 mg g⁻¹. Kinetic experiments suggested that the biosorbent reached adsorption equilibrium within 60 min. After adsorption, the Pd(II) bound to the Ca-alginate immobilized P. vermicola was easily desorbed with 0.1 M HCl. A regeneration test of this Ca-alginate immobilized P. vermicola biosorbent revealed that it could be used for at least five cycles with high adsorption capacity. These results indicated that Ca-alginate immobilized P. vermicola has the extraordinary potential to adsorb metal ions from industrial wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data  a51871250, 51504106cProject supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China  aSKL-SPM-201809cProject supported by the State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technologyies for Comprehensive Utilization of Platinum Metals  a502211852cProject supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University  aSKYAM005-2016cProject supported by State Key Laboratory of Applied Microbiology Southern China  a2015FB204, 2016BA006, 2017FA030cProject supported by the Yunnan Science and Technology Plan Project of China. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aProvidencia 3aadsorption 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3acalcium alginate 3adesorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrochloric acid 3aindustrial wastewater 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3apalladium 3aphosphates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms1 aFeng, Ningning1 aWong, Yoon-wah,1 aGuo, Ziwen1 aDong, Haigang1 aCui, Hao1 aWu, Haiyan1 aQiu, Guanzhou1 aLiu, Xinxing0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 Feb., v. 231, no. 2 p.36-36dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-4399-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009900161300001800260500001900278500001100297520118100308592002801489650001601517650001901533650001001552650001201562650001301574650001601587700006101603773015001664856007401814852000901888655001201897IND60737954320221117205838.0210520e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073795432DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.110202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSommerfeld, Vera10aIn vitro assays for evaluating phytate degradation in non‐ruminants: chances and limitations  ap. 3117-3122.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aThe positive effects of phytases on the environment, animal welfare and animal feed costs have resulted in the continuous development and improvement of these enzymes in the non‐ruminant feed market. To test the efficacy of these phytases, a large number of experimental animals are necessary, antagonising the animal welfare aspect of these enzymes. In the present review, we summarise the most prominent available in vitro assays for evaluating phytase enzymes and how far they can reduce the number of in vivo experiments. Several in vitro assays exist that differ in their setup, extent and conditions depending on the animal of interest and the research question. With the in vitro assays described, it is not possible to fully replace in vivo trials. However, for the investigation of phytase effects in feedstuffs, the use of an in vitro assay has several advantages. In vitro assays have the potential to be used for ranking feed enzymes and as screening tools. Applying in vitro protocols will result in a reduction in the number of animals or treatments usually necessary for an in vivo trial, thus acting towards the three Rs. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aanimal welfare 3afeeds 3amarkets 3aphytases 3aphytic acid1 aSantos, Regiane R1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7030-60970 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 June, v. 101, no. 8 p.3117-3122dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.110203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245013200207300001600339500001900355520176800374592002802142596006402170650002302234650001402257650002202271650002502293650002402318650002602342650002002368650002302388650002602411650001602437650001802453650001702471651000902488700002002497700006402517773010702581856008202688852000902770655001202779IND60701284120221121020731.0200710e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070128412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-020-00958-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilk, Andrew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5469-979910aEffects of habitat fragment size and isolation on the density and genetics of urban red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus)  ap. 761-773.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUrban expansion is creating environmental stressors through land use change, habitat fragmentation, and habitat loss. These stressors, along with a host of others, are driving precipitous declines in vertebrate taxa around the world. Amphibians, often requiring a narrow range of environmental conditions, can be especially susceptible to the stressors of environmental change. Despite habitat loss and degradation, some amphibian species continue to persist in altered urban landscapes. The red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one such- species and in this study, we assess how habitat patch size affects population density and genetic diversity of salamander populations in and around an urban center in Ohio, United States. Further, we examined patterns of genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity to understand gene flow between populations and tested for historic demographic bottleneck effects. Populations were sampled from 9 urban forest patches ranging in size from less than 1 ha to approximately 250 ha. There was no apparent effect of contiguous habitat patch size on salamander density nor genetic diversity, but we did observe significant genetic differentiation between 97% of pairwise population comparisons. The differentiation observed was not a result of overland distance or effective distance due to landscape resistance. There was evidence of historic bottlenecks at every site. These results suggest that density is driven by within-patch heterogeneity and that genetic diversity is affected by drivers other than patch size or contemporary population density. Our study demonstrates that red-backed salamanders can persist in wooded, urban parks, but that genetic diversity remains susceptible to demographic changes.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcOffice of Undergraduate Research, Ohio State University 3aPlethodon cinereus 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat connectivity 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland use change 3apopulation density 3asalamanders and newts 3aurban areas 3aurban forests 3aurbanization 3aOhio1 aDonlon, Kate C.1 aPeterman, William E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5229-92680 tUrban ecosystems.g2020 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.761-773dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-020-00958-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010300169300001800272500001100290520178400301592002802085650002302113650005202136650003002188650001602218650001402234650001302248650002302261650001202284651001002296700002002306700001902326700001802345700006602363773014402429856008302573852000902656655001202665IND60735836220221121065819.0211001e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073583622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-020-00963-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChangotra, Rahil10aLargest democracy in the world crippled by COVID-19: current perspective and experience from India  ap. 6623-6641.  aReview  aThe outbreak of novel and recent coronavirus disease 2019, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has made an emergency throughout the world. In India, the outspread of the pandemic was observed on 3 March 2020, and after that exponential growth in the cases was observed in the country. Owing to the widespread transmission, high population density, high testing capacity and ineffective treatment, a continuous rise in cases was observed due to the pandemic in India. In this paper, we have discussed the trend and spread of COVID-19 spread in India with time, history of initial confirmed cases, the impact of phased manner lockdown, age- and gender-wise trend of cases and comparison of cases with the other most affected countries. The study uses exploratory data analysis to describe the current situation of COVID-19 cases in India till 16 August 2020, with the help of data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India (GOI) and the World Health Organization (WHO). As of August 16, the total number of confirmed cases in India crossed 2.5 million marks with over 50,000 causalities. With more patients recovering and being discharged from hospitals and home isolation (in case of mild and moderate cases), the total recoveries have crossed the 1.8 million mark with a recovery rate of more than 70% and case fatality rate of 1.94% which is maintained below the global average and is on a continuous positive slide. The study also enlightens the preventive and stringent measures taken by India to combat the COVID-19 situation along with the future prospects. The GOI is following its proactive and preemptive approach for management, prevention and containment of COVID-19 in collaboration with the WHO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aWorld Health Organization 3aenvironment 3amortality 3apandemic 3apopulation density 3aviruses 3aIndia1 aRajput, Himadri1 aRajput, Prachi1 aGautam, Sneha1 aArora, Amarpreet Singh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5916-27740 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.6623-6641dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00963-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245014100208300001500349500001400364520131800378592002801696596018301724650001101907650001701918650001801935650001601953650001001969650001401979650001601993650002002009650001702029650001202046650001202058650001302070650001202083650001402095650002002109650005202129650001302181650001202194700006602206700002002272700001802292700001802310700005602328773013502384856008202519852000902601655001202610IND60725524720221116211851.0210126e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552472DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-020-00298-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahim, Md.

We identified 16 and 7 genes putatively involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and regulation via phylogenetic analysis in sweet orange. Further, we determined the expression pattern of these genes by quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). The result showed that the expression levels of CsPSY (Cs6g15910), CsZDS (Cs3g11180), CsZ-ISO (Cs5g24730), CsBCH1 (Cs9g19270), CsFUL2 (Cs5g12280), CsTAGL1 (Cs7g16960), CsRIN1 (Cs6g19680), CsRIN2 (Cs7g10980), and CsHY5 (Cs7g05140) were up-regulated in the skin of mutant cultivar ‘Suneat’ than any other tissues of both citrus cultivars. Of these CsPSY, CsZDS, CsZ-ISO and CsBCH1 genes were related to carotenoid biosynthesis and CsFUL2, CsTAGL1, CsRIN1, CsRIN2, and CsHY5 were known to involve in the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis. Our results reveal that the attractive dark orange skin color of ‘Suneat’ might be due to the up-regulation of carotenoid biosynthetic as well as regulatory genes and thereby higher levels carotenoids at ripening.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant no. 213007-05-4-CG100cThe Golden Seed Project (Center for Horticultural Seed Development) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural affairs (MAFRA), Republic of Korea 3aCitrus 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3acultivars 3aenvironment 3agene expression 3ahorticulture 3ahybrids 3amutants 3amutation 3aoranges 3aphylogeny 3aregulator genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aripening 3atissues1 aAfrin, Khandker Shazia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7403-472X1 aJung, Hee-Jeong1 aKim, Hoy-Taek1 aPark, Jong-In1 aNou, Ill-Sup1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6768-05200 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2021 Feb., v. 62, no. 1 p.99-111dSpringer SingaporewJournal:21607x2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-020-00298-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245008600167300001600253520138700269592002801656653003201684653001601716653001701732653002101749653002301770653001801793653001301811700002701824700001801851700001601869700002101885700002301906773012701929856007802056852000902134655001202143IND60517096820221118191416.0160328e20140107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051709682DNAL7 a10.1139/cjpp-2013-03502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGordon, Bradley S.10aResveratrol improves muscle function but not oxidative capacity in young mdx mice  ap. 243-251.  aPatients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have reduced muscle function due to chronic muscle damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, and reduced oxidative capacity. Resveratrol reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, and increases oxidative capacity in other disease models. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of resveratrol on muscle function, muscle pathology, and oxidative capacity in young mdx mice. For this, 4- to 5-week-old male mdx mice were randomized into control or resveratrol-treated groups and given resveratrol (100 mg/kg body mass) or an equal volume of water by gavage every other day for 8 weeks. Muscle function was assessed pre- and post-treatment. Central nucleation, total immune cell infiltrate, oxidative stress, and oxidative capacity were measured post-treatment. Resveratrol mediated substantial improvements in rotarod performance and in-situ peak tension by 53% and 17%, respectively, and slight improvements in central nucleation and oxidative stress. Resveratrol did not affect total immune cell infiltrate at 12 weeks of age, and had no effect on oxidative capacity. Resveratrol improves muscle function in mdx mice despite small changes in muscle pathology. The likely mechanism is a resveratrol-mediated reduction in immune cell infiltrate at the early stages of this disease, as previously reported by our laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDuchenne muscular dystrophy 0aresveratrol 0ainflammation 0aoxidative stress 0aoxidative capacity 0amuscle damage 0autrophin1 aDelgado-Diaz, Diana C.1 aCarson, James1 aFayad, Raja1 aWilson, L.

The isolates were morphologically characterized and subsequently analyzed using repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences (rep-PCR), and the intergenic region was sequenced to genetically identify the isolates. Changes on in the filamentous fungi population were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and the resulting bands were sequenced. The population did not significantly change from day 3 to 10 (2.55 x 10⁵–6 x 10⁵CFU g⁻¹), and maximum counts on day 14 of phase II composting (6.92 log CFU g⁻¹). In the morphological characterization, Scytalidium thermophilum, Thermomyces lanuginosus, and Thermomyces ibadanensis were the most abundant identified species. The 26 most abundant isolates identified by morphological analysis were characterized using rep-PCR. A significant amount of genetic diversity was detected among the isolates of all three studied species. Based on the DGGE analysis, the diversity of the fungi was reduced during phase II composting, and S. thermophilum was the predominant species identified throughout the entire process. Thus, this study presents the first report of the involvement of T. ibadanensis in the production of compost for Agaricus mushroom cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus subrufescens 3aScytalidium 3aThermomyces lanuginosus 3acomposting 3acomposts 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3aintergenic DNA 3amushroom growing 3arepetitive extragenic palindromic sequences 2aAgaricusxgrowth & development 2aBiota 2aCluster Analysis 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDenaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis 2aFungixclassificationxcytologyxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aGenotype 2aGenotyping Techniques 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTemperature1 aMarques, Simone Cristina1 ada Silveira e Santos, Débora Marques1 aDias, Eustáquio Souza0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2014 Sept., v. 30, no. 9 p.2419-2425dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-014-1667-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245010400210300001800314520128100332592002801613596006101641650001701702650001601719650001401735650001901749650001701768651001001785700001901795773014401814856008301958852000902041655001202050IND60735836320221121065844.0211001e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073583632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-020-00955-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChinnasamy, Pennan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3184-213410aRemote sensing-based assessment of Coastal Regulation Zones in India: a case study of Mumbai, India  ap. 7931-7950.  aCoastal pollution and encroachment in India are ever-growing issues, for which the Indian government drafted coastal regulation notifications for better management. However, many violations have occurred but not documented due to paucity in data. In recent decades, remote sensing tools are widely used to estimate encroachment and violations, where such official data are not available. This study uses satellite imagery to estimate violations that have occurred in the years 2002, 2008, 2014 and 2019, along the coastal regions of Maharashtra, India. Spatiotemporal variations in violations were assessed and classified into four violation classes: < 25%, 25–50%, 50–75% and > 75%. Over the study period, violations in the class > 75% increased by 110% while violations in the < 25% class decreased by 10%, indicating not a reduction in low violations, but a significant conversion of low to maximum violation scenarios. Particularly, metropolitan areas like Mumbai had higher violations when compared to other areas. Reasons for these violations include increased urbanization and regional occupations like fishing. This study has provided information on hotspots of violation areas that could help reformulate, execute and inspect the coastal regulations.  aPublisher supplied data  aFOSSEE 2020cMinistry of Human Resource Development (IN) 3acase studies 3aenvironment 3apollution 3aremote sensing 3aurbanization 3aIndia1 aParikh, Aashni0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.7931-7950dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00955-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013400169300001600303500001500319520194800334592002802282650003202310650001202342650002002354650001002374650001202384650001002396650001702406650001802423650002102441650002202462650001302484650001202497650001802509650002402527650001102551650001602562650001502578650001002593650001802603651002202621651001002643653001902653653002702672653001702699653001402716653001202730653002602742700002202768700003402790700002502824700003102849700002002880700002102900773008702921856008503008852000903093655001203102IND60581740120221119003704.0190403e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058174012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2017.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulido, Manuel10aReduction of the frequency of herbaceous roots as an effect of soil compaction induced by heavy grazing in rangelands of SW Spain  ap. 381-389.  a2019-12-06  aRangelands in SW Spain constitute the most extensive ranching system on the Iberian Peninsula. During the last few decades, a significant increase in livestock numbers, along with a progressive substitution of cattle for sheep, have led to land degradation processes such as the reduction of grass cover and increased soil compaction in heavily grazed areas. Nevertheless, a better understanding of how soil compaction affects grass production is still needed. In this study, some of the effects of soil compaction due to heavy grazing are analysed, mainly the reduction of the frequency of herbaceous roots and its relationships with bulk density and soil penetration resistance. The study was carried out in 22 fenced areas grazed under different intensities (animal stocking rates: 0.19–15.76AUha−1). Undisturbed soil core and bulk samples were collected at 3 depth intervals in order to determine select soil properties (texture, organic matter content, and bulk density). Additionally, soil penetration resistance was quantified at 890 random points at different depths and soil moisture contents. Frequency of herbaceous roots was estimated for each soil horizon in 47 soil profiles and categorized into 4 classes: none, few, common and many. Results showed negative relationships between bulk density (>10cm depth) and the content of soil organic matter from 0 to 5cm (r=−0.061, p<0.05) and 5–10m depth (r=−0.824, p<0.005). Furthermore, a tendency for decreasing mean values of soil penetration resistance as the frequency of herbaceous roots increased was also observed. The values observed confirm that soil compaction provoked by an excessive number of animals reduced the quantity of herbaceous roots. The value of 2MPa traditionally accepted as restrictive for root growth is discussed. Findings presented here could be of interest for policy makers and farm owners to guide decisions about optimum animal stocking rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil penetration resistance 3agrazing 3asoil compaction 3aroots 3atexture 3afarms 3abulk density 3asoil horizons 3aland degradation 3aissues and policy 3aranching 3agrasses 3astocking rate 3asoil organic matter 3acattle 3aroot growth 3arangelands 3asheep 3asoil profiles 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 0aorganic matter 0aPenetration resistance 0aBulk density 0aLivestock 0aDehesas 0aAnimal stocking rates1 aSchnabel, Susanne1 aLavado Contador, J.

Milk chocolates are very popular because milk provides flavour and smooth texture to the product. This study aimed to determine the optimal ingredient formulation for vegetable milk chocolate using peanut–cowpea milk as a substitute for dairy milk. The study followed a four‐component constrained mixture design, with cocoa liquor, vegetable milk, cocoa butter and sugar as the components. Lecithin and vanillin were added at a constant amount to all formulations. Critical attributes of the chocolates were evaluated using descriptive sensory tests and instrumental techniques. RESULTS: Regression models were fitted to the data, and the optimum ingredient formulation for acceptable vegetable milk chocolate was determined. The vegetable milk had significant (P = 0.05) influence on flavour, mouth feel, hardness and after taste of chocolates. CONCLUSIONS: The optimum ingredient formulation for acceptable vegetable milk chocolates was determined to be cocoa liquor (18.00%), sugar (30.75%), peanut–cowpea milk (28.93%), and cocoa butter (22.32%). The results demonstrate that it is feasible to use vegetable source milk for chocolate. The findings also provide clues for scale‐up criteria for large‐scale production of vegetable milk chocolate.  aPublisher supplied data 3achocolate liquor 3acocoa butter 3aconsumer acceptance 3ahardness 3aingredients 3amilk 3amilk chocolate 3amilk flavor 3amilk production 3amilk substitutes 3amouthfeel 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aregression analysis 3arheological properties 3asugars 3ataste 3atexture 3avanillin 3avegetables 2aAnimals 2aCacaoxchemistry 2aCarbohydrates 2aCattle 2aDehydration 2aDietary Fats 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aFood Technology 2aMilkxchemistry1 aSakyi‐Dawson, Esther1 aAbbey, Lawrence1 aTano‐Debrah, Kwaku1 aSaalia, Firibu Kwesi0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 Jan. 30, v. 92, no. 2 p.224-231dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4563  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011900163300001300282500001400295520189900309592002802208650001202236650001802248650001602266650001402282650001302296650002302309650001602332650001302348650001802361650001402379650001702393650001102410650000902421650001602430650001502446650001702461650001402478650001102492650001102503650001102514650001702525650001602542650001002558650001602568650002502584650001102609651002102620700002202641700001902663700006002682773013302742856008202875852000902957655001202966IND60725524820221116211920.0210126e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552482DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-020-00293-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Eun Ui10aResponse of fruit set and quality and seed formation to ploidy levels of pollen donor in yellow-fleshed kiwifruits  ap. 9-15.  aNAL-light  aThis study investigated how the ploidy level of the kiwifruit pollinizer cultivars “CK3” (diploid), “T line” (tetraploid), “Pohwa” (hexaploid) and “Chieftain” (hexaploid) affected fruit set, fruit quality, and seed formation in the tetraploid kiwifruit cultivars “Halla Gold” and “Sweet Gold” cultivated in an unheated greenhouse in Jeju, Korea. Pollen tubes growing in the pistil reached and combined with the ovule 3 days after artificial pollination, and their patterns differed depending on the ploidy level of the pollen parent. The number of pollen tubes observed in “Halla Gold” and “Sweet Gold” pistils was significantly lower following pollination by “CK3” than with the other pollen donors. In all pollen treatments, the fruit set rates were > 90%. The fruit weight of both “Halla Gold” and “Sweet Gold” were high following pollination with “Chieftain” and “Pohwa”. The dry matter content, soluble solids, and acidity were not significantly different among all pollination treatments. Fruit firmness was higher following pollination with “Chieftain” and “Powha.” Colorimeter h˚ values for flesh of “Halla Gold” was low following pollination with “CK3,” but there were no differences for “Sweet Gold” among all pollinations. The number of seeds showed a similar trend to fruit weight, but the 100-seed weight was highest with “T line” as the pollinizer. The results indicate that the ploidy level of the pollen donor affects fruit quality more than fruit set. Also, the pollen most suitable for cultivation of “Halla Gold” and “Sweet Gold” is considered to be tetraploid “T line” and hexaploid “Pohwa” and “Chieftain,” which showed favorable effects on the weight and firmness of fruits, and the number and weight of seeds without adversely influencing fruit set and dry matter content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3abiotechnology 3acolorimetry 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3adry matter content 3aenvironment 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruit set 3afruit weight 3afruits 3agold 3agreenhouses 3ahexaploidy 3ahorticulture 3akiwifruit 3aovules 3apistil 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3apollination 3aseeds 3atetraploidy 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight 3aKorean Peninsula1 aJeong, Seung Yong1 aKim, Ju-Young,1 aSong, Kwan Jeong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5706-99120 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2021 Feb., v. 62, no. 1 p.9-15dSpringer SingaporewJournal:21607x2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-020-00293-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009800165300001100263500001100274500001900285520182800304592002802132596007002160596006102230650000802291650001202299650001102311650001702322650001402339650002302353650001802376650002402394650002002418650003502438650001302473650001402486650001502500650002502515650001902540650001602559650001202575700001602587700002102603700002102624700005802645773012702703856008202830961001302912852000902925655001202934IND60681805120221118130841.0220105e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068180512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-020-1414-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Feixiong10aProspects for achieving durable disease resistance with elite fruit quality in apple breeding  ap. 21.  aReview  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aApple industries suffer from major apple diseases because of widely planted susceptible cultivars. Developed disease-resistant cultivars that often carry only a single source of resistance are not expected to be durable over time. Cultivars with multiple sources of resistance are often commercially unacceptable due to unsatisfactory fruit quality alleles inherited from unimproved and improved parents. To improve fruit quality, approximately five modified backcrossing generations have been used with phenotypic selection for offspring with the least proportion of unimproved genome and elite fruit quality. Modified backcrossing is time-consuming owing to the long juvenility of apple. Unimproved parents are always assumed to carry undesirable alleles in addition to the targeted resistance allele. To efficiently identify favorable offspring each generation, DNA-based markers would be useful. Locus-specific DNA tests are unavailable to detect many sources of resistance alleles. Known numbers of DNA segments from unimproved parents could help subsequent parent selection among offspring because of the direct connection to the probability of eliminating such segments each generation. Accurately estimating the proportion and number of unimproved segments requires precise information on genomic positions of recombinations that can be detected with effective genetic marker sets. High-resolution and genome-wide apple SNP arrays can be used to characterize unimproved DNA segments present in disease-resistant offspring to efficiently achieve durable resistance and elite fruit quality. To hasten apple flowering, a rapid generation cycling approach with transgenic genetic stocks is available. Using these tools is expected to effectively exploit additional unimproved germplasm toward apple genetic improvement.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014-51181-22378cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture  a1014919cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aDNA 3aalleles 3aapples 3abackcrossing 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3afruit quality 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic markers 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenomics 3agermplasm 3ajuvenility 3aphenotypic selection 3aplant genetics 3aprobability 3aprogeny1 aEvans, Kate1 aNorelli, John L.1 aZhang, Fenglong,1 aPeace, Cameron1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0706-11080 tTree genetics & genomes.g2020 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.21-21dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949857x1614-29427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-020-1414-x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01178naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012400153300001800277520022100295592002800516650002300544650002300567650001400590650001500604650001200619700001100631700001300642700001900655773010600674856007500780852000900855655001200864IND60578561220221122225751.0170813e20130705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057856122DNAL7 a10.1021/ol401540k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jun10aRhodium(III)-Catalyzed Oxidative Olefination of Pyridines and Quinolines: Multigram-Scale Synthesis of Naphthyridinones  ap. 3460-3463.  aA Rh(III)-catalyzed oxidative olefination of pyridines and quinolines has been achieved.

We evaluated the role of self, wind and insect pollination to Coffea canephora production in this landscape. The giant Asian honeybee, Apis dorsata, which nests in remnant forests, was the main pollinator of coffee (accounting for 58% of the floral visitors). The proportion of flowers that developed into fruits was highest when hand cross-pollinated (44%), followed by open- (insect and wind combined; 33%) and wind- (22.1%) pollination treatments. Pollination by bees therefore increases fruit production by 50% over that achieved by wind. Self-pollination (1.7%) and no pollination (1%) treatments produced very low fruit set, emphasizing the importance of cross-pollination in C. canephora. Unlike measures of pollination success, initial fruit set (five weeks after flowering) proved an unreliable proxy for final fruit set. Size of adjoining forest fragments (mostly 0.3â20ha, with a few exceeding 200ha) positively influenced pollinator visitation to coffee flowers, but distance to such fragments had no influence on pollination. This study demonstrates the importance of cross-pollination for crop production in C. canephora, the important contribution that pollinating insects make to coffee production, and the benefits of relatively large forest fragments within the landscape mosaic to support insect pollinators of coffee. A comparison of pollinator composition to that of 100 years ago indicated that coffee pollination services remained intact despite changes in pollinator community composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis dorsata 3aCoffea canephora 3acommunity structure 3acrop production 3across pollination 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aforests 3afruit growing 3afruit set 3afruits 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahoney bees 3ainsect pollination 3anesting 3apollinating insects 3aself-pollination 3awind 3aIndia1 aKushalappa, Cheppudira.

The great attention towards them is caused by their remarkable properties. Here, we use two different fluorinated graphite intercalation compounds with different fluorine content in their matrices to prepare thermally exfoliated fluorinated graphites and to investigate them in terms of their structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical properties as materials for use in supercapacitors. A higher temperature of low-fluorinated graphenes preparation resulted in higher exfoliation degree and higher gravimetric capacitance in supercapacitor appliances. More dramatic leap of gravimetric capacitance was observed after a treatment in a concentrated acid mixture of graphene material samples prepared at the highest temperature of thermolysis with highest exposition time.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorine 3agraphene 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3athermal degradation1 aChekhova, Galina N.1 aOkotrub, Alexander V.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9607-911X1 aAsanov, Igor P.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7767-89851 aShubin, Yury V.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4029-23381 aFedorovskaya, Ekaterina O.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7107-71691 aPlyusnin, Pavel E.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7494-62401 aBulusheva, Lyubov G.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0039-24220 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Sept., v. 53, no. 18 p.13053-13066dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2516-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245018700165300001400352520107700366592002801443650000801471650001501479650002501494650001401519650001201533650001701545650001101562650001701573650002301590650001601613650001901629650001801648650004701666650002101713653001401734653001001748653002501758653001701783653001501800653001601815700002101831700002001852700002001872700001801892700001401910700001701924700001601941700002101957700001801978700001501996700001402011700001502025700001402040773010102054856008602155852000902241655001202250IND60535914820221119034740.0190318e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053591482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNigro, M.10an-TiO2 and CdCl2 co-exposure to titanium dioxide nanoparticles and cadmium: Genomic, DNA and chromosomal damage evaluation in the marine fish European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)  ap. 72-77.  aDue to the large production and growing use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (n-TiO2), their release in the marine environment and their potential interaction with existing toxic contaminants represent a growing concern for biota. Different end-points of genotoxicity were investigated in the European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax exposed to n-TiO2 (1mgL−1) either alone and combined with CdCl2 (0.1mgL−1) for 7 days. DNA primary damage (comet assay), apoptotic cells (diffusion assay), occurrence of micronuclei and nuclear abnormalities (cytome assay) were assessed in peripheral erythrocytes and genomic stability (random amplified polymorphism DNA-PCR, RAPD assay) in muscle tissue. Results showed that genome template stability was reduced after CdCl2 and n-TiO2 exposure. Exposure to n-TiO2 alone was responsible for chromosomal alteration but ineffective in terms of DNA damage; while the opposite was observed in CdCl2 exposed specimens. Co-exposure apparently prevents the chromosomal damage and leads to a partial recovery of the genome template stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aapoptosis 3acadmium 3aerythrocytes 3agenome 3agenotoxicity 3amarine environment 3amarine fish 3amuscle tissues 3ananoparticles 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3atitanium dioxide 0aNano-TiO2 0aCdCl2 0aDicentrarchus labrax 0aGenotoxicity 0aDNA damage 0aMicronuclei1 aBernardeschi, M.1 aCostagliola, D.1 aDella Torre, C.1 aFrenzilli, G.1 aGuidi, P.1 aLucchesi, P.1 aMottola, F.1 aSantonastaso, M.1 aScarcelli, V.1 aMonaci, F.1 aCorsi, I.1 aStingo, V.1 aRocco, L.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Nov., v. 168 p.72-77dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245013600161300001800297520116800315592002801483650002201511650001201533650001301545650001201558650002301570650001101593650001501604650003301619650001201652650001101664700001801675700001801693700001901711773010501730856004801835852000901883655001201892IND4483986020221116141449.0120928e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448398602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5326-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, HuiNa10aOptimization of a synthetic medium for ethanol production by xylose-fermenting Zymomonas mobilis using response surface methodology  ap. 3782-3789.  aA synthetic medium for ethanol production by recombinant xylose-fermenting Zymomonas mobilis was optimized using Plackett-Burman (PB) design and response surface methodology (RSM). The effects of 19 medium components were investigated by PB design. Eight of these components were determined to have significant effects on ethanol production. The statistical model was constructed via central composite design (CCD) using five selected variables, including xylose, trisodium citrate, choline chloride, pyridoxine, and thiamine. The validity of the developed model was verified. The ethanol concentration in the optimized medium was 6.7% higher than in the RM medium. The optimized medium was then simplified to give the final synthetic medium (S2), in which the ethanol concentration was 20.7% higher than in the RM medium. Xylose and trisodium citrate were the key medium components influencing ethanol production, while calcium pantothenate was the only growth factor required by recombinant Z. mobilis. Ethanol production and growth response were directly proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of trisodium citrate in the range of 0.1â1.6 g/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZymomonas mobilis 3acholine 3acitrates 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3amodels 3apyridoxine 3aresponse surface methodology 3athiamin 3axylose1 aZhao, XueMing1 aMa, Yuanyuan,1 aZhang, Minhua,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 Oct., v. 57, no. 28-29 p.3782-3789dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5326-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013100172300001600303520101000319592002801329650001101357650002001368650001201388650002901400650001601429650002101445650002001466650002501486653003701511653003301548653002601581653003701607700001601644700001801660700002201678700002201700773009601722856008401818852000901902655001201911IND60603809820221122030505.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060380982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.10.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChantana, Jakapan10aUniqueness verification of direct solar spectral index for estimating outdoor performance of concentrator photovoltaic systems  ap. 762-766.  aTo analyze the impact of a direct spectral distribution of the solar spectrum on the outdoor performance of concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems, an index for the direct spectral distribution is needed. Average photon energy (APE), the average energy of a photon in the direct solar spectrum, is one of these indexes. In this contribution, the uniqueness of APE to the direct solar spectral distribution is statistically analyzed to assure that an APE value uniquely yields the shape of a direct solar radiation spectrum. The results have exhibited the uniqueness of the direct normal solar spectrum with each APE value, in which the standard deviations are quite small. Short-circuit current density of the InGaP/InGaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell in the CPV system is additionally calculated using the direct spectral irradiance with different APE values. It is revealed that APE is a useful index to describe the direct spectral distribution to evaluate the outdoor performance of the CPV systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3alight intensity 3aphotons 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar cells 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3astatistical analysis 0aSpectral irradiance distribution 0aDirect normal solar spectrum 0aAverage photon energy 0aConcentrator photovoltaic system1 aUeno, Seiya1 aOta, Yasuyuki1 aNishioka, Kensuke1 aMinemoto, Takashi0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Mar., v. 75 p.762-766dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.10.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01585naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011500156300001800271520054700289592002800836650001700864650001500881650001700896650002300913650001300936650002200949700002100971700002200992700002101014700002201035773010601057856007501163852000901238655001201247IND60578561720180213000000.0170813e20130719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057856172DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400384z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuque, Luisa10aRadical Scavenging Capacity of 2,4-Dihydroxy-9-phenyl-1H-phenalen-1-one: A Functional Group Exclusion Approach  ap. 3542-3545.  a2,4-Dihydroxy-9-phenyl-1H-phenalen-1-one (4-hydroxyanigorufone, 1), a compound isolated from Anigozanthos flavidus and Monochoria elata, displayed a high radical scavenging capacity in the ORAC assay.

Various physicochemical measurements including water uptake, proton conductivity and surface tension were investigated for both the as-received Nafion and the biopolymeric LbL modified Nafion. The smaller water contact angle and the less swelling characteristics of the biopolymer modified Nafion membrane was founded compared to that of as-received Nafion. This clearly indicates that the more hydrophilic surface of biopolymeric layers on Nafion plays an important role in the enhanced dimensional stability. In addition, a potential hypothesis explaining the higher proton conductivity from the LbL biopolymeric film coated Nafion is suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acatalysts 3acontact angle 3adimensional stability 3afuel cells 3ahydrophilicity 3asurface tension 3atemperature1 aNam, Eun Ji1 aWoo, Jung-Je1 aMoon, Seung-Hyeon1 aLee, Jaeyoung0 tCurrent applied physics.g2012 Sept., v. 12, no. 5 p.1235-1238dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2012.01.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014500155300001600300500002000316520184000336592002802176650001802204650001402222650001502236650001602251650001402267650002102281650001802302650001502320650001802335650001002353650002202363650002202385650001902407650002702426650001302453700002302466700001802489700001802507700002102525700001802546700002302564773013302587856007302720852000902793655001202802IND60595924520221117163115.0180608e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059592452DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.132702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Yukie10aPatterns of reproductive isolation in a haplodiploid – strong post‐mating, prezygotic barriers among three forms of a social spider mite  ap. 866-881.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn speciation research, much attention is paid to the evolution of reproductive barriers, preventing diverging groups from hybridizing back into one gene pool. The prevalent view is that reproductive barriers evolve gradually as a by‐product of genetic changes accumulated by natural selection and genetic drift in groups that are segregated spatially and/or temporally. Reproductive barriers, however, can also be reinforced by natural selection against maladaptive hybridization. These mutually compatible theories are both empirically supported by studies, analysing relationships between intensity of reproductive isolation and genetic distance in sympatric taxa and allopatric taxa. Here, we present the – to our knowledge – first comparative study in a haplodiploid organism, the social spider mite Stigmaeopsis miscanthi, by measuring premating and post‐mating, pre‐ and post‐zygotic components of reproductive isolation, using three recently diverged forms of the mite that partly overlap in home range. We carried out cross‐experiments and measured genetic distances (mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA) among parapatric and allopatric populations of the three forms. Our results show that the three forms are reproductively isolated, despite the absence of premating barriers, and that the post‐mating, prezygotic component contributes most to reproductive isolation. As expected, the strength of post‐mating reproductive barriers positively correlated with genetic distance. We did not find a clear pattern of prezygotic barriers evolving faster in parapatry than in allopatry, although one form did show a trend in line with the ecological and behavioural relationships between the forms. Our study advocates the versatility of haplodiploid animals for investigating the evolution of reproductive barriers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetranychidae 3aallopatry 3abyproducts 3acorrelation 3agene pool 3agenetic distance 3agenetic drift 3ahome range 3ahybridization 3amites 3amitochondrial DNA 3anatural selection 3anuclear genome 3areproductive isolation 3asympatry1 aSakamoto, Hironori1 aGotoh, Tetsuo1 aSaito, Yutaka1 aChao, Jung‐Tai1 aEgas, Martijn1 aMochizuki, Atsushi0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2018 June, v. 31, no. 6 p.866-881dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.132703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001600171245008800187300001600275520068100291592002800972650002201000650002201022650001301044650001401057650001901071650000901090650000701099650003301106650001601139650003701155650001201192650002301204650002001227650002601247650002501273650002401298650003101322650002201353650004401375650004801419650002601467650001601493650002201509700001401531700001501545700002001560700002001580773009601600856008601696852000901782655001201791IND60095595820221122142859.0141104e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009559582DNAL7 a210365582pmid7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying10aFlower-like agglomerates of hydroxyapatite crystals formed on an egg-shell membrane  ap. 490-496.  aFlower-like hydroxyapatite agglomerates formed on the upper side and lower side of an egg-shell membrane were intensively investigated using a uniquely designed crystallizer.

Such materials include biochar made of agriculture residues, digestate or elemental sulphur obtained from biogas desulphurisation. The joint use of these materials via pre-incubation may be more advantageous than only mixing prior the application to soil. In this study, digestates were mixed with amendments and incubated for 6 weeks before application to soil in a short-term pot experiment with lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The following treatments were tested: control digestate, digestate + biochar, digestate + elemental sulphur, digestate + biochar + elemental sulphur. The biochar-enriched digestate significantly increased soil microbial biomass, soil C:N, fresh above ground biomass, fresh and dry root biomass. Elemental sulphur-enriched digestate caused highest arylsulfatase and phosphatase, increased urease, microbial biomass in soil and fresh root biomass. Amendment of digestate + biochar + sulphur led to the significantly highest total soil carbon, microbial biomass, β-glucosidase, urease, and increased C:N ratio, arylsulfatase in soil and root biomass. It mitigated the adverse effect of either biochar or elemental sulphur on soil respiration. Properties of digestates were apparently affected by pre-incubation. This approach in digestate fertilizer production may contribute to sustainable farming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aaboveground biomass 3aadverse effects 3aagronomy 3aarylsulfatase 3abiochar 3abiogas 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3afertilizers 3alettuce 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen content 3aplant growth 3asoil 3asoil carbon 3asoil quality 3asoil respiration 3asoil treatment 3asulfur 3aurease1 aHolatko, Jiri 1 aSudoma, Marek 1 aKintl, Antonin 1 aVopravil, Jan 1 aRyant, Pavel 1 aSkarpa, Petr 1 aRadziemska, Maja 1 aLatal, Oldrich 1 aBrtnicky, Martin 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111020413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010300170300001600273520117000289592002801459650002801487650001901515650002101534650001301555650001301568650001101581650001901592650001201611650002501623650002801648650001001676650001301686650001201699700001801711700001601729773012901745856008201874852000901956655001201965IND60549161820221123011223.0160907e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054916182DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-12-0480-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCorkle, Kestrel10aResistance to Phytophthora nicotianae in Tobacco Breeding Lines Derived from Variety Beinhart 1000  ap. 252-258.  aBlack shank, caused by Phytophthora nicotianae, is managed primarily by host resistance. The rapid emergence of race 1 eliminated the usefulness of available complete resistance, leading breeders to search for new sources of resistance. Cigar tobacco ‘Beinhart 1000’ (BH) is highly resistant to all races of P. nicotianae. Doubled-haploid (DH) lines from a cross of BH and the susceptible ‘Hicks’ were evaluated for black shank resistance, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) on linkage groups (LGs) 4 and 8 accounted for >43% of the phenotypic variation in resistance. Forty-three DH lines and parents were evaluated, and genotypes with one or both QTL from BH on LGs 4 and 8 had increased incubation periods and decreased root rot but higher final inoculum levels than genotypes with neither QTL. A low level of stem resistance was observed in BH and DH lines with the QTL from BH on LG 4 but not LG 8. Low levels of leaf resistance were seen for Hicks, BH, and DH lines with both QTL from BH on LG 4 and 8. The partial resistance from BH has not been used commercially and may provide an increase in level of partial resistance in future tobacco varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora nicotianae 3abreeding lines 3adoubled haploids 3agenotype 3ainoculum 3aleaves 3alinkage groups 3aparents 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3araces 3aroot rot 3atobacco1 aLewis, Ramsey1 aShew, David0 tPlant disease.g2013 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.252-258dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-05-12-0480-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008600166520192000252592002802172650003102200650002202231650001802253650001302271650001502284650001202299650001102311650001402322650000902336650001102345650001302356650001702369650001402386650001402400650000902414651000902423700001802432773012302450856008102573852000902654655001202663IND60754107120221122182736.0211023e20211012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075410712DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy111020432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chung-Pao 10aBeneficial Microbes and Basal Fertilization in Antagonism of Banana Fusarium Wilt  aFusarium Wilt Tropical Race 4 (TR4) is spreading rapidly all over the world and threatens banana production, especially the Cavendish variety, which is the main commercial cultivar in Asia. This work aims to use beneficial microbes and fertilizers to control TR4. Both Bacillus mycoides NP02 (BM) and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BaPD1 (BA) antagonized TR4 growth in plate tests. In addition, basal nutrients (BN) in combination with BM and BA were used to treat 1-month-old banana seedlings infected by Fusarium Wilt; plant growth and nutrients of leaves were investigated after 6-month cultivation in the field. The seedling survival rates for uninfected and infected controls without the microbes were 89.4 ± 14.8% and 50 ± 10.7%, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding rates for 2BM, 5BM, 1BA, F1 (5BM + 4BN + 1BA) and G1 (1BM + 4BN + 1BA) in the infected plants were 80 ± 9.4%, 83 ± 4.3%, 85 ± 14.2%, 96.7 ± 1.9% and 96.7 ± 3.3%, respectively. The 2BM treatment promoted the growth of both uninfected and infected banana plants and the 5BA treatment significantly reduced the severity index by 1.45-fold. Plants infected with TR4 showed significantly reduced contents of nitrogen and potassium, but the contents of iron, copper and zinc were higher than those of healthy plants. Additionally, 1BM treatment stimulated the accumulation of nitrogen and zinc ions in the leaves of uninfected plants. Both the 1BA and 2BN treatments increased the iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) metal ion levels of TR4 infected plants. The F2 (5BM + 2BN + 1BA) treatment significantly maintained the growth of banana plants under TR4 stress with increased contents of nickel and zinc in banana leaves, suggesting that these ions may play a key role in stimulating the growth of banana plants under the threat of TR4. This work shows the potential of applying BM, BN and BA in the control of Fusarium wilt in field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aBacillus mycoides 3aFusarium wilt 3aagronomy 3aantagonism 3abananas 3acopper 3acultivars 3airon 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3aseedlings 3azinc 3aAsia1 aHo, Yi-Cheng 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111020433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013500164300001200299520150600311592002801817650002501845650001401870650002401884650001001908650001401918650001401932650001401946650001301960650001301973650002001986650003102006650001002037650001202047650001602059650002702075650002602102650001502128650001402143650002002157650001602177650001802193650001302211650002102224650002702245650001402272650002402286650001102310650002502321650001302346650002102359650001102380653001202391653002102403653001402424653001002438653002502448700001302473700001602486700001902502700001502521700001902536700001802555773009902573856008602672852000902758655001202767IND60535915120221119034656.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053591512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Rui10aEffects of nitrite exposure on haematological parameters, oxidative stress and apoptosis in juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus)  ap. 1-9.  aNitrite (NO2–) is commonly present as contaminant in aquatic environment and toxic to aquatic organisms. In the present study, we investigated the effects of nitrite exposure on haematological parameters, oxidative stress and apoptosis in juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). Fish were exposed to various concentrations of nitrite (0, 0.02, 0.08, 0.4 and 0.8mM) for 96h. Fish blood and gills were collected to assay haematological parameters, oxidative stress and expression of genes after 0, 24, 48 and 96h of exposure. In blood, the data showed that the levels of methemoglobin (MetHb), triglyceride (TG), potassium (K+), cortisol, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and glucose significantly increased in treatments with higher concentrations of nitrite (0.4 and/or 0.8mM) after 48 and 96h, while the levels of haemoglobin (Hb) and sodium (Na+) significantly decreased in these treatments. In gills, nitrite (0.4 and/or 0.8mM) apparently reduced the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH), increased the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), up-regulated the mRNA levels of c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JUK1), p53, caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 after 48 and 96h of exposure. The results suggested caspase-dependent and JUK signaling pathways played important roles in nitrite-induced apoptosis in fish. Further, this study provides new insights into how nitrite affects the physiological responses and apoptosis in a marine fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aapoptosis 3aaquatic environment 3ablood 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-7 3acaspase-9 3acatalase 3acortisol 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agills 3aglucose 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ahemoglobin 3ajuveniles 3amalondialdehyde 3amarine fish 3amessenger RNA 3anitrites 3aoxidative stress 3aphysiological response 3apotassium 3asignal transduction 3asodium 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3atriacylglycerols 3aturbot 0aNitrite 0aOxidative stress 0aApoptosis 0aGills 0aScophthalmus maximus1 aHan, Cen1 aLei, Ji-Lin1 aLiu, Bao-Liang1 aHuang, Bin1 aHuo, Huan-Huan1 aYin, Shu-Ting0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Dec., v. 169 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013700169300001600306520156300322592002801885650001201913650002901925650001301954650001501967650001201982650003501994650001902029650003302048650003502081650001302116650001902129650001102148650001902159650002202178650001002200650002102210651001002231700005702241700002402298700001802322700001902340700002302359773014302382856008202525852000902607655001202616IND60634949120221119065835.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063494912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-017-0060-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinghai, Akinchan10aGIS-based multi-criteria approach for identification of rainwater harvesting zones in upper Betwa sub-basin of Madhya Pradesh, India  ap. 777-797.  aThe emergent water paucity calls for more resourceful alternatives of water conservation. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is one of the most capable systems to increase availability of water and agriculture output in the semi-arid regions. Nevertheless, the assessment of RWH potential and selection of appropriate RWH locations pose a great challenge for the water managers due to lacking biophysical data and infrastructure. The present study attempts to assess the RWH potential and identifying probable RWH locations in the Betwa sub-basin using geospatial and multiple criteria decision analysis techniques (MCDA). The spatial theme such as land use land cover was derived by supervised classification method and lineament and drainage by edge enhancement method from Landsat ETM + satellite image and other secondary published maps. The surface runoff was determined from modified Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. These parameters were assigned suitable weights and integrated with a geospatial (GIS) technique to generate RWH site suitability map and to identify possible locations for RWH structures. SCS-CN technique displays that the water-body and built-up areas have high runoff potential, while forest area shows low runoff. The analysis indicates that 5.6% (87.7 km²) is suitable for percolation tanks, 3% (46.6 km²) suitable for farm ponds and for check dams (0.7 km²) of the study area. The study reveals combined methodology of geospatial and MCDA procedures in planning of rainwater harvesting at a regional scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3adecision support systems 3adrainage 3afarm ponds 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ainfrastructure 3aland use and land cover maps 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3asemiarid zones 3asoil conservation 3atanks 3awater harvesting 3aIndia1 aDas, Sandipan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8474-23211 aKadam, Ajaykumar K.1 aShukla, J.

With the rapid development of systems biology, recent network analyses of proteins, drugs, and diseases have enabled great progress in delineating the molecule mechanisms of drug candidates. However, most analyses perform a direct association between gene/protein and disease levels without considering the intermediate biological pathways regulated by the drugs. Given that a protein performs its biological roles through pathways, we propose using a novel pathway-pathway network analysis to investigate the potential therapeutic functions of the drug candidates. Many studies have demonstrated that salvianolic acid B (Sal B) of Salvia miltiorrhiza is an effective therapy for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Using molecular docking methods to identify direct interacting targets of Sal B, we collected all Sal B-regulated proteins with supporting experimental evidence in PubMed abstracts. FDA-approved CVD drugs and their corresponding targets were also collected. From a traditional drug-protein network analysis, we found that Sal B could affect ACE and REN of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to relax vessels and alleviate hypertension. Subsequent pathway-pathway network analysis was attempted to study the mechanisms of Sal B in treating CVD, and demonstrated that Sal B regulates immunity/inflammation, apoptosis, ion transport and basic metabolism processes in the treatment of CVD. Regulating the immune/inflammation process may be the major mechanism of Sal B. We believe that pathway-pathway network analysis is a novel method for studying the therapeutic mechanisms of herbal ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3aimmunity 3aproteins 3ametabolism 3adrugs 3ainflammation 3ahypertension 3aion transport 3atherapeutics 3amethodology 3agenes 3aingredients 3asalvianolic acid 3aapoptosis 0anew methods1 aHe, Yuan1 aYe, Hao1 aLiu, XuePing1 aYang, LinLin1 aCao, Zhiwei,1 aTang, Kailin,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 May, v. 57, no. 14 p.1672-1679dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5142-y  aDNAL 7aarticle04284naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245014700189300001800336500001500354520252500369592002802894650002802922650001602950650001402966650001602980650001202996650001603008650002503024650001203049650001303061650002103074650001303095650001703108650001703125650001403142650001503156650001503171650002003186650002503206650002503231650002203256650001503278650003103293650003803324650004403362650005703406651001203463653001303475700002003488700001903508773011003527856004803637852000903685655001203694IND50066736620221120120854.0130528e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006673662DNAL7 a235360492pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-013-2083-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEskandari, Mehrzad10aGenetic control of soybean seed oil: II. QTL and genes that increase oil concentration without decreasing protein or with increased seed yield  ap. 1677-1687.  a2019-12-06  aSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seed oil is the primary global source of edible oil and a major renewable and sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, increasing the relative oil concentration in soybean is desirable; however, that goal is complex due to the quantitative nature of the oil concentration trait and possible effects on major agronomic traits such as seed yield or protein concentration. The objectives of the present study were to study the relationship between seed oil concentration and important agronomic and seed quality traits, including seed yield, 100-seed weight, protein concentration, plant height, and days to maturity, and to identify oil quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are co-localized with the traits evaluated. A population of 203 F₄:₆ recombinant inbred lines, derived from a cross between moderately high oil soybean genotypes OAC Wallace and OAC Glencoe, was developed and grown across multiple environments in Ontario, Canada, in 2009 and 2010. Among the 11 QTL associated with seed oil concentration in the population, which were detected using either single-factor ANOVA or multiple QTL mapping methods, the number of QTL that were co-localized with other important traits QTL were six for protein concentration, four for seed yield, two for 100-seed weight, one for days to maturity, and one for plant height. The oil-beneficial allele of the QTL tagged by marker Sat_020 was positively associated with seed protein concentration. The oil favorable alleles of markers Satt001 and GmDGAT2B were positively correlated with seed yield. In addition, significant two-way epistatic interactions, where one of the interacting markers was solely associated with seed oil concentration, were identified for the selected traits in this study. The number of significant epistatic interactions was seven for yield, four for days to maturity, two for 100-seed weight, one for protein concentration, and one for plant height. The identified molecular markers associated with oil-related QTL in this study, which also have positive effects on other important traits such as seed yield and protein concentration, could be used in the soybean marker breeding programs aimed at developing either higher seed yield and oil concentration or higher seed protein and oil concentration per hectare. Alternatively, selecting complementary parents with greater breeding values due to positive epistatic interactions could lead to the development of higher oil soybean cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative trait loci 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3aGlycine max 3aalleles 3asoybean oil 3aanalysis of variance 3aparents 3asoybeans 3aagronomic traits 3agenotype 3ainbred lines 3aseed quality 3abiodiesel 3afeedstocks 3aseed yield 3agenetic markers 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBreedingxmethods 2aPlant Oils 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aSeedsxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aSoybeansxchemistryxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 3aOntario 0abreeding1 aCober, Elroy R.1 aRajcan, Istvan0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2013 June, v. 126, no. 6 p.1677-1687dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-013-2083-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013700167300001600304520182500320592002802145650003402173650001802207650003102225650001402256650002102270650001502291650001702306650001302323650002002336650001902356650001102375650002002386650001702406650002202423650002102445650001802466650002302484650001402507650001602521650002202537650002402559650003602583650003202619653000902651653003002660653001702690653001602707653002202723700001902745700002602764700001802790700002002808700001802828700001802846773012302864856008602987852000903073655001203082IND60582647620221122231100.0180905e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058264762DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(17)30084-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNam, Ju-Suk10aAnti-inflammatory effects of traditional mixed extract of medicinal herbs (MEMH) on monosodium urate crystal-induced gouty arthritis  ap. 561-575.  aKorean oriental medicine prescription is widely used for the treatment of gouty diseases. In the present study, we investigated anti-inflammatory effects of modified Korean herbal formulation, mixed extract of medicinal herbs (MEMH), and its modulatory effects on inflammatory mediators associated with gouty arthritis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies were carried out to assess the anti-inflammatory efficacy of MEMH on monosodium urate (MSU) crystals-induced gouty inflammation. MSU crystals stimulated human chondrosarcoma cell line, SW1353, and human primary chondrocytes were treated with MEMH in vitro. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and metalloproteases were analyzed. The effect of MEMH on NFκB signaling pathway in SW1353 cells was examined. Effect of MEMH on the mRNA expression level of pro-inflammatory mediators and chemotactic factor from human monocytic cell line, THP-1, was also analyzed. The probable role of MEMH in the differentiation process of osteoblast like cells, SaOS-2, after MSU treatment was also observed. To investigate the effects of MEMH in vivo, MSU crystals-induced ankle arthritic model was established. Histopathological changes in affected joints and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and TNFα) were recorded. MEMH inhibited NFκB signaling pathway and COX-2 protein expression in chondrocytes. MSU-induced mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory mediators and chemotactic cytokines were suppressed by MEMH. In MSU crystals-induced ankle arthritic mouse model, administration of MEMH relieved inflammatory symptoms and decreased the plasma levels of IL-1β and TNFα. The results indicated that MEMH can effectively inhibit the expression of inflammatory mediators in gouty arthritis, demonstrating its potential for treating gouty arthritis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarthritis 3achemoattractants 3achemokines 3achondrocytes 3acrystals 3agene expression 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amedicinal plants 3amessenger RNA 3ametalloproteinases 3amonocytes 3aosteoblasts 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aGout 0aMonosodium urate crystals 0aInflammation 0aChondrocyte 0aOriental medicine1 aJagga, Supriya1 aSharma, Ashish Ranjan1 aLee, Joon-Hee1 aPark, Jong Bong1 aJung, Jun-Sub1 aLee, Sang-Soo0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2017 Aug., v. 15, no. 8 p.561-575dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(17)30084-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001600295520155200311592002801863650001601891650001701907650001101924650002901935650001201964650002901976650002502005650001502030650000902045650001602054651000902070700002002079700002202099700002002121773014302141856008202284852000902366655001202375IND60634949320221119065726.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063494932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-017-0063-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaffari, Amir10aEnvironmental impact assessment (EIA) by using the Fuzzy Delphi Folchi (FDF) method (case study: Shahrood cement plant, Iran)  ap. 817-860.  aEnvironmental concern has become one of the major global issues that affect all nations individually and/or collectively. One of the most important methods for environmental impact assessment (EIA) is Folchi method. An improvement for Folchi method in EIA is done in this paper by using fuzzy method. A fuzzy expert semi-quantitative methodology is designed to assess the EIA within the Folchi framework. The proposed fuzzy method has the advantage of allowing consideration of uncertainties in the Folchi method in comparison with classic expert semi-quantitative method that only unique codes are used to quantify the effect of each impacting factor on each designed environmental component. Since the fuzzy system is used to minimize subjectivity of the weights which are computed in the Folchi method, the “Fuzzy Delphi” and “Folchi” methods were merged. Due to the high potential of cement plants in the creation of environmental impact, environment impact assessment of the development of cement plants is very important. To test the proposed method, the Shahrood cement plant was selected as a case study. According to the results, the contamination generated by the plant, especially for environmental components such as air quality, soil of the area, area landscape, area usage, and ecology, is more significant than other environmental components. The newly proposed approach is an efficient tool in EIA and hence can be operational in humanistic decision-making systems with existence of uncertainty, vagueness, and imprecision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acase studies 3acement 3adecision support systems 3aecology 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3alandscapes 3asoil 3auncertainty 3aIran1 aAtaei, Mohammad1 aSereshki, Farhang1 aNaderi, Mostafa0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2019 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.817-860dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-017-0063-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011700160300001800277500002000295520124200315592002801557650001801585650003001603650002201633650001601655650001601671650001501687650000801702650001601710650003001726650001501756650001501771650001001786650001501796650002201811651001101833700002201844700001901866700002001885700001701905700002101922700001801943773012201961856007302083852000902156655001202165IND60595924920221117163144.0180608e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059592492DNAL7 a10.1111/are.137002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Hsiang‐Yi10aRevealing the compositions of the intestinal microbiota of three Anguillid eel species using 16S rDNA sequencing  ap. 2404-2415.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnguilla japonica, A. marmorata and A. bicolor pacifica are important eel species for aquaculture in Taiwan. In the past, seldom studies focused on the intestinal microbiome of them or the probiotics used in their cultivation. Probiotics are microbes that can improve the health of organisms, and the microbes isolated from the intestines of organisms might be the potential probiotics. Therefore, the aim of this study was to collect the intestinal mucus samples of these three eel species for investigating the autochthonous microbiome using 16S rDNA sequencing. The diversity, abundance of the intestinal microbiome and compositions of all the libraries were identified. Moreover, the composition of intestinal microbiome of eel was suggested that it would be affected by the waters and the characteristics of different eel species. Furthermore, most of the identified predominant genera of the intestinal microbiome of these three eel species, such as Cetobacterium, Clostridium, Shewanella, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides, seemed to have great potential as the probiotics. In the future, more studies shall be conducted to promote the practical application of these candidate probiotics for improving the techniques of eel farming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aAnguilla bicolor pacifica 3aAnguilla japonica 3aBacteroides 3aClostridium 3aShewanella 3aeel 3aeel culture 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amicrobiome 3amucus 3aprobiotics 3asequence analysis 3aTaiwan1 aChang, Fang‐Chi1 aWang, Yu‐Bin1 aChen, Shu‐Hwa1 aLin, Ya‐Po1 aLin, Chung‐Yen1 aHan, Yu‐San0 tAquaculture research.g2018 July, v. 49, no. 7 p.2404-2415dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.137003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01682naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010700170300001700277520067500294592002800969650001900997650001001016650002101026650001201047650001801059650001501077650002201092650001901114773014401133856008201277852000901359655001201368IND60634949420221119065559.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063494942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-017-0070-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMourao, Paulo Reis14aThe effectiveness of Green voices in parliaments: Do Green Parties matter in the control of pollution?  ap. 985-1011.  aGreen Parties are not the most popular in polls.

This paper discusses the role of various Green seats occupied in 36 democracies in terms of the country’s control of pollution. Using different specifications for system GMM, the regressions here discussed concluded that higher shares of parliamentary seats occupied by Green Parties tended to be observed in countries with the most significant reductions in estimated levels of different pollutant gases (CO₂, N₂O, SO₂, CH₄, and GHG).

A simple dilute acid hydrolysis method was used, avoiding the addition of enzymes. Results showed that both fructose and glucose in the tuber hydrolysate were fermented simultaneously to succinic acid. The addition of yeast extract and other nutrients was not strictly required for succinic acid production, although it affected process performance, mainly product yield and cell growth rate. The highest succinic acid titre of 47.9gl−1 was obtained when undiluted hydrolysate was fermented. Succinic acid yield from diluted tuber hydrolysate (1:1 with medium) was 10% higher compared to the process with undiluted hydrolysate. Our work clearly demonstrates that Jerusalem artichoke tubers are a promising feedstock for production of succinic acid using A. succinogenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus succinogenes 3aHelianthus tuberosus 3aJerusalem artichokes 3aacid hydrolysis 3acell growth 3aenzymes 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3anutrients 3asuccinic acid 3atubers 3ayeast extract 0aJerusalem artichoke tubers 0aDilute acid hydrolysis 0aSuccinic acid 0aActinobacillus succinogenes1 aKarakashev, D.1 aAngelidaki, I.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Dec., v. 62 p.125-129dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04179naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100001600184245015000200300001800350506007600368520168900444592002802133506003702161650003102198650001002229650001502239650001302254650002002267650001402287650001102301650002602312650002602338650001202364650001802376650005202394650002102446650002002467650003802487650004802525650007002573650004502643650006302688650001902751650003902770650000902809650002102818650001302839650003402852650004002886650002102926650004202947650005902989650005203048650003403100650003703134650004903171700002003220700002503240773017303265856004603438852000903484655001203493IND4481236420221207123459.0120530e20120529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448123642DNAL7 a225860912pmid7 aPMC33651912pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.12064181092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbe, Haruka10aGene regulation via excitation and BDNF is mediated by induction and phosphorylation of the Etv1 transcription factor in cerebellar granule cells  ap. 8734-8739.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn maturing postnatal cerebellar granule cells, the Etv1/Er81 transcription factor is induced by sequential activity-dependent mechanisms through stimulation of AMPA and NMDA receptors, voltage-dependent Nav1.2 Na+ channels, and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Etv1 then up-regulates a battery of maturation genes involved in the cerebellar circuitry. In this process, BDNF is also induced and participates in the up-regulation of these maturation genes. Using cultures of granule cells, we addressed how the activity-dependent and BDNF signaling mechanisms converge on the regulation of the representative NR2C NMDA receptor and Tiam1 maturation genes. BDNF up-regulated both the NR2C and Tiam1 genes via the TrkB-Erk cascade and this up-regulation was blocked not only by inhibition of the activity-dependent signaling mechanisms but also by suppression of Etv1 expression with Etv1 siRNA. Importantly, Etv1 was selectively phosphorylated by Erk1/2 in the BDNF signaling cascade, and the inhibition of this phosphorylation abrogated the BDNF-induced up-regulation of the NR2C and Tiam1 genes. The luciferase reporter assays in combination with mutations of MEK and Etv1 indicated that the Erk-mediated, phosphorylated Etv1 interacted with the Ets motifs of the NR2C promoter sequence and that phosphorylation at both serine 94 and a cluster of threonines and a serine (Thr139, Thr143, and Ser146) of Etv1 was indispensable for the BDNF-mediated activation of the NR2C promoter activity. This study demonstrates that the NR2C and Tiam1 maturation genes are synergistically controlled by the activity-dependent induction of Etv1 and its phosphorylation by the BDNF signaling cascade.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aluciferase 3amutation 3aphosphorylation 3areceptors 3aserine 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factorxpharmacology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCells, Cultured 2aCerebellumxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGuanine Nucleotide Exchange Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aImmunoblotting 2aLuciferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aMutation 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRNA Interference 2aReceptor, trkBxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartatexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSerinexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aThreoninexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aOkazawa, Makoto1 aNakanishi, Shigetada0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 May 29, v. 109, no. 22 p.8734-8739dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1206418109  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011000163300001800273520205900291592002802350650001202378650001902390650002102409650001102430650000902441650001102450650002002461650001102481650001602492650002302508650002202531651001002553700001402563700001902577700001702596700001902613773010202632856004802734852000902782655001202791IND4483986420221116141442.0120715e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448398642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-011-4548-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hongli,10aSimulated analysis of summer climate on centennial time scale in eastern China during the last millennium  ap. 2229-2235.  aUsing Lanczos filtered simulation results from the ECHO-G coupled ocean-atmosphere model, this study analyzes the spatiotemporal structure of temperature and precipitation on centennial time scale to examine how climate change in eastern China responded to external forcing during the last millennium. The conclusions are (1) eastern China experienced a warm-cold-warm climate transition, and the transition from the warm period to the cold period was slower than the cold to warm transition which followed it. There was more rainfall in the warm periods, and the transitional peak and valley of precipitation lag those of temperature. The effective solar radiation and solar irradiance have significant impacts on the temporal variation of both temperature and precipitation. Volcanic activity plays an important role in the sudden drop of temperature before the Present Warm Period (PWP). There is a positive correlation between precipitation and volcanic activity before 1400 A.D., and a negative relationship between the two thereafter. The concentration of greenhouse gases increases in the PWP, and the temperature and precipitation increase accordingly. (2) The spatial pattern of the first leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of temperature on centennial time scale is consistent with that on the inter-annual/inter-decadal (IA-ID) time scales; namely, the entirety of eastern China is of the same sign. This pattern has good coherence with effective solar radiation and the concentrations of greenhouse gases. The first leading EOF mode of precipitation on centennial time scale is totally different from that on the IA-ID time scales. The first leading mode of centennial time scale changes consistently over the entirety of eastern China, while the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers are the opposite to the rest of eastern China is the leading spatial pattern on IA-ID time scale. The distribution of precipitation on centennial time scale is affected by solar irradiance and greenhouse gas concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3arain 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3avolcanic activity 3aChina1 aLiu, Jian1 aWang, Zhiyuan,1 aWang, Sumin,1 aKuang, XueYuan0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 July, v. 56, no. 21 p.2229-2235dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4548-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013000163300001600293520173400309592002802043596007102071596013602142596015402278650001702432650001502449650002902464650001102493650002802504651001002532700001602542773014302558856008202701852000902783655001202792IND60634949620221119065613.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063494962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-017-0068-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Feifei10aRegional sustainability system as ecosystem: case study of China’s two leading economic circles from a keystone perspective  ap. 961-983.  aExploring the structure, function, and dynamics of regional sustainability system (as ecosystem) can help providing insights into the importance of how environmental management answers to socioeconomic and environmental changes for transitioning to sustainable development. The connectivity (structure) and stability (function) of regional sustainability system are investigated through making regional radiation capability model and spatial coordination index model, which is relied on how keystone province influences the other provinces from society, economy and environment dimensions. The brand new models are then applied to the two largest urban agglomerations in China during period 2001–2014. The results show that the connectivity and stability in BHR are distinctly weaker than in YRD, and reveal the essential characteristics and underlying drivers of regional sustainability system. To be specific, initially, it reflects that on the whole BHR harbors larger difference and lower radiation capability than YRD. Additionally, the regional sustainability system of YRD has much higher stability and better interactive function than of BHR. Thirdly, although the sustainable development level of both BHR and YRD increases at a certain speed year by year, the disparity among various provinces shows an apparent decline and the contribution mainly comes from intra-BHR. Finally, it also provides that how the key province and the surrounding province interact and what the main contributors to the dynamics of regional sustainability system are. Overall, taking regional sustainability system as ecosystem can well reveal this complex system and can provide references to any other urban agglomerations in worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.71603111cNational Natural Science Foundation Programs of China  a2016SJB790015cGeneral project supported by the Philosophy and Social Science Fund in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province  a2015KFJJ04cOpen Research Fund Program of Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Eco-Environmental Science for Yellow River Delta (Binzhou University) 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aLu, Zhaohua0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2019 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.961-983dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-017-0068-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008500172300001600257520140900273592002801682650001801710650001401728650001201742650002201754650001101776650001701787650003101804650003301835650001901868650001201887650002001899650001301919650001201932650001501944650001201959653001301971653001701984653002602001653001502027653001502042700007202057700002002129700002502149773009602174856008402270852000902354655001202363IND60603810320221120122800.0180716e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060381032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.10.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Lauro A.10aProspects of using microalgae for biofuels production: Results of a Delphi study  ap. 799-804.  aAdvanced biofuels, such as those obtained from microalgae, are widely accepted as better choices for achieving goals of incorporating renewables and non-food fuel sources into the transportation sector, and for overcoming land use issues due to biofuel crops. Main challenges are currently the feasibility of large-scale commercialization of microalgae biofuels, since there are still some technical problems to overcome (e.g. the high energy consumption associated with biomass processing) and the majority of economic and financial analyses are based on pilot-scale projects. Therefore, this article presents the results of a Delphi study aiming to identify the main obstacles and most critical issues affecting the potential of large-scale commercialization of microalgae biodiesel and its incorporation into the fuel market. According to the authors' knowledge, this is the first Delphi study with this objective. The respondents are worldwide market specialists in the survey themes that ranged from biofuels economics to their environmental sustainability. One of the key findings is that most of the experts believe that production of microalgae biofuels will achieve its full commercial scale until 2020, and that from 2021 till 2030 it could represent from 1% to 5% of the worldwide fuel consumption. The study results also showed that environmental issues are where expert opinion differs more.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae culture 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3acommercialization 3aenergy 3aenergy crops 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3afuel production 3aland use 3amarkets 3amicroalgae 3asurveys 0aBiofuels 0aDelphi study 0aEmerging technologies 0aMicroalgae 0aRenewables1 aSilva, Patrícia Pereira da,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5862-12781 aMata, Teresa M.1 aMartins, António A.0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Mar., v. 75 p.799-804dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002600171245010000197300001600297520116000313592002801473650001301501650002601514650002801540650001301568650001401581650001101595650001301606650003901619650002001658650002201678650002101700650002501721650001901746650001001765650001301775650001601788650002701804650002701831650002401858650001401882650002101896650002201917650002201939650003401961650001301995650002302008650003702031700002002068700002002088700002102108700002202129700002402151700002702175773009602202856008602298852000902384655001202393IND60095596420221123025407.0141104e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009559642DNAL7 a210410682pmid7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayawardena, Menuk B.10aSurfactant enhanced lipase containing films characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy  ap. 291-296.  aConfocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in combination with a fluorescently labeling enzyme dye, LavaPurple™, was demonstrated as a technique for the visualization of Thermomyces (Humicola) lanuginosa lipase (LIPHLL) and Candida antarctica lipase A (LIPCA) within a transparent latex coating. Addition of Teric Surfactants (C₁₆ non-ionic Teric 475, 1.8% (w/w) or C₁₀ non-ionic Teric 460, 2.0% (w/w)) significantly increased the accumulation of both LIPHLL and LIPCA to the surface of a latex coating. An α-naphthyl acetate substrate assay was used to quantify the accumulated lipase. The results derived from the acetate assay correlated with the enzyme accumulation (at the surface) observed in the CLSM images of the latex coating. This correlation demonstrated that the increased enzyme accumulation within the top 2μm of the latex film was responsible for the increase in surface enzymatic activity. The combination of CLSM imagery and quantifiable image analysis provided a valuable tool for the optimization of surfactant concentrations for maximizing the activity of an enzyme (and potentially other additives) within a latex coating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHumicola 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aThermomyces lanuginosus 3aacetates 3aadditives 3aassays 3acoatings 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aenzyme activity 3afilms (materials) 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorescent labeling 3aimage analysis 3alatex 3asurfaces 3asurfactants 3atriacylglycerol lipase 2aAscomycotaxenzymology 2aCandidaxenzymology 2aCatalysis 2aLatexxchemistry 2aLipasexchemistry 2aMaterials Testing 2aMicroscopy, Confocalxmethods 2aSoftware 2aSurface Properties 2aSurface-Active Agentsxchemistry1 aYee, Lachlan H.1 aRainbow, Ian J.1 aBergquist, Peter1 aSuch, Christopher1 aSteinberg, Peter D.1 aKjelleberg, Staffan J.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 82, no. 2 p.291-296dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2010.08.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009200167300001600259520165300275592002801928650001401956650001301970650002501983650001102008650001302019650001802032650001302050650001602063650002002079650001602099650001802115653002302133653001602156653002302172653002602195653002402221700002302245700002402268700002302292773011302315856008602428852000902514655001202523IND60542863820221120213746.0190408e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054286382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Linh D.10aPreliminary formulation development for aqueous surfactant-based soybean oil extraction  ap. 140-146.  aSoybean oils are increasingly being used for a range of non-food applications, including production of biofuels and oleochemicals. While most soybean oil is produced by hexane-based extraction methods, concern about environmental and health effects from hexane extraction has led to increased interest in development of aqueous extraction methods. Among aqueous methods, surfactant-based aqueous extraction of vegetable oils has shown particular promise as an alternative to hexane-based extraction methods. The objectives of this work were to explore the use of surfactant-based methods for the extraction of soybean oils, and to test whether the use of mixed anionic–cationic and anionic–cationic–nonionic surfactant mixtures could successfully be used to reduce the salinity requirements for surfactant-based extraction. All three formulations tested were capable of producing ultra-low (<0.01mN/m) interfacial tensions with soybean oil. One of the formulations, a four-component (three surfactant, one hydrotrope) mixture, was able to reduce the salinity requirement from 5% down to 0.75%. A range of experiments was conducted to better understand the factors influencing extraction yield for surfactant-based extraction of soybean oil. Extraction experiments were conducted with a single extended surfactant system which has been used previously for extraction of other oilseeds. Extraction yields as high as 88.6% were observed for the conditions tested. Extraction yield was strongly dependent on salinity, and was found to increase with increasing shaker agitation rate, decreasing solid to liquid ratio, and decreasing particle size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagitation 3abiofuels 3aenvironmental health 3ahexane 3aoilseeds 3aparticle size 3asalinity 3asoybean oil 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3avegetable oil 0aOilseed extraction 0aSoybean oil 0aAqueous extraction 0aSurfactant extraction 0aInterfacial tension1 aStevens, Travis L.1 aKibbey, Tohren C.G.1 aSabatini, David A.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Dec., v. 62 p.140-146dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010600169520092200275592002801197650001301225650001701238650001701255650001301272650001301285650003001298650001601328650001301344653002101357653001401378700002601392700001701418700006201435773008701497856008501584852000901669655001201678IND60746703020221117004836.0211003e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074670302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2021.1031272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgarwal, Gopal10aX-ray tomography analysis reveals the influence of graphene on porous morphology of collagen cryogels  aX-ray micro-tomography based analysis of porous hydrogel has gained a wide attention recently. It provides an advantage in three-dimensional analysis of pore morphometric and interconnection within the hydrogel network. We have fabricated highly elastic graphene crosslinked collagen hydrogel using cryogelation technique. The influence of graphene as a nano-crosslinker on the overall porosity and inter-connections between the pores in collagen cryogels was determined using X-ray micro-tomography. We have evaluated the effect of different concentration of amino-functionalized graphene nano-crosslinker on collagen cryogels porosity, pore volume, interconnectivity density, fractal dimensions and pore wall thickness. This study, reveals that the use of graphene as a nano-crosslinker have improved micro-architecture as compare to collagen cryogels in the absence of graphene for tissue engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3acryogelation 3acryogels 3agraphene 3amicro-computed tomography 3amorphometry 3aporosity 0aX-ray tomography 0aPore-wall1 aAgrawal, Ashish Kumar1 aFatima, Anis1 aSrivastava, Akshay1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5048-94200 tMicron.g2021 Nov., v. 150 p.103127-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2021.1031273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04718naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012400173300001500297520259500312592002802907650002402935650001302959650001602972650001402988650002403002650001403026650001503040650001703055650002203072650001603094650002103110650003503131650002303166650002603189650001603215650000903231650002003240650003103260650001003291650002803301650001603329650001603345650001203361650002103373650001003394650002403404650002603428650001403454650002103468650004803489650001703537650001403554650002903568650002003597650001703617653002403634653002403658653000903682653001503691653002003706653002203726700001403748700002503762773010203787856008603889852000903975655001203984IND60535915620221119034759.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053591562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHultman, Maria T.10a17α-Ethinylestradiol (EE2) effect on global gene expression in primary rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes  ap. 90-104.  aThe potential impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the aquatic environment has driven the development of screening assays to evaluate the estrogenic properties of chemicals and their effects on aquatic organisms such as fish. However, obtaining full concentration–response relationships in animal (in vivo) exposure studies are laborious, costly and unethical, hence a need for developing feasible alternative (non-animal) methods. Use of in vitro bioassays such as primary fish hepatocytes, which retain many of the native properties of the liver, has been proposed for in vitro screening of estrogen receptor (ER) agonists and antagonists. The aim of present study was to characterize the molecular mode of action (MoA) of the ER agonist 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) in primary rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes. A custom designed salmonid 60,000-feature (60k) oligonucleotide microarray was used to characterize the potential MoAs after 48h exposure to EE2. The microarray analysis revealed several concentration-dependent gene expression alterations including classical estrogen sensitive biomarker gene expression (e.g. estrogen receptor α, vitellogenin, zona radiata). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis displayed transcriptional changes suggesting interference of cellular growth, fatty acid and lipid metabolism potentially mediated through the estrogen receptor (ER), which were proposed to be associated with modulation of genes involved in endocrine function and reproduction. Pathway analysis supported the identified GOs and revealed modulation of additional genes associated with apoptosis and cholesterol biosynthesis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to impaired lipid metabolism (e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ), growth (e.g. insulin growth factor protein 1), phase I and II biotransformation (e.g. cytochrome P450 1A, sulfotransferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and glutathione S-transferase) provided additional insight into the MoA of EE2 in primary fish hepatocytes. Results from the present study suggest that biotransformation, estrogen receptor-mediated responses, lipid homeostasis, growth and cancer/apoptosis in primary fish hepatocytes may be altered after short-term exposure to ER-agonists such as EE2. In many cases the observed changes were similar to those reported for estrogen-exposed fish in vivo. In conclusion, global transcriptional analysis demonstrated that EE2 affected a number of toxicologically relevant pathways associated with an estrogenic MoA in the rainbow trout hepatocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3aapoptosis 3aaquatic environment 3abioassays 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3acholesterol 3acytochrome P-450 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogenic properties 3afatty acids 3afish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3ahepatocytes 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amechanism of action 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3areproduction 3ascreening 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3avitellogenin 0aOncorhynchus mykiss 0aPrimary hepatocytes 0aEDCs 0aMicroarray 0aGene expression 0aEstrogen receptor1 aSong, You1 aTollefsen, Knut Erik0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Dec., v. 169 p.90-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009800165520123500263592002801498650002101526650001301547650001501560650002301575650001701598650001301615650001801628650001701646650002101663700001501684700001401699700001801713773012301731856008101854852000901935655001201944IND60754107920221122214014.0211023e20211012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075410792DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy111020492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Meining 14aThe Promotion of Festuca sinensis under Heavy Metal Treatment Mediated by Epichloë Endophyte  aTo more clearly clarify the relationship between the Epichloë endophyte and its host, F. sinensis, the effects of Epichloë endophyte on F. sinensis performance under heavy metal treatment was investigated. The growth performance and physiology variations of F. sinensis with (E+) and without the endophyte (E−) were evaluated after they were subjected to Zn²⁺ and Cd²⁺ treatments. The results showed that heavy metal treatments had significant effects on plants, as the performance of plants under Zn²⁺ and Cd²⁺ treatments was significantly different with plants under control treatment (p < 0.05). Cd²⁺ treatments showed a hormesis effect, whereas Zn²⁺ did not. The endophyte increased host heavy metal stress tolerance by promoting host growth as the E+ plants had significantly higher plant height, tiller number, root length (p < 0.05). The endophyte also promoted ion uptake by the host and induced endogenous hormone production (p < 0.05). These results suggested that the Epichloë endophyte regulated host growth and physiology to improve association tolerance to environmental conditions. This study provides another example that the Epichloë endophyte can increase plant tolerance to metal stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca sinensis 3aagronomy 3aendophytes 3agrowth performance 3aheavy metals 3ahormesis 3aion transport 3aplant height 3astress tolerance1 aTian, Pei 1 aGao, Min 1 aLi, Miaomiao 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111020493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245011800201300002000319500001500339520151300354592002801867650001101895650001301906650001601919650002801935650001601963650002101979650002502000650001902025650002502044653001402069700005702083700005502140700005202195700005302247700005002300700005202350700005502402700005602457773012502513856008102638852000902719655001202728IND60597817920221121052219.0180627e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059781792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2523-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zheng1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6808-270910aElectrochemical impedance study of water transportation in corona-aged silicone rubber: effect of applied voltage  ap. 12871-12884.  a2019-12-06  aSilicone rubber is widely used as the housing material of composite insulator for outdoor high-voltage insulation. However, corona-induced aging in silicone rubber contributes to the ingress of water or moisture, which finally leads to fracture of a composite insulator. To investigate water transportation in silicone rubber helps to shed light upon the insulator fracture mechanism. In this work, water transportation behaviors in silicone rubber treated by different applied voltages of corona discharge were systematically studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Low voltages (3, 4 kV) of corona treatments result in growing value of [Formula: see text] in Bode phase angle, indicative of severer degree of surface delamination. After 5 kV of corona treatment, water can finally diffuse through the silicone rubber, and then induces double-layer capacitance ([Formula: see text]) and the charge transfer resistance ([Formula: see text]) in EIS spectra. For high-voltage ([Formula: see text]) corona-exposed samples, great number of surface cracks are observed, and then Warburg impedance appears in EIS spectra on initial period of immersion, suggesting a direct water transportation process. The polar groups generated in silicone rubber during corona exposure also facilitate this water diffusion process. Calculated water diffusion coefficients show a sharp increase between 5 and 6 kV, which serves as an indicator for percolation of cracks or defects in bulk of silicone rubber.  aPublisher supplied data 3arubber 3asilicone 3adiffusivity 3adielectric spectroscopy 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3awater transportation 3aelectric power 3ainsulating materials 0aimpedance1 aYin, Chongshan1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5578-27111 aLi, Jingjing1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6048-50361 aYang, Yue1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7109-89201 aChen, Long1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5952-10951 aLuo, Yi1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3839-970X1 aLiu, Yong1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6095-69261 aHe, Chunqing1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6439-40941 aFang, Pengfei1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6836-03180 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Sept., v. 53, no. 18 p.12871-12884dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2523-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015500163300001600318520165400334592002801988596012402016650002302140650002302163650002502186650002302211650001902234650002002253650001602273650001702289650001102306650001602317650002602333650001102359650002302370650001302393650001302406650001302419650001602432650002202448650001102470650001002481650001802491650002002509651001002529700001902539700002302558773014302581856008202724852000902806655001202815IND60634950120221123031850.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063495012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-017-0057-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaqir, Mohd10aCharacterization and ranking of subtropical trees in a rural plantation forest of Uttar Pradesh, India, as fuel wood using fuel wood value index (FVI)  ap. 763-776.  aThe present study investigate fuel wood characteristics on the basis of fuel wood value index (FVI), a proximate and ultimate analysis of 12 subtropical tree species of rural areas of Uttar Pradesh in northern India, to sort out the tree species commonly used by the rural communities and examine their energy properties. The FVI was determined on the basis of calorific value (CV), bulk density (BD), and ash content (AC). The highest CV (22.56 MJ/kg) and BD (0.80 g/cm³) were found in Prosopis juliflora, and the lowest CV (17.32 MJ/kg) and BD (0.32 g/cm³) were found in Streblus asper. The AC was found maximum in Pithecellobium dulce (2.81%) and minimum in S. asper (0.83%). Moisture content was ranged between 38.70 and 58.67%. Investigation of elemental composition in fuel wood revealed that carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen (CHN), and sulfur value ranged from 40 to 46% C, 4.80 to 6.80% H, 0.03 to 1.40% N, and sulfur was defected only in some species and its maximum value (0.012) was found in species of Tectona grandis, T. arjuna, and Ficus benghalensis. This study revealed that only the single basic parameter is not sufficient for identifying the suitable tree species for fuel wood. On the basis of FVI and other fuel wood properties species, P. juliflora, T. grandis, F. benghalensis, Alstonia scholaris, and Holopetelea integrifolia are the most preferred fuel wood species among the 12 trees studied. To enable choice of plant species for future energy plantation program may help the local people to take maximum benefit to be used as bioenergy if electricity and alternative energy sources are not available in such remote areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aF1-17.1/ 2016-17/NFST-2015-17-ST-JAM-671/(SA-III/Website) dated on 05-04-2016.cnational fellowship for higher eduction 3aAlstonia scholaris 3aFicus benghalensis 3aPithecellobium dulce 3aProsopis juliflora 3aStreblus asper 3aTectona grandis 3aash content 3abulk density 3acarbon 3aelectricity 3aelemental composition 3aenergy 3aforest plantations 3afuelwood 3ahydrogen 3anitrogen 3arural areas 3arural communities 3asulfur 3atrees 3awater content 3awood properties 3aIndia1 aKothari, Richa1 aSingh, Rana Pratap0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2019 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.763-776dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-017-0057-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245018800211300001600399520174900415592002802164650002302192650001802215650002502233650003002258650001202288650001802300650001202318650001502330650001702345650001702362650001802379650002102397650001102418650001102429650001302440650001502453650001802468650001202486650001602498650001302514650002302527651001202550653003102562653001602593653001102609653002202620653002202642700002002664700005902684700002102743700003102764773014002795856008302935852000903018655001203027IND60746703320221117004411.0210904e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074670332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2021.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbohon, Osamudiamen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3547-693310aIn vitro antiplasmodial activity, cytotoxicity, and gas chromatography – flame ionization detector metabolites fingerprint of extracts and fractions from Tetrorchidium didymostemon  ap. 480-488.  aTetrorchidium didymostemon is used as an antimalarial remedy in southern Nigeria.This study was aimed at providing scientific validation for the use of T. didymostemon in the treatment of malaria in Nigeria.Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 (Pf3D7) strain was cultured and maintained in fresh O⁺ human erythrocytes.

They also suggest that the phytoconstituent(s) responsible for the antiplasmodial activity of this plant may be more extractable in non-polar solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aantimalarials 3aantioxidant activity 3aantiplasmodial properties 3aazulene 3abark extracts 3acamphor 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3aerythrocytes 3aethyl acetate 3aflame ionization 3ahexane 3ahumans 3ahumulene 3akaempferol 3aleaf extracts 3amalaria 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3aNigeria 0aTetrorchidium didymostemon 0aAntioxidant 0aGC-FID 0aEthnopharmacology 0aPhytoconstituents1 aIrabor, Francis1 aErhunse, Nekpen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0312-02301 aOmagene, Abigail1 aOmoregie, Ehimwenma Sheena0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2021 July,  Sept., v. 12, no. 3 p.480-488dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245013300187300001800320520149300338592002801831650001701859650002201876650001001898650001801908650001501926650002201941650001501963650001401978650001801992650001602010650001102026650002302037650001102060650001802071650006202089650002802151650006602179650003802245650001002283650002502293650001202318650002902330650002302359650006002382651001702442651001702459700002302476700002102499773014002520856008202660852000902742655001202751IND50067483420221117231046.0210324e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006748342DNAL7 a232425062pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-012-3048-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSibanda, Timothy10aSeasonal and spatio-temporal distribution of faecal-indicator bacteria in Tyume River in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa  ap. 6579-6590.  aWe assessed the incidence of faecal-indicator bacteria in Tyume River over a 12-month period between August 2010 and July 2011. Total coliforms, faecal coliforms and enterococci were determined by the membrane filtration method. Total coliforms were detected in counts ranging from 2.1 × 10² to 3.4 × 10⁴ CFU/100 ml. Faecal coliform counts ranged from 1 × 10² to 1.6 × 10⁴ CFU/100 ml while enterococci counts were in the range of 3.3 × 10¹ to 5.1 × 10³ CFU/100 ml. Indicator bacteria counts increased from upstream to downstream sampling sites. Counts of indicator bacteria at all sites were significantly affected by seasonal changes. The bacteriological qualities of the river water were poor, exceeding the guideline of 200 CFU/100 ml and 33 CFU/100 ml for faecal coliforms and enterococci, respectively, for recreational water. Faecal coliform counts also exceeded the 1,000 CFU/100 ml guideline for water used in fresh produce irrigation. Microbial source tracking results showed that faecal pollution was predominantly of human origin during spring at all sampling sites. During other seasons, human faecal pollution was largely confined to midstream and downstream sampling sites. Generally, the presence of faecal-indicator bacteria in the river water samples suggests faecal pollution of this freshwater resource, raising the possibility of the presence of pathogenic microorganisms in the water and a threat to public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3acoliform bacteria 3afeces 3afresh produce 3afreshwater 3aindicator species 3airrigation 3apollution 3apublic health 3ariver water 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3awater quality 2aBacteriaxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEnterococcusxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFeces 2aRiversxmicrobiology 2aSeasons 2aSpatio-Temporal Analysis 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Pollutionxanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 3aSouth Africa 0aSouth Africa1 aChigor, Vincent N.1 aOkoh, Anthony I.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 Aug., v. 185, no. 8 p.6579-6590dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-3048-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245009400212300001600306520149400322592002801816650001101844650002001855650001801875650003201893650001501925650001901940650001101959650001301970650001001983650001501993700002702008700001702035700001902052700002202071700002502093700002602118700002202144700002202166700002202188700002502210700002502235700002102260700002502281700001902306700002302325700002102348700002202369700002502391700001602416700002002432700002402452700001702476700001902493700002202512700002002534700002402554700002502578700002402603700002202627700001902649700002202668773011102690856008302801852000902884655001202893IND60725521220221116211037.0210425e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552122DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-020-00886-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDennison, William C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2024-614210aSusan Lynn Williams: the Life of an Exceptional Scholar, Leader, and Friend (1951–2018)  ap. 304-311.  aSusan Lynn Williams (1951–2018) was an exceptional marine ecologist whose research focused broadly on the ecology of benthic nearshore environments dominated by seagrasses, seaweeds, and coral reefs.

Accurate information regarding variations in precipitation and temperature is essential for identifying and understanding these potential impacts. This research applied Mann–Kendall, rescaled range analysis and wave transform methods to analyze the trends and periodic properties of global and regional surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation (PR) over the period of 1948 to 2010. The results show that 65.34 % of the area studied exhibits significant warming trends (p < 0.05) while only 3.18 % of the area exhibits significant cooling trends. The greatest warming trends are observed in Antarctica (0.32 °C per decade) and Middle Africa (0.21 °C per decade). Notably, 62.26 % of the area became wetter, while 22.01 % of the area shows drying trends. Northern Europe shows the largest precipitation increase, 12.49 mm per decade. Western Africa shows the fastest drying, −21.05 mm per decade. The rescaled range analysis reveals large areas that show persistent warming trends; this behavior in SAT is more obvious than that in PR. Wave transform results show that a 1-year period of SAT variation dominates in all regions, while inconsistent 0.5-year bands are observed in East Asia, Middle Africa, and Southeast Asia. In PR, significant power in the wavelet power spectrum at a 1-year period was observed in 17 regions, i.e., in all regions studied except Western Europe, where precipitation is instead characterized by 0.5-year and 0.25-year periods. Overall, the variations in SAT and PR can be consistent with the combined impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors, such as atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, the internal variability of climate system, and volcanic eruptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acooling 3adrying 3agreenhouse gases 3ahumans 3awavelet 2aClimate 2aClimate Change 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aRain 2aSnow 2aTemperature 3aAntarctica 3aNorthern European region 3aSouth East Asia 3aWestern Africa 3aWestern European region1 aKong, Dongxian1 aMiao, Chiyuan1 aDuan, Qingyun1 aYang, Tiantian1 aYe, Aizhong1 aDi, Zhenhua1 aGong, Wei0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 Sept., v. 186, no. 9 p.5663-5679dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3811-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011700208300001600325520170300341592002802044596004502072596004502117596004502162650000802207650001902215650001102234650002402245650002202269650001902291650002702310650001602337650001602353650002502369650001502394650002102409651001802430700002402448700002202472700002302494700002302517773011102540856008302651852000902734655001202743IND60725521320221116211029.0210425e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072552132DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-020-00813-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHays, Cynthia G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7856-726410aLinking Spatial Patterns of Adult and Seed Diversity Across the Depth Gradient in the Seagrass Zostera marina L.  ap. 383-395.  aSexual reproduction is the primary source of genotypic diversity in seagrass meadows, with important implications for both the evolutionary potential and ecological function of these habitats. However, relatively little is known about seagrass pollination dynamics or how genetic diversity in life history stage may influence genetic diversity in another. We used microsatellite DNA markers to assess how genetic diversity of adult shoots and seeds covaried across the depth gradient in two Zostera marina L. (eelgrass) meadows in Massachusetts (USA). Despite strong spatial patterns in the density of reproductive shoots and genetic evidence for limited pollen dispersal, we found modest corresponding variation in outcrossing rates and paternal diversity. Across spatial scales from quadrats to sites, there was a positive association between the density of flowering shoots and clonal richness; however, other measures of diversity (e.g., allelic richness and heterozygosity) showed weak or opposing patterns with reproductive effort, and neither flowering effort nor local genotypic richness of adults were good proxies for seed diversity. Self-pollinated seeds were significantly smaller than their outcrossed half-siblings, and our data suggest that selection against selfed seeds varies spatially within and among meadows, possibly due to high competition with vegetative shoots in the dense shallow margin.

This could be because of the difficulty in assessing ES relationships, in general, and particularly, an uneven study of geographical distribution and the relationships among ES demand remains under-researched. Yet, understanding relationships among multiple ES can support policy and management decisions, from problem definition to interventions. This novel research focused on addressing some of the challenges, presenting relationships among ES demand undertaken in Omo Biosphere Reserve (OBR), Nigeria, to improve understanding and extend the geographical coverage of ES relationship studies. In this study, primary data were obtained using a questionnaire survey administered to 302 individuals in OBR. Multinomial regression, correlation and factor analysis were used to identify key ES, explain the influence of sociodemographic attributes on ES preferences and identify the trade-offs, synergies and bundles of ES demand, respectively. The results showed that there were 18 key ES demanded with more preference for provisioning ES such as crops than other ES. Few sociodemographic attributes were identified to influence people’s preferences for ES. Furthermore, major trade-offs occurred between provisioning ES with synergies observed among provisioning, regulating and cultural ES. Of the six bundles identified, the first three bundles explained 53% of the total variance which involved environmental, health and basic needs. Our findings not only provide valuable information that could help achieve a well-managed landscape but also support decision-making process and management strategies that could potentially strengthen rural livelihoods.  aPublisher supplied data  a11084cNational Research Foundation (ZA) 3aconservation areas 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3afactor analysis 3ageographical distribution 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3avariance 3aNigeria1 aChirwa, Paxie W1 aBabalola, Folaranmi Dapo1 aChaikaew, Pasicha0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 May, v. 23, no. 5 p.7310-7325dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00918-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245008700150300001800237300002600255500001500281520094400296650002001240650001501260650001301275650001801288650000801306650001001314650002301324650001701347650002301364650001101387650001101398650001001409650003101419650001701450650001101467650001801478650001801496650001101514650001101525650002401536650000901560650001601569650003201585653001601617653003601633653002401669700001801693700001601711773010501727852001301832939003301845945000801878946001301886852000901899655001201908991608364900742620221120185620.0920327e199112  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920008992DNAL7 a19603462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarkin, F.A.10aComparison of three consecutive-day and three random-day records of dietary intake  ap. 1538-1542.  ap. 1538-1542. charts.  a2019-12-05  aWe conducted this study to determine whether 3 days of dietary records from randomly selected days or from consecutive days more closely estimated the energy and nutrient intake values obtained from 16 days over a 1-year period.

The group means for intake of energy and seven nutrients were similar for random and consecutive days. However, for energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, and calcium, the means of the absolute differences between the values for 16 days and those for the random days were significantly smaller than the corresponding means between the values for 16 days and those for consecutive days. Random-day samples may be preferable for describing dietary intake of individuals and small groups when the gain in reliability is worth the cost. 3anutrient intake 3aestimation 3asampling 3aenergy intake 3amen 3awomen 3agender differences 3adiet history 3aseasonal variation 3aWhites 3aBlacks 2aAdult 2aBlack or African American. 2aDiet Records 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 0acomparisons 0anationalities and ethnic groups 0asequential sampling1 aMetzner, H.L.1 aGuire, K.E.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1991 Dec., v. 91, no. 12 p.1538-1542x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245007500151300001600226300002400242520023500266650001600501650001800517650002000535650001600555650001300571650001600584650001600600650002400616650002300640650000800663650001000671650001000681650005000691650001700741650004200758650001100800650001100811650001100822650000900833650001600842650004000858650003200898650002200930650002000952650001500972651001400987700001701001700001701018700002201035773010201057852001301159939003301172945000801205946001301213852000901226655001201235991608364840742620221120185437.0920309e199202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920005512DNAL7 a17379072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrawert, S.M.10aRecruitment and retention of volunteers in a dietary methodology study  ap. 221-222.  ap. 221-222. charts.  aThis study evaluated the methods used to recruit and retain volunteers to test a short self-administered food-frequency questionnaire designed to assess usual intake of dietary fat and cholesterol and provide educational messages. 3afood intake 3aeating habits 3adietary surveys 3ameasurement 3aaccuracy 3adietary fat 3acholesterol 3anutrition education 3aworking conditions 3amen 3awomen 2aAdult 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aDiet Records 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRandom Allocation 2aResearch Design 2aVolunteers 3aMinnesota1 aPeters, J.R.1 aMullis, R.M.1 aHunninghake, D.B.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1992 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.221-222x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245005600168300001600224500002400240520216100264650001702425650001202442650001102454650002502465650001102490650001402501650001202515650001902527650001302546650001502559650002102574650001802595650001002613650002202623650002802645650001502673650001002688650001802698651002002716653002402736653002202760653002902782653002002811653002902831653001102860653001102871653000902882653001302891653002202904700002002926700002902946773014002975852000903115856004803124655001203172IND4388004620221120174700.0070218e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438800462DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-005-9010-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoshetko, James M.10aSmallholder Agroforestry Systems For Carbon Storage  ap. 219-242.  aIncludes references  aMost smallholder agroforestry systems in Southeast Asia are tree- and species-rich systems producing non-wood and wood products for both home use and market sale. Due to their high biomass, these systems contain large carbon (C) stocks. While the systems of individual farmers are of limited size, on a per area basis smallholder systems accumulate significant amounts of C, equaling the amount of C stored in some secondary forests of similar age. Their ability to simultaneously address smallholders' livelihood needs and store large amounts of C makes smallholder systems viable project types under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, with its dual objective of emissions reduction and sustainable development. Smallholder systems have not developed in areas where enabling conditions do not exist. A CDM project that facilitates a minimum threshold of enabling conditions that make smallholder agroforestation possible should qualify for C credits. To secure smallholder confidence, the agroforestry systems promoted through a CDM project must be socially and economically viable independent of C payments. To assure system productivity and profitability, projects should provide farmers with technical and marketing assistance. Additionally, project sites should meet the following preconditions: areas of underutilized low-biomass landuse systems available for rehabilitation; smallholders interested in tree farming; accessible markets for tree products; supportive local governments; sufficient infrastructure; and transparent and equitable relationships between project partners. Questions of leakage and additionality should not be problematic and can be addressed through the project design, establishment of quantifiable baseline data and facilitating enabling conditions. However, smallholder-focused CDM projects would have high transaction costs. The subsequent challenge is thus to develop mechanisms that reduce the costs of: (a) making information (e.g., technology, markets) more accessible to multiple clients; (b) facilitating and enforcing smallholder agreements and (c) designing feasible monitoring systems. 3aagroforestry 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acredit 3aemissions 3afarmers 3ainfrastructure 3aland use 3alivelihood 3alocal government 3aprofitability 3asales 3asecondary forests 3asustainable development 3atree farms 3atrees 3awood products 3aSouth East Asia 0aenabling conditions 0alocal livelihoods 0asmallholder agroforestry 0aagroforestation 0asmallholder CDM projects 0aAR CDM 0aLULUCF 0aCERs 0aC stocks 0atransaction costs1 aLasco, Rodel D.1 aAngeles, Marian S.

Hormonal aberrations in reproductive function characterized by secondary amenorrhea are reported in female athletes, particularly those who initiate training before menarche. Secondary amenorrhea, in turn, is associated with reduced bone mineral density. Interpretation of the cause of amenorrhea in athletic women is still the subject of investigation because of the many variables associated with menstruation, eg, exercise training and energy intake. The purpose of this study was to assess the dietary and training status of amenorrheic and eumenorrheic adolescent runners. 3aamenorrhea 3ahormone secretion 3aexercise 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3aadolescents 3awomen 3aathletes 2aAdolescent 2aAmenorrheaxetiologyxmetabolism. 2aBody Composition 2aDiet 2aDiet Records 2aEstradiolxblood 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aNutritional Status 2aRunning1 aTaper, L.J.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1992 Jan., v. 92, no. 1 p.89-91x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245011400150300001600264500002400280520136400304650001901668650002301687650001201710650002201722650001201744650001501756650001901771650001501790650001501805651001501820700001901835700001601854700001601870773008801886852000901974856003801983655001202021IND4426737820221120174708.0091002s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442673782DNAL7 a10.1071/WR081222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuda, Y.10aFencing artificial waterpoints failed to influence density and distribution of red kangaroos (Macropus rufus)  ap. 457-465.  aIncludes references  aProvision of artificial waterpoints in Australian rangelands has resulted in an increase in the range and density of kangaroos. At high densities, kangaroos can inhibit vegetation regeneration, particularly in some protected areas where harvesting is prohibited. Fencing off waterpoints has been proposed to limit these impacts. Our aim was to determine whether fencing off waterpoints during a drought (when kangaroos would be especially water-limited) would influence the density and distribution of red kangaroos (Macropus rufus). Two waterpoints were fenced within the first 6 months of the 27-month study and a further two waterpoints were kept unfenced as controls in Idalia National Park, western Queensland. We estimated kangaroo densities around waterpoints from walked line-transect counts, and their grazing distribution from dung-pellet counts. Fencing off waterpoints failed to influence either the density or distribution up to 4km from the waterpoints. Our results indicate that food availability, rather than the location of waterpoints, determines kangaroo distribution. Few areas in the rangelands are beyond kangaroos' convenient reach from permanent waterpoints. Therefore, fencing off waterpoints without explicitly considering the spatial context in relation to other available water sources will fail to achieve vegetation regeneration. 3aMacropus rufus 3aconservation areas 3adrought 3afood availability 3agrazing 3aharvesting 3anational parks 3arangelands 3avegetation 3aQueensland1 aMcCallum, H.I.1 aGrigg, G.C.1 aPople, A.R.0 tWildlife research.g2009, v. 36, no. 6 p.457-465dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR08122 7aarticle02849naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007400165300001800239520173100257650001801988653003702006653001102043653002002054700001802074700002202092700002202114700002002136700001702156773020002173852000902373856008502382930003302467946001102500655001202511IND4445364420221120174856.0101119e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444536442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00381-010-1176-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurash, Surash 12aA retrospective analysis of revision endoscopic third ventriculostomy  ap. 1693-1698.  aPurpose Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has gained favour as an effective treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus. However, the timing of ETV failure and the long-term efficacy of revision ETV remain poorly documented. Methods A retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing revision ETV between 1999 and 2007. Only those patients in whom there was evidence of a good sustained clinical improvement after the initial ETV were considered candidates for ETV revision. All other patients underwent insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt at the time of ETV failure. Failures that were selected for repeat ETV were subdivided into; “early” if the revision occurred within the first 3 months of the primary procedure and “late” if occurring after this. Results Ten patients underwent revision ETV (6% of all ETVs performed). Age ranged from 2 months to 32 years (mean 13.6 years). Three “early” revision ETV were performed at a mean of 1.3 months, and there were seven “late” revisions performed at a mean of 27 months. The stoma was closed in seven patients and narrowed in one patient, and a second membrane was found under the original patent stoma in a further two patients. In two patients, a third ETV procedure was performed (both at 1 month after second ETV), and the stoma was closed in both these patients. No patients have required a shunt. Conclusion At last follow-up (mean 38 months), all patients remain well. Revision ETV appears a safe and effective means of managing hydrocephalus—providing there is clinical evidence that the primary procedure was initially effective. It is important to emphasise that patients with an initially successful ETV are by no means “cured”. 3ahydrocephalus 0aEndoscopic third ventriculostomy 0aShunts 0aShunt revisions1 aChumas, Paul 1 aBhargava, Deepti 1 aCrimmins, Darach 1 aStraiton, John 1 aTyagi, Atul 0 tChild's nervous system ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery.g2010 Dec., v. 26, no. 12 p.1693-1698dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0256-70407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00381-010-1176-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20101119b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03283naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245012000149300001600269300002400285520164800309650000901957650002001966650002801986650001402014650001402028650001302042650002302055650001602078650003202094650001302126650001402139650001502153650001002168650000902178650002302187650001102210650001302221650006602234650001102300650005902311650000902370650001602379650001402395650001402409650001502423650002602438651001802464651003302482773010202515852001302617930003302630945000802663946001302671852000902684655001202693991608363770742620221120174712.0920309e199202  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920005462DNAL7 a17379032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGable, C.B.10aHemochromatosis and dietary iron supplementation: Implications from US mortality, morbidity, and health survey data  ap. 208-212.  ap. 208-212. charts.  aTrends in the mortality rates, morbidity rates, and hematologic screening parameters for hemochromatosis in the United States over the past 20 years were examined to assess whether dietary iron supplementation is a precipitating factor for hemochromatosis. From 1968 through 1987, there was an increase in the overall hemochromatosis mortality rates attributable to white women. From 1979 through 1987, the hospitalization rates for hemochromatosis ranged from 4 to 13 per 100,000 persons in Medicaid data (1984) and the National Hospital Discharge Survey (1979-1987) and are similar to estimates in the literature from 1955. Although the iron nutritional status of persons under 55 years of age increased from the first to the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, there was no corresponding increase at the 95th percentile in the hemochromatosis screening parameters--serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation. A hypothetical scenario was used to examine the progression from homozygous gene frequency to phenotypic expression. It is concluded that clinical hemochromatosis is rarer than prevalence estimates of 100 to 500 per 100,000 persons predicted by gene frequency. In addition, there is no strong evidence of an increase in hemochromatosis from mortality, morbidity, or health survey data, which implies that dietary iron supplementation begun in 1940 has not accelerated manifestations of hemochromatosis. Any increase in hemochromatosis since iron fortification can probably be attributed to accuracy in diagnosis and enhanced awareness of the disease by physicians rather than to environmental factors. 3airon 3ahemochromatosis 3aepidemiological studies 3amortality 3amorbidity 3aetiology 3anutritional status 3atransferrin 3adietary mineral supplements 3agenotype 3aphenotype 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDatabases, Factual 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHemochromatosisxepidemiologyxetiologyxgeneticsxmortality. 2aHumans 2aIronxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxblood. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMorbidity 2aPhenotype 2aPrevalence 2aTransferrinxanalysis 3aUnited States 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1992 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.208-212x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001800186245006600204300001800270520192000288650001202208650002302220650001002243650000902253650003102262650005202293650003302345650001102378650003202389650004102421650001102462650006702473650003802540650000902578650001602587650006702603650002802670650006302698653001402761700002002775700002002795700002302815700002302838773011302861852000902974856008502983930003303068946001103101655001203112IND4443223120221120171238.0101001e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444322312DNAL7 a200947062pmid7 aPMC29478142pmcid7 a10.1007/s00198-009-1149-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubin, M. R. 10aTherapy of hypoparathyroidism with intact parathyroid hormone  ap. 1927-1934.  aSummary Hypoparathyroidism, a disorder characterized by low parathyroid hormone (PTH), is generally treated with oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation. We investigated the effects of PTH(1-84) treatment in 30 hypoparathyroid subjects for 24 months. PTH(1-84) treatment in hypoparathyroidism significantly reduced supplemental calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D requirements without generally altering serum and urinary calcium levels. Introduction Hypoparathyroidism, a disorder characterized by low PTH, is associated with hypocalcemia, hypercalciuria, and increased bone mineral density (BMD). Conventional therapy with calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D can maintain the serum calcium concentration, but doses are high, and control is variable. We investigated the effects of human PTH(1-84) treatment in hypoparathyroidism. Methods Thirty subjects with hypoparathyroidism were treated in an open-label study of PTH(1-84) 100 µg every other day by subcutaneous injection for 24 months, with monitoring of calcium and vitamin D supplementation requirements, serum and 24 h urinary calcium excretion, and BMD by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results Requirements for supplemental calcium decreased significantly (3,030 ± 2,325 to 1,661 ± 1,267 mg/day (mean ± SD); p < 0.05), as did requirements for supplemental 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (0.68 ± 0.5 to 0.40 ± 0.5 µg/day; p < 0.05). Serum calcium levels and 24 h urinary calcium excretion were mostly unchanged at 24 months. BMD increased at the lumbar spine by 2.9 ± 4% from baseline (p < 0.05), while femoral neck BMD remained unchanged and distal one third radial BMD decreased by 2.4 ± 4% (p < 0.05). Conclusion PTH(1-84) treatment in hypoparathyroidism significantly reduces supplemental calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D requirements without generally altering serum and urinary calcium levels. 3acalcium 3ahypoparathyroidism 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aCalciumxadministration & dosagexbloodxurine. 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aFemale 2aFemur Neckxphysiopathology 2aHormone Replacement Therapyxmethods 2aHumans 2aHypoparathyroidismxdrug therapyxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aLumbar Vertebraexphysiopathology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aParathyroid Hormonexadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aRadiusxphysiopathology 2aVitamin Dxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivatives. 0aPTH(1-84)1 aSliney, J.

We have tested the response of the Trp pathway enzymes and three other amino acid biosynthetic enzymes to starvation for aromatic amino acids, branched-chain amino acids, or methionine. The Trp pathway enzymes and cytosolic glutamine synthetase were induced under all of the amino acid starvation test conditions, whereas methionine synthase and acetolactate synthase were not. The mRNAs for two stress-inducible enzymes unrelated to amine acid biosynthesis and accumulation of the indolic phytoalexin camalexin were also induced by amino acid starvation. These results suggest that regulation of the Trp pathway enzymes under amino acid deprivation conditions is largely a stress response to allow for increased biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Consistent with this hypothesis, treatments with the oxidative stress-inducing herbicide acifluorfen and the abiotic elicitor alpha-amino butyric acid induced responses similar to those induced by the amino acid starvation treatments. The role of salicylic acid in herbicide-mediated Trp and camalexin induction was investigated. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aenzymes 3atryptophan 3aamino acid metabolism 3aphytoalexins 3abiosynthesis 3afree amino acids 3anutrient availability 3aoxidation 3aacifluorfen 3aalpha-aminobutyric acid 3aheat stress 3asalicylic acid 3aglyphosate 3achlorsulfuron 3aheat shock proteins 3apathogenesis-related proteins 2a5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferasexmetabolism 2aAcetolactate Synthasexmetabolism 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAminobutyratesxpharmacology 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aGlutamate-Ammonia Ligasexmetabolism 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aIndolesxmetabolism 2aNitrobenzoatesxpharmacology 2aOxidative Stress 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSalicylatesxmetabolism 2aSalicylic Acid 2aThiazolesxmetabolism 2aTryptophanxbiosynthesis 0astress 0agenetic regulation1 aWilliams, C.C.1 aLast, R.L.0 tPlant cell.g1998 Mar., v. 10, no. 3 p.359-370x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02848naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009200167300001600259520155100275650001201826650001401838650002601852650001301878650001801891650001201909650001201921650001001933650000901943650002701952650002201979650001402001650002702015651001202042653001902054700002102073700002102094700001902115773013002134852000902264856008502273930003302358946001102391655001202402IND4441645620221120171315.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444164562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-009-9137-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLajbner, Zdeněk 10aLack of reproductive isolation between the Western and Eastern phylogroups of the tench  ap. 289-300.  aThe Eurasian range of the tench distribution is subdivided into deeply divergent Western and Eastern phylogroups evidenced by nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence markers. A broad zone of overlap exists in central and western Europe, suggesting post-glacial contact with limited hybridisation. We conducted a population genetic test of this indication that the two phylogroups may represent distinct species. We analysed variation at introns of nuclear genes, microsatellites, allozymes and mitochondrial DNA in populations from two postglacial lakes within the contact zone in Germany. The test is based on the expectation that in the presence of strong barriers to reproduction, a hybrid population will show genome-wide associations among alleles and genotypes from each phylogroup even after hundreds of generations of interbreeding. In contrast to this expectation, no consistent significant deviations from linkage and Hardy-Weinberg equilibria were found. Samples from both lakes did show significant disequilibria but they were limited to individual loci and were not concordant between populations, and were not robust to the method used. The single consistent association can be attributed to physical linkage between two microsatellite loci. Thus, results of our study support the hypothesis of free interbreeding between the two phylogroups of tench.

Their analysis becomes even more significant when studying runoff reaction to intense rainfall, especially in the case of ungauged, flash flood prone basins. Unit hydrographs are one of the useful tools for estimating runoff when instrumental data are inadequate. In this work, instantaneous unit hydrographs based on the time-area method have been compiled along the drainage networks of two small rural catchments in Greece, situated approximately 25 km northeast of its capital, Athens. The two catchments drained by ephemeral torrents, namely Rapentosa and Charadros, have been subject to flash flooding during the last decades, which caused extensive damages at the local small towns of Marathon and Vranas. Hydrograph compilation in numerous locations along the catchments' drainage networks directly reflected the runoff conditions across each basin against a given rainfall. This gave a holistic assessment of their hydrologic response, allowing the detection of areas where peak flow rates were elevated and therefore, there was higher flood potential. The resulting flood hazard zonation showed good correlation with locations of damages induced by past flood events, indicating that the method can successfully predict flood hazard spatial distribution. The whole methodology was based on geographic information software due to its excellent capabilities on storing and processing spatial data. 3amorphometry 3aGreece 0aFlood hazard 0aGIS 0aMarathon 0aTime-area0 tNatural hazards.g2011 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.803-814dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-010-9592-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02167naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245006100172300001800233520097900251650003001230650001301260650001601273650002301289650002801312650003401340650001001374650001501384700002101399700002701420700001801447700003401465773014901499852000901648856009201657930003301749946001101782655001201793IND4440269620221120155121.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444026962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02277.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Cristina10aShelf life extension of durum semolina-based fresh pasta  ap. 1545-1551.  aIn this work, the combined effects of chitosan, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and packaging barrier properties on shelf life of fresh pasta is presented. In particular, all pasta samples were packaged under active and passive MAP in two different polymeric films with high and low barrier properties. In order to assess the influence of the variables described beforehand on the shelf life of pasta, the sensorial and microbiological quality has been monitored during storage. Results confirmed the antimicrobial properties of chitosan. Moreover, the findings recorded in this study suggest that the shelf life of fresh pasta is limited by the sensorial characteristics. Statistically significant differences between the shelf life of pasta packaged in low barrier and high barrier films were found. The best result was obtained for samples packaged in high barrier film, due to the ability of the packaging to maintain the gas headspace conditions during the storage. 3aanti-infective properties 3achitosan 3adurum wheat 3aheadspace analysis 3amicrobiological quality 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3apasta 3ashelf life1 aLucera, Annalisa1 aMastromatteo, Marcella1 aConte, Amalia1 aDel Nobile, Matteo Alessandro0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2010 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.1545-1551dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02277.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02014naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003600115040001800151100001600169245005400185300001600239520038100255650002000636650001000656650001200666650004400678650002100722650001700743650002600760650001800786650003300804650003000837650001100867650001100878650001100889650002000900650004500920650000900965650002900974650001001003650001701013651001301030653003201043653003701075700001601112700001901128700001601147700001701163773008401180852000901264856008601273939003301359945000801392946001301400990002301413655001201436991608359370742620221120125210.0830316e198205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830025592DNAL7 a72003412pmid7 a10.7326/0003-4819-96-5-6012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWittner, M.10aSuccessful chemotherapy of transfusion babesiosis  ap. 601-604.  aBabesia microti, female infant infected by blood transfusion, successfully treated with quinine and clindamycin, clinical case review, blood donor had visited Fire Island, N.Y. where he had been bitten by tick;

The study was made on crude extract (XAD-7 Amberlite-retained fraction) as well as on the following pure pigments isolated from tamarillo fruit (Solanum betaceum Cav.): delphinidin 3-O-(6"-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl-β-glucopyranosyl)-3'-O-β-glucopyranoside, delphinidin 3-O-(6"-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl)-β-glucopyranoside, cyanidin 3-O-(6"-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl)-β-glucopyranoside and pelargonidin 3-O-(6"-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl)-β-glucopyranoside. The relationships between the colour and the hydroxylation degree of the B ring and the pH have been studied for the first time on rutinosides. The peel extract showed much more colour stability than the jelly extract at all the pH values studied. The replacement of the 3'-OH with a glycosyl group increased the stability of the colour to pH changes, although this substitution yields a less colourful (higher L[low asterisk] and lower [formula removed]) compound (Dp 3-rut-3'-glc), having both hypsochromic and hypochromic shifts relative to the non-glycosylated molecule (Dp 3-rut). Moreover, the influence of the hydroxylation degree of the B ring on the quality and stability of colour, as well as on the antioxidant activity, was determined. 3aanthocyanins 3aplant extracts 3aSolanum betaceum 3apH 3acolor 3ahydroxylation 3aantioxidant activity 3adisaccharides 0ajelly extract 0aplant pigments 0aphytochemicals 0aphysicochemical properties 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0apeels1 aMorales, Alicia L.1 aGonzález-Miret, M.

Longissimus dorsi muscles from 39 Angus or LimousinxAngus bulls were examined to see if pHu achieved at 22h post mortem (rigor) affected tenderness and water holding capacity of beef. Samples were segregated into three pHu groups termed high (pH>6.3), intermediate (5.7<pH<6.3) and low (pH<5.7) pHu beef. More than 30% of bull beef did not achieve acceptable tenderness at 8 days post mortem with this ageing regime. No significant differences in calpain or cathepsin enzyme levels due to meat pH were observed until after 22h post mortem, but low pHu beef had elevated caspase 3/7 activity soon after slaughter. At 22h post mortem, greater levels of μ-calpain enzyme were found in the high and intermediate pHu beef and cathepsin B levels were superior in the low pHu beef after 2 days post mortem. Different rates of desmin and troponin T protein degradation were also observed in aged bull beef. Both proteins were degraded within 6h post mortem for high pHu beef, but took >3 days post mortem for intermediate pHu beef. High levels of alpha β-crystallin (aβC) at 22h post mortem coincided with delayed muscle protein degradation for low pHu beef. Our results support the hypothesis that aβC shields myofibrils and buffers against endopeptidase degradation of beef structure during ageing. 3aheat shock proteins 3abulls 3aAngus 3arigor mortis 3abeef quality 3abeef cattle 3aproteolysis 3aLimousin (cattle breed) 3atroponins 3ameat tenderness 3abeef 3alongissimus muscle 3apH 3awater holding capacity 3acalpain 3ameat aging 3aenzyme activity 3acrystallins 0acaspase 3/7 0alongissimus dorsi 0aproteinases 0adesmin1 aDobbie, P.1 aFraga Vazquez, S.1 aFraser-Smith, E.1 aFrost, D.A.1 aMorris, C.A.0 tMeat science.g2009 Sept., v. 83, no. 1 p.1-9dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.11.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090730b20090801c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/07/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01121naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024003000115040001800145100001700163245003600180300001600216520009100232650003200323650002800355650001600383650003600399650003300435650001100468650003300479773009500512852000900607856008000616939003300696945000800729946001100737990002300748655001200771991608356600742620221120093447.0831027e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830095912DNAL7 a68856742pmid7 a10.1093/jac/11.6.4942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, D.L.10aChemotherapy of hydatid disease  ap. 494-496.  ahydatid disease, human, current management, chemotherapy including albendazole, review 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aEchinococcus granulosus 2aAlbendazole 2aBenzimidazolesxtherapeutic use 2aEchinococcosisxdrug therapy 2aHumans 2aMebendazolextherapeutic use0 tJournal of antimicrobial chemotherapy.g1983 June, v. 11, no. 6 p.494-496x0305-74537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jac/11.6.4943Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19831027c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02907naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168100001700177245015800194300001400352500002400366500001500390520118400405650002101589650002901610650001901639650001701658650001901675650003701694650001801731650002201749650002001771650001901791650002301810650001601833650000701849650001401856650002201870650001301892650002601905650001601931651001001947653002901957653001401986700001802000700001402018700001502032700001602047773008702063852000902150856008902159930003302248945002502281946001102306655001202317IND4421745220221120093527.0090612e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442174522DNAL7 a204167742pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1221 aBonomo, M.G.10aTechnological and safety characterization of coagulase-negative staphylococci from traditionally fermented sausages of Basilicata region (Southern Italy)  ap. 15-23.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThirty-seven strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, isolated from traditional fermented sausages of Basilicata region, were screened on the basis of their technological properties (nitrate reductase, proteolytic, lipolytic, amino acid-decarboxylase and antimicrobial activities) and for their ability to grow in the presence of different salt concentrations, temperatures and pH values, to elucidate their possible role during meat fermentation process. All strains grew at 20°C and 30°C in all conditions, while at 10°C, only few isolates showed a good growth at pH values ranging from 6 to 5.2. Staphylococci strains had different enzymatic profiles. A significant level of proteolytic activity was observed in 75.6% of the strains and 23 staphylococci hydrolysed sarcoplasmatic proteins. Nitrate was reduced by 62% of the strains, while most of isolates (80.9%) were able to decarboxylate at least one of the tested amino acids. This is a preliminary study focused on the selection of autochthonous starter cultures to standardize the production of fermented sausages, to preserve their organoleptic and sensory properties and to improve the quality of final product. 3astarter cultures 3aantimicrobial properties 3asalt tolerance 3afermentation 3aacid tolerance 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3acarboxylation 3anitrate reductase 3afermented foods 3aheat tolerance 3asensory properties 3aproteolysis 3apH 3alipolysis 3atraditional foods 3asausages 3amolecular systematics 3afood safety 3aItaly 0atechnological properties 0aisolation1 aRicciardi, A.1 aZotta, T.1 aSico, M.A.1 aSalzano, G.0 tMeat science.g2009 Sept., v. 83, no. 1 p.15-23dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.03.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090730b20090801c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/07/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01949naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097040001800139100002300157245004700180300001400227500001500241520092600256650001601182650001501198650001401213650001301227650001801240653001201258653001401270653001901284653001401303773008001317852000901397856009201406939003301498945000801531946001301539990002301552655001201575991608355200742620221120083111.0800523e197908  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800007842DNAL7 a10.1097/00003727-197908000-000032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWooddell, W.

The liver metabolizes alcohol primarily through the alcohol dehydrogenase pathway or the microsomal ethanol oxidation system (MEOS). The MEOS is of more significance in chronic alcoholism, is partially responsible for alcohol tolerance and alters the metabolism of other drugs. The three main stages of alcoholic liver disease are: 1) the presence of fatty liver or steatosis, which can result from drinking from 120 to 270 cc. of alcohol a day for two days; 2) the development of alcoholic hepatitis, which can be diagnosed through a liver biopsy; and 3) the progression into alcoholic cirrhosis, defined as scar formation (fibrosis) within the liver with loss of normal structure. Known cause-and-effect relationships and diagnostic methods are described. Rehabilitation and education are most important parameters of treatment. 3afatty liver 3ametabolism 3ahepatitis 3atoxicity 3aalcohol abuse 0aAddicts 0acirrhosis 0aliver diseases 0atreatment0 tFamily & community health.g1979 Aug., v. 2, no. 2 p.13-22x0160-63797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00003727-197908000-000033Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19800523c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03514naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002800186245012100214300001600335520169400351650002302045650003502068650001202103650002402115650000902139650002102148650003302169650002702202650002702229650004602256650003802302650004102340653002502381653002902406653002402435653002002459700002102479700002502500700002902525700001802554700002302572700001902595700002502614700002102639700002502660773013702685852000902822856008502831930003302916946001102949655001202960IND4442066020221120082948.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444206602DNAL7 a208030582pmid7 aPMC38052522pmcid7 a10.1007/s10974-010-9228-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJagatheesan, Ganapathy 10aStriated muscle tropomyosin isoforms differentially regulate cardiac performance and myofilament calcium sensitivity  ap. 227-239.  aTropomyosin (TM) plays a central role in calcium mediated striated muscle contraction. There are three muscle TM isoforms: α-TM, β-TM, and γ-TM. α-TM is the predominant cardiac and skeletal muscle isoform. β-TM is expressed in skeletal and embryonic cardiac muscle. γ-TM is expressed in slow-twitch musculature, but is not found in the heart. Our previous work established that muscle TM isoforms confer different physiological properties to the cardiac sarcomere. To determine whether one of these isoforms is dominant in dictating its functional properties, we generated single and double transgenic mice expressing β-TM and/or γ-TM in the heart, in addition to the endogenously expressed α-TM. Results show significant TM protein expression in the βγ-DTG hearts: α-TM: 36%, β-TM: 32%, and γ-TM: 32%. These βγ-DTG mice do not develop pathological abnormalities; however, they exhibit a hyper contractile phenotype with decreased myofilament calcium sensitivity, similar to γ-TM transgenic hearts. Biophysical studies indicate that γ-TM is more rigid than either α-TM or β-TM. This is the first report showing that with approximately equivalent levels of expression within the same tissue, there is a functional dominance of γ-TM over α-TM or β-TM in regulating physiological performance of the striated muscle sarcomere. In addition to the effect expression of γ-TM has on Ca²⁺ activation of the cardiac myofilaments, our data demonstrates an effect on cooperative activation of the thin filament by strongly bound rigor cross-bridges. This is significant in relation to current ideas on the control mechanism of the steep relation between Ca²⁺ and tension. 3amuscle contraction 2aActin Cytoskeletonxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aMuscle, Striatedxmetabolism 2aMyocardial Contraction 2aMyocardiumxmetabolism 2aProtein Isoformsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aSarcomeresxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTropomyosinxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0aTropomyosin isoforms 0aThin filament regulation 0aCalcium sensitivity 0aTransgenic mice1 aRajan, Sudarsan 1 aAhmed, Rafeeq P.

Five kinds of land cover, namely urban woods, lawn, bare concrete cover, water areas and wetlands were selected to study on the temperature, humidity and human comfort. The air temperature and relative humidity were measured once every two hours from 8:00 to 20:00 every day and continuously three days in July 2010. The results showed that the microclimate of these five kinds of land cover had signiﬁcant differences during the day. In general, the air temperature of these five types of land cover complied with the order during the middle of the day: bare concrete cover > wetlands > lawn > water areas > woods, with reversed order in the late afternoon when the air temperature of the lawn became the lowest. Compared with the bare concrete cover, the other four types of land cover can decrease temperature 1.0-3.5°C at noon. Finally, the human thermal comfort of the five kinds of land cover was assessed with the discontent index (DI). The DI in five kinds of land cover was the highest at 14:00, and the lowest at 8:00. The woods had the lowest DI while the bare concrete cover had the highest one at 14:00, and the lawn cover had the lowest DI while the wetlands had the highest one at 20:00. 3aair temperature 3acities 3adiurnal variation 3aforestry 3ahumans 3aland cover 3alawns and turf 3amicroclimate 3amonitoring 3aparks 3arelative humidity 3asummer 3awetlands 3aChina1 aHao, P.Y.1 aDong, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 June, , no. 999 p.193-197dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/999/999_26.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03077naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007700125500014900202500002400351520193900375650001602314650002402330650004002354650002002394651002502414700001702439700001402456700001502470700001502485700001402500700001802514773011202532852000902644856008602653655001202739IND4465092420221120054520.0130304s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeitel, M.14aThe effect of gutters and roof vents on light in a multi-span greenhouse  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Light in Horticultural Systems, held October 14-18, 2012, Wageningen, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aTo effectively ventilate large, multi-span gutter connected greenhouses, in the Mediterranean region, it is usually required to use both side and roof vents. Since the roof vents and gutters are constructed of opaque structural elements and since the vents are generally covered with insect-proof screens, they may partially block the penetration of solar radiation into the house. The present work characterizes the disturbance induced by the vents and gutters to the level and distribution of light reaching the plants. Experiments were carried out in a typical multi-span greenhouse with roof vents on which insect-proof screens were installed. To measure the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) above the plants a sensor was placed on a cart that moved along a horizontal beam positioned 2.6 m above ground level inside the greenhouse; a motorized system moved the trolley continuously across more than one greenhouse span back and forth throughout the day. Two additional sensors were used as reference: one was located inside the greenhouse, just below the plastic cover at the greenhouse ridge, to compensate for the effect of the cover type and accumulated dust on the cover, and the other was located outside the greenhouse to measure ambient PAR levels. The mean daily PAR level immediately below the greenhouse cover was 64% of the level outside the greenhouse. Above the crop the mean daily PAR level over one greenhouse span (including regions that were shaded by the gutters and vents) further decreased and was only 47% of the outside level. Results show that the structural elements of the roof vents significantly affect light distribution. At midday the light level in the region below the roof vents may drop by nearly 27% in comparison to the level measured at the centerline of the greenhouse span. Thus, although roof vents improve natural ventilation they may deteriorate light level and its distribution. 3agreenhouses 3anatural ventilation 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3asolar radiation 3aMediterranean region1 aDeriugin, M.1 aBarak, M.1 aAntler, A.1 aGahali, Y.1 aTanny, J.1 aHaslavsky, V.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 956dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/956/956_53.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02036naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002200138245008800160300001800248520097200266650001501238650000901253650001901262650001301281650001601294650002201310700002101332700002801353700001301381700001701394773014201411852000901553856007801562930003301640946001301673655001201686IND4426577420221120054442.0090925e20091015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442657742DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.235852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonuru, Venkat R.10aDeep-red emissive conjugated poly(2,6-BODIPY-ethynylene)s bearing alkyl side chains  ap. 5354-5366.  aNovel deep-red emissive poly(2,6-BODIPY-ethynylene)s bearing dodecyl side chains (polymers A, B, and C) have been prepared by palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira polymerization of 2,6-diiodo-functionalized BODIPY monomers with 2,6-diethynyl-functionalized BODIPY monomers. These polymers emit in the deep-red region with emission maxima at up to 690 nm, and exhibit significant red shifts (up to 166 and 179 nm) of both absorption and emission maxima compared with their parent BODIPY dyes due to significant extension of π-conjugation. These polymers possess good thermal stability with decomposition temperature between 270 and 360 °C. The polymers exhibit a little larger Stokes shifts and shorter lifetime than their corresponding BODIPY dyes.

Their copolymers can find extensive applications in biomedical materials. However, it is very difficult to synthesize starch-graft-PPDO copolymers in common organic solvents with very good solubility. In this article, well-defined polysaccharides-graft-poly(p-dioxanone) (SAn-PPDO) copolymers were successfully synthesized via the ring-opening polymerization of p-dioxanone (PDO) with an acetylated starch (SA) initiator and a Sn(Oct)₂ catalyst in bulk. The copolymers were characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ¹H NMR, gel permeation chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis (TG), differential scanning calorimetry, and wide angle x-ray diffraction. The in vitro degradation results showed that the introduction of SA segments into the backbone chains of the copolymers led to an enhancement of the degradation rate, and the degradation rate of SAn-PPDO increased with the increase of SA wt %. Microspheres with an average volume diameter of 20 μm, which will have potential applications in controlled release of drugs, were successfully prepared by using these new copolymers. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiodegradability 3abiomedical materials 3acatalysts 3acomposite polymers 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3agel chromatography 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3asolubility 3asolvents 3astarch 3athermogravimetry 3atin1 aWang, Xiu-Li1 aChen, Si-Chong1 aYang, Ke-Ke1 aWang, Yu-Zhong0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 Oct. 15, v. 47, no. 20 p.5344-5353dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.235843Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02285naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002900138245015000167300001800317520118600335650002301521650001901544650001901563650001701582650001701599700001801616700001901634700003101653773014201684852000901826856007801835930003301913946001301946655001201959IND4426577520221120054557.0090925e20091015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442657752DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.235862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsteves, Ana Catarina C.10aPreparation of nanocomposites by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization from the surface of quantum dots in miniemulsion  ap. 5367-5377.  aHerein, we report the synthesis of quantum dots (QDs)/polymer nanocomposites by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in miniemulsions using a grafting from approach. First, the surfaces of CdS and CdSe QDs were functionalized using a chain transfer agent, a trisalkylphosphine oxide incorporating 4-cyano-4-(thiobenzoylsulfanyl)pentanoic acid moieties. Using a free radical initiator (AIBN) to activate the RAFT process, a polystyrene (PS) block was grafted from the surface of the QDs. Quantum confinement effects were identified for the nanocomposite obtained, so attesting to the integrity of the QDs after the polymerization. Free PS chains were also present in the final nanocomposite, indicating that the RAFT polymerization from the surface of the QDs was accompanied by conventional free radical polymerization. After isolating the nanocomposite particles, a second poly(n-butyl acrylate) block was tentatively grown from the initial PS block. The first results indicated a successful polymerization of the second polymer and show the potential of the current strategy to prepare block copolymers from the surface of the RAFT-modified QDs. 3acomposite polymers 3ananocomposites 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3aquantum dots1 aHodge, Philip1 aTrindade, Tito1 aBarros-Timmons, Ana M.M.V.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 Oct. 15, v. 47, no. 20 p.5367-5377dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.235863Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02170naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002100138245012300159300001800282520102300300650001001323650002101333650002101354650001701375650001301392650001401405650001301419650001301432650001601445650002201461700001701483700002101500773014201521852000901663856007801672930003301750946001301783655001201796IND4426577620221120054522.0090925e20091015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442657762DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.235872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiou, Guey-Sheng10aNear-infrared electrochromic poly(aryl ether)s based on isolated electroactive tetraphenyl-p-phenylenediamine moieties  ap. 5378-5385.  aA series of near-infrared (NIR) electrochromic aromatic poly(aryl ether)s containing N,N,N',N'-tetraphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (TPPA) moieties in the backbone were prepared from the high-temperature polycondensation reactions of a biphenol monomer, 2,5-bis(diphenylamino)hydroquinone, with difluoro compounds. The obtained polymers were readily soluble in many organic solvents and showed useful levels of thermal stability associated with high glass-transition temperatures (182-205 °C) and high char yields (higher than 40% at 800 °C in nitrogen). The polymer films showed reversible electrochemical oxidation with high contrast ratio both in the visible range and NIR region, and also exhibited high coloration efficiency (CE), low switching time, and stability for electrochromic operation. The polyether TPPA-a thin film revealed good CE in visible (CE = 217 cm²/C) and NIR (CE = 192 cm²/C) region with reversible electroactive stability (over 500 times within 5% loss relative to its initial injected charge). 3acolor 3aelectrochemistry 3aglass transition 3ahydroquinone 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aYen, Hung-Ju1 aChiang, Ming-Che0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 Oct. 15, v. 47, no. 20 p.5378-5385dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.235873Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02102naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009500126300001600221500014900237500002400386520081000410650001901220650000901239650001901248650001401267650001001281650002101291650001301312650001501325650001201340650001401352650001201366650001801378700001601396700001501412700001301427700001701440773014001457852000901597856008601606655001201692IND4465091620221120054603.0130304s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorbuly, J.10aEvaluation of frost resistance of traditional and newly bred Hungarian win-grape cultivars  ap. 337-341.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Grapevine Growing, Commerce and Research, held June 30 - July 2, 2003, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aThe frost hardiness of 102 traditional and newly bred Hungarian Vitis vinifera and interspecific cultivars were tested using artificial frost treatments in climatic chambers.

We have shown previously that pollen tube orientation is regulated by cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]c). In this paper, we studied the activity of a Ca2+ -dependent protein kinase during reorientation. The kinase activity was assayed in living cells by using confocal ratio imaging of BODIPY FL bisindolylmaleimide. We found that growing pollen tubes exhibited higher protein kinase activity in the apical region, whereas nongrowing cells showed uniform distribution. Modification of growth direction by diffusion of inhibitors/activators from a micropipette showed the spatial redistribution of kinase activity to predict the new growth orientation. Localized increases in [Ca2+]c induced by photolysis of caged Ca2+ that led to reorientation also increased kinase activity. Molecular and immunological assays suggest that this kinase may show some functional homology with protein kinase C. We suggest that the tip-localized gradient of kinase activity promotes Ca2+ -mediated exocytosis and may act to regulate Ca2+ channel activity. 3aAgapanthus africanus 3aenzyme activity 3apollen tubes 3acytochemistry 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorescence 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 0aorientation 0agrowth 0abisindolylmaleimide1 aTrewavas, A.J.1 aMalho, R.0 tPlant cell.g1998 Sept., v. 10, no. 9 p.1499-1509x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03121naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245017500166300001800341500001500359520087000374650002501244650002401269650002201293650001601315650002301331650002101354650003601375650002101411650002501432650001001457650001201467650002301479650004401502650002801546650002801574650001901602650002401621650004101645650001801686650002501704650001701729650003301746650002801779650002101807650001301828650002901841650004401870650003301914650003101947650003701978650003402015653002802049653001402077653002102091653002802112653001302140653002502153700001302178700001502191700001402206700001602220773007102236852000902307930003302316945001302349946001302362655001202375IND2196951020221120042038.0990211e199809  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219695102DNAL7 a97246912pmid7 aPMC1440762pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, R.F.12aA mutation within the leucine-rich repeat domain of the Arabidopsis disease resistance gene RPS5 partially suppresses multiple bacterial and downy mildew resistance genes  ap. 1439-1442.  a2019-12-05  aRecognition of pathogens by plants is mediated by several distinct families of functionally variable but structurally related disease resistance (R) genes. The largest family is defined by the presence of a putative nucleotide binding domain and 12 to 21 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The function of these LRRs has not been defined, but they are speculated to bind pathogen-derived ligands. We have isolated a mutation in the Arabidopsis RPS5 gene that indicates that the LRR region may interact with other plant proteins. The rps5-1 mutation causes a glutamate-to-lysine substitution in the third LRR and partially compromises the function of several R genes that confer bacterial and downy mildew resistance. The third LRR is relatively well conserved, and we speculate that it may interact with a signal transduction component shared by multiple R gene pathways. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aopen reading frames 3atransgenic plants 3amutagenesis 3adefense mechanisms 3agene interaction 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3amutants 3adisease resistance 3aPhytophthora nicotianae var. parasitica 3agenetic complementation 3ahypersensitive response 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aMutation 2aOomycetesxpathogenicity 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPseudomonasxpathogenicity 2aRepetitive Sequences, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0amolecular sequence data 0arps5 gene 0agenbank/af074916 0aexperimental infections 0asymptoms 0anucleotide sequences1 aHenk, A.1 aMowery, P.1 aHolub, E.1 aInnes, R.W.0 tPlant cell.g1998 Sept., v. 10, no. 9 p.1439-1442x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02734naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009800128300001800226500001500244520117600259650001401435650001001449650002001459650001501479650002101494650002801515650002901543650002501572650002301597650001501620650001601635650001701651650001301668650002301681650002101704650001801725650002201743650001201765650001501777650001801792650001201810653001301822653001001835653001501845653003001860653001401890653001401904653001701918653002301935700001901958700001701977773007001994852000902064930003302073945001302106946001302119655001202132IND2196834220221120041950.0990204e199808  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219683422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhijn, P. van10aLotus corniculatus nodulation specificity is changed by the presence of a soybean lectin gene  ap. 1233-1249.  a2019-12-05  aPlant lectins have been implicated as playing an important role in mediating recognition and specificity in the Rhizobium-legume nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. To test this hypothesis, we introduced the soybean lectin gene Le1 either behind its own promoter or behind the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter into Lotus corniculatus, which is nodulated by R. loti. We found that nodulelike outgrowths developed on transgenic L. corniculatus plant roots in response to Bradyrhizobium japonicum, which nodulates soybean and not Lotus spp. Soybean lectin was properly targeted to L. corniculatus root hairs, and although infection threads formed, they aborted in epidermal or hypodermal cells. Mutation of the lectin sugar binding site abolished infection thread formation and nodulation. Incubation of bradyrhizobia in the nodulation (nod) gene-inducing flavonoid genistein increased the number of nodulelike outgrowths on transgenic L. corniculatus roots. Studies of bacterial mutants, however, suggest that a component of the exopolysaccharide surface of B. japonicum, rather than Nod factor, is required for extension of host range to the transgenic L. corniculatus plants. 3agenistein 3agenes 3apolysaccharides 3anodulation 3apromoter regions 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3acell wall components 3aLotus corniculatus 3ahost range 3aGlycine max 3aroot nodules 3amutation 3aMesorhizobium loti 3aoligosaccharides 3agene transfer 3atransgenic plants 3alectins 3aroot hairs 3abinding sites 3amutants 0ale1 gene 0aroots 0anod factor 0alipochitooligosaccharides 0aepidermis 0aRhizobium 0acolonization 0aexopolysaccharides1 aGoldberg, R.B.1 aHirsch, A.M.0 tPlant cell.g1998 Aug., v. 10, no. 8 p.1233-1249x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03481naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245015500168300001800323500001500341520107200356650001801428650001201446650002301458650000901481650002401490650001001514650002201524650003701546650002501583650002001608650001001628650002501638650001201663650003301675650002801708650002001736650002501756650004301781650002401824650001201848650001801860650002301878650001601901650003501917650001701952650002301969650003001992650003602022650005102058650002802109650002802137650002802165650003302193650003402226650002602260650002702286653001602313653002802329653002102357653001602378653002102394653002502415700001502440700001702455700001802472700001402490700002102504773007002525852000902595930003302604945001302637946001302650655001202663IND2196835020221120041920.0990204e199808  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219683502DNAL7 a97075312pmid7 aPMC1443782pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilligan, S.B.14aThe root knot nematode resistance gene Mi from tomato is a member of the leucine zipper, nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat family of plant genes  ap. 1307-1319.  a2019-12-05  aThe Mi locus of tomato confers resistance to root knot nematodes. Tomato DNA spanning the locus was isolated as bacterial artificial chromosome clones, and 52 kb of contiguous DNA was sequenced. Three open reading frames were identified with similarity to cloned plant disease resistance genes. Two of them, Mi-1.1 and Mi-1.2, appear to be intact genes; the third is a pseudogene. A 4-kb mRNA hybridizing with these genes is present in tomato roots. Complementation studies using cloned copies of Mi-1.1 and Mi-1.2 indicated that Mi-1.2, but not Mi-1.1, is sufficient to confer resistance to a susceptible tomato line with the progeny of transformants segregating for resistance. The cloned gene most similar to Mi-1.2 is Prf, a tomato gene required for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. Prf and Mi-1.2 share several structural motifs, including a nucleotide binding site and a leucine-rich repeat region, that are characteristic of a family of plant proteins, including several that are required for resistance against viruses, bacteria, fungi, and now, nematodes. 3amessenger RNA 3aleucine 3agenetic resistance 3aloci 3aopen reading frames 3aroots 3atransgenic plants 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3agenes 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aprogeny 3ayeast artificial chromosomes 3agenetic complementation 3apest resistance 3aMeloidogyne javanica 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aLeucinexchemistry 2aLeucine Zippersxgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgenetics. 2aMicrophthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNematodaxpathogenicity 2aNucleotidesxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription Factors 2aTranscription, Genetic 0asegregation 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af039682 0achromosomes 0agenbank/af039631 0anucleotide sequences1 aBodeau, J.1 aYaghoobi, J.1 aKaloshian, I.1 aZabel, P.1 aWilliamson, V.M.0 tPlant cell.g1998 Aug., v. 10, no. 8 p.1307-1319x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02652naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010300124300001600227500014900243500002400392520135000416650000801766650001901774650001401793650001501807650002701822650003901849650001601888650001501904700001501919700001301934700001401947700001501961700001401976700001501990700001402005773014002019852000902159856008602168655001202254IND4465094820221120033921.0130304s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeres, A.10aCharacterization of grapevine cultivars autochthonous in the carpathian basin with microsatellites  ap. 467-470.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Grapevine Growing, Commerce and Research, held June 30 - July 2, 2003, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aThe Hungarian grapevine gene bank has been established in the Research Institute for Viticulture and Enology, Pécs. Since this institute has joined the GENRES CT96 No 81 EU project, our aim was to make the microsatellite fingerprinting of the ancient grapevine cultivars grown for centuries in the Carpathian Basin in collaboration with this institiute. We reported earlier that we had started testing and characterizing 96 cultivars maintained in the gene bank with microsatellite primers. After preliminary tests carried out with 5 varieties and 19 microsatellite primer pairs 6 were selected for comparison of the 96 varieties. Three of the primer pairs (VVMD5, VVMD36, VrZag79) are recommended by the GENRES CT96 No. 81 EU Project for identification and differentiation of the European grapevine cultivars or varieties. The other three (VVMD21, VrZag64, scu10vv) were applied based on the positive results of the preliminary examinations. Allele number varied between 3-6 in the analyses of 96 varieties, and the results provided possibility to differentiate the varieties based on their individual SSR pattern and allele sizes. In this paper we show results obtained on 5 ٪ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and allele sizes determined by ALFexpress DNA fragment analyser (Pharmacia) using CY-labelled VrZag64 and scu10 SSR primer pairs. 3aDNA 3aEuropean Union 3acultivars 3agene banks 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aviticulture 3awinemaking1 aBalogh, A.1 aKiss, E.1 aSzoke, A.1 aHeszky, L.1 aKozma, P.1 aKocsis, M.1 aGalli, Z.0 tActa horticulturae.g2004 July, , no. 652 p.467-470dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/652/652_62.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03502naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245013000168300001800298500001500316520158900331650002701920650002501947650001801972650002001990650001202010650003002022650001202052650001702064650001202081650001802093650007502111650002902186650003102215650001202246650002802258650003102286650003002317650002702347650005102374650005502425650006002480650002202540650002702562653002402589653004302613653001502656653001602671653001202687653001402699653000802713700001702721773007002738852000902808930003302817945001302850946001302863655001202876IND2196761220221120033735.0990201e199807  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219676122DNAL7 a96681372pmid7 aPMC1440492pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolloway, S.P.10aProcessing of a composite large subunit rRNA: studies with Chlamydomonas mutants deficient in maturation of the 23S-like rRNA  ap. 1193-1206.  a2019-12-05  aMaturation of the chloroplast 23S-like rRNA involves the removal of internal transcribed spacers (ITSs) and, in the case of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the splicing of a group I intron (Cr.LSU). Little is known of the cis and trans requirements or of the processing pathway for this essential RNA. Previous work showed that the ribosome-deficient ac20 mutant overaccumulates an unspliced large subunit (LSU) RNA, suggesting that it might be a splicing mutant. To elucidate the molecular basis of the ac20 phenotype, a detailed analysis of the rrn transcripts in ac20 and wild-type cells was performed. The results indicate that processing of the ITSs, particularly ITS-1, is inefficient in ac20 and that ITS processing occurs after splicing. Deletion of the Cr.LSU intron from ac20 also did not alleviate the mutant phenotype. Thus, the primary defect in ac20 is not splicing but most likely is associated with ITS processing. A splicing deficiency was studied by transforming wild-type cells with rrnL genes containing point mutations in the intron core. Heteroplasmic transformants were obtained in most cases, except for P4 helix mutants; these strains grew slowly, were light sensitive, and had an RNA profile indicative of inefficient splicing. Transcript analysis in the P4 mutants also indicated that ITS processing can occur on an unspliced precursor, although with reduced efficiency. These latter results indicate that although there is not an absolutely required order for LSU processing, there does seem to be a preferred order that results in efficient processing in vivo. 3agenetic transformation 3aalternative splicing 3aribosomal RNA 3agene expression 3amutants 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aintrons 3achloroplasts 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aDNA, Ribosomalxmetabolism 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aOligonucleotide Probes 2aRNA, Plantxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRNA, Ribosomalxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 23Sxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSequence Deletion 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aorganelle mutations 0ainternal transcribed spacer processing 0aprecursors 0atranscripts 0aremoval 0adeletions 0aRNA1 aHerrin, D.L.0 tPlant cell.g1998 July, v. 10, no. 7 p.1193-1206x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03576naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245007500144300001600219500006800235500001500303520136800318650002801686650002101714650001401735650002101749650002201770650002101792650002701813650002801840650001201868650003701880650008201917650002601999650002302025650008502048650005102133650002502184650002102209650001802230650001102248650001302259650007802272650003702350650002102387650001302408650001402421650003202435650002702467650002502494653001402519653001102533653001002544700001902554700001602573700001602589700001802605700002102623700001602644700001802660700001902678773008902697852000902786930003302795945001302828946001302841655001202854IND2331125420221117180825.0030303e20021004dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233112542DNAL7 a123647962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanson, H.10aEvolution of supergene families associated with insecticide resistance  ap. 179-181.  aIn the special section: The mosquito genome: Anopheles gambiae.  a2019-12-05  aThe emergence of insecticide resistance in the mosquito poses a serious threat to the efficacy of many malaria control programs. We have searched the Anopheles gambiae genome for members of the three major enzyme families-the carboxylesterases, glutathione transferases, and cytochrome P450s-that are primarily responsible for metabolic resistance to insecticides. A comparative genomic analysis with Drosophila melanogaster reveals that a considerable expansion of these supergene families has occurred in the mosquito. Low gene orthology and little chromosomal synteny paradoxically contrast the easily identified orthologous groups of genes presumably seeded by common ancestors. In A. gambiae, the independent expansion of paralogous genes is mainly a consequence of the formation of clusters among locally duplicated genes. These expansions may reflect the functional diversification of supergene families consistent with major differences in the life history and ecology of these organisms. These data provide a basis for identifying the resistance-associated enzymes within these families. This will enable the resistance status of mosquitoes, flies, and possibly other holometabolous insects to be monitored. The analyses also provide the means for identifying previously unknown molecules involved in fundamental biological processes such as development. 3aglutathione transferase 3acarboxylesterase 3aphylogeny 3acytochrome P-450 3aAnopheles gambiae 3amultigene family 3ainsecticide resistance 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aComputational Biology 2aConserved Sequence 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Duplicate 2aGenes, Insect 2aGenome 2aGenomics 2aGlutathione Transferasexchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsecticide Resistancexgenetics 2aMultigene Family 2aMutation 2aPhylogeny 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTerminology as Topic 0aevolution 0agenome 0agenes1 aClaudianos, C.1 aOrtelli, F.1 aAbgrall, C.1 aHemingway, J.1 aSharakhova, M.V.1 aUnger, M.F.1 aCollins, F.H.1 aFeyereisen, R.0 tScience.g2002 Oct. 4, v. 298, no. 5591 p.179-181aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03715naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245017000162300001600332500001500348520137600363650000901739650002001748650002201768650002001790650002501810650001301835650001901848650002501867650002501892650001801917650002401935650001101959650002401970650001201994650001802006650004702024650001802071650001102089650002302100650002302123650002002146650002302166650003902189650006302228650004002291650002002331650002802351650004402379650001902423650002502442650007002467650002302537650003402560653001702594653003602611653002802647653001902675653001202694700001602706700001602722700001302738700001802751700001502769700001402784773006702798852000902865930003302874945001302907946001302920655001202933IND2196092120221117180811.0981219e199805  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219609212DNAL7 a95966432pmid7 aPMC1443772pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, N.10aMolecular characterization of the PEND protein, a novel bZIP protein present in the envelope membrane that is the site of nucleoid replication in developing plastids  ap. 859-872.  a2019-12-05  aPlastid nucleoids are known to bind to the envelope membrane in developing chloroplasts. Here, plastid DNA is extensively replicated. We previously detected a DNA binding protein in the inner envelope membranes of developing plastids in pea and named it PEND (for plastid envelope DNA binding) protein. In this study, we report on the structure and molecular characterization of a cDNA for the PEND protein. As a result of screening cDNA libraries in lambdagt11 with one of the target sequences of the PEND protein as a probe, we obtained a clone (PD2) for a novel DNA binding protein consisting of 633 amino acid residues. Analysis of the N-terminal sequence of the purified PEND protein indicated that the transit peptide is just 16 residues long. The PEND protein was detected specifically in the plastid envelope membrane of young unopened leaf buds by immunoblot analysis. The PEND protein consists of a basic region plus zipper region, an unprecedented sextuple repeat region, and a putative membrane-spanning region. The basic region with a zipper region seems to have diverged from that of other plant transcription factors. In addition, the PEND protein could be a distant homolog of the trans-Golgi network integral membrane proteins. The PEND protein is therefore a novel type of DNA binding protein that binds to the membrane as an intrinsic membrane protein. 3abuds 3aDNA replication 3acomplementary DNA 3achloroplast DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3aplastids 3acell membranes 3aDNA-binding proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aPisum sativum 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aleaves 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBasic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors 2aBinding Sites 2aCattle 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA Replication 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aIntracellular Membranesxmetabolism 2aLeucine Zippers 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeasxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteins 2aPlastidsxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0apurification 0aplastid inner envelope membrane 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x98740 0abinding1 aOhshima, K.1 aWatnabe, A.1 aOhta, N.1 aNishiyama, Y.1 aJoyard, J.1 aDouce, R.0 tPlant cell.g1998 May, v. 10, no. 5 p.859-872x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02128naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245011500133300001600248500001500264520107500279650001801354650001401372650001301386650001501399650002201414650002401436650002601460653001501486653001501501653001301516700001601529700001501545700001701560700001801577773006701595852000901662930003301671945001301704946001301717655001201730IND2196091820221117180802.0981219e199805  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219609182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHara-Nishimura, I.10aTransport of storage proteins to protein storage vacuoles is mediated by large precursor-accumulating vesicles  ap. 825-836.  a2019-12-05  aNovel vesicles that accumulate large amounts of proprotein precursors of storage proteins were purified from maturing pumpkin seeds. These vesicles were designated precursor-accumulating (PAC) vesicles and had diameters of 200 to 400 nm. They contained an electron-dense core of storage proteins surrounded by an electron-translucent layer, and some vesicles also contained small vesicle-like structures. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed numerous electron-dense aggregates of storage proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. It is likely that these aggregates develop into the electron-dense cores of the PAC vesicles and then leave the endoplasmic reticulum. Immunocytochemical analysis also showed that complex glycans are associated with the peripheral region of PAC vesicles but not the electron-dense cores, indicating that Golgi-derived glycoproteins are incorporated into the PAC vesicles. These results suggest that the unique PAC vesicles might mediate a transport pathway for insoluble aggregates of storage proteins directly to protein storage vacuoles. 3aglycoproteins 3aCucurbita 3avacuoles 3acotyledons 3aprotein transport 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aendoplasmic reticulum 0aorganelles 0aprecursors 0avesicles1 aShimada, T.1 aHatano, K.1 aTakeuchi, Y.1 aNishimura, M.0 tPlant cell.g1998 May, v. 10, no. 5 p.825-836x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03633naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245009400166300001600260500001500276520146500291650001501756650002101771650001001792650002001802650001101822650001801833650001701851650003701868650002901905650001501934650001101949650002001960650002401980650001902004650003402023650001302057650002202070650002202092650001902114650003602133650001702169650002302186650002002209650001202229650001702241650001602258650002502274650004602299650006102345650002602406650002202432650003402454650003402488650003002522650002402552650002002576653003702596653001402633653001502647653004002662700002002702700001802722773006702740852000902807930003302816945001302849946001302862655001202875IND2196091220221117162328.0981219e199805  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219609122DNAL7 a95966342pmid7 aPMC1440262pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, D.E.10aRegulation of cell-specific inositol metabolism and transport in plant salinity tolerance  ap. 753-764.  a2019-12-05  amyo-Inositol and its derivatives are commonly studied with respect to cell signaling and membrane biogenesis, but they also participate in responses to salinity in animals and plants. In this study, we focused on L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase (INPS), which commits carbon to de novo synthesis, and myo-inositol O-methyltransferase (IMT), which uses myo-inositol for stress-induced accumulation of a methylinositol, D-ononitol. The Imt and Inps promoters are transcriptionally controlled. We determined that the transcription rates, transcript levels, and protein abundance are correlated. During normal growth, INPS is present in all cells, but IMT is repressed. After salinity stress, the amount of INPS was enhanced in leaves but repressed in roots. IMT was induced in all cell types. The absence of myo-inositol synthesis in roots is compensated by inositol/ononitol transport in the phloem. The mobilization of photosynthate through myo-inositol translocation links root metabolism to photosynthesis. Our model integrates the transcriptional control of a specialized metabolic pathway with physiological reactions in different tissues. The tissue-specific differential regulation of INPS, which leads to a gradient of myo-inositol synthesis, supports root growth and sodium uptake. By inducing expression of IMT and increasing myo-inositol synthesis, metabolic end products accumulate, facilitating sodium sequestration and protecting photosynthesis. 3aluciferase 3apromoter regions 3aroots 3agene expression 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3amyo-inositol 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3atranscription (genetics) 3aisomerases 3aphloem 3asodium chloride 3aimmunocytochemistry 3asalt tolerance 3aMesembryanthemum crystallinum 3asalinity 3atransgenic plants 3adiurnal variation 3areporter genes 3achemical constituents of plants 3atransferases 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aAcclimatization 2aAnimals 2aGenes, Plant 2aHomeostasis 2aInositolxmetabolism 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMyo-Inositol-1-Phosphate Synthasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPlant Development 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSignal Transduction 2aSodium Chloride 0amyo-inositol o-methyltransferase 0acyclitols 0ad-ononitol 0al-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase1 aRammesmayer, G.1 aBohnert, H.J.0 tPlant cell.g1998 May, v. 10, no. 5 p.753-764x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03883naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002200149245013000171300001600301500001500317520145100332650002001783650002001803650001401823650002101837650001001858650001801868650001401886650001001900650002001910650001601930650001101946650002501957650002601982650002902008650001902037650003802056650001202094650001902106650002302125650005802148650002502206650001802231650004702249650001802296650002902314650003902343650005702382650002002439650001002459650003102469650003302500650003102533650003002564650004402594650003902638650004602677653002902723653001502752653001002767653001602777653002302793653002402816653001202840653001002852700001402862700001502876700001502891700001202906773006702918852000902985930003302994945001303027946001303040655001203053IND2196090620221117162351.0981219e199805  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219609062DNAL7 a95966292pmid7 aPMC1440282pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChattopadhyay, S.10aArabidopsis bZIP protein HY5 directly interacts with light-responsive promoters in mediating light control of gene expression  ap. 673-683.  a2019-12-05  aThe Arabidopsis HY5 gene has been defined genetically as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis and recently has been shown to encode a basic leucine zipper type of transcription factor. Here, we report that HY5 is constitutively nuclear localized and is involved in light regulation of transcriptional activity of the promoters containing the G-box, a well-characterized light-responsive element (LRE). In vitro DNA binding studies suggested that HY5 can bind specifically to the G-box DNA sequences but not to any of the other LREs present in the light-responsive promoters examined. High-irradiance light activation of two synthetic promoters containing either the consensus G-box alone or the G-box combined with the GATA motif (another LRE) and the native Arabidopsis ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit gene RBCS-1A promoter, which has an essential copy of the G-box, was significantly compromised in the hy5 mutant. The hy5 mutation's effect on the high-irradiance light activation of gene expression was observed in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues. Furthermore, the characteristic phytochrome-mediated red light- and far-red light-reversible low-fluence induction of the G-box-containing promoters was diminished specifically in hy5 plants. These results suggest that HY5 may interact directly with the G-box in the promoters of light-inducible genes to mediate light-controlled transcriptional activity. 3arecombinant DNA 3alight intensity 3ared light 3apromoter regions 3aroots 3afar-red light 3aphenotype 3astems 3agene expression 3aphytochrome 3aleaves 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3atranscription (genetics) 3ahistochemistry 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3amutants 3areporter genes 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aBasic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aLeucine Zippers 2aLight 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNuclear Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aTranscription, Geneticxradiation effects 0alight responsive element 0agata motif 0ag-box 0aArabidopsis 0agenetic regulation 0asynthetic promoters 0abinding 0alight1 aAng, L.H.1 aPuente, P.1 aDeng, X.W.1 aWei, N.0 tPlant cell.g1998 May, v. 10, no. 5 p.673-683x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02439naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012300128300001600251500001500267520105900282650001601341650001201357650002001369650001401389650001901403650002101422650001301443650002701456650001901483650001801502650002001520650002401540650001601564650002501580653001101605653002201616653003001638653002801668653001601696653003201712653002101744700001701765700001601782773006701798852000901865930003301874945001301907946001301920655001201933IND2196090720221117162341.0981219e199805  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219609072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwanson, S.J.10aBarley aleurone cells contain two types of vacuoles: characterization of lytic organelles by use of fluorescent probes  ap. 685-698.  a2019-12-05  aLight microscopy was used to study the structure and function of vacuoles in living protoplasts of barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Himalaya) aleurone. Light microscopy showed that aleurone protoplasts contain two distinct types of vacuole: the protein storage vacuole and a lysosome-like organelle, which we have called the secondary vacuole. Fluorescence microscopy using pH-sensitive fluorescent probes and a fluorogenic substrate for cysteine proteases showed that both protein storage vacuoles and secondary vacuoles are acidic, lytic organelles. Ratio imaging showed that the pH of secondary vacuoles was lower in aleurone protoplasts incubated in gibberellic acid than in those incubated in abscisic acid. Uptake of fluorescent probes into intact, isolated protein storage vacuoles and secondary vacuoles required ATP and occurred via at least two types of vanadate-sensitive, ATP-dependent tonoplast transporters. One transporter catalyzed the accumulation of glutathione-conjugated probes, and another transported probes not conjugated to glutathione. 3aprotoplasts 3aacidity 3aHordeum vulgare 3atonoplast 3aplant proteins 3aactive transport 3avacuoles 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaleurone cells 3acytochemistry 3aenzyme activity 3aimmunocytochemistry 3afluorescein 3acysteine proteinases 0auptake 0asecondary vacuole 0aatp dependent transporter 0aprotein storage vacuole 0aderivatives 0atonoplast intrinsic protein 0afluorescent dyes1 aBethke, P.C.1 aJones, R.L.0 tPlant cell.g1998 May, v. 10, no. 5 p.685-698x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02673naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245010000121300001800221500002200239520138500261650001601646650002501662650001601687650002101703650001901724650001101743650001401754650002301768650002301791650001801814653001201832653002801844700001601872700001701888700001901905700001801924700001501942700001801957700001801975700001801993700001602011700001502027773006902042852000902111930003302120945001302153946001302166655001202179IND2062907620221123030920.0980403e199708  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206290762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, C.10aSpecific binding of the syringolide elicitors to a soluble protein fraction from soybean leaves  ap. 1425-1433.  anicotiana tabacum  aSyringolides are glycolipid elicitors produced by Gram-negative bacteria expressing Pseudomonas syringae avirulence gene D. The syringolides mediate gene-for-gene complementarity, inducing the hypersensitive response only in soybean plants carrying the Rpg4 disease resistance gene. A site(s) for 125I-syringolide 1 was detected in the soluble protein fraction from soybean leaves, but no evidence for ligand-specific binding to the microsomal fraction was obtained. The Kd value for syringolide 1 binding with the soluble fraction was 8.7 nM, and binding was greatly reduced by prior protease treatment or heating. A native gel assay was also used to demonstrate ligand-specific binding of labeled syringolide 1 with a soluble protein(s). Competition studies with 125I-syringolide 1 and several structural derivatives demonstrated a direct correlation between binding affinity to the soluble fraction and elicitor activity. However, differential competition binding studies disclosed no differences in syringolide binding to soluble fractions from Rpg4/Rpg4 or rpg4/rpg4 soybean leaves. Thus, the observed binding site fulfills several criteria expected of an intracellular receptor for the syringolides, but it is most likely not encoded by the Rpg4 gene. Instead, the Rpg4 gene product may function subsequent to elicitor binding, possibly in intracellular signal transduction. 3aGlycine max 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aglycolipids 3abinding proteins 3aplant proteins 3aleaves 3areceptors 3adisease resistance 3adefense mechanisms 3abinding sites 0abinding 0aintracellular receptors1 aOkinaka, Y.1 aTakeuchi, Y.1 aTsurushima, T.1 aBuzzell, R.I.1 aSims, J.J.1 aMidland, S.L.1 aSlaymaker, D.1 aYoshikawa, M.1 aYamaoka, N.1 aKeen, N.T.0 tPlant cell.g1997 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1425-1433x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03149naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245005200188300001600240520191100256650001102167650003702178650002802215650002102243650002102264650001102285650002902296650003002325650001302355650002202368650002602390653002202416653003102438773014402469852000902613856008502622930003302707946001102740655001202751IND4426567220221123013511.0090925e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442656722DNAL7 a194792002pmid7 a10.1007/s00005-009-0027-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKottow, Michael H. 10aClinical and research ethics as moral strangers  ap. 157-164.  aThis article takes issue with those who defend a brand of clinical research ethics that tends to substitute the ethics of clinical care of patients being recruited as trial subjects. The distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic studies is being disregarded by arguing that research is concerned with the pursuit of knowledge rather than with the medical benefits for patients. Non-competent patients may therefore be recruited for studies that will offer them no medical benefits in spite of involving them in the inherent risks of any biomedical trial. Supported by the World Medical Association, clinicians tend to shun the use of placebos in randomized trials, because of the therapeutic void created in the control group. Nevertheless, investigators continue to consider that scientific purity demands the use of placebos as the most appropriate comparator, even if risks to patient-subjects are increased. Equipoise and clinical equipoise have been suggested as adequate criteria to evaluate the need for a clinical trial, when genuine uncertainty about the equivalence of medical measures requires clarification. If equipoise is understood as a balanced situation where alternatives are equivalent and exchangeable in the view of experienced and current medical thought, no comparison seems warranted until a substantiated doubt about their true equivalence appears. Whereas respecting equipoise is an important measure to curb redundant research, new trials become mandatory if equivalence is reliably questioned. In the best interests of patients being recruited for clinical trials, they should continue to be the full beneficiaries of clinical ethics, in addition to receiving the protection of research ethics. Placebos and sub-medication for control groups are to be used sparingly, and best existing therapy should be employed as control when new and promising agents are developed. 3aethics 2aClinical Trials as Topicxethics 2aDecision Makingxethics 2aEthics, Clinical 2aEthics, Research 2aHumans 2aInformed Consentxethics 2aPatient Selectionxethics 2aPlacebos 2aResearch Subjects 2aTherapeutic Equipoise 0aclinical research 0aplacebo in clinical trials0 tArchivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis.g2009 June, v. 57, no. 3 p.157-164dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx0004-069X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00005-009-0027-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02979naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245009200163300001600255500001500271520114400286650002401430650001801454650002101472650002901493650001401522650002201536650001201558650002101570650002501591650002001616650001701636650002101653650001201674650002601686650001701712650001901729650002401748650003301772650002501805650002001830650001701850650004001867650001201907650002001919650002801939650002101967650001401988650002902002650003002031650003402061650003202095653001602127653002502143700001302168773006802181852000902249930003302258945001302291946001302304655001202317IND2196083220221123013603.0981218e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219608322DNAL7 a95489812pmid7 aPMC1440102pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuy, C.L.14aThe organization and evolution of the spinach stress 70 molecular chaperone gene family  ap. 539-556.  a2019-12-05  aThe stress 70 molecular chaperones of plants are localized and function in all of the major subcellular compartments of the cell. Collectively, all of the various forms are encoded by a multigene family in the nucleus. At least 12 members of this family have been found, and sequence and DNA blot analyses provide an emerging description of the diversity of gene structure organization for this family of evolutionarily conserved proteins in spinach. They exhibit not only structural diversity in the organization of coding and noncoding regions but also distinct expression patterns for different tissues and abiotic conditions. The results of phylogenetic analyses are concordant with at least four major evolutionary events that gave rise to stress 70 molecular chaperones in each of four major subcelluiar compartments of plant cells: the plastid, mitochondrion, cytoplasm, and endoplasmic reticulum. The varied expression patterns also illustrate the complexity of effectively interpreting the role of any one of these stress-related proteins in response to abiotic stress in the absence of context to the other members of the family. 3aheat shock proteins 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3abiochemical polymorphism 3aphylogeny 3aSpinacia oleracea 3acytosol 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amitochondria 3amultigene family 3aintrons 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3achloroplasts 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aIntrons 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpinacia oleraceaxgenetics 0acomparisons 0anucleotide sequences1 aLi, Q.B.0 tPlant cell.g1998 Apr., v. 10, no. 4 p.539-556x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02714naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011900129300001600248520146700264650002601731650002601757650001901783650002501802650002001827650001801847650002401865650001801889650001901907650001701926650001001943650001701953650003001970650001602000653001302016653002002029700001602049700001902065700001902084700001702103773006802120852000902188930003302197945001302230946001302243655001202256IND2196083120221123013506.0981218e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219608312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlackman, L.M.14aThe movement protein of cucumber mosaic virus traffics into sieve elements in minor veins of Nicotiana clevelandii  ap. 525-537.  aThe location of the 3a movement protein (MP) of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) was studied by quantitative immunogold labeling of the wild-type 3a MP in leaves of Nicotiana clevelandii infected by CMV as well as by using a 3a-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion expressed from a potato virus X (PVX) vector. Whether expressed from CMV or PVX, the 3a MP targeted plasmodesmata and accumulated in the central cavity of the pore. Within minor veins, the most extensively labeled plasmodesmata were those connecting sieve elements and companion cells. In addition to targeting plasmodesmata, the 3a MP accumulated in the parietal layer of mature sieve elements. Confocal imaging of cells expressing the 3a-GFP fusion protein showed that the 3a MP assembled into elaborate fibrillar formations in the sieve element parietal layer. The ability of 3a-GFP, expressed from PVX rather than CMV, to enter sieve elements demonstrates that neither the CMV RNA nor the CMV coat protein is required for trafficking of the 3a MP into sieve elements. CMV virions were not detected in plasmodesmata from CMV-infected tissue, although large CMV aggregates were often found in the parietal layer of sieve elements and were usually surrounded by 3a MP. These data suggest that CMV traffics into minor vein sieve elements as a ribonucleoprotein complex that contains the viral RNA, coat protein, and 3a MP, with subsequent viral assembly occurring in the sieve element parietal layer. 3aNicotiana clevelandii 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aviral proteins 3arecombinant proteins 3aanimal proteins 3acytochemistry 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aplasmodesmata 3asieve elements 3apathogenesis 3acells 3afluorescence 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aplant veins 0amovement 0acompanion cells1 aBoevink, P.1 aSanta Cruz, S.1 aPalukaitis, P.1 aOparka, K.J.0 tPlant cell.g1998 Apr., v. 10, no. 4 p.525-537x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02075naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009800124300001600222520092100238650003301159650001301192650001401205650002101219650001501240650001201255650002201267650001801289653001301307653002401320653001701344653001101361653001601372653001801388653001701406653002201423700002001445700001501465700001301480773006801493852000901561930003301570945001301603946001301616655001201629IND2196083020221122235905.0981218e199804  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219608302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKranz, E.10aEndosperm development after fusion of isolated, single maize sperm and central cells in vitro  ap. 511-524.  aWe demonstrate here the possibility of endosperm development in vitro after the fusion of pairs of an isolated sperm and an isolated central cell of maize. The occurrence of karyogamy and the time course of the fusion of sperm and central cell nuclei are presented. The fusion of the sperm nucleus occurred either with one of the two polar nuclei or with the secondary nucleus and was completed within 2 hr after in vitro cell fusion. The in vitro study of early events after cell and nuclear fusion indicates that the resulting primary endosperm cell develops into a characteristic tissue capable of self-organization apart from the mother tissue. The technology presented here opens the way for new cellular and molecular studies, especially of early events after sperm and central cell fusion. These studies should lead to a better understanding of the processes of double fertilization and endosperm development. 3afertilization (reproduction) 3aZea mays 3aendosperm 3aseed development 3agerm cells 3amitosis 3achromosome number 3aelectrofusion 0ain vitro 0ainduced cell fusion 0ainteractions 0anuclei 0asperm cells 0asperm nucleus 0apolar nuclei 0asecondary nucleus1 aWiegen, P. von.1 aQuader, H.1 aLorz, H.0 tPlant cell.g1998 Apr., v. 10, no. 4 p.511-524x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02880naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001400150245007700164300001600241520112000257650002201377650002701399650001101426650002301437650001601460650001601476650001101492650001101503650002601514650001101540650002201551650001801573650002301591650003001614650004501644650004101689650002901730650002401759650001701783650001901800650002901819650001801848650003401866650002401900650002001924653001101944653001601955653001401971653001901985653002002004653001802024700001702042700001802059700001702077773006802094852000902162930003302171945001302204946001302217655001202230IND2201059120221122235832.0991013e199903  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220105912DNAL7 a100724062pmid7 aPMC1441862pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, H.10aDivinyl ether fatty acid synthesis in late blight-diseased potato leaves  ap. 485-493.  aWe conducted a study of the patterns and dynamics of oxidized fatty acid derivatives (oxylipins) in potato leaves infected with the late-blight pathogen Phytophthora intestans. Two 18-carbon divinyl ether fatty acids, colneleic acid and colnelenic acid, accumulated during disease development. To date, there are no reports that such compounds have been detected in higher plants. The divinyl ether fatty acids accumulate more rapidly in potato cultivar Matilda (a cultivar with increased resistance to late blight) than in cultivar Bintje, a susceptible cultivar. Colnelenic acid reached levels of up to approximatelty 24 nmol (7 microgram) per g fresh weight of tissue in infected leaves. By contrast, levels of members of the jasmonic acid family did not change significantly during pathogenesis. The divinyl ethers also accumulated during the incompatible interaction of tobacco with tobacco mosaic virus. Colneleic and colnelenic acids were found to be inhibitory to P. infestans, suggesting a function in plant defense for divinyl ethers, which are unstable compounds rarely encountered in biological systems. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aPhytophthora infestans 3ablight 3adefense mechanisms 3alipogenesis 3afatty acids 3aethers 3aleaves 3aantifungal properties 3ahyphae 3aspore germination 3ajasmonic acid 2aEthersxmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxbiosynthesis 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxmetabolism 2aLipoxygenasexmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhytophthora 2aPlant Diseases 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlants, Toxic 2aSolanum tuberosumxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxmetabolism 2aVinyl Compounds 0agrowth 0aderivatives 0aoxylipins 0acolneleic acid 0acolnelenic acid 0adorignic acid1 aChetelat, A.1 aCaldelari, D.1 aFarmer, E.E.0 tPlant cell.g1999 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.485-493x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02837naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100003600163245011900199300001600318500002400334520134600358650001801704650001401722650002201736650001001758650002101768650001601789650002201805650001301827650001701840650001001857650001701867650002201884650001601906650001901922653001901941653003101960700001501991700001902006700002102025773012002046852000902166856008502175930003302260945002502293946001302318655001202331IND4432418320221122235825.0100205e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443241832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-009-1480-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aUbhayasekera, Sarojini J.

The main objective of this paper was to study the effects of dietary fatty by-products in low, medium and high levels of oxidized lipids and trans fatty acids (TFAs) on the contents of cholesterol and oxycholesterols in meat, liver, and plasma of chickens. A palm fatty acid distillate, before and after hydrogenation, and a sunflower-olive oil blend (70/30, v/v) before and after use in a commercial frying process were used in feeding trials after adding 6% of the fats to the feeds. Highly oxidized lipid and TFA feeds significantly increased the contents of cholesterol and oxycholesterols in all tissues of chicken (0.01 < p ≤ 0.05). The contents of oxycholesterols in chicken meat, liver and plasma obtained from TFA feeding trials varied between 17 and 48 μg/100 g in meat, 19-42 μg/100 g in liver and 105-126 μg/dL in plasma. In contrast, in the oxidized lipid feeding trials, oxycholesterols varied between 13 and 75 μg/100 g in meat, 30-58 μg/100 g in liver and 66-209 μg/dL in plasma. Meat from chickens fed with feeds containing high levels of TFAs or oxidized lipids may contribute to higher ingestion of cholesterol and oxycholesterols by humans. 3asunflower oil 3aolive oil 3ahydrogenated oils 3afeeds 3afeed composition 3adietary fat 3atrans fatty acids 3achickens 3achicken meat 3aliver 3ablood plasma 3achemical analysis 3acholesterol 3asaponification 0aoxycholesterol 0apalm fatty acid sistillate1 aTres, Alba1 aCodony, Rafael1 aDutta, Paresh C.0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2010 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.173-184dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-009-1480-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/04/23  aOther US 7aarticle02051naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245014100131300001600272520087700288650002501165650003601190650001401226650003101240650002101271650001201292650002001304650001801324650002001342650002801362653001201390653001701402653002201419700001201441700001101453700001301464700001601477773006801493852000901561930003301570945001301603946001301616655001201629IND2201051520221122235916.0991012e199903  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220105152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrotochaud, A.E.14aThe CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase requires CLAVATA3 for its assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and Rho-related protein  ap. 393-405.  aThe CLAVATA1 (CLV1) and CLAVATA3 (CLV3) genes are required to maintain the balance between cell proliferation and organ formation at the Arabidopsis shoot and flower meristems. CLV1 encodes a receptor-like protein kinase. We have found that CLV1 is present in two protein complexes in vivo. One is approximately 185 kD, and the other is approximately 450 kD. In each complex, CLV1 is part of a disulfide-linked multimer of approximately 185 kD. The 450-kD complex contains the protein phosphatase KAPP, which is a negative regulator of CLV1 signaling, and a Rho GTPase-related protein. In clv1 and clv3 mutants, CLV1 is found primarily in the 185-kD complex. We propose that CLV1 is present as an inactive disulfide-linked heterodimer and that CLV3 functions to promote the assembly of the active 450-kD complex, which then relays signal transduction through a Rho GTPase. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica oleracea var. botrytis 3areceptors 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3apyrophosphatases 3amutants 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3ashoot meristems 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 0abinding 0ainteractions 0aprotein complexes1 aHao, T.1 aWu, G.1 aYang, Z.1 aClark, S.E.0 tPlant cell.g1999 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.393-405x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02517naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002200154245010600176300001600282500002400298500001500322520094500337650001701282650001601299650001401315650001801329650002301347650001801370650002701388650001301415650001601428650002201444650001701466650001501483651001801498651000901516651001301525653002201538653001501560700002501575700002901600700001701629700002101646700002301667773012001690852000901810856008501819930003301904945002501937946001301962655001201975IND4432418220140725000000.0100205e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443241822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-009-1490-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aMontúfar, Rommel10aOenocarpus bataua Mart.

Fifteen fatty acids were obtained from the mesocarp of this palm species. Oleic (72.7%) and palmitic (18.1%) acids were the predominant FAs. Minor FAs were cis-vaccenic acid (2.3%), linoleic acid (1.9%), stearic acid (1.7%), palmitoleic (0.9%) and alpha-linolenic acid (0.8%). The mean lipid content of the dry mesocarp was 51.6%. The O. bataua oil samples analyzed were remarkably rich in α-tocopherol. By contrast, the other fractions of the unsaponifiable matter (sterols, carotenoids) did not show any noteworthy specificity in comparison with common vegetable oils. However, the particularly high percentage in Δ5-avenasterol of O. bataua oil could serve as a marker for its authentication. Results are discussed in terms of the potential nutritional value of O. bataua oil. 3aphytosterols 3atocopherols 3apalm oils 3alipid content 3aEuterpe precatoria 3avegetable oil 3afatty acid composition 3amesocarp 3acarotenoids 3aOenocarpus bataua 3atocotrienols 3aoleic acid 3aFrench Guiana 3aPeru 3aAmazonia 0aOenocarpus bacaba 0aOenocarpus1 aLaffargue, Andréina1 aPintaud, Jean-Christophe1 aHamon, Serge1 aAvallone, Sylvie1 aDussert, Stéphane0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2010 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.167-172dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-009-1490-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/04/23  aOther US 7aarticle03292naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001700150245010700167300001600274520138100290650002501671650001901696650001401715650002601729650002501755650002301780650001401803650002001817650001801837650001501855650001901870650002201889650001401911650001201925650001001937650003001947650002401977650002702001650002502028650004302053650002802096650002502124650002802149650003102177650003302208650004102241650003602282650003002318653001402348653001102362653001702373653003202390653003602422700001602458700002002474773006802494852000902562930003302571945001302604946001302617655001202630IND2201047820221122235929.0991012e199903  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220104782DNAL7 a100723962pmid7 aPMC1441842pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStacey, M.G.10aDiscrete domains mediate the light-responsive nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of Arabidopsis COP1  ap. 349-363.  aThe Arabidopsis CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) protein plays a critical role in the repression of photomorphogenesis during Arabidopsis seedling development. We investigated the control of COP1 partitioning between nucleus and cytoplasm, which has been implicated in the regulation of COP1 activity, by using fusion proteins between COP1 and beta-glucuronidase or the green fluorescent protein. Transient expression assays using onion epidermal cells and data from hypocotyl cells of stably transformed Arabidopsis demonstrated that COP1 carries a single, bipartite nuclear localization signal that functions independently of light. Nuclear exclusion was mediated by a novel and distinct signal, bordering the zinc-finger and coiled-coil motifs, that was able to redirect a heterologous nuclear protein to the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization signal functioned in a light-independent manner. Light regulation of nuclear localization was reconstituted by combining the individual domains containing the nuclear localization signal and the cytoplasmic localization signal; the WD-40 repeat domain of COP1 was not required. However, phenotypic analysis of transgenic seedlings suggested that the constitutively nuclear-localized WD-40 repeat domain was able to mimic aspects of COP1 function, as indicated by exaggerated hypocotyl elongation under light conditions. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aAllium sativum 3acytoplasm 3atranscription factors 3arecombinant proteins 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aScyphozoa 3aanimal proteins 3acytochemistry 3ahypocotyls 3asignal peptide 3atransgenic plants 3aseedlings 3amutants 3alight 3agreen fluorescent protein 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxchemistry 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aCarrier Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aCell Nucleusxchemistry 2aCytoplasmxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNuclear Localization Signals 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligases 0aepidermis 0anuclei 0acop1 protein 0anuclear localization signal 0acytoplasmic localization signal1 aHicks, S.N.1 aVon Arnim, A.G.0 tPlant cell.g1999 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.349-363x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02463naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010300125300001600228500014900244500002400393520110500417650001201522650001001534650002601544650001101570650001301581650002501594650001401619650001301633650001101646650001701657650001101674650002501685650001001710650001001720651001001730700001601740700001901756700001901775773014001794852000901934856008601943655001202029IND4465087820221122231115.0130304s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446508782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, P.10aColour of 'Tempranillo' grapes as affected by different nitrogen and potassium fertilization rates  ap. 153-160.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Grapevine Growing, Commerce and Research, held June 30 - July 2, 2003, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aThe influence of the combined application of different doses of nitrogen and potassium on the must colour of cv. Tempranillo was examined. The study was carried out in 2000, in Duero river region (Spain). The plants were treated with 3 nitrogen (0, 50 and 200 g N vine-1) and 3 potassium doses (0, 60 and 120 g K2O per vine) in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The fertilization rates applied did not significantly affect either the vigour or productive capacity of vines or the size of berries. Higher potassium supplies increased the total soluble solids content and decreased the total acidity of berries, but they did not affect the colour density and hue of the must. The higher nitrogen doses delayed the accumulation of sugars during ripening, compared to the other treatments. Average dose of nitrogen (50 g N vine-1) increased the levels of anthocyanins in the skin compared with the untreated control vines, which significantly increased the colour density of the must. The blue component of must colour was higher as the nitrogen fertilization dose was increased. 3aacidity 3acolor 3aeconomic productivity 3agrapes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apotassium 3aripening 3arivers 3asmall fruits 3asugars 3atotal soluble solids 3avigor 3avines 3aSpain1 aDelgado, R.1 aGonzalez, M.R.1 aGallegos, J.I.0 tActa horticulturae.g2004 July, , no. 652 p.153-160dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/652/652_18.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02637naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245011600142300001600258500001500274520098200289650002701271650001401298650001301312650001701325650002501342650000801367650002201375650000901397650002001406650001301426650001801439650001601457650003201473650001201505650003901517650005001556650001101606650005301617650001301670650004001683650000901723650000901732653004201741653001301783653003701796700001501833700001601848700001701864700001801881700001401899773007901913852000901992939003302001946001302034655001202047IND9200009620221122221023.0920106e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000962DNAL7 a21707502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasai, N.10aClinico-pathological studies of LEC rats with hereditary hepatitis and hepatoma in the acute phase of hepatitis  ap. 502-505.  a2019-12-05  aThe LEC rat, which suffers from hereditary hepatitis, was examined for elucidation of its clinicopathological characteristics during development of the acute phase of hepatitis by quantitative analyses of histological observations of the liver in combination with laboratory data on various serum enzymes. The progression of acute hepatitis in the LEC rat was observed to begin insidiously early in life, i.e., a few enlarged hepatocytes and Councilman bodies appeared at around 8 weeks of age without clinical signs. Furthermore, it was revealed that the acute phase of hepatitis started with a remarkable increase of Councilman bodies, large nuclei and hepatocytes in mitosis in the liver 3 to 4 weeks before the onset of fulminant hepatitis, which is characterized by the elevation of serum enzyme activities such as GOT, GPT and gamma-GTP, and the onset of jaundice. From those observations, three stages were proposed for the progression of acute hepatitis in the LEC rat. 3aaspartate transaminase 3ahepatitis 3ahepatoma 3aacute course 3aalanine transaminase 3aage 3agenetic disorders 3arats 3aenzyme activity 3ajaundice 2aAcute Disease 2aAge Factors 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxbloodxenzymology. 2aFemale 2aHepatitis, Animalxbloodxenzymologyxpathology. 2aKinetics 2aLiver Neoplasmsxbloodxenzymology. 2aMale 2aRats 0apathological processes and conditions 0asymptoms 0agamma-aspartate aminotransferase1 aOsanai, T.1 aMiyoshi, I.1 aKamimura, E.1 aYoshida, M.C.1 aDempo, K.0 tComparative medicine.g1990 Sept., v. 40, no. 5 p.502-505x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03289naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001600150245014600166300001600312520128600328650002201614650002501636650001401661650002401675650002601699650002001725650001901745650002301764650002001787650002101807650001101828650001001839650001001849650002101859650002701880650001801907650001901925650001801944650001501962650002001977650004001997650003702037650003802074650003602112650003102148650003202179650001402211650001902225650001802244650003102262650001202293650003802305650003102343653001202374653001402386700001802400700001902418700001802437773006802455852000902523930003302532945001302565946001302578655001202591IND2201046520221122221041.0991012e199903  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220104652DNAL7 a100723942pmid7 aPMC1441952pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumann, K.14aThe DNA binding site of the Dof protein NtBBF1 is essential for tissue-specific and auxin-regulated expression of the rolB oncogene in plants  ap. 323-333.  aThe Dof proteins are a large family of plant transcription factors that share a single highly conserved zinc finger. The tobacco Dof protein NtBBF1 was identified by its ability to bind to regulatory domain B in the promoter of the rolB oncogene. In this study, we show that the ACTTTA target sequence of NtBBF1 in domain B is necessary for tissue-specific expression of rolB. beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) activity of tobacco plants containing a rolB promoter-GUS fusion with a mutated NtBBF1 target sequence within domain B is almost completely suppressed in apical meristems and is severely abated in the vascular system. The ACTTTA motif is shown here also to be one of the cis-regulatory elements involved in auxin induction of rolB. The pattern of NtBBF1 expression in plants is remarkably similar to that of rolB, except in mesophyll cells of mature leaves, in which only NtBBF1 expression could be detected. Ectopic expression of rolB in mesophyll cells was achieved by particle gun delivery if the NtBBF1 binding sequence was intact. These data provide evidence that in the plant, a Dof protein DNA binding sequence acts as a transcriptional regulatory motif, and they point to NtBBF1 as the protein involved in mediating tissue-specific and auxin-inducible expression of rolB. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aoncogenes 3aDNA-binding domains 3atranscription factors 3arecombinant DNA 3areporter genes 3abeta-glucuronidase 3agene expression 3aapical meristems 3aleaves 3astems 3aroots 3apromoter regions 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3abinding sites 3ahistochemistry 2aBinding Sites 2aBiolistics 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aDNA, Plantxadministration & dosage 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxphysiology. 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aOncogene Proteinsxgenetics 2aOncogenes 2aPlant Proteins 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aTobacco 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2abeta-Glucosidasexgenetics 0abinding 0arolb gene1 aDe Paolis, A.1 aCostantino, P.1 aGualberti, G.0 tPlant cell.g1999 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.323-333x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03147naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001400163245008900177300001600266500002400282500001500306520163500321650001701956650000901973650001901982650002502001650001402026650001702040650001402057650002802071650002102099650001602120650002102136650002602157650001202183650001302195651001602208653002902224653002002253700001902273700001702292700001702309700002302326773009302349852000902442856008502451930003302536945002502569946001102594655001202605IND4432367320221122173100.0100205e20100303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443236732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2009.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF1201 aAo, Hejun10aReduction of unproductive tillers did not increase the grain yield of irrigated rice  ap. 108-115.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTillering ability is one of the most important traits of the rice plant because it plays a major role in determining grain yield. However, it is not clear whether rice yield potential could be further increased if unproductive tillers were reduced or eliminated. Two field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of tiller reduction on plant growth and grain yield in two varieties with different tillering ability. Two methods were used to reduce tillers: the first was the removal of tillers manually at different crop growth stages and the second was to grow rice plants through holes in styrofoam slats, which provided a physical restriction on tiller emergence. Tiller number declined by 12-57% with the first method and by 18-47% with the second method compared with the control. Despite the significant reduction in tiller number and unproductive tiller percentage, none of the treatments with manual tiller removal and physical restriction of tillering resulted in a significant increase in grain yield compared with the control. Decreases in leaf area and biomass at heading and panicle number at maturity were observed when tiller number declined significantly, but grain yield was not necessarily reduced because it was compensated for by more biomass production after heading and increased spikelet number per panicle. The two varieties with different tillering ability had similar responses to tiller reduction. Based on the two methods of tiller reduction used in this study, we conclude that a further increase in rice yield potential may not be possible by reducing or eliminating unproductive tillers. 3aplant growth 3arice 3ainflorescences 3aplant growth control 3atillering 3aOryza sativa 3aleaf area 3adry matter accumulation 3aagronomic traits 3agrain yield 3ayield components 3afield experimentation 3atillers 3aseed set 3aPhilippines 0aplant cultural practices 0ayield potential1 aPeng, Shaobing1 aZou, Yingbin1 aTang, Qiyuan1 aVisperas, Romeo M.0 tField crops research.g2010 Mar. 3, v. 116, no. 1-2 p.108-115dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2009.11.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20100410b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03526naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001700182245010800199300001600307500002400323500001500347520140100362650001701763650001701780650002201797650001401819650003001833650003001863650002101893650001401914650002201928650001001950650001601960650002001976650001401996650002802010650002402038650001202062650003902074650002302113650002602136650003902162650002802201650002902229650007002258650003502328653002102363653002902384653001502413700001602428700001502444700001402459700001402473700001702487700001502504700001602519773011602535852000902651856008502660930003302745945002502778946001302803655001202816IND4432460920221122153701.0100205e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443246092DNAL7 a190672482pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-008-8418-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF8211 aYe, Song-hua10aTransgenic Tobacco Expressing Zephyranthes grandiflora Agglutinin Confers Enhanced Resistance to Aphids  ap. 615-630.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPlant lectins have been reported as transgenic resistance factors against a variety of insect pests. Herein, homologous analysis demonstrated that Zephyranthes grandiflora agglutinin (ZGA) exhibited high similarity with other monocot mannose-binding lectins (MBLs). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that it had taxonomical relationships with insecticidal MBLs. Subsequently, a plasmid expression vector pBI121 containing zga gene (pBIZGA) was constructed using the zga sequence, under the control of CaMV35S promoter and nos terminator. pBIZGA was then integrated into the genome of Nicotiana tabacum L. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis demonstrated that this zga gene was integrated into the plant genome. Western blotting and agglutinating activity analysis also showed that transgenic tobacco plants expressed different levels of ZGA. Carbohydrate inhibition analysis indicated that recombinant ZGA and the native shared the same carbohydrate-binding specificity. Moreover, genetic analysis confirmed Mendelian segregation (3:1) of the transgenic in T1 progenies. In planta bioassays on T0 plants and their progenies indicated that expressed ZGA had an effect on reducing the survivability and fecundity of tobacco aphids (Myzus nicotianae). These findings demonstrate that the novel zga gene of ZGA can be expressed in crop plants susceptible to various sap-sucking insects. 3aZephyranthes 3ainsect pests 3atransgenic plants 3afecundity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aMyzus persicae nicotianae 3aWestern blotting 3abioassays 3aNicotiana tabacum 3agenes 3aagglutinins 3apest resistance 3amortality 2aAgglutininsxmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aBlotting, Southern 2aLiliaceaexmetabolism 2aMannose-Binding Lectinxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aMyzus nicotianae 0aZephyranthes grandiflora 0aAphidoidea1 aChen, Sheng1 aZhang, Fan1 aWang, Wei1 aTian, Qin1 aLiu, Jin-zhi1 aChen, Fang1 aBao, Jin-ku0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 158, no. 3 p.615-630dHumana Press Incx0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-008-8418-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/04/16  aOther US 7aarticle03358naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001800172245008800190300001600278500002400294520146600318650004201784650001501826650002401841650002101865650002301886650002101909650003501930650002701965650001801992650001402010650001902024650001902043650001402062650002702076650004302103650002002146650002102166650002502187650002602212653002802238700002102266700001702287700001902304700001602323700001902339700002702358700001602385700001802401700002002419773011802439852000902557856008502566930003302651945002502684946001102709655001202720IND4432453120221122123254.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443245312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-009-9654-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aF833 0aF2001 aAcquadro, A. 10aProduction and fingerprinting of virus-free clones in a reflowering globe artichoke  ap. 329-337.  aIncludes references  aMost of the 24 viruses which infect globe artichoke are detrimental to the crop's performance and hamper the development of a nursery activity in the respect of current EU legislation. We describe a procedure to sanitize globe artichoke “Brindisino” from Artichoke Italian latent virus (AILV) and Artichoke latent virus (ArLV), while preserving its valuable early flowering trait. ArLV was successfully eliminated by meristem-tip culture, while AILV was removed when two rounds of meristem-tip culture were spaced out with in vitro thermotherapy. In vivo thermotherapy, followed by meristem-tip culture, was also successful in producing virus-free material but was less efficient in terms of the number of plants recovered post treatment. Due to the multi-clonal composition of the populations at present in cultivation, the selected and sanitised clones were fingerprinted by applying microsatellite and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) markers. One AFLP primer combination produced 28 informative fragments used to evaluate genetic relatedness among the clones in study. Our results demonstrates that AFLP-based molecular fingerprinting enables to verify the true to clone correspondence in nurseries, ensure the effective correspondence between the real and the declared identity of a clone, so that to avoid commercial frauds, and might represents a valuable tool for assessing somaclonal variation occuring during ‘in vitro' propagation. 3aCynara cardunculus subsp. cardunculus 3aartichokes 3adisease-free plants 3amicropropagation 3aDNA fingerprinting 3acloning (plants) 3aArtichoke Italian latent virus 3aArtichoke latent virus 3aplant viruses 3ameristems 3atissue culture 3aheat treatment 3amortality 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3agenetic distance 3asomaclonal variation 3ain vitro regeneration 0amolecular sequence data1 aPapanice, M.

The conversion of an adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in primary RNA transcripts can result in an amino acid change in the encoded protein, a change in secondary structure of the RNA, creation or destruction of a splice consensus site, or otherwise alter RNA fate. Substantial transcriptome and proteome variability is generated by A-to-I RNA editing through site-selective post-transcriptional recoding of single nucleotides. We posit that this epigenetic source of phenotypic variation is an unrecognized mechanism of adaptive evolution. The genetic variation introduced through editing occurs at low evolutionary cost since predominant production of the wild-type protein is retained. This property even allows exploration of sequence space that is inaccessible through mutation, leading to increased phenotypic plasticity and provides an evolutionary advantage for acclimatization as well as long-term adaptation. Furthermore, continuous probing for novel RNA editing sites throughout the transcriptome is an intrinsic property of the editing machinery and represents the molecular basis for increased adaptability. We propose that higher organisms have therefore evolved to systems with increasing RNA editing activity and, as a result, to more complex systems.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA editing 3aacclimation 3aadenosine 3aamino acids 3aepigenetics 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agenetic variation 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3anucleotides 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aproteome 3atranscriptome1 aMullen, Sean P.1 aMaas, Stefan0 tBioEssays.g2009 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.1137-1145dWiley-VCH Verlagx0265-92477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2009000453Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02795naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009600128500014900224500002400373520156500397650000901962650001501971650001401986650001102000650001702011650001302028650002002041650001202061650002502073650002602098650002302124650001002147650001702157651001202174700001602186773011202202852000902314856008602323655001202409IND4465093320221122040656.0130304s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrout, B.W.W.10aCounteracting low light levels in protected strawberry cultivation using reflective mulches  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Light in Horticultural Systems, held October 14-18, 2012, Wageningen, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aPlastic mulches of various types are used to influence the yield and quality of strawberries in protected cultivation. In this study a white and an aluminised plastic mulch have been used in an attempt to compensate for low light levels not uncommon in more northerly latitudes. Plants of the everbearing cultivar 'Flamenco' were raised in growing bags under 50% shade netting, with the reflective mulch covering the entire space between plants. Control plants were grown with and without the shading using a black, non-reflective mulch of a similar material to the reflective ones. The plants were glasshouse-grown in SE England and fruits harvested, weighed and graded between the end of July and the end of October. For fruit with a diameter >25 mm (commercial Class 1) there was a significant negative difference in cumulative yield over the season between plants grown without shade and those under shade with a non-reflective mulch (P≤0.01). There was no significant difference in yield between the unshaded control and fruits harvested under shade either over white or aluminised mulch, and no significant difference between these reflective treatments. The use of mulches did not alter the distribution of yield across the season. These data indicate that simple reflective mulches can be used to support strawberry yield, under protected cultivation, when environmental light levels are low, and can reduce seasonal variation. Their use might also help to extend the harvesting season or expand the growing region into regions with lower irradiance. 3abags 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afruits 3aharvest date 3alatitude 3alight intensity 3anetting 3aplastic film mulches 3aprotected cultivation 3aseasonal variation 3ashade 3astrawberries 3aEngland1 aGreig, M.J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 956dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/956/956_57.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02914naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008400128500014900212500002400361520175400385650001502139650001402154650001102168650001902179650001702198650001402215650002102229650002002250650001602270700001302286700001702299700001402316700001502330773011202345852000902457856008602466655001202552IND4465093120221122040652.0130304s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishimura, Y.14aThe effect of spectrum conversion covering film on cucumber in soilless culture  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Light in Horticultural Systems, held October 14-18, 2012, Wageningen, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aIt is known that the effective wavelength range of light for photosynthesis is 400-700 nm, and that assimilation in the red region is higher than in other regions. Recently, we harnessed this characteristic for the development of a spectrum conversion covering film which changes light from the low active region (green light) for photosynthesis to the effective region (red light). The effect on plant growth of conversion film changing sunlight to the red region had not been clarified because of the difficulty of developing a lasting weather resistant spectrum conversion film. We improved the film and carried out studies on nursery stage vegetables. In this experiment we used a cucumber crop, in which the quantity of photosynthesis is greatly influenced, since the growth rate of the plant and fruit is fast, and investigated growth, yield, and nutrient absorption under the spectrum conversion covering film. The results show that total yield, growth and fruit dry matter rate of cucumbers grown under the spectrum conversion covering film were greater than for cucumbers grown under non-conversion film, but there was no difference in fruit length, level of bent fruit and average fruit weight between the two films. The P concentration in the 10th leaf and in the fruit under the spectrum conversion covering film was higher than under the non-conversion film. The concentrations of other mineral elements under the spectrum conversion covering film tended to be higher than under the non-conversion film. The light transmission characteristics of covering conversion film did not change after 42 months. The spectrum conversion covering film is effective for stable cucumber production because of high yield and good nutrient absorption. 3aabsorption 3acucumbers 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3ared light 3asoilless culture 3asolar radiation 3awavelengths1 aWada, E.1 aFukumoto, Y.1 aAruga, H.1 aShimoi, Y.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 956dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/956/956_56.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03349naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245008200164300001600246500001500262520151600277650002601793650001301819650002001832650002201852650002101874650002501895650002001920650002501940650001801965650000901983650002101992650002402013650001802037650001802055650004802073650003102121650002102152650004302173650002802216650001302244650001902257650003402276650004902310650003202359653001902391653001902410653001202429653001902441653002802460653001002488653002502498653001702523700001902540700001802559773006702577852000902644939003302653946001302686655001202699IND9302257220221122025723.0930414e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930225722DNAL7 a84533042pmid7 aPMC1602652pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPysh, L.D.10aOHP1: a maize basic domain-leucine zipper protein that interacts with opaque2  ap. 227-236.  a2019-12-04  aOPAQUE2 (O2) is a regulatory gene that predominantly affects the expression of the 22-kD class of zein storage protein genes at the level of transcription. The O2 gene encodes a polypeptide belonging to the basic domain/leucine zipper (bZIP) class of transcriptional regulatory proteins. Our prior analyses have demonstrated that the O2 protein binds 22-kD zein gene promoters as a homodimer in vitro and have also suggested that O2 may bind as a heterodimer in vivo. To identity cDNAs encoding other bZIP motifs that might interact with O2, a portion encoding the bZIP motif from an O2 cDNA was used to screen an endosperm cDNA library. Sequence analysis of one isolated recombinant phage indicated the presence of a bZIP motif similar to O2. The protein product of this partial cDNA, designated OHP1, can bind the O2 target site both as a homodimer and in a heterodimeric complex with O2. Whole genome DNA gel blot analysis of maize recombinant inbreds revealed two strongly hybridizing restriction fragments, neither of which mapped close to any locus known to affect zein expression. RNA gel blot analysis revealed an approximately 1.7-kb transcript that is expressed in all organs examined except the female flower and is also expressed in endosperms homozygous for o2 and other mutations that affect zein expression (opaque7, floury2, and Defective endosperm b-30). Based on these results and previously reported data, we propose models to accommodate OHP1 in the regulation of zein gene expression by O2. 3atranscription factors 3aZea mays 3aregulator genes 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aDNA-binding proteins 3abinding sites 3azein 3apromoter regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNAxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Regulator 2aLeucine Zippersxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPlant Proteins 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aZeinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenbank/l06478 0amultiple genes 0a02 gene 0aopaque-2 maize 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0abzip protein1 aAukerman, M.J.1 aSchmidt, R.J.0 tPlant cell.g1993 Feb., v. 5, no. 2 p.227-236x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02913naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245014100168300001600309520114400325650002001469650002601489650001101515650002501526650002201551650002501573650002001598650001801618650002501636650002301661650002501684650002401709650001801733650002801751650003401779650001801813650003601831650004601867650004301913650004201956650003401998650002402032650002402056650003502080653002802115700001602143700001802159700001702177700001902194773006702213852000902280939003302289946001302322655001202335IND9302257020221122025714.0930414e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930225702DNAL7 a84533022pmid7 aPMC1602632pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkinson, A.H.10aProteinase inhibitors in Nicotiana alata stigmas are derived from a precursor protein which is processed into five homologous inhibitors  ap. 203-213.  aA cDNA clone, NA-PI-II, encoding a protein with partial identity to proteinase inhibitor (PI) II of potato and tomato has been isolated from a cDNA library constructed from Nicotiana alata stigma and style mRNA. The cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 397 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 29 amino acids and six repeated domains, each with a potential reactive site. Domains 1 and 2 have chymotrypsin-specific sites and domains 3, 4, 5, and 6 have sites specific for trypsin. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that expression of the gene is restricted to the stigma of both immature and mature pistils. Peptides with inhibitory activity toward chymotrypsin and trypsin have been isolated from stigmas of N. alata. The N-terminal amino acid sequence obtained from this protein preparation corresponds to six regions in the cDNA clone NA-PI-II. The purified PI protein preparation is likely to be composed of a mixture of up to five similar peptides of approximately 6 kD, produced in vivo by proteolytic processing of a 42-kD precursor. The PI may function to protect the reproductive tissue against potential pathogens. 3aNicotiana alata 3aproteinase inhibitors 3astigma 3aamino acid sequences 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aspatial distribution 3atemporal variation 3aimmunohistochemistry 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aDNAxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Toxic 2aProtease Inhibitorsxmetabolism 2aProtein Precursorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTissue Distribution 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data1 aHeath, R.L.1 aSimpson, R.J.1 aClarke, A.E.1 aAnderson, M.A.0 tPlant cell.g1993 Feb., v. 5, no. 2 p.203-213x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03607naa a2200925 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001600150245012900166300001800295500001500313520114600328650002001474650002501494650001801519650002001537650001001557650001701567650001201584650002001596650001101616650001101627650001101638650002501649650001801674650001201692650001601704650002501720650002301745650001401768650002001782650002101802650002001823650001401843650001901857650002101876650000901897650001801906650001301924650001401937650001901951650001201970650003601982650001602018650003002034650006102064650001802125650002102143650001002164650001302174650002602187650002302213650003202236650002802268653001402296653001602310653001102326653001902337653001302356653002002369653002402389653001502413653001402428653001402442700001802456700001302474700001302487700001302500700001802513773007002531852000902601930003302610945001302643946001302656655001202669IND2202712220221122025430.0000224e199907  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220271222DNAL7 a104024222pmid7 aPMC1442662pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsugane, K.12aA recessive arabidopsis mutant that grows photoautotrophically under salt stress shows enhanced active oxygen detoxification  ap. 1195-1206.  a2019-12-05  aMutagenized Arabidopsis seedlings (ecotype Columbia) were screened for the ability to grow photoautotrophically on solid medium containing 200 mM NaCl. A novel mutant line, designated pst1 (for photoautotrophic salt tolerance1), was obtained. There were no significant differences between pst1 and wild-type plants with regard to their ability to induce proline as an osmoregulatory solute. In addition, the content of monovalent cations in pst1 plants grown with or without salt stress was equal to that in the wild type. We observed that light, even at moderate intensities, increased the effects of salt stress on wild-type plants. The pst1 seedlings were nearly 10 times more tolerant to methyl viologen than were wild-type seedlings. We also found that the activities of the active oxygen scavengers superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase were enhanced significantly in pst1 plants. The pst1 plants also were tolerant to other stresses, such as high light intensity and toxic monovalent cations. The recessive nature of the pst1 mutation indicates that the potential for salt-stress tolerance is blocked in wild-type Arabidopsis. 3aseedling growth 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aion transport 3alight intensity 3agenes 3afluorescence 3aproline 3agene expression 3asodium 3aoxygen 3aleaves 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3acalcium 3amutagenesis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3achromosome mapping 3apotassium 3asodium chloride 3alithium chloride 3aenzyme activity 3amortality 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3aloci 3afree radicals 3asalinity 3amagnesium 3aphotosystem II 3amutants 3achemical constituents of plants 3achlorophyll 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFree Radicals 2aGenes, Recessive 2aLight 2aMutation 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 0atolerance 0aperoxidases 0astress 0aphotosynthesis 0acab gene 0acesium chloride 0asuperoxide radicals 0apst1 locus 0achlorides 0arbcs gene1 aKobayashi, K.1 aNiwa, Y.1 aOhba, Y.1 aWada, K.1 aKobayashi, H.0 tPlant cell.g1999 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.1195-1206x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02798naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017900126500014900305500002400454520144600478650001101924650002601935650001501961650002001976650002001996650003102016650001002047650002102057650002102078650003002099650001402129650001502143650001602158700001502174700001602189773011202205852000902317856008602326655001202412IND4465096620221121222849.0130304s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlferez, F.10aLight from different wavelengths affects expression of genes encoding phospholipases a2 and d in peel from mandarins at different maturation stages during postharvest storage  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Light in Horticultural Systems, held October 14-18, 2012, Wageningen, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aPrevious studies showed that blue light reduced fungal colonization by Penicillium digitatum in mature tangerines and activated CssPLA2α gene expression, whereas inhibition of PLA2 enzymatic activity allowed infection to progress. Red light, an inhibitor of PLD, promoted infection as well. These data strongly suggested i) involvement of lipid-derived signals on citrus fruit immunity against postharvest pathogens and ii) activation of lipid signalling by light. In this work we explored the potential of LED-light treatments to manipulate lipid signal production in tangerines. We selected two different maturation stages: mature-green and full mature fruit. Fruit were maintained for 3 days in chambers equipped with LEDs emitting from 600-780 nm (red/far red), 580-670 nm (red), 470-620 nm (green) and 410-540 nm (blue) wavelengths, and 40 μmol m-2 s-1 of intensity before inoculation with a suspension of Penicillium digitatum spores and then stored for 6 days in the same conditions to follow infection development. The expression of CssPLA2αα, CssPLA2β, CsPLD α and CsPLDγ, was studied by quantitative real time PCR. Our results show that blue and green light reduced fungal growth in the fruit surface more effectively in mature-green than in full mature fruit whereas red light treatment promoted decay irrespective of the maturation stage. Gene expression was differentially affected by light, showing a complex regulation. 3aCitrus 3aPenicillium digitatum 3ablue light 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicrobial growth 3aphospholipase A2 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ared light 3atangerines 3awavelengths1 aLiao, H.L.1 aBurns, J.K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 956dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/956/956_75.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02212naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245007800183300001600261520066800277650002000945650002000965650000900985650002200994650001201016650001601028650001701044650001201061650001101073650001101084650001201095650002901107650003901136650001101175650004001186650003201226650003301258650002201291651001001313651001001323653001701333653001101350700002201361700002001383773013901403852000901542856008501551930003301636946001301669655001201682IND4393499720221121222945.0070729e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439349972DNAL7 a176183852pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-007-9188-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalik, Amrita 10aResidues of Organochlorine Pesticides in Fish from the Gomti River, India  ap. 335-340.  aThis study reports the levels and distribution patterns of some organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in fish samples of the Gomti river, India, collected from three sites.

Payments over property rights of new peach cultivars have proved to be very controversial. When a producer designs a new plant, he or she must pay royalties for the new cultivars to the market, use free cultivars or develop new cultivars. The latter option is currently being used by NOVAMED S.L. The company consists of several major fruit-operators located in the Region. In collaboration with the Murcia Institute of Research and Agricultural Development (IMIDA) and in order to avoid breeder's dependence and costly royalty payments, the company has signed an agreement to obtain cultivars adapted to the Region's conditions. The company is actually working on a peach and nectarine program. The program’s general objectives seek to develop cultivars that have been adapted to the soil and climatic conditions of the region achieving early maturing, high productivity and excellent organoleptic qualities. 3aEuropean Union 3aagricultural research 3abreeding 3aclimatic factors 3acultivars 3amarkets 3apeaches 3aproperty rights1 aCarrillo, A.1 aGarcía, F.1 aFrutos, D.1 aLópez, G.1 aPerets, Mikhaʼel ben Yosef.1 aGuevara, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 962dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/962/962_4.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02969naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010300128500014900231500002400380520159200404650002801996650001902024650001502043650002602058650002702084650001102111650001302122650001402135650001902149650002202168650001702190650003002207650001302237650001702250650001602267700001902283700001802302700002002320773011202340852000902452856008602461655001202547IND4465096520221121190232.0130304s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSysoeva, M.I.10aPotato plant responses to temperature drop and Phytonematode infestation under continuous lighting  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Light in Horticultural Systems, held October 14-18, 2012, Wageningen, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aPlant defenses and resistance against pathogens can be affected by changing environmental conditions. Light is the major external factor affecting plant growth and development and influencing many other plant responses to the environment including defense against pests and pathogens. Potato cyst-forming nematode (PCN) Globodera rostochiensis Woll. is a widespread endoparasite of root system that causes significant reduction in potato yield in terms of quality and quantity. Under Nordic conditions potato crop is often subjected to a combination of low temperature and PCN invasion. The aim of the study was to investigate potato plant responses to a short-term temperature drop combined with PCN infestation under continuous lighting. Potato plants (‘Nevsky’) were grown under 24-h photoperiod. At the stage of 3 leaves plants were treated with a daily short temperature drop from 23 to 5°C for 2 h during 6 days. Control plants were grown under constant temperature of 23°C. Then plants were infested by potato cyst-forming nematode (10 cysts per plant) and maintained under 23°C with continuous light for 1 month. Drop-treated plants were more compact and had healthy (without light injury symptoms) leaves and higher plant developmental rate. Infestation by PCN also decreased plant height, but did not affect plant development. Nematode infestation had no effect on the maximum PSII efficiency of plants (Fv/Fm). Temperature drop treatment halved potato plant infestation by PCN. Possible mechanisms of plant cross-adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses are discussed. 3aGlobodera rostochiensis 3aabiotic stress 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowth and development 3aleaves 3alighting 3apathogens 3aphotosystem II 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3apotatoes 3aroot systems 3atemperature1 aMatveeva, E.M.1 aLavrova, V.V.1 aSherudilo, E.G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 956dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/956/956_74.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02762naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245018800181300001600369520073800385650001301123650002001136650001701156650001201173650001301185650001201198650001301210650002001223650001001243650001601253650002701269650002801296650003601324650001701360650002201377650001201399650001001411650000901421650001201430650001001442650001201452650001201464650003001476650001201506650001201518650002601530650002801556650002501584650004001609650004101649651001001690653001901700653002501719653002501744700002101769700001801790773014001808852000901948856008501957930003302042946001302075655001202088IND4394224320221121190250.0070819e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439422432DNAL7 a176183972pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-007-9157-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElia, A.

The chlorophyll fluorescence monitoring system in this study is composed of a PC (host computer), a programmable constant current power supply and a MINI-PAM, which is a modulation fluorescence detector. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of tomato, such as Fs (Steady-state fluorescence), F'm (Maximal fluorescence in illuminated samples, ETR (Electron Transport Rate), PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) and ΦPSII (Quantum yield of PSII during exposure to light) were measured, then the light use efficiency was analyzed according to the measured light response curve of tomato in a fixed growth cycle, and the influence of light intensity on the tomato growth mechanism was determined further. According to the relation model between light intensity and fluorescence parameters, the information of host computer was set to monitor the quantitative fluorescence parameters, so the light control environment was established to guide the dynamic output. The 'Liaoyuanduoli' tomato grown in greenhouse of north China was studied in this experiment. The results show that the change of fluorescent parameters depends on the change of the PAR closely. The increase of PAR makes Fs higher significantly while F'm lower correspondingly, thus the quantum yield of ΦPSII was decreased. Therefore, the system can achieve monitoring in the quantitative fluorescent parameters, so as to realize the actual measurement and quantitative control of plant photosynthetic capacity. 3achlorophyll 3adevelopmental stages 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3agreenhouses 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3atomatoes 3aChina1 aJi, J.1 aZou, Q.1 aLi, Feng1 aYu, H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 956dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/956/956_70.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03366naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013300125300001600258500014900274500002400423520203400447650001302481650002002494650002302514650001502537650001102552650002502563650001102588650002102599650001902620650002102639650001002660650001602670650001702686650001502703700001502718773014002733852000902873856008602882655001202968IND4465095920221121190217.0130304s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGungor, H.14aThe economic structures and marketing strategies of small family enterprises engaged with wine production in Northwest of Turkey  ap. 519-525.  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Grapevine Growing, Commerce and Research, held June 30 - July 2, 2003, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aThe Northwest of Turkey is an important region which has several grape varieties for processing quality wine products. Since 1990s, there have been many small enterprises which were engaged in wine processing activities. After this period, because of low productivity, high production costs and low quality problems the enterprises have been affected negatively and many of them had to stop a great deal of their activities. Especially, the alternative production choice of olive production has gained great importance due to governmental supports. However, for nearly two or three years, wine processing activities have gained back their popularity due to many factors. The aim of this research, is to determine the economical structure and marketing strategies of small enterprises and the reasons of attractiveness of wine production over again in the region. The marketing strategies carried out by enterprises were also examined. Research findings have been collected from 12 holdings using questionnaires by personal interviewing during 2001-2002 production period. Main findings of the research are as follows: Established capacities of enterprises differ between 80 to 1200 tonnes per year. Most of the enterprises have the capacity of 300-500 tonnes level. Usable capacity is nearly 66% in total. Generally storing system were built by using reinforced concrete and fibreglass materials. Only two enterprises have been using steel storing system. The main grape varieties used for wine making in the region are Semilion, Cinsaut, Gamay, Papazkarası, Narince and Yapıncak. In recent years, the high quality varieties of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot have gained great importance due to high demand by customers. The average production cost of quality wines is calculated as € 1.026 and selling price is € 2.43 per bottle and for the table wines were € 0.662 and € 1.086 respectively. Marketing strategies have been discussed under the title of product, price, promotion and place which are called marketing mix. 3aconcrete 3aconsumer demand 3aeconomic structure 3afiberglass 3agrapes 3amarketing strategies 3aprices 3aproduction costs 3aquestionnaires 3asmall businesses 3asteel 3atable wines 3awine quality 3awinemaking1 aGungor, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2004 July, , no. 652 p.519-525dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/652/652_69.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03682naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007800128500014900206500002400355520209000379650001502469650002502484650001502509650001402524650001602538650001502554650001602569650003102585650001302616650002002629650001802649650001302667650002002680650001002700650002302710650001602733650003302749650002702782650002002809650002202829650002602851650001602877700001402893700001702907700001902924700001402943773011202957852000903069856008603078655001203164IND4465096220221121190235.0130304s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVänninen, I.10aProspecting the use of artificial lighting for integrated pest management  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Symposium on Light in Horticultural Systems, held October 14-18, 2012, Wageningen, The Netherlands.  aIncludes references  aDevelopments in artificial lighting technologies and greenhouse cladding materials increase the possibilities of manipulating pests and beneficial species. Here, we review the direct and indirect plant-mediated effects of light characteristics on pests and beneficial organisms, focusing on arthropods and their natural enemies. Some examples on the possibilities of managing plant diseases, alone and in combination with pests, with light are also envisioned. Light intensity, photoperiod and wavelength distribution affect plant functions and physical and chemical quality which, in turn, can be reflected in the performance of herbivores. The attenuation of UV-light in HPSL spectrum and in the natural winter daylight of northern latitudes may make plants more vulnerable to pests, whereas the high ratio of red to far-red of HPSLs may act to compensate for the effects of attenuated UV-levels. High red to far red ratio has been shown to result in increased production of plant phenolics and physical defences which, in turn, can negatively influence the performance of some herbivore guilds on plants. Specific spectra produced by LEDs can influence plant quality and hence herbivore performance, but direct effects on arthropods can be even more pronounced, such as the inability of locating host plants by visually orienting pests in red and blue light. Other direct effects of artificial light on organisms include the detrimental effect of UV-C and UV-B on arthropods and fungi, diapause prevention by species-specific wavelengths or photoperiods, attraction to yellow-green wavelengths and polarized light, reduced visibility of prey in specific spectra which, in turn, reduces vector transmitted diseases, interactive effects of light quality and photoperiod on fecundity, species-specific effects of continuous light on the population growth of arthropods and plant-infesting fungi as well as the red light-induced resistance in plants to plant pathogenic fungi. Based on the reviewed literature, the practical implications for IPM as well as knowledge gaps are presented. 3aarthropods 3abeneficial organisms 3ablue light 3afecundity 3agreenhouses 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3aintegrated pest management 3alatitude 3alight intensity 3alight quality 3alighting 3anatural enemies 3apests 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotoperiod 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apolarized light 3apopulation growth 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths1 aPinto, D.1 aNissinen, A.1 aJohansen, N.S.1 aShipp, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 956dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/956/956_71.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01521naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008500129500010300214500002400317520054000341650001900881650001600900650001000916650001100926650001200937650001400949651003100963700001800994773011201012852000901124856008601133655001201219IND4465099620221121170240.0130306s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaparro, J.X.10aEvidence for a new single gene trait controlling pre-mature defoliation in peach  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Peach Symposium, held June 8-11, 2009, Lleida, Spain.  aIncludes references  aSeveral populations of peach [Prunus persica (L.)

The new 'Puldin' cultivar was obtained from the parent combination 'July Lady' × 'July Lady', the crossing being done in 1991 in the city of Plovdiv. The pomological studies were carried out in the period 2005-2008 when the age of the experimental trees was 5-8 years old, respectively. The results obtained for 'Puldin' cultivar were compared to those of the cultivars 'July Lady', 'Redhaven' and 'Glohaven'. The fruits of the new cultivar ripened at the end of July and the beginning of August, 2-3 days after those of 'Redhaven' cultivar. They are very large - 178 g. The fruit shape is spherical with a good symmetry. The tip point is small and the pedicel cavity is narrow and moderately deep. An intensively red blush covers the whole fruit skin and it has very fine fuzz. Fruit flesh is bright yellow with a slight red water colouring. It is juicy, with a gentle texture, homogeneous, with well-balanced saturated sweet-sour taste and a strong aroma. The stone is small, its relative share being 3,73%, detachable from the fruit flesh. The fruits are very suitable for fresh consumption. Concerning its economic characteristics, 'Puldin' falls a little bit behind 'Glohaven' but surpasses 'Redhaven' and 'July Lady'. It is not susceptible to the major diseases typical of peach. It demonstrates comparatively good susceptibility to winter frosts and good tolerance to dryness. The aim of the present study was to carry out pomological and economic evaluation of the new peach cultivar 'Puldin'. 3acrossing 3acultivars 3aeconomic analysis 3afruit growing 3afruits 3aodors 3apeaches 3apedicel 3ataste 3atexture 3atrees 3aBulgaria0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 962dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/962/962_16.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02983naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006200125500010300187500002400290520136100314650002501675650002301700650001201723650001401735650001501749650001801764650001601782650001701798650001201815650002601827650001201853650001201865650001301877650001501890650001401905650001201919650000901931650001501940651001201955651001101967651001101978651001001989651002101999651001102020651000902031651001702040651001002057651002602067700002102093700001402114700001602128700001902144700001202163773011202175852000902287856008502296655001202381IND4465098020221121170328.0130306s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446509802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez, S.10aPeach genetic resources and breeding strategies in Mexico  aPaper presented at the Seventh International Peach Symposium, held June 8-11, 2009, Lleida, Spain.  aIncludes references  aPeaches are widely distributed in Mexico after more than 400 years of local selection pressures and have produced a large number of homogenous populations. The main objective of this presentation is to describe the genetic resources, breeding strategies as well as the progress in the generation of new peach cultivars in Central Mexico. Approaches to describe the diversity of Mexican peaches have been based in multivariate analysis with emphasis on traits related with adaptation. Genetic resources are kept in situ on six representative ecosystems and is being used to develop homozygous lines with a high level of homoygocity, which are used as parents to generate hybrids in crosses with foreign selections and cultivars from Eastern and Western United States, Canada, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, South Africa, Spain, China and Korea. The F1 are evaluated in research stations and the F2 are planted and screened on each representative ecosystem. Screening is based on adaptation to: a) soil: rootstock seed sources derived from selfing local and introduced selections; b) climate (50 to 500 hours of chilling for the subtropics and 700 to 1000 hours for temperate climates in the north), blossom season; c) resistance to Spaheroteca pannosa, Taphrina deformans and Monilinia fructicola; d) growth habit, yield and fruit quality based on target consumers. 3aMonilinia fructicola 3aTaphrina deformans 3acooling 3acultivars 3aecosystems 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3agrowth habit 3ahybrids 3amultivariate analysis 3aparents 3apeaches 3aplanting 3arootstocks 3ascreening 3aselfing 3asoil 3asubtropics 3aBolivia 3aBrazil 3aCanada 3aChina 3aKorean Peninsula 3aMexico 3aPeru 3aSouth Africa 3aSpain 3aWestern United States1 aFernández, M.R.1 aParra, R.1 aRumayor, A.1 aMondragón, C.1 aRoa, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 Oct., , no. 962dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/962/962_8.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02165naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100003100142245006000173300001800233520111500251650002301366650002301389650001701412650001401429650002001443650002401463650001901487650002901506650003601535700002101571773008801592852000901680856008201689930003301771946001101804655001201815IND4426573320221121130254.0090925e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442657332DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2009000632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Camacho, Cristina10aEmerging mechanisms in morphogen-mediated axon guidance  ap. 1013-1025.  aEarly in animal development, gradients of secreted morphogenic molecules, such as Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Wnt and TGFβ/Bmp family members, regulate cell proliferation and determine the fate and phenotype of the target cells by activating well-characterized signalling pathways, which ultimately control gene transcription. Shh, Wnt and TGFβ/Bmp signalling also play an important and evolutionary conserved role in neural circuit assembly. They regulate neuronal polarization, axon and dendrite development and synaptogenesis, processes that require rapid and local changes in cytoskeletal organization and plasma membrane components. A key question then is whether morphogen signalling at the growth cone uses similar mechanisms and intracellular pathway components to those described for morphogen-mediated cell specification. This review discusses recent advances towards the understanding of this problem, showing how Shh, Wnt and TGFβ/Bmp have adapted their 'classical' signalling pathways or adopted alternative and novel molecular mechanisms to influence different aspects of neuronal circuit formation. 3aanimal development 3acell proliferation 3acytoskeleton 3aphenotype 3aplasma membrane 3asignal transduction 3asynaptogenesis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aBovolenta, Paola0 tBioEssays.g2009 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.1013-1025dWiley-VCH Verlagx0265-92477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2009000633Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02730naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001300133245005700146300001400203500002300217500001500240520139000255650001601645650001801661650000901679650001401688650002101702650002101723650001401744650001701758650001001775650004401785650004301829650003001872650001101902650003801913650003701951650005301988653000902041653002302050700001602073773007102089852001302160939003302173945000802206946001302214852000902227655001202236991608326630742620221121100208.0930415s1993    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930013312DNAL7 a83833152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraf, E.10aSuppression of colonic cancer by dietary phytic acid  ap. 11-19.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aLarge differences exist between human populations in the frequency of colonic cancer. Epidemiological evidence indicates that these differences are strongly influenced by country, of residence, and a negative correlation has been found between the fiber content of the diet and frequency of colonic cancer. This has prompted the hypothesis that high-fiber diets are in some way protective. However, reanalysis of the dietary data provides equally strong support for the hypothesis that the protective element may be phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphate). This heat- and acid-stable substance is present in high concentration in many food items, including cereal grains, nuts, and seeds. Phytic acid forms chelates with various metals and suppresses damaging iron-catalyzed redox reactions. Inasmuch as colonic bacteria have been shown to produce oxygen radicals in appreciable amounts, dietary phytic acid might suppress oxidant damage to intestinal epithelium and neighboring cells. Indeed, rapidly accumulating data from animal models indicate that dietary supplementation with phytic acid may provide substantial protection against experimentally induced colonic cancer. Should further investigations yield additional support for this hypothesis, purposeful amplification of dietary phytic acid content would represent a simple method for reducing the risk of colonic carcinogenesis. 3aphytic acid 3adietary fiber 3airon 3acarcinoma 3afood composition 3adietary minerals 3achelation 3aantioxidants 3acolon 2aColonic Neoplasmsxprevention & control 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aFree Radicalsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aIron Chelating Agentsxmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aPhytic Acidxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 0adiet 0aliterature reviews1 aEaton, J.W.0 tNutrition and cancer.g1993, v. 19, no. 1 p.11-19x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01883naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245005800134300001300192500001500205520087900220650002301099650002601122650001801148650001601166650001601182650002101198650001201219650002701231650002401258650001401282651001901296653000901315653001801324773009401342852000901436939003301445945000801478946001101486655001201497991608326470742620221121100243.0930415e199302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930013382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPattison, A.J.10aReview of current practice in 'clean' diets in the UK  ap. 3-11.  a2019-12-04  aA survey of current practice in the provision of 'clean' diets at UK bone-marrow transplant (BMT) centres was carried out as a basis for updating the information given to patients at Sheffield Children's Hospital (SCH). 'Clean' diets are used to minimize the risk of infection from food in immunosuppressed patients. Information received varied greatly from sterile diets to modified ward diets. It was found difficult to collate the results for this reason. In addition, there has been little documented evidence on the use and effectiveness of these diets. In general, there appears to be a move away from a stringent sterile diet towards a more relaxed diet, giving patients a greater choice of foods. Following this survey, the information given to BMT patients at SCH was modified to allow greater freedom of choice, whilst maintaining sensible food hygiene guidelines. 3adisease prevention 3ahospital food service 3amenu planning 3asterilizing 3aplate count 3afood preparation 3asurveys 3abone marrow transplant 3adietary supplements 3ainfection 3aUnited Kingdom 0adiet 0asterile diets0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g1993 Feb., v. 6, no. 1 p.3-11x0952-38717nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02896naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013500129300001600264500001500280520134500295650003801640650003401678650001801712650001401730650003201744650001801776650001401794650002001808650001501828650003301843650002001876650001001896650001201906650001901918650001301937650001801950650001701968650001001985650001101995653001402006653001502020653002302035653003602058653001402094653002102108653000902129653001602138653001402154700001502168773006702183852000902250930003302259945001302292946001302305655001202318IND2201797320221121100245.0991130e199905  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220179732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullivan, J.A.10aPlastid translation is required for the expression of nuclear photosynthesis genes in the dark and in roots of the pea lip1 mutant  ap. 901-910.  a2019-12-05  aThe expression of nuclear photosynthesis genes in pea seedlings requires both light and a postulated signal produced by developing plastids. The requirement for the plastid signal for the accumulation of transcripts of Lhcb1, RbcS, PetE, and AtpC genes was investigated in the pea mutant lip1, which shows light-independent photomorphogenic development. Lincomycin and erythromycin, inhibitors of plastid translation, decreased the accumulation of transcripts of nuclear photosynthesis genes in shoots of light-grown wild-type and lip1 seedlings, indicating that the plastid signal is required in the lip1 mutant. Treatment with lincomycin or erythromycin also reduced the accumulation of transcripts in shoots of dark-grown lip1 seedlings, indicating that light is not an obligate requirement for the synthesis or activity of the plastid signal. Lincomycin had a similar effect on the accumulation of Lhcb1 transcripts in dark-grown cop1-4 seedlings of Arabidopsis. Accumulation of transcripts of nuclear photosynthesis genes was also observed in roots of lightgrown lip1 seedlings, and this accumulation, which was associated with the development of chloroplasts, was again dependent on plastid translation. The plastid signal therefore regulates the expression of nuclear photosynthesis genes in the dark and in roots of the lip1 mutant. 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3anucleocytoplasmic interaction 3amessenger RNA 3aphenotype 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3amorphogenesis 3aseedlings 3achloroplast DNA 3alincomycin 3aprotein synthesis inhibitors 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutants 3aphotosynthesis 3agenomics 3aPisum sativum 3aerythromycin 3aroots 3ashoots 0apete gene 0alhcb1 gene 0aphotomorphogenesis 0achlorophyll a/b binding protein 0aatpc gene 0apyrophosphatases 0adark 0atranslation 0arbcs gene1 aGray, J.C.0 tPlant cell.g1999 May, v. 11, no. 5 p.901-910x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01728naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245005100158300001800209520079000227650002501017650001401042650001701056650002801073650002001101650002001121650002201141650001601163773008801179852000901267856008201276930003301358946001101391655001201402IND4426573820221121100213.0090925e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442657382DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2009000252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobohm, Uwe10aToward general prophylactic cancer vaccination  ap. 1071-1079.  aIt is well established that chronic infections can lead to cancer. Almost unknown is that, in contrast, acute brief viral and bacterial infections may have beneficial effects in cases of established neoplastic disease, while exposure to pathogenic products by infection, vaccination, and inhalation can cause prophylactic effects. In the following I will align evidence from case studies of spontaneous regression and from epidemiological studies with recent immunology to conclude that pathogenic substances belonging to the group of "pathogen-associated molecular patterns" can trigger the innate immune system to establish anti-neoplastic immune responses. A better understanding of the protective role of the innate immune system might leverage considerable prophylactic potential. 3abacterial infections 3abreathing 3acase studies 3aepidemiological studies 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3aprotective effect 3avaccination0 tBioEssays.g2009 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.1071-1079dWiley-VCH Verlagx0265-92477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2009000253Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02753naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001300150245010500163300001600268500001500284520085600299650002501155650001801180650002101198650001001219650002401229650002201253650002601275650001101301650002001312650001401332650001001346650001201356650001701368650003601385650003901421650001301460650004401473650003801517650002401555650004401579650004701623650005501670650001401725650002801739650003301767653002301800653001301823653002001836653001301856653001301869653002701882700001101909700001501920700002101935773006701956852000902023930003302032945001302065946001302078655001202091IND2201797620221121065837.0991130e199905  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220179762DNAL7 a103304762pmid7 aPMC1442302pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Y.L.10aFeedback regulation of GA5 expression and metabolic engineering of gibberellin levels in Arabidopsis  ap. 927-935.  a2019-12-05  aThe gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase encoded by the GA5 gene of Arabidopsis directs GA biosynthesis to active GAs, whereas that encoded by the P16 gene of pumpkin endosperm leads to biosynthesis of inactive GAs. Negative feedback regulation of GA5 expression was demonstrated in stems of Arabidopsis by bioactive GAs but not by inactive GA. In transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing P16, there was a severe reduction in the amounts of C(20)-GA intermediates, accumulation of large amounts of inactive GA(25) and GA(17), a reduction in GA(4) content, and a small increase in GA(1). However, due to feedback regulation, expression of GA5 and GA4, the gene coding for the subsequent 3beta-hydroxylase, was greatly increased to compensate for the effects of the P16 transgene. Consequently, stem height was only slightly reduced in the transgenic plants. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3aCucurbita maxima 3astems 3agene overexpression 3atransgenic plants 3aplant characteristics 3aheight 3aoxidoreductases 3aendosperm 3agenes 3amutants 3agibberellins 3achemical constituents of plants 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFeedback 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Engineering 2aGibberellinsxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Stemsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 0agenetic regulation 0ap16 gene 0agene expression 0aga4 gene 0aga5 gene 0agibberellin 20-oxidase1 aLi, L.1 aGage, D.A.1 aZeevaart, J.A.D.0 tPlant cell.g1999 May, v. 11, no. 5 p.927-935x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02630naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001600245500014900261500002400410520108700434650001901521650000901540650001201549650002101561650001101582650001401593650001001607650001101617650000901628650001401637650001401651650002001665650002001685650002101705650002301726650001301749650001101762650002501773650001401798650000901812700001401821700001801835700001601853700002001869773014001889852000902029856008602038655001202124IND4465089520221121070015.0130304s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446508952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomingos, I.10aEffects of fertiliser practices on the growth and quality of two table grape cultivars: 'Cardinal' and 'D.

The vineyards were established in similar soils under the same climatic conditions and additional water was supplied by drip irrigation. At harvest, the mineral composition of petioles (P, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn) and quality parameters of the grapes (total soluble solids expressed as degree Brix, cluster length and weight, number of grapes, grapes weight and rachis weight) were recorded. For the ‘Cardinal’ cultivar, the nutritional status of the plant was correlated with growth and yield, and the greatest values for most of the parameters studied were measured at Alvisquer farm. For the ‘D. Maria’ cultivar, a single correlation was found between nutrient levels and growth. Shoot and cluster lengths, and grape weight were similar at all farms, though cluster weight, number of grapes and total soluble solids were smaller at Pedras than at Alvisquer or Gomeira. 3aVitis vinifera 3abrix 3acalcium 3aclimatic factors 3acopper 3acultivars 3afarms 3agrapes 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amicroirrigation 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3anutritional status 3apetioles 3ashoots 3atotal soluble solids 3avineyards 3azinc1 aSilva, T.1 aCorreia, J.P.1 aPestana, M.1 aVarennes, A. de0 tActa horticulturae.g2004 July, , no. 652 p.241-247dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/652/652_30.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02956naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001600150245009400166300001600260500001500276520119100291650002501482650000901507650002201516650002501538650002001563650001401583650001301597650002101610650002501631650002301656650001001679650001201689650002001701650001201721650001901733650002401752650002601776650001801802650001701820650002801837650002701865650001301892650002301905650004201928650002001970650002501990650001302015653002802028653001002056653002502066653001902091653001502110700001402125700002002139773006702159852000902226930003302235945001302268946001302281655001202294IND2201795420221121065928.0991130e199905  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220179542DNAL7 a103304692pmid7 aPMC1442222pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarniol, B.10aArabidopsis FUSCA5 encodes a novel phosphoprotein that is a component of the COP9 complex  ap. 839-848.  a2019-12-05  aThe COP9 complex is a regulator essential for repression of light-mediated development in Arabidopsis. Using partial amino acid sequence data generated from purified COP9 complexes, we cloned the Arabidopsis cDNA encoding the 27-kD subunit of the COP9 complex and showed that it is encoded by the previously identified FUSCA5 (FUS5) locus. fus5 mutants exhibit constitutive photomorphogenic phenotypes similar to those of cop9 and fus6. Point mutations in FUS5 that led to a loss of FUS5 protein were detected in four fus5 allelic strains. FUS5 contains the PCI/PINT and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activation loop motifs and is highly conserved with the mammalian COP9 complex subunit 7 and the Aspergillus nidulans AcoB proteins. FUS5 is present in both complex and monomeric forms. In the COP9 complex, FUS5 may interact directly with FUS6 and COP9. Mutations in FUS6 and COP9 result in a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of FUS5. This shift can be mimicked by in vitro phosphorylation of FUS5 by plant extracts. These findings further support the hypothesis that the COP9 complex is a central and common regulator that may interact with multiple signaling pathways. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aloci 3acomplementary DNA 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aphosphoproteins 3aseedlings 3amutation 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3achromosome mapping 3aexons 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3aintrons 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultiprotein Complexes 2aMutation 2aPeptide Hydrolases 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Conformation 2aProteins 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u89959 0afus5 locus1 aMalec, P.1 aChamovitz, D.A.0 tPlant cell.g1999 May, v. 11, no. 5 p.839-848x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01896naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245012900159300001800288520070800306650001501014650002001029650002001049650001001069650002901079650002101108650001501129650001401144650001701158700001701175700002001192700001801212700001901230700001901249773009501268852000901363856008201372930003301454946001101487655001201498IND4426571820221121060626.0090925e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442657182DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2009001362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Keesung10aRapid detection of Mycoplasma pneumonia in a microfluidic device using immunoagglutination assay and static light scattering  ap. 3206-3211.  aWe present real-time, rapid detection of Mycoplasma pneumonia in PBS inside a Y-channel PDMS microfluidic device via optical fiber monitoring of latex immunoagglutination.

The electrophoretic experimental parameters to analyze TC, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and doxycycline antibiotics were investigated with a cellulose-dsDNA-modified carbon paste electrode. Modification of the electrode improved detection performance by enhancing the signal-to-noise characteristics without surface fouling of the electrode. Field-amplified sample stacking and field-amplified sample injection techniques were employed for on-chip preconcentration of the TC series. The sensitivity of the method was improved 10 900-fold when compared with conventional MEKC-electrochemical detection analysis. The overall recoveries for TC, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and doxycycline were 87, 89, 87, and 81%, respectively, with 6.0% RSD. The limits of detection for the series were estimated between 1.5 and 4.3 nM. Applicability of the method to beef samples was successfully demonstrated. 3acarbon 3achlortetracycline 3adetection limit 3adoxycycline 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophoresis 3afouling 3aoxytetracycline 3atetracycline1 aPark, So-Hee1 aWon, So-Young1 aShim, Yoon-Bo0 tElectrophoresis.g2009 Sept., v. 30, no. 18 p.3219-3227dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2009001173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03556naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245014100144300001600285520218200301650001902483650001802502650002002520650001402540650001902554650001802573650001202591650002902603650006402632650004602696650002102742650004002763650003302803650000902836650001702845650003202862653001202894653002202906700002002928700001702948773007802965852000903043939003303052946001303085655001203098IND9205290320221121071443.0920821e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920529032DNAL7 a16671932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, L.C.10aPersistent reduction of B virus (Herpesvirus simiae) seropositivity in rhesus macaques acquired for a study of renal allograft tolerance  ap. 540-544.  aOne hundred and two rhesus macaques were used in a study of renal allograft tolerance. Each animal was monitored serologically more than one time to determine its B virus (Herpesvirus simiae) antibody status. The follow-up period for some individuals was 3 years, extending from 1986 to 1989. The accumulated test results eventually provided an opportunity to retrospectively support a contention that a small research colony of rhesus macaques could become and remain B virus seronegative if the animals were housed individually, monitored periodically, acquired only if they were seronegative, and culled if they converted to positive status. It was also possible that the test results might disclose useful information about the influence of acute immunosuppression on the reliability of determining B virus antibody status by serologic methods, and help formulate guidelines for selecting donor-recipient pairs. A review of the serologic test results disclosed that antibody status before the initiation of experimental therapy, and subsequent seroreactivity, did not change throughout the experimental lifetime of 92 monkeys. The few exceptions were six juveniles that lost detectable antibody, and four other juveniles that converted to positive. Preliminary data suggested that total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and splenectomy were associated with the loss of detectable antibody; however, further study is needed to establish the validity and significance of this association. No other unexpected or unexplained results were associated with concomitant periods of acute immunosuppression. The number of seropositive animals in the colony was reduced to three through attrition and culling by the end of 1989. These three seropositive animals were culled shortly thereafter, and there were no conversions to seropositive during the subsequent 2 years. The findings suggested that research institutions with a small number of rhesus macaques could reliably achieve B virus seronegative status, given our conditions, by emphasizing a management program that gives priority to preshipment screening, individual housing, regular testing, and culling of seropositive animals. 3aMacaca mulatta 3aHerpesviridae 3adisease control 3ascreening 3aanimal housing 3aserodiagnosis 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aHerpesvirus 1, Cercopithecineximmunology 2aImmune Tolerance 2aKidney Transplantationximmunology. 2aMacaca mulattaxmicrobiology 2aMale 2aTime Factors 2aTransplantation, Homologous 0aculling 0aimmunosuppression1 aPryor, W.H.

Growth inhibition was immediately reversible upon return to 101.3 kPa, albeit at a slower rate. A population of B. subtilis cells was cultivated at the near-inhibitory pressure of 5 kPa for 1,000 generations, where a stepwise increase in growth was observed, as measured by the turbidity of 24-h cultures. An isolate from the 1,000-generation population was obtained that showed an increase in fitness at 5 kPa when compared to the ancestral strain or a strain obtained from a parallel population that evolved for 1,000 generations at 101.3 kPa. The results from this preliminary study have implications for understanding the ability of terrestrial microbes to grow in low-pressure environments such as Mars.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aatmospheric pressure 3aevolution 3amicroorganisms 3aturbidity1 aFajardo-Cavazos, Patricia1 aFedenko, Jeffrey1 aOrtíz-Lugo, José L.1 aRivas-Castillo, Andrea1 aWaters, Samantha M.1 aSchuerger, Andrew C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Nov. 15, v. 76, no. 22 p.7559-7565dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01126-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02033naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012700125300001600252520114100268650000901409650001501418650001801433650001301451650001201464653001101476653003101487700002201518700001701540700001601557773007901573852000901652939003301661946001301694655001201707IND8906544320221121054357.0891212e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890654432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZinn, S.A.10aAlterations in concentrations of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the median eminence of rats euthanatized with pentobarbital  ap. 412-419.  aConcentrations of dopamine (DA) and one of its major metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DO-PAC), were determined in selected brain regions of rats that were euthanatized either by decapitation or by intravenous injections of pentobarbital or Fatal Plus, a commerical preparation that contains pentobarbital. When compared with values in decapitated brains, pentobarbital increased the concentration of DOPAC in the medium eminence, which contains terminals of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons. Fifteen minutes of restraint reduced the concentration of DOPAC in the median eminence of rats killed by decapitation or by injections of pentobarbital, indicating that pentobarbital does not mask restraint-induced decrease in TIDA neuronal activity. In contrast, none of the manipulations altered DA or DOPAC concentrations in the striatum, which contains terminals of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Thus, changes in the concentrations of DOPAC in the median eminence (an index of TIDA neuronal activity) induced by stress can be detected in rats euthanatized by either decapitation or an injection of pentobarbital. 3arats 3aeuthanasia 3apentobarbital 3adopamine 3aneurons 0astress 0adihydroxyphenylacetic acid1 aLookingland, K.J.1 aTucker, H.A.1 aMoore, K.E.0 tComparative medicine.g1989 Sept., v. 39, no. 5 p.412-419x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01067naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009900128300001600227500001500243520017300258650002100431650001400452650001700466650003600483650001400519650002900533653001400562700001600576700001600592773008000608852000900688939003300697946001100730655001200741IND9302141520221121054437.0930409e19930129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930214152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacquet, J.P.10aReaction of diazomethane with clerocidin. preparation of new clerodane diterpenoid derivatives  ap. 823-826.  a2019-12-04  aReaction of 1 with diazomethane in MeOH gave the ketone 2 as well as the diepoxide 4.

Mixed breed male dogs of various body weights and ages underwent midline laparotomy for exposure of the portal vein system. After exposure the portal vein was dissected free and cannulated through a purse-string suture placed just caudad (approximately 1 cm) to the entry point of the cranial pancreaticoduodenal vein with a cuffed, medical grade, silastic catheter. The catheter was advanced craniad to a point just distal to the level of the liver and secured in place via the purse-string suture and a single stay suture. The catheter was then passed through the dorsolateral abdominal wall and routed subcutaneously to a point between the shoulder blades. After catheter plug attachment the catheter was tested for patency, flushed, heparin locked, then was secured to the subcutaneous tissue between the scapulas. The dorsal skin wound and abdominal incision were closed in a routine manner, and the dogs recovered from anesthesia. Catheter patency and function in all dogs were maintained for periods up to 4 weeks. No postoperative complications such as catheter tract infections occurred, maintenance was minimal, and all dogs were afforded complete freedom of movement and activity throughout the study, with no requirement for cumbersome jackets or wraps. 3ainsulin secretion 3abiomedical research 3aportal vein 3ablood sampling 3asurgery 3adogs 3aanimal experimentation 2aAnimals 2aBlood Specimen Collectionxmethods 2aCatheterizationxmethods 2aDogs 2aInsulinxbloodxsecretion. 2aMale 2aPeriodicity 2aPortal Vein 2aSurgical Procedures, Operativexmethods 0acatheterization 0ainsulin pulse amplitudes1 aAycock, E.D.1 aButler, P.C.0 tComparative medicine.g1996 Apr., v. 46, no. 2 p.202-205x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02336naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009500145300001400240500001500254520065300269650001300922650002100935650002700956650001300983650001800996650002401014650001101038650002101049650001201070650002101082650001201103650004101115650007001156650002201226650001501248650002701263650002501290650002501315650001101340650001301351650002001364650001101384650002601395650003301421650002501454653001701479653001501496700001601511700002101527700001801548700001201566773007601578852000901654930003301663945001301696946001301709655001201722IND2051648920221121054356.0960612e199502  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205164892DNAL7 a77526222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvendsen, L.10aDevelopment and comparison of purification strategies for chicken antibodies from egg yolk  ap. 89-93.  a2019-12-05  aWith regard for animal welfare as well as cost, antibodies purified from the egg yolk of immunized chickens are an attractive alternative to antibodies raised in serum of mammals. Various purification strategies based on initial purification by a freeze-and-thaw method followed by one of three precipitation methods- ammonium sulfate, polyethylene glycol 6000, or caprylic acid--were compared. Ammonium sulfate precipitation (25 to 40%) was found to give the best combination of high purity and yield (58%). Moreover, this method is inexpensive and well suited for standard purification of egg yolk antibodies in large scale production facilities. 3afreezing 3aimmunoglobulin G 3achemical precipitation 3aegg yolk 3aoctanoic acid 3apolyethylene glycol 3ayields 3aammonium sulfate 3athawing 2aAmmonium Sulfate 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxisolation & purification 2aAntibodies, Anti-Idiotypicximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCaprylates 2aChemical Precipitation 2aChickensximmunology 2aEgg Yolkximmunology 2aFemale 2aFreezing 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aImmunoelectrophoresis 2aImmunoglobulin Gximmunology 2aPolyethylene Glycols 0apurification 0aproduction1 aCrowley, A.1 aOstergaard, L.H.1 aStodulski, G.1 aHau, J.0 tComparative medicine.g1995 Feb., v. 45, no. 1 p.89-93x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03712naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245010100144300001600245520191500261650000902176650003002185650001702215650002402232650001702256650001902273650001102292650001802303650002502321650001202346650005802358650004302416650001102459650002102470650002902491650000902520650000902529650002302538650004202561650007602603650003202679650005702711650003402768653003002802653002802832700001802860700001502878700001702893700001702910700001802927700001902945773007802964852000903042930003303051945001303084946001303097655001203110IND2080069220221121054443.0980508e199606  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND208006922DNAL7 a87999332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoelz, M.F.10aEfficacy of various therapeutic regimens in eliminating Pasteurella pneumotropica from the mouse  ap. 280-285.  aPasteurella pneumotropica, a gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, can be isolated from the oropharynx, intestinal tract, and reproductive tract of clinically normal mice and has been associated with various clinical syndromes, including conjunctivitis, infections of the reproductive tract, otitis, and subcutaneous abscess formation. Enrofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone bactericidal antimicrobial, has been shown to be effective in eliminating P. multocida from rabbits. We sought to determine whether enrofloxacin would eliminate P. pneumotropica from mice known to be asymptomatically infected with the agent. Pasteurella pneumotropica-positive (culture and immunofluorescence assay) male (n = 55) and female (n = 55) C57BL/6N mice were randomly assigned to one of seven treatment groups or to a control group. These groups were designed to evaluate the efficacy of enrofloxacin administered orally via the drinking water or parenterally at three dosages (8.5, 25.5, and 85.0 mg/kg of body weight per day) over a 14-day treatment period. A tetracycline-treated group (80 mg/kg per day) and an untreated control group were included for comparisons. Repeated oropharyngeal swab and fecal specimens were obtained for culture through posttreatment day 30, and specimens from numerous enteric and reproductive organs collected during necropsy were used to evaluate group differences. Enrofloxacin limited evidence of P. pneumotropica from all sites when administered at 25.5 or 85 mg/kg but not at 8.5 mg/kg by either route for at least 30 days after treatment. Tetracycline-treated and control groups remained consistently culture-positive throughout the study. We concluded that the oral route may be a more practical method for treating large numbers of mice. Enrofloxacin may be a practical and inexpensive alternative to cesarian rederivation or embryo transfer for the elimination of P. pneumotropica in mice. 3amice 3aPasteurella pneumotropica 3aenrofloxacin 3aoral administration 3atetracycline 3adrinking water 3adosage 3aanimal organs 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aFemale 2aFluoroquinolones 2aInjections, Subcutaneous 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPasteurellaxisolation & purification 2aPasteurella Infectionsxdrug therapyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aQuinolonesxtherapeutic use 2aRodent Diseasesxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aTetracyclinextherapeutic use 0aparenteral administration 0aasymptomatic infections1 aThigpen, J.E.1 aMahler, J.1 aRogers, W.P.1 aLocklear, J.1 aWeigler, B.J.1 aForsythe, D.B.0 tComparative medicine.g1996 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.280-285x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01900naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245015800130300001600288500001500304520086800319650001301187650002001200650002101220650002101241650002501262653001201287653002801299653001401327653002501341653002601366653001301392700001601405773006401421852000901485939003301494946001101527655001201538IND9302259220221120150146.0930419e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930225922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrajewski, W.A.10aOrganization of specific DNA sequence elements in the region of the replication origin and matrix attachment site in the chicken alpha-globin gene domain  ap. 381-388.  a2019-12-04  aThe distribution of specific DNA sequence elements in a 2.9 kb HindIII fragment of chicken DNA containing the replication origin and the upstream matrix attachment site (MAR) of the alpha-globin gene domain was investigated.

One of them colocalizes with the previously described MAR element and with the recognition site for a proliferating-cell-specific, DNA-binding protein. The melting pattern of a set of subfragments of the region proved to be non random. No correlation between the distribution of readily melting sequences and bent DNA was found. The possible importance of curved, low-melting and repetitive DNA sequences for the organization of the upstream boundary of the alpha-globin gene domain and the function of the replication origin is discussed. 3achickens 3aDNA replication 3astructural genes 3aDNA conformation 3arepetitive sequences 0aglobins 0amolecular sequence data 0adna bends 0anucleotide sequences 0alow-melting sequences 0abent dna1 aRazin, S.V.0 tMGG.g1992 Nov., v. 235, no. 2/3 p.381-388x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03335naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245007700163300001600240520097200256650002201228650002001250650002001270650001901290650002301309650002501332650001901357650002201376650001801398650001801416650001101434650001001445650001001455650001101465650003501476650002701511650002801538650001401566650003401580650002101614650005001635650001801685650003201703650001801735650001801753650004501771650002801816650001201844650002801856650004201884650004201926650002901968650005001997650001802047650004402065650003002109650001902139650005102158650004002209653002302249700001602272700001802288700001702306700001702323700002402340700001502364700001402379700001402393773006702407852000902474939003302483946001302516655001202529IND9302256620221120140139.0930414e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930225662DNAL7 a84533002pmid7 aPMC1602592pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUknes, S.10aRegulation of pathogenesis-related protein-1a gene expression in tobacco  ap. 159-169.  aPathogenesis-related protein-1a (Pr-1a) is a protein of unknown function that is strongly induced during the onset of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in tobacco. The expression of Pr-1a is under complex regulation that is controlled at least partially by the rate of transcription. In this study, we demonstrated that 661 bp of 5' flanking DNA was sufficient to impart tobacco mosaic virus and salicylic acid inducibility to a reporter gene. The Pr-1a promoter did not respond significantly to treatments with either auxin or cytokinin. Experiments with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide indicated that protein synthesis is required for salicylate-dependent mRNA accumulation. At flowering, the Pr-1a gene was expressed primarily in the mesophyll and epidermal tissues of the leaf blade and the sepals of the flower. Several artifacts, most importantly ectopic expression in pollen, were associated with the use of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3agene expression 3arecombinant DNA 3areporter genes 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3asalicylic acid 3aprotein synthesis 3acycloheximide 3amessenger RNA 3aleaves 3astems 3aroots 3apollen 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenetic transformation 3aplant growth substances 3aflowering 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3apromoter regions 2aAdeninexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aBase Sequence 2aCycloheximidexpharmacology 2aDNAxgenetics 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGlucuronidasexgenetics 2aKinetin 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNaphthaleneacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlantsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxdrug effects 2aSalicylatesxpharmacology 2aSalicylic Acid 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aTobacco Mosaic Virusxpathogenicity 0agenetic regulation1 aDincher, S.1 aFriedrich, L.1 aNegrotto, D.1 aWilliams's'.1 aThompson-Taylor, H.1 aPotter, S.1 aWards, E.1 aRyals, J.0 tPlant cell.g1993 Feb., v. 5, no. 2 p.159-169x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02734naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245009300141300001800234520155100252650001001803650001101813650002501824650001001849650001701859650000901876650001201885650003201897650003501929650003301964650005301997650003102050650000902081650002502090650002602115651001102141653001702152700001602169773006202185852000902247939003302256946001102289655001202300IND9302147120221120140157.0930412s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930214712DNAL7 a19490612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, C.L.10aLocal edema induced by the black-bellied hornet (Vespa basalis) venom and its components  ap. 1033-1042.  aThe black-bellied hornet, (Vespa basalis, is one of the most dangerous species of wasp in Taiwan. The hornet venom possesses a potent edema-inducing activity in addition to its lethal cardiovascular effect. Rat hind-paw edema induced by the venom was inhibited significantly by antiserotonin compounds (cyproheptadine and methysergide) but not by antihistaminics (chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine), betamethasone, cromolyn, indomethacin plus nordihydroguaiaretic acid, cellulose sulfate, aprotinin or captopril. However, chlorpheniramine or betamethasone, when given in combination with cyproheptadine, showed a significant further inhibition of the venom-induced edema. Pretreating the rat with compound 48/80 reduced the edematous response to the venom. Four venom components, i.e. the lethal protein, mastoparan B, fraction 3 (containing protease) and fraction 15 (containing serotonin) were involved in the edematous effect of the venom. Paw edema induced by the crude venom and its protein components (lethal protein, mastoparan B and fraction 3) was similar in their responses to antiserotonin compounds and antihistamine (inhibited by cyproheptadine and methysergide but not by chlorpheniramine), while that induced by fraction 15 was inhibited by both. It is postulated that upon hornet stings, fraction 15 is acting as an exogenous serotonin, while the protein components, especially the lethal protein, are responsible for the release of endogenous autacoids in which serotonin plays the most important role in inducing local edema. 3aVespa 3avenoms 3achemical composition 3aedema 3adrug therapy 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBetamethasonexpharmacology 2aChlorpheniraminexpharmacology 2aCyproheptadinexpharmacology 2aEdemaxchemically inducedxprevention & control. 2aMethysergidexpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aWasp Venomsxtoxicity 3aTaiwan 0aenvenomation1 aHwang, L.L.0 tToxicon.g1991, v. 29, no. 8 p.1033-1042x0041-01017nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02344naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010800165300001600273520096300289592002801252650001801280650001501298650001301313650002701326650002301353650001401376650001701390650001101407650002201418650002101440650003201461650001101493650001901504700001601523700001801539700001801557700001901575700001501594700001401609700001501623773015301638856008601791852000901877655001201886IND60567844820170925000000.0170428e20170428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056784482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b006972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Ting10aMonoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids from Kopsia officinalis and the Immunosuppressive Activity of Rhazinilam  ap. 864-871.  aSix new monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, kopsinidines C–E (1–3), 11,12-methylenedioxychanofruticosinic acid (4), 12-methoxychanofruticosinic acid (5), and N(4)-methylkopsininate (7), as well as chanofruticosinic acid (6, as a natural product) and 23 known alkaloids, were obtained from the twigs and leaves of Kopsia officinalis.

To examine seasonal variation in their causes, nitrogen and carbon were measured in Ulva lactuca in May, July, and September and stable nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios were quantified in U. lactuca, Penn Cove seawater, upwelled water from Saratoga Passage, water near the Skagit River outflow, and effluents from wastewater treatment facilities. Ulvoid growth was nitrogen limited and the sources of nitrogen used by the algae changed during the growing season. Algal nitrogen concentrations were 0.85–4.55% and were highest in September and at sites where algae were abundant. Upwelled waters were the primary nitrogen source for the algae, but anthropogenic sources also contributed to algal growth towards the end of the growing season. This study suggests that small nitrogen inputs can result in crossing a “tipping point”, causing the release of nutrient limitation and localized increases in algal growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUlva lactuca 3aalgal blooms 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon 3acrossing 3aeffluents 3agrowing season 3aisotopes 3amacroalgae 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 0aGreen tides 0aNutrient limitation 0aSeaweed blooms 0aSeasonal variation 0aStable isotopes 0aUlva lactuca0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 103, no. 1-2 p.186-194dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.12.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010100170520167500271592002801946650001001974650001701984650001002001650001602011650001002027650003302037650001402070650001802084650001402102653002002116653002202136653001602158653002202174653001202196653002102208700002302229700001502252700002302267700002202290700001802312700002002330700002002350700002002370700002202390700001602412773012402428856008402552852000902636655001202645IND60731725020221117183735.0220606e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073172502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2021.1071582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYorifuji, Makiko10aUnique environmental Symbiodiniaceae diversity at an isolated island in the northwestern Pacific  aDinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae are intensively investigated as algal symbionts of corals and other invertebrates, underpinning coral reef ecosystems as primary producers. Diversity, including regional diversification, of free-living communities is less studied. In this study, an environmental Symbiodiniaceae community at an isolated island, Okinotori Island, Japan, was investigated to determine whether the community is endemic or common with other locations near continents and major ocean currents. Symbiotic algae in common corals at the island were the same type as those of the corals from other Japanese waters. In the environmental samples, genera Symbiodinium (formerly clade A), Cladocopium (clade C), Durusdinium (clade D), and clades F (including Freudenthalidium), G, and I, were identified through analysis of internal transcribed spacer region 2 of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (ITS2) sequences. Interestingly, some sequences found were genetically different from those of previously reported genera/clades. These unknown sequences were genetically included in the Symbiodiniaceae linage, but they were differentiated from the previously known nine clades. The sequences formed a cluster in the phylogenetic tree based on 28S nrDNA. These sequences were thus considered members of a novel clade in the family (clade J). In total, 120 kinds of ITS2 sequences were produced; while 10 were identical to previously reported sequences, the majority were highly divergent. These genetically unique Symbiodiniaceae types, including novel clade J, may have evolved in isolation and reflect the environmental characteristics of the Okinotori Island.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aSymbiodinium 3aalgae 3acoral reefs 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asymbionts 0aDinoflagellates 0aEnvironmental DNA 0aFree-living 0aNovel clade/genus 0aClade J 0aOkinotori Island1 aYamashita, Hiroshi1 aSuzuki, Go1 aKawasaki, Takayuki1 aTsukamoto, Takuto1 aOkada, Wataru1 aTamura, Keiichi1 aNakamura, Ryota1 aInoue, Masahito1 aYamazaki, Masashi1 aHarii, Saki0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2021 Aug., v. 161 p.107158-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.1071583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011100165300001600276520131700292592002801609650003401637650004401671650002401715650001501739650002501754650001401779650001401793650002401807650001801831650002001849650001101869650002101880650001401901650001201915650001101927650002201938650002101960650000901981650002101990650001402011650002102025650002002046650001302066650001302079650002002092650001102112653003702123653002402160653002302184653002502207653000902232653001502241700001502256700001302271700001402284700001502298773013102313856008702444852000902531655001202540IND60591709420221120045937.0190131e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059170942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Ling10aCharacterization of Se-enriched Pleurotus ostreatus polysaccharides and their antioxidant effects in vitro  ap. 421-429.  aSelenium-enriched polysaccharides have become a major research focus owing to their high anti-oxidant activities. Selenium-enriched Pleurotus ostreatus polysaccharide (Se-POP) and the native polysaccharide (POP) were obtained by hot water extraction from fresh fruiting bodies of P. ostreatus with or without selenium. Se-POP and POP had similar average molecular weights (0.95×104Da and 0.94×104Da, respectively). Se-POP was mainly composed of fucose, rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, and xylose, similar to the composition of POP, but in different molar ratios. In an FT-IR analysis, in comparison to POP, two new absorption peaks at 941cm−1 and 1048cm−1 were observed due to COSe and SeO bonds. In vitro study of DPPH, hydroxyl, and ABTS free radicals, Se-POP had a stronger antioxidant capacity than that of POP. Compared to POP, Se-POP had a superior ability to reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in murine skeletal muscle (C2C12) cells. In general, selenium in Se-POP contributed to high antioxidant and biological activities. Se-POP acts as a potent antioxidant and has the ability to prevent oxidation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals in humans. These results suggest that Se-POP is a candidate dietary supplement for functional foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3aarabinose 3adietary supplements 3afree radicals 3afruiting bodies 3afucose 3afunctional foods 3agalactose 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro studies 3amice 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apolysaccharides 3arhamnose 3aselenium 3askeletal muscle 3axylose 0aSelenium-enriched polysaccharide 0aPleurotus ostreatus 0aChemical structure 0aAntioxidant activity 0aH2O2 0aC2C12 cell1 aZhao, Yana1 aYu, Juan1 aJi, Haiyu1 aLiu, Anjun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.421-429dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011100165300001600276500001900292520136400311592002801675596005901703596008001762596007801842596006601920596005001986596008302036596009302119650002302212650002502235650001802260650002302278650001602301650001002317650002902327650001402356650002802370700001502398700001602413700001802429700001302447700001302460700001702473700002002490700001802510700001502528700005702543700005102600700001802651773011202669856008202781852000902863655001202872IND60736218520221120072007.0210504e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073621852DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-021-00319-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lihua10aIncreasing Long-Chain Dicarboxylic Acid Production in Candida tropicalis by Engineering Fatty Transporters  ap. 544-555.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCandida tropicalis can metabolize alkanes or fatty acids to produce long-chain dicarboxylic acids (DCAs). Fatty acid transporters located on the cell or peroxisome membrane may play an important role in this process. Using amino acid sequence homologous alignment, two putative proteins, CtFat1p and CtPxa1p, located on the cell and peroxisome membrane were found, respectively. Moreover, single- and double-knockout homologous recombination technology was used to study ctfat1p and ctpxa1p gene effects on DCA synthesis. In comparison to the wild-type strain, long-chain DCA yield decreased by 65.14%, 88.38% and 56.19% after single and double-copy knockout of ctfat1p genes and double-copy knockout of ctpxa1p genes, respectively, indicating that the knockout of ctfat1p and ctpxa1p genes had a significant effect on the conversion of oils and fats into long-chain DCAs by C. tropicalis. However, the yield of long-chain DCAs increased by 21.90% after single-knockout of the ctpxa1p gene, indicating that the single-knockout of the ctpxa1p gene may reduce fatty acid transport to peroxisome for further oxidation. Moreover, to improve the intracellular transport rate of fatty acids, ctfat1p copy number increased, increasing DCA yield by 30.10%. These results may provide useful information for enhancing the production of long-chain DCAs by C. tropicalis.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801527cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019JZZY011003cFocus on Research and Development Plan in Shandong Province  a2018YFJH0401cFocus on Research and Development Plan in Shandong Province  a2019YFC1905900cNational Key Research and Development Project  atscy20180103cTaishan industry leading talent  aZR2017ZB0208cMajor Program of National Natural Science Foundation of Shandong  asdsynbio-2018-PY-02cSynthetic Biology Technology Innovation Center of Shandong Province 3aCandida tropicalis 3aamino acid sequences 3abiotechnology 3adicarboxylic acids 3afatty acids 3agenes 3ahomologous recombination 3aoxidation 3aphysiological transport1 aXiu, Xiang1 aWang, Zirui1 aJiang, Yanjun1 aFan, Han1 aSu, Jing1 aSui, Songsen1 aWang, Songjiang1 aWang, Ruiming1 aLi, Junlin1 aWang, Junqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9862-23661 aLi, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1919-97021 aWang, Jianbin0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2021 June, v. 63, no. 6 p.544-555dSpringer USwJournal:jnl52132x1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-021-00319-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245012600197300001800323520084900341592002801190650001401218650001001232650001301242650001201255700001401267700005701281700005701338773014601395856007701541852000901618655001201627IND60769140420221122041620.0220303e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076914042DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c129342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Minhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5036-163510aOn the Origin of Rh-Catalyzed Selective Ring-Opening Amidation of Substituted Cyclopropanols to Access β²-Amino Ketones  ap. 3667-3675.  aβ²-Amino carbonyls, an α-substituted β-amino scaffold, hold a prominent place in the development of new pharmaceuticals and peptidomimetics. Herein, we report a highly efficient Rh-catalyzed ring-opening amidation of substituted cyclopropanols, which turned out to serve as a linchpin for the selective synthesis of β²-amino ketones to outcompete the formation of β³-isomers. Instead of the generally accepted rationale to consider steric factors for the β²-selectivity, orbital interaction was elucidated to play a more critical role in the amidative ring-opening of cyclopropanols to generate the key Rh–C intermediate. Subsequent inner-sphere acylnitrene transfer was achieved in excellent efficiency (TON > 5000) by using readily accessible dioxazolones as the amino source to afford β²-amino ketones with broad applicability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3adrugs 3ajournals 3aketones1 aHeo, Joon1 aKim, Dongwook1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4432-371X1 aChang, Sukbok1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9069-09460 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 144, no. 8 p.3667-3675dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c129343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012400167500001900291520181200310592002802122650002602150650002502176650001502201650000902216650001602225650001702241650001902258650002402277650001002301653003502311653002402346653001902370653001202389700001702401700001802418700001202436700001602448700001602464700001802480700001602498700001702514700001702531700001502548773010502563856008502668852000902753655001202762IND60720937420221116143014.0210121e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072093742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1038482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Benjuan10aMicrobial metabolic efficiency and community stability in high and low fertility soils following wheat residue addition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil microbial metabolic efficiency and microbial community stability following the amendment of plant residue to soils are of great importance to the improvement of soil carbon storage and soil fertility. However, heterogeneity of microbial metabolic efficiency and community stability in soils with different fertility defined based on the crop yield, as well as the underlying mechanisms still remains elusive. Here, soils with high and low fertility (HF and LF) were incubated with ¹³C-labeled wheat residue and analyzed periodically for microbial metabolic quotient and functional bacterial populations using DNA-stable isotope probing technique combined with high-throughput sequencing. Results revealed that soil organic matter (SOM) decomposers following wheat residue amendment were suppressed in HF but stimulated in LF, leading to a higher microbial metabolic efficiency and lower priming effect in HF. This difference in SOM decomposers' responses could be due to that microbes in nutrient- limited LF has to mine recalcitrant SOM for nutrient requirement to support the utilization of wheat residue, the ample nutrients in HF, however, render the microbes to directly utilize wheat residue. Both the resistance (disturbance stability) and resilience (temporal stability) of bacterial community were higher in HF than in LF following disturbance of wheat residue addition. Higher abundance and lower composition variation of wheat residue decomposers in HF than in LF might result in the higher stability of microbial community in HF. The results suggest that plant residue amendment to fertile soils is likely more effective for soil carbon accumulation and soil fertility buildup than to infertile soils, due to higher microbial metabolic efficiency and higher microbial community stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial communities 3acarbon sequestration 3acrop yield 3asoil 3asoil carbon 3asoil ecology 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic matter 3awheat 0aMicrobial metabolic efficiency 0aCommunity stability 0aPriming effect 0aDNA-SIP1 aBei, Qicheng1 aWang, Xiaojie1 aLiu, Qi1 aHu, Shuijin1 aLin, Zhibin1 aZhang, Yanhui1 aLin, Xingwu1 aJin, Haiyang1 aHu, Tianlong1 aXie, Zubin0 tApplied soil ecology.g2021 Mar., v. 159 p.103848-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1038483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245006200178300001600240520146000256592002801716650002301744650001401767650001901781650001101800650001101811653001101822653001401833653001001847653002001857653001101877653001101888700002401899700002601923700002401949700002301973700003201996700002502028773010602053856008702159852000902246655001202255IND60536206720221116141637.0190410e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053620672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStolarski, Mariusz J.10aEconomic comparison of growing different willow cultivars  ap. 210-215.  aThe aim of this study was to assess the cost, income and revenue of chips produced from seven new willow cultivars harvested in three-year harvest rotations. In the base scenario, the willow biomass yield varied greatly from one cultivar to another and the cost of producing chips ranged from 89.1 € Mg−1 d.m. to 57.1 € Mg−1 d.m. for UWM 155 and UWM 006, respectively. The highest revenue in the base scenario (537 € ha−1 year−1) was achieved in the plantation with the highest-yielding cultivar UWM 006.A sensitivity analysis showed that the change in the biomass price and change in energy content of willow biomass had a much greater effect on the final revenue than a change in the yield level. When the price increased by 10%, the revenue from growing different cultivars increased by 33–92%, whereas when the yield increased by 10%, the revenue from growing different cultivars increased by 13–20%. Shortening the transport distance from 50 to 25 km increased the final revenue by 14–36%. An increase in the transport distance to 100 km decreased the final revenue by 28–73%, and when the transport distance increased to 200 km, only the production of UWM 006 and UWM 043 cultivars brought any positive revenue. It is important to find willow varieties with a high energy content because a higher yield of Mg d.m. per hectare will cause the costs per hectare increase but the costs per Mg d.m. and GJ will decrease.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acultivars 3aenergy content 3aincome 3aprices 0aWillow 0aVarieties 0aYield 0aProduction cost 0aIncome 0aPoland1 aRosenqvist, Håkan,1 aKrzyżaniak, Michał,1 aSzczukowski, Stefan1 aTworkowski, Józef1 aGołaszewski, J.q(Janusz),1 aOlba-Zięty, Ewelina0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Oct., v. 81 p.210-215dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008900168300001600257520082800273592002801101650002101129650002401150650002201174650002601196650001401222650002201236650001601258650001701274650004401291650001801335650001601353650001901369700002001388700001801408700002301426700002601449700002601475700002301501700002201524700002401546700003001570773015301600856008601753852000901839655001201848IND60567845020170925000000.0170428e20170428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056784502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b007602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGindro, Katia10aGeneration of Antifungal Stilbenes Using the Enzymatic Secretome of Botrytis cinerea  ap. 887-898.  aThe protein secretome of Botrytis cinerea was used to perform the biotransformation of resveratrol, pterostilbene, and a mixture of both.

The [Fe((Rₐ)-BINSate)]⁺ catalyst was designed as a chiral version of FeCl₃ with multicoordination sites available for binding the two coupling partners 1 and 2 as well as the oxidant.

These temporally dynamic ecosystems contain unique assemblages of animals adapted to cyclically wet–dry habitats. As a result of the high variation in environmental conditions, wetlands serve as hotspots for animal movement and potentially hotspots of biogeochemical activity and migratory transport of nutrient subsidies. Most amphibians are semi-aquatic and migrate between isolated wetlands and the surrounding terrestrial system to complete their life cycle, with rainfall and other environmental factors affecting the timing and magnitude of wetland export of juveniles. Here we used a long-term drift fence study coupled with system-specific nutrient content data of amphibians from two small wetlands in southeastern Georgia, USA. We couple environmental data with count data of juveniles exiting wetlands to explore the controls of amphibian diversity, production and export and the amphibian life-history traits associated with export over varying environmental conditions. Our results highlight the high degree of spatial and temporal variability in amphibian flux with hydroperiod length and temperature driving community composition and overall biomass and nutrient fluxes. Additionally, specific life-history traits, such as development time and body size, were associated with longer hydroperiods. Our findings underscore the key role of small, isolated wetlands and their hydroperiod characteristics in maintaining amphibian productivity and community dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3abody size 3acommunity structure 3aecological function 3aexports 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amigratory behavior 3anutrient content 3arain 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awetlands 3aGeorgia1 aKnapp, Daniel D.1 aSmith, Lora L.0 tDiversity.g2021 Nov. 20, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d131105983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245009100184300001600275520114600291592002801437650001401465650001801479650001501497650002301512650001701535650002501552650002901577650001301606650002001619653001701639653001801656653001001674653001201684653001501696653001501711653001301726700002301739700002401762700002601786700002201812700002401834700002801858700002601886773011801912856008802030852000902118655001202127IND60525015020221120060148.0190318e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052501502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade-la-Ossa-Carretero, J.A.10aBioindicators as metrics for environmental monitoring of desalination plant discharges  ap. 313-318.  aDevelopment of desalination projects requires simple methodologies and tools for cost-effective and environmentally-sensitive management. Sentinel taxa and biotic indices are easily interpreted in the perspective of environment management. Echinoderms are potential sentinel taxon to gauge the impact produced by brine discharge and the BOPA index is considered an effective tool for monitoring different types of impact. Salinity increase due to desalination brine discharge was evaluated in terms of these two indicators. They reflected the environmental impact and recovery after implementation of a mitigation measure. Echinoderms disappeared at the station closest to the discharge during the years with highest salinity and then recovered their abundance after installation of a diffuser reduced the salinity increase. In the same period, BOPA responded due to the decrease in sensitive amphipods and the increase in tolerant polychaete families when salinities rose. Although salinity changes explained most of the observed variability in both indicators, other abiotic parameters were also significant in explaining this variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aEchinodermata 3aPolychaeta 3acost effectiveness 3adesalination 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental monitoring 3asalinity 3awater pollution 0aDesalination 0aMediterranean 0aBrine 0aBenthos 0aBOPA index 0aEchinoderm 0aSalinity1 aDel-Pilar-Ruso, Y.1 aLoya-Fernández, A.1 aFerrero-Vicente, L.M.1 aMarco-Méndez, C.1 aMartinez-Garcia, E.1 aGiménez-Casalduero, F.1 aSánchez-Lizaso, J.L.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 103, no. 1-2 p.313-318dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013800159300001600297500001900313520147900332592002801811650002401839650002301863650001901886650001301905650001301918650001201931650001601943650001501959650001201974650001101986650001101997650001302008650001502021651001002036651002502046653001502071653002702086653002102113653003002134700002402164700002702188700002002215700003202235700001802267700002002285700002202305700002002327700002002347773013502367856007402502852000902576655001202585IND60737198120221117163209.0210514e20201207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073719812DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/nvaa1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBodino, Nicola10aDispersal of Philaenus spumarius (Hemiptera: Aphrophoridae), a Vector of Xylella fastidiosa, in Olive Grove and Meadow Agroecosystems  ap. 267-279.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe introduction of the Xylella fastidiosa Wells bacterium into Apulia (South Italy) has caused the massive dieback of olive trees, and is threatening olive production throughout the Mediterranean Region. The key vector of X. fastidiosa in Europe is the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius L. The dispersal capabilities of P. spumarius are poorly known, despite being a key parameter for the prediction of the spread of the bacterium. In this study, we have examined the dispersal of P. spumarius adults in two different agroecosystems in Italy: an olive grove in Apulia (Southern Italy) and a meadow in Piedmont (Northern Italy). Insects were marked with albumin and released during seven independent trials over 2 yr. The recapture data were pooled separately for each agroecosystem and used to estimate the dispersal kernels of P. spumarius in the olive grove and in the meadow. The diffusion coefficient estimate for P. spumarius was higher in the meadow than in the olive grove.The median distance from the release point for 1 d of dispersal was 26 m in the olive grove and 35 m in the meadow. On the basis of our model, we estimated that 50% of the spittlebug population remained within 200 m (98% within 400 m) during the 2 mo period of high abundance of the vector on olives in Apulia.The dispersal of P. spumarius is thus limited to some hundreds of meters throughout the whole year, although it can be influenced to a great extent by the structure of the agroecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilaenus spumarius 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aagroecosystems 3aalbumins 3abacteria 3adieback 3adiffusivity 3aentomology 3ameadows 3amodels 3aolives 3apiedmont 3aprediction 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 0aspittlebug 0amark-release-recapture 0adispersal kernel 0aXylella fastidiosa spread1 aCavalieri, Vincenzo1 aDongiovanni, Crescenza1 aSimonetto, Anna1 aSaladini, Matteo Alessandro1 aPlazio, Elisa1 aGilioli, Gianni1 aMolinatto, Giulia1 aSaponari, Maria1 aBosco, Domenico0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2020 Dec. 7, v. 50, no. 2 p.267-279dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3243x0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaa1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009600173300001600269520132900285592002801614650001101642650000901653650001401662650001601676650001501692650001201707650001801719650001201737650002201749650002101771650001901792650001601811700002401827700002001851700002701871700001901898700001801917700001701935700001901952700002001971700002101991773015302012856008602165852000902251655001202260IND60567845120170925000000.0170428e20170428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056784512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b007712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinämäki, Jyrki10aSuberin Fatty Acids from Outer Birch Bark: Isolation and Physical Material Characterization  ap. 916-924.  aThe isolation and physical material properties of suberin fatty acids (SFAs) were investigated with special reference to their potential applications as novel pharmaceutical excipients. SFAs were isolated from outer birch bark (OBB) with a new extractive hydrolysis method. The present simplified isolation process resulted in a moderate batch yield and chemical purity of SFAs, but further development is needed for establishing batch-to-batch variation. Cryogenic milling was the method of choice for the particle size reduction of SFAs powder. The cryogenically milled SFAs powder exhibited a semicrystalline structure with apparent microcrystalline domains within an amorphous fatty acids matrix. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of SFAs samples showed a good thermal stability up to 200 °C, followed by a progressive weight loss, reaching a plateau at about 95% volatilization at about 470 °C. The binary blends of SFAs and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC; Avicel PH 101) in a ratio of 25:75 (w/w) displayed good powder flow and tablet compression properties. The corresponding theophylline-containing tablets showed sustained or prolonged-release characteristics. The physicochemical and bulk powder properties of SFAs isolated from OBB are auspicious in terms of potential pharmaceutical excipient applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3abark 3acellulose 3afatty acids 3ahydrolysis 3amilling 3aparticle size 3asuberin 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3avolatilization 3aweight loss1 aPirttimaa, Minni M.1 aAlakurtti, Sami1 aPitkänen, H.

A significant association has been reported between a SNP (AB604331, g.420 C>A) in the cholecystokinin type A receptor gene and growth traits in some Japanese slow-growing chickens. This genetic improvement effect was examined in Amakusa Daioh cross chickens by comparing superior A allele-fixed chickens with conventional ones. Fattening experiments using 436 conventional and 297 improved (A allele-fixed) Amakusa Daioh cross birds were performed over two seasons. In each season, experimental birds of both sexes were hatched on the same day, raised in the same chicken house, and fed the same diet ad libitum for 15 wk for cockerels and 19 wk for pullets, after which they were slaughtered. Body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), and carcass weights were measured. SNP genotypes were determined using mismatch amplification mutation assay. Association between the SNP and growth traits was analyzed using GLM, taking into account gender, season, genetic additive and dominance, and test group effects. The improved pullets were significantly heavier than the conventional pullets at slaughter age. Boneless carcasses of the improved pullets were significantly heavier than those of the conventional pullets as well. In the conventional cockerels, significantly positive additive effects of the A allele on BW were detected during the entire experimental period, except at 10 and 11 wk. Significantly positive additive effects of the A allele on thigh weight were detected. We concluded that g.420 C>A is a good selective marker for increased slaughter live weight and meat weight in Amakusa Daioh cross chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aage at slaughter 3aalleles 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acholecystokinin 3adiet 3agenetic improvement 3ahybrids 3ameat 3amismatch amplification mutation assay 3apoultry housing 3aresearch 0achicken 0aAmakusa Daioh cross chicken 0acholecystokinin type A receptor gene 0agrowth traits 0asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aTsusaki, T.1 aYamashita, H.1 aTakahashi, H.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2021 Sept., v. 30, no. 3 p.100166-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2021.1001663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245009600207300001600303520192600319592002802245650001402273650002202287650002402309650001802333650001302351650001502364650001902379650000902398650001302407650001302420650001802433650002102451650001302472650001802485653002002503653002102523653002102544653003002565653002102595700001802616700006002634700005602694700002402750773009702774856008502871852000902956655001202965IND60644874720221118114459.0191010e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064487472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.05.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Baat, M.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1559-322X10aEffect-based nationwide surface water quality assessment to identify ecotoxicological risks  ap. 434-443.  aA large portion of the toxic effects observed in surface waters cannot be attributed to compounds regularly measured by water authorities. Hence, there is an urgent need for an effect-based monitoring strategy that employs bioassays to identify environmental risks. The aim of the present study was to perform an effect-based nationwide water quality assessment to identify ecotoxicological risks in a wide variety of surface waters. At 45 locations silicone rubbers and polar organic chemical integrative samplers were exposed to surface water for 6 weeks. Alongside the passive samplers an in-situ daphnid test was performed. Subsequent to field exposure, accumulated compounds were extracted from the passive samplers after which a battery of in vivo and in vitro bioassays was exposed to the extracts. The bioassay battery was selected such that it could identify the risks posed by a wide range of chemical pollutants and their transformation products, while simultaneously allowing for targeted identification of groups of compounds that cause specific effects. Bioassay responses were compared to effect-based trigger values to identify potential ecotoxicological risks at the investigated locations. Responses were observed in all bioassays, and trigger values were exceeded in 9 out of the 21 applied assays, allowing for ranking of the investigated locations based on ecotoxicological risks. No relationship between land use and the identification of ecotoxicological risks was observed. Based on the results, considerations regarding future improvements of effect-based monitoring are given. It is concluded that effect-based water quality assessment allowed prioritization of sites based on ecotoxicological risks, identified the presence of hazardous compounds regardless of being listed as priority substances, and meanwhile could prevent costly chemical analysis at sites with low ecotoxicological risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3achemical analysis 3achemical pollutants 3aecotoxicology 3aland use 3amonitoring 3aprioritization 3arisk 3asamplers 3asilicone 3asurface water 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3awater quality 0aMicropollutants 0aBioassay battery 0aPassive sampling 0aWater framework directive 0aWater monitoring1 aKraak, M.H.S.1 aVan der Oost, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4881-089X1 aDe Voogt, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9065-97971 aVerdonschot, P.F.M.0 tWater research.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 159 p.434-443dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.05.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012500167300001200292520129600304592002801600596011301628650001401741650000901755650001401764650002901778650002101807650001101828650002201839650001801861650002401879650001501903650001701918700001701935700001701952700001401969700001401983700005101997773013502048856008302183852000902266655001202275IND60778400720221117060723.0220608e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077840072DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-022-10421-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Guangjie10aSoil water transport and plant water use patterns in subsidence fracture zone due to coal mining using isotopic labeling  ap. 310.  aWith more underground coal mining, soil subsidence and fracture have increasingly developed and resulted in changed hydrological progress; however, the effects of subsidence fracture on plant water uptake patterns remain largely unknown. This study aimed at investigating whether there were variations in soil water transport and plant water use patterns in subsidence fracture zone and fracture-free zone compared to the non-mining areas. The isotopically labeled water (²H) injection experiments were conducted and the MixSIAR model was used to explore the mechanism of soil water infiltration and water sources of Artemisia Desertorum in a semi-arid coal-mining area. The results showed that: (1) the proportion of the preferential flow in the subsidence fracture zone from the water balance equation was 18.2%; (2) in non-mining zone, 59.7% of water used by Artemisia Desertorum was from the 10–20 cm soil profile layer; (3) in the fracture-free zone, 46.6% and 39.4% of water were from the 40–60 cm and 0–10 cm layers, respectively; and (4) in the subsidence fracture zone, 85.9% of water derived mainly from the 40–60 cm layer. This study provided new insights into soil water transport and plant water uptake patterns in the subsidence fracture zone of coal-mining areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aGJNY-18-73.15cOpen Fund of State Key Laboratory of Water Resource Protection and Utilization in Coal Mining 3aArtemisia 3acoal 3aequations 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aisotope labeling 3amodels 3apreferential flow 3asoil profiles 3asoil water movement 3asubsidence 3awater uptake1 aGuo, Junting1 aSong, Ziheng1 aFeng, Hao1 aChen, Shi1 aLi, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0376-72370 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2022 June, v. 81, no. 11 p.310-310dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10421-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005600092040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100001400193245010700207300001600314500002400330500001500354520114800369650001701517650001801534650001801552650001601570650001601586650001201602650000901614650001801623650001801641650001101659650002301670650001001693653002001703653002501723700001801748773014001766852000901906856010601915930003302021945002502054946001302079655001202092IND4417898820221116160728.0090319e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441789882DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2008)101[881:HCWAID]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aCalvo, D.10aHead Capsule Width and Instar Determination for Larvae of Streblote panda (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae)  ap. 881-886.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe moth Streblote panda Hübner (1820) (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) is an ornamental and fruit plant pest in southwestern Andalusia. Analysis of head capsule width of 387 larvae reared on different host plants (Pistacea lentisco L., Arbutus unedo L., Citrus reticulata Blanco, Retama sphaerocarpa (L.) Boiss, Spartium junceum L., Tamarix gallica L., and Vaccinium spp.) indicates that growth rate between instars does not fit well to Dyar's rule. The number of instars varied from 5 to 8. Head capsule width could be used directly to determine developmental stage of individual in almost all host plants used. Only for larvae fed on S. junceum, R. sphaerocarpa, Vaccinium corymbosum L. 'Sharpblue', and Vaccinium ashei Reade 'Bonita', beyond third instar, did the range of measurements overlap. These data were analyzed using a combination of statistical methods. A nonlinear least-squares approach was used to determine width means and ranges for each instar, and misclassification probabilities were calculated for each overlapping instar using Z statistics for all head capsule widths. Various factors are discussed to explain the results. 3ainsect pests 3anursery crops 3aLasiocampidae 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3ainstars 3ahead 3agrowth models 3adata analysis 3alarvae 3ainsect development 3awidth 0aStreblote panda 0adevelopmental stages1 aMolina, J.

By comparing three polymers (P1, P2 and P3) and five activated carbons (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4 and AC5) phases, P2 (a modified pyrrolidone polymer) and AC4 coatings showed much higher selectivity and capacity through BAμE, where the former offers multiple mechanisms of interaction and faster equilibrium kinetics. Assays performed on 25mL of ultra-pure water samples spiked at the 8.0μg/L level, yielded recoveries ranging from 76.6±8.3% to 103.5±6.4% depending on the sorbent phase used (P2 or AC4), under optimized experimental conditions. The analytical performance showed convenient detection limits (0.3–0.5μg/L) and good linear dynamic ranges (1.0–24.0μg/L) with remarkable determination coefficients (r²>0.9969). Excellent repeatability was also achieved through intraday (RSD<13.0%) and interday (RSD<8.9%) experiments. By using the standard addition methodology, the application of the present analytical approach on sea water, wastewater, commercial cosmetic products and urine samples revealed good sensitivity, absence of matrix effects and the occurrence of levels of some benzophenones. The proposed methodology that uses nanostructured particles and operates under the floating sampling technology proved to be a sorption-based static micro-extraction alternative to monitor benzophenone-type UV filters in real matrices. Moreover, is easy to implement, reliable, sensitive, requiring low sample volume and the possibility to choose the most selective sorbent coating according to the target compounds involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzophenones 3amicroextraction 3apyrrolidones 3aactivated carbon 3adetection limit 3aurine 3acoatings 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aseawater 3apolymers 3awastewater 3afilters 3adesorption 0abenzophenone1 aStępkowska, A.1 aAlegre, A.1 aNogueira, J.M.F.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Oct. 11, v. 1311 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009000176300001600266520173900282592002802021650001302049650001402062650002302076650001902099650004102118650001202159650001102171650001802182650001102200650004402211650001402255650002002269650001002289650001902299650001402318650002202332650002002354653001902374653000802393653000902401653001102410653002102421653001702442700006302459700002402522700002302546700002102569700002402590700001702614700001602631700002002647773010602667856008702773852000902860655001202869IND60536207020221116141807.0190410e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053620702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRío, José C. del,10aDifferences in the chemical structure of the lignins from sugarcane bagasse and straw  ap. 322-338.  aTwo major residues are produced by the sugarcane industry, the fibrous fraction following juice extraction (bagasse), and the harvest residue (straw). The structures of the lignins from these residues were studied by pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and derivatization followed by reductive cleavage (DFRC). Whereas the lignin from bagasse has a syringyl-rich p-hydroxyphenyl:guaiacyl:syringyl (H:G:S) molar composition of 2:38:60, the lignin from straw is guaiacyl-rich (H:G:S of 4:68:28). The compositional differences were also reflected in the relative abundances of the different interunit linkages. Bagasse lignin was primarily β–O–4′ alkyl-aryl ether substructures (representing 83% of NMR-measurable linkages), followed by minor amounts of β–5′ (phenylcoumarans, 6%) and other condensed substructures. The lignin from straw has lower levels of β-ethers (75%) but higher relative levels of phenylcoumarans (β–5′, 15%) and dibenzodioxocins (5–5/4–O–β, 3%), consistent with a lignin enriched in G-units. Both lignins are extensively acylated at the γ-hydroxyl of the lignin side-chain (42% and 36% acylation in bagasse and straw), predominantly with p-coumarates (preferentially on S-units) but also with acetates (preferentially on G-units) to a minor extent. Tetrahydrofuran structures diagnostically arising from β–β-coupling (dehydrodimerization) of sinapyl p-coumarate or its cross-coupling with sinapyl alcohol were found in both lignins, indicating that sinapyl p-coumarate acts as a monomer participating in lignification. The flavone tricin was also found in the lignins from sugarcane, as also occurs in other grasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacylation 3achemical structure 3aderivatization 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrasses 3ajuices 3alignification 3alignin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apyrolysis 3asinapyl alcohol 3astraw 3asugar industry 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3atetrahydrofuran 0aSaccharum spp. 0aNMR 0aDFRC 0aTricin 0aLignin acylation 0ap-Coumarates1 aLino, Alessandro G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0281-289X1 aColodette, Jorge L.1 aLima, Cláudio F.,1 aGutiérrez, Ana,1 aMartinez, Angel T.,1 aLu, Fachuang1 aRalph, John1 aRencoret, Jorge0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Oct., v. 81 p.322-338dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03724naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013100168300001400299520233400313592002802647650001302675650001202688650001202700650001102712650001602723650001602739650001102755650005002766650002202816650001902838650002302857650001102880651001002891651001102901651002502912651001802937651001802955651001902973700001502992700001803007700001303025700001803038773009103056856008603147852000903233655001203242IND60089260120221120124619.0141102e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008926012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Meij, A.10aEMAC model evaluation and analysis of atmospheric aerosol properties and distribution with a focus on the Mediterranean region  ap. 38-69.  aThe skill of the EMAC atmospheric chemistry-climate model to predict the aerosol optical depth (AOD) is evaluated by comparing with remote sensing data products from AERONET, MODIS, MISR and CALIOP with a focus on the Mediterranean region. In addition, calculated aerosol concentrations are compared with measurements from the CASTNET, IMPROVE, EMEP, EANET and CAWNET networks. Calculated sulphate concentrations are in good agreement with the measurements, whilst the agreement is less satisfactory for ammonium and nitrate, possibly because of measurement artefacts. The model reproduces the main spatial atmospheric distribution of the sulphate and ammonium aerosols. For nitrate some differences are found when compared to observations. The analysis of black and organic carbon (BC and OC) over Europe shows that the model typically overestimates observed BC concentrations by a factor of 1.6 and underestimates OC by a factor of 2.6. For the USA BC and OC are in general overestimated and for China BC and OC are in general underestimated by the model. The seasonal distribution of elevated AODs is well represented by the model when compared to MODIS and MISR, though AODs are somewhat low-biased. Calculated annual mean AODs are in general lower than of AERONET and the temporal correlation coefficients vary between 0.11 and 0.68. High temporal correlation coefficients are found for biomass burning regions (South America and West Africa), indicating that the seasonal cycle of this source category is well represented in the model, based on the GFED inventory. High temporal correlation coefficients are obtained for the Mediterranean region during summer, which indicates that the model captures the dust intrusions. Our model calculations show that inorganic particles and associated water are the most abundant aerosol components over Europe, North America and Asia, whilst over the Mediterranean during summer dust dominates the total AOD. An analysis of the meridional vertical distribution of model calculated dust indicates good agreement with CALIOP observations for locations near the Mediterranean and over northern Africa. The modelled underestimation of the AODs over Europe and the USA is larger at low than at high relative humidity, indicating that the concentrations of hygroscopic aerosols are too low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3ainventories 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3arelative humidity 3aremote sensing 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aChina 3aEurope 3aMediterranean region 3aSouth America 3aUnited States 3aWestern Africa1 aPozzer, A.1 aPringle, K.J.1 aTost, H.1 aLelieveld, J.0 tAtmospheric research.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 114-115 p.38-69dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245007300217300001600290520076800306592002801074650001901102650001001121650002301131650001101154650001501165650001401180650001801194650002101212650001801233650001001251653002701261653002201288653002001310653002301330653001501353653002701368700006101395700001601456700005701472700001801529700006401547700006601611773011301677856008601790852000901876655001201885IND60731725620221117183656.0210713e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073172562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2021.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalma-Guerrero, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0867-760110aTake-All Disease: New Insights into an Important Wheat Root Pathogen  ap. 836-848.  aTake-all disease, caused by the fungal root pathogen Gaeumannomyces tritici, is considered to be the most important root disease of wheat worldwide.

(122) samples were collected from external wounds (head, abdomen, back and leg) during different seasons. One isolate (124B) was identified using whole-genome sequence analysis. RAST software identified 31 virulent genes of disease and defense, including methicillin-resistant genes, TatR family and ANT(4′)-Ib. Plasmid rep22 was identified by PlasmidFindet-2.0 Server and a CRISPR. MILST-2.0 predicted many novel alleles. NCBI notated the genome as a novel M. caseolyticus strain (DaniaSudan). The MLST₋tree₋V1 revealed that DaniaSudan and KM0211a strains were interrelated. Strain DaniaSudan was resistant to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, erythromycin, oxacillin, clindamycin and kanamycin. Mice modeling showed bacteremia and many clinical signs (swelling, allergy, wounds, and hair loss). Enlargement, hyperemia, adhesions and abscesses were observed in many organs.Constructive conclusionThe prevalence of the strain was 4.73%, with significant differences between collection seasons and locations of wounds. A highly significant association between doses (10⁵ CFU/ml, 10² CFU/ml, Intra-peritoneum and sub-cutaneous) and swelling, developing of allergy and loss of hair (p = 0.001, p = 0.000 and p = 0.005) respectively were seen.This result represents the first report of pathogenic strains of M. caseolyticus worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrococcus caseolyticus 3aabdomen 3aalopecia 3abacteremia 3aceftazidime 3aciprofloxacin 3aclindamycin 3acomputer software 3aerythromycin 3ahyperemia 3ahypersensitivity 3akanamycin 3aoxacillin 3aplasmids 3asequence analysis 3aveterinary medicine 3avirulence 3avirulent strains1 aAllam, Mushal1 aAltayb, Hisham N.1 aMursi, D.1 aAdalla, M.

A single year of defoliation has no significant impact on the trees, whereas continuous defoliation events could be fatal. How birch species avoid serious damage caused by gypsy moth outbreak is yet to be revealed. Trichomes on leaf surfaces of birch trees are an effective antiherbivore defense strategy. We examined a 1-yr delayed induction of glandular (GT) and nonglandular trichomes (NGT) on leaf surfaces caused by stress in white birch (Betula platyphylla Sukaczev var. japonica [Miq.] Hara) and monarch birch (Betula maximowicziana Regel). Saplings were subjected to four treatments in June 2009: herbivory (50% of the leaf area was grazed by gypsy moths), mechanical cutting (50% of the leaf area was cut using scissors), shading (50% light shading with a black sheet), and control (covered with a net to prevent herbivory). Then, the density of GT and NGT on early leaves was determined in April 2010. In both birch species, the density of GT was higher in herbivory than in other treatments. The density of GT due to mechanical cutting was higher than that in the control, but only for white birch. However, the density of NGT was lower after mechanical cutting than in other treatments for white birch. There were no differences in the density of NGT among treatments for monarch birch. These results show that 1-yr delayed induction of GT by herbivory was stronger in white birch than in monarch birch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula maximowicziana 3aBetula pendula subsp. mandshurica 3aErebidae 3aLymantria dispar 3adefoliation 3aentomology 3aherbivores 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3atrichomes 0adelayed induction 0aglandular trichome 0anonglandular trichome 0abirch 0agypsy moth1 aToki, Rika1 aWatanabe, Yōko,1 aMasaka, Kazuhiko0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2020 Dec. 18, v. 50, no. 2 p.427-432dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3243x0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvaa1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245010400163300001800267520050700285592002800792650001600820650001300836650001600849650001300865700006100878700001700939700001500956700002100971700002400992700001601016700001901032700001701051700002001068700005901088700001601147700005501163700001901218700002401237700005901261773014601320856007701466852000901543655001201552IND60769141020221121110156.0220303e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076914102DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c135552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhipeng A.10aHistone H2B Deacylation Selectivity: Exploring Chromatin’s Dark Matter with an Engineered Sortase  ap. 3360-3364.  aWe describe a new method to produce histone H2B by semisynthesis with an engineered sortase transpeptidase.

The GSRHS model uses the transmission function (Tf,ᵢⱼ), which was developed to control hourly global solar radiation, for predicting solar radiation. The inputs of the model were: hour of day, day (Julian) of year, optimized parameter values, solar constant (H₀), latitude, and longitude of the location of interest. The parameter values used in the model were optimized at a location (Albuquerque, NM), and these values were applied into the model for predicting average hourly global solar radiations at four different locations (Austin, TX; El Paso, TX; Desert Rock, NV; Seattle, WA) of the United States. The model performance was assessed using correlation coefficient (r), Mean Absolute Bias Error (MABE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and coefficient of determinations (R²). The sensitivities of parameter to prediction were estimated. Results show that the model performed very well. The correlation coefficients (r) range from 0.96 to 0.99, while coefficients of determination (R²) range from 0.92 to 0.98. For daily and monthly prediction, error percentages (i.e. MABE and RMSE) were less than 20%. The approach we proposed here can be potentially useful for predicting average hourly global solar radiation on the horizontal surface for different locations, with the use of readily available data (i.e. latitude and longitude of the location) as inputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3asolar radiation 3amodels 3amodel validation 3alongitude 3alatitude 3aprediction 3aTexas 3aNew Mexico 0aWashington1 aSoupir, Michelle L.0 tAtmospheric research.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 114-115 p.83-90dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300001600288500001900304520177700323592002802100650001502128650001602143650002502159650001602184650001502200650001302215650001702228650002802245650001002273650000902283650002002292650002002312651001202332653001602344653001802360653001402378653001802392653002202410700001902432700001402451773013602465856007402601961001202675852000902687655001202696IND60737198620221117181857.0210514e20201212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073719862DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/nvaa1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCassidy, V.

An emerging management approach is to apply systemic insecticides to seedlings to reduce NPTM damage.These systemic insecticide applications generally occur once, perhaps twice, during the first few years of loblolly pine growth. However, these applications could lead to unintended environmental consequences to nontarget organisms.The purpose of this study was to assess potential nontarget effects from four systemic insecticide applications by assessing ground-dwelling arthropod trap catch, with a focus on collembolan trap catch and genera richness. Loblolly seedlings (24 seedlings per plot) at three sites in southeast Georgia were treated with either chlorantraniliprole, dinotefuran, fipronil, or imidacloprid or left untreated as a control. Arthropods were collected with pitfall traps that were deployed for 5 d in July, August, and September 2019, 7–9 mo after treatment. Ground-dwelling arthropod trap catch, arthropod order trap catch, collembolan trap catch, and collembolan genera richness did not vary among insecticide treatments and the untreated control in this mid-term insecticide risk assessment. While no significant effects of insecticide treatment were observed, ground-dwelling arthropod trap catch, collembolan trap catch, and collembolan genera richness differed among collection times.This study was the first of its kind in a young pine stand setting and is an important first step to understanding risk in these settings. Information on nontarget risks of management practices informs growers of the level of environmental risk associated with systemic insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollembola 3aPinus taeda 3aRhyacionia frustrana 3adinotefuran 3aentomology 3afipronil 3aimidacloprid 3ainsecticide application 3apests 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil arthropods 3aGeorgia 0acollembolan 0aforest insect 0anontarget 0apine tip moth 0aregeneration pest1 aMcCarty, E.

Determination of NMR spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times of water proton in homopolymeric block solutions and hydrogels indicated differences in homopolymeric blocks tertiary structure. Hydrogels of MM or GG blocks and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were prepared by freeze-thawing cycles method; their swelling properties and sensitivity to pH stimuli were assayed in control delivery of a model drug. MM/PVA hydrogels show better metformin release characteristics than GG/PVA hydrogels. It was found that release of the drug at pH 1.2 from hydrogels was minor to 5%. At the release equilibrium, 60 and 55% of the drug encapsulated were release from MM/PVA and GG/PVA hydrogels, respectively. Also, the release of metformin from hydrogels was studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy showing that 40 and 36% of drug were released after 4 h from MM/PVA and GG/PVA hydrogels, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogels 3ametformin 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asalts 3asodium 3asodium alginate1 aGuerrero, Juan1 aMatsuhiro, Betty1 aPavez O., Jorgeq(Pavez Ojeda),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5100-67070 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.935-946dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012900173300001600302520145800318592002801776650001601804650002801820650001401848650002101862650001201883650001701895650002101912650001901933650001901952650000901971650001101980650001401991650002602005650003302031650001502064700002002079700002102099700002002120700002402140773015302164856008602317852000902403655001202412IND60567845620221117083044.0170428e20170428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056784562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b009172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbrahim, Hassan Y.10aUsnic Acid Benzylidene Analogues as Potent Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Inhibitors for the Control of Breast Malignancies  ap. 932-952.  a(+)-Usnic acid (1) is a common bioactive lichen-derived secondary metabolite with a characteristic dibenzofuran scaffold. It displayed low micromolar antiproliferative activity levels and, notably, induced autophagy in a panel of diverse breast cancer cell lines, suggesting the mechanistic (formerly “mammalian”) target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a potential macromolecular target. The cellular autophagic markers were significantly upregulated due to the inhibition of mTOR downstream effectors. Additionally, 1 showed an optimal binding pose at the mTOR kinase pocket aided by multiple interactions to critical amino acids. Rationally designed benzylidene analogues of 1 displayed excellent fitting into a targeted deep hydrophobic pocket at the core of the kinase cleft, through stacking with the phenolic side chain of the Tyr2225 residue. Several potent analogues were generated, including 52, that exhibited potent (nM concentrations) antiproliferative, antimigratory, and anti-invasive activities against cells from multiple breast cancer clonal lines, without affecting the nontumorigenic MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. Analogue 52 also exhibited potent mTOR inhibition and autophagy induction. Furthermore, 52 showed potent in vivo antitumor activity in two athymic nude mice breast cancer xenograft models. Collectively, usnic acid and analogues are potential lead mTOR inhibitors appropriate for future use to control breast malignancies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aantineoplastic activity 3aautophagy 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3adibenzofuran 3aepithelial cells 3ahydrophobicity 3amammary glands 3amice 3amodels 3arapamycin 3asecondary metabolites 3atarget of rapamycin proteins 3ausnic acid1 aAkl, Mohamed R.1 aElsayed, Heba E.1 aHill, Ronald A.1 aEl Sayed, Khalid A.0 tJournal of natural products.g2017 Apr. 28, v. 80, no. 4 p.932-952dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosyx1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jnatprod.6b009173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012600168300001600294520179300310592002802103650001602131650001702147650001702164650001802181650001702199650001902216650002102235650001302256650001302269650000902282653003902291653004102330653004902371653001902420653001902439700001702458700001602475700001302491700005302504700001702557773009802574856008502672852000902757655001202766IND60644875220221118114912.0190620e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064487522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Aihong10aIntegrated control of CX3R-type DBP formation by coupling thermally activated persulfate pre-oxidation and chloramination  ap. 304-312.  aThe alternative disinfectant chloramine can lower the formation of carbonaceous DBPs (C-DBPs) but promote the formation of nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs), which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic. In this study, the combination of thermally activated persulfate pre-oxidation and post-chloramination (TA/PS-NH2Cl) was proposed to control the formation and reduce the toxicity of both C-DBPs and N-DBPs. The formation, speciation and toxicity of trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, haloaldehydes, haloacetonitriles, halonitromethanes and haloacetamides, collectively defined as CX3R-type DBPs, under TA/PS-NH2Cl process were compared with processes of chlorination alone (Cl2), chloramination alone (NH2Cl) and coupled thermally activated persulfate pre-oxidation with post-chlorination (TA/PS-Cl2). Results showed that chloramination could reduce formation of C-DBPs and total organic halogen (TOX) while increase N-DBP formation, and the introduction of TA/PS pretreatment process slightly increased the formation of C-DBPs and TOX but sharply reduced the formation of N-DBPs with higher toxicity as well as brominated CX3R-type DBPs that are more toxic than their chlorinated analogues. By comprehensive toxicity calculation, an outright decline of both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risk of CX3R-type DBPs was observed during TA/PS-NH2Cl process compared with Cl2, NH2Cl, and TA/PS-Cl2 processes. In summary, TA/PS-NH2Cl process was a potential effective method for integrally controlling the formation of CX3R-type DBPs and their toxicity and is suggested to be used to treat raw waters containing no bromide or low levels of bromide considering bromate caused by TA/PS pre-oxidation. The study may provide a feasible and economical method for DBP control on the background of global warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromination 3achlorination 3acytotoxicity 3adisinfectants 3agenotoxicity 3aglobal warming 3ahaloacetic acids 3ahalogens 3amutagens 3arisk 0aCX3R-type disinfection by-products 0aNitrogenous disinfection by-products 0aThermally activated persulfate pre-oxidation 0aChloramination 0aDrinking water1 aWang, Feifei1 aChu, Wenhai1 aYang, Xu1 aPan, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6894-72711 aZhu, Huifeng0 tWater research.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 160 p.304-312dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.05.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001500187245012700202300001200329506007600341520189900417592002802316506003702344650001802381650002102399650002502420650002702445650001902472650002402491650002502515650001402540650001702554650003802571650002002609650002702629650001702656650003602673650001702709650001802726650000902744650001702753650002002770650002202790650004302812650001302855650002602868700001202894700001802906700001502924700002002939700001202959700001902971700001302990700001703003700002003020773013103040856008003171852000903251655001203260IND60574957120221207105948.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057495712DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-3132doi7 aPMC41551032pmcid7 a251503642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yi-Xin10aAstragalosides from Radix Astragali benefits experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in C57BL /6 mice at multiple levels  ap. 313.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Radix Astragali is famous for its beneficial effect on inflammation associated diseases. This study was to assess the efficacy of astragalosides (AST) extracted from Radix Astragali, on the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and explore its possible underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: EAE was induced by subcutaneous immunization of MOG₃₅–₅₅. Infiltration of inflammatory cells was examined by HE staining. ROS level was detected by measuring infiltrated hydroethidine. Leakage of blood brain barrier (BBB) was assessed using Evan’s blue dye extravasation method. Levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured using ELISA kits. Activities of total-SOD, GSH-Px, and iNOS and MDA concentration were measured using biochemical analytic kits. Gene expression was detected using real-time PCR method. Protein expression was assayed using western blotting approach. RESULTS: AST administration attenuated the progression of EAE in mice remarkably. Further studies manifested that AST treatment inhibited infiltration of inflammatory cells, lessened ROS production and decreased BBB leakage. In peripheral immune-systems, AST up-regulated mRNA expression of transcriptional factors T-bet and Foxp3 but decreased that of RORγt to modulate T cell differentiation. In CNS, AST stopped BBB leakage, reduced ROS production by up-regulation of T-SOD, and reduced neuroinflammation by inhibition of iNOS and other inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, AST inhibited production of p53 and phosphorylation of tau by modulation of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. CONCLUSIONS: AST orchestrated multiple pathways, including immuno-regulation, anti-oxidative stress, anti-neuroinflammation and anti-neuroapoptosis involved in the MS pathogenesis, to prevent the deterioration of EAE, which paves the way for the application of it in clinical prevention/therapy of MS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aWestern blotting 3aalternative medicine 3aaspartate transaminase 3aastragalosides 3ablood-brain barrier 3acell differentiation 3acytokines 3aencephalitis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aimmunization 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3apathogenesis 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3atranscription factors1 aDu, Min1 aShi, Hai-Lian1 aHuang, Fei1 aLiu, Hong-Shuai1 aWu, Hui1 aZhang, Bei-Bei1 aDou, Wei1 aWu, Xiao-Jun1 aWang, Zheng-Tao0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.313-313dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-3133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008400170300001600254520088000270592002801150650001601178650002201194650000901216650001601225650002301241650000901264650001101273650001901284650001901303650001101322651001001333651002101343700001801364700001901382700002201401773009001423856008601513852000901599655001201608IND60089260620221120151804.0141102e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008926062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jung-Eun10aFactors influencing atmospheric wet deposition of trace elements in rural Korea  ap. 185-194.  aIn this study, precipitation samples were collected in a rural area of Korea between August 2006 and July 2009. The volume weighted mean (VWM) concentrations showed distinct seasonal variations, having high values in winter and low values in summer. Westerly winds that prevailed during the cold season were associated with enhanced concentrations of trace elements in precipitation. Based on back-trajectory analysis these samples were often associated with industrialized areas of China and metropolitan areas of Korea. Wet deposition fluxes of trace elements were inversely related to the VWM concentration, having high values in the summer due to the large precipitation depths. However, the largest wet deposition fluxes were observed for snow events despite their low precipitation depth, indicating that snow was a more efficient scavenger of trace elements than rain.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold season 3aindustrialization 3arain 3arural areas 3aseasonal variation 3asnow 3asummer 3atrace elements 3awet deposition 3awinter 3aChina 3aKorean Peninsula1 aHan, Young-Ji1 aKim, Pyung-Rae1 aHolsen, Thomas M.0 tAtmospheric research.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 116 p.185-194dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002700150245007000177300001800247520116400265592002801429650001501457650001001472650001901482650001601501650001501517650001901532650001201551650001001563650001101573650001201584650001001596650001501606650001301621650000901634650004401643650001301687650001001700650001301710650001501723700002001738700002601758700002801784700002201812700002601834773009101860856008601951852000902037655001202046IND4465308220221118024131.0141111e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446530822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPripdeevech, Patcharee10aAdaptogenic-active components from Kaempferia parviflora rhizomes  ap. 1150-1155.  aKaempferia parviflora rhizome extracts obtained by maceration with hexane, chloroform, methanol, and ethanol were screened for their adaptogenic activities using swimming tests of mice. The effective adaptogenic extract dose was 500mg/kg of body weight and was given orally once a day. Crude hexane extract showed significantly shorter mouse immobilisation time than those of the other and control extracts. This crude hexane extract was separated into three fractions by column chromatography. Among these fractions, the fraction rich in terpenoids possessed the highest adaptogenic activity and was comparable to that of the crude ginseng root powder used as a reference control. Therefore, terpenes contained in this fraction could be attributed to the decrease in exhaustion during the swimming of mice. There was no effect on body weight, heart, liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands of the mice. Chemical characterisation of this adaptogenic-active fraction by NMR and GC–MS showed germacene D, β-elemene, α-copaene, and E-caryophyllene as major constituents. Accordingly, these terpenes are considered the adaptogenic agents of K. parviflora rhizomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKaempferia 3aPanax 3aadrenal glands 3abody weight 3achloroform 3achromatography 3aethanol 3aheart 3ahexane 3akidneys 3aliver 3amaceration 3amethanol 3amice 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arhizomes 3aroots 3aswimming 3aterpenoids1 aPitija, Kitsada1 aRujjanawate, Chaiyong1 aPojanagaroon, Sermsakul1 aKittakoop, Prasat1 aWongpornchai, Sugunya0 tFood chemistry.g2012 June 1, v. 132, no. 3 p.1150-1155dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03953naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024002700134024001200161040001800173100001900191245009500210300001800305506017300323520206500496650001402561650001502575650001102590650001602601650002102617650001102638650001002649650005002659650001402709650001102723650001802734650001602752650001902768650001002787650002102797650000902818700002002827700001902847700002802866700002202894700002002916773008902936856011403025856007403139956008303213956008503296961000903381852000903390655001203399IND60647115320221214225607.0190418e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064711532DNAL7 a10113/64711532hdl7 a3485702aris7 a10.3390/rs51053302doi8 ans16312  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Dailiang10aResponse of Spectral Reflectances and Vegetation Indices on Varying Juniper Cone Densities  ap. 5330-5345.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aJuniper trees are widely distributed throughout the world and are common sources of allergies when microscopic pollen grains are transported by wind and inhaled. In this study, we investigated the spectral influences of pollen-discharging male juniper cones within a juniper canopy. This was done through a controlled outdoor experiment involving ASD FieldSpec Pro Spectroradiometer measurements over juniper canopies of varying cone densities. Broadband and narrowband spectral reflectance and vegetation index (VI) patterns were evaluated as to their sensitivity and their ability to discriminate the presence of cones. The overall aim of this research was to assess remotely sensed phenological capabilities to detect pollen-bearing juniper trees for public health applications. A general decrease in reflectance values with increasing juniper cone density was found, particularly in the Green (545–565 nm) and NIR (750–1,350 nm) regions. In contrast, reflectances in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 2,000 nm to 2,350 nm) region decreased from no cone presence to intermediate amounts (90 g/m2) and then increased from intermediate levels to the highest cone densities (200 g/m2). Reflectance patterns in the Red (620–700 nm) were more complex due to shifting contrast patterns in absorptance between cones and juniper foliage, where juniper foliage is more absorbing than cones only within the intensenarrowband region of maximum chlorophyll absorption near 680 nm. Overall, narrowband reflectances were more sensitive to cone density changes than the equivalent MODIS broadbands. In all VIs analyzed, there were significant relationships with cone density levels, particularly with the narrowband versions and the two-band vegetation index (TBVI) based on Green and Red bands, a promising outcome for the use of phenocams in juniper phenology trait studies. These results indicate that spectral indices are sensitive to certain juniper phenologic traits that can potentially be used for juniper cone detection in support of public health applications. 3aJuniperus 3aabsorption 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3ahypersensitivity 3aleaves 3amales 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aphenology 3apollen 3apublic health 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3atrees 3avegetation index 3awind1 aJiang, Zhangyan1 aHuete, Alfredo1 aPonce-Campos, Guillermo1 aNguyễn, Uyển,1 aLuvall, Jeffrey0 tRemote Sensing.g2013 Oct., v. 5, no. 10 p.5330-5345wJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64711533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs51053303Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2433.pdf  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2433_0.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100003000187245016100217300001200378506007600390520176000466592002802226506003702254650001702291650002202308650002102330650001202351650002502363650001402388650002102402650001302423650002702436650001902463650001702482650001902499650001102518650002402529650001302553650001902566650001402585650002502599650005202624650002602676650001502702650003002717700002202747700002502769700002602794700003002820773013102850856008102981852000903062655001203071IND60574957220221207095454.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057495722DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-3052doi7 aPMC41550932pmcid7 a251356912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoirangthem, Dinesh Singh10aCephalotaxus griffithii Hook.f. needle extract induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and suppression of hTERT and hTR expression on human breast cancer cells  ap. 305.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cephalotaxus spp. are known to possess anticancer potential. In this present work, for the first time the effects of C. griffithii needle (CGN) extracts on human cancer cells were examined. METHODS: The CGN was successively extracted with petroleum ether (PE), acetone and methanol. The extracts were tested for its effect on proliferation of cancer cells (MTT assay on HeLa, ZR751 and HepG2). Extract that showed the maximum growth inhibitory effect was subjected for mechanism of action study. These included apoptosis (morphological and DNA fragmentation assay), cell cycle (flow cytometry), caspase expression (Western blot) and activity (assay kit), p53 (western blot and TP53 siRNA interference) and telomerase expression (reverse transcriptase PCR) analysis. RESULTS: Among the extracts, PE extract induced maximum cytotoxicity, with highest death occurred in ZR751 cells. Since, PE extract induced cell death was highest among the CGN extracts, with maximum cancer cell death occurred in ZR751 cells; we carried out mechanism study of PE extract induced ZR751 cell death. It was observed that PE extract induced ZR751 cell death was associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Knock down study revealed that p53 is essential for loss of ZR751 cell viability induced by PE extract. Further, PE extract down-regulated hTERT, hTR, and c-Myc expression. Thin layer chromatography analysis indicated the presence of unique phytochemicals in PE extract. CONCLUSION: Based on the observations, we concluded that PE extract of C. griffithii needle contains important phyto-components with multiple cellular targets for control of breast cancer and is worthy of future studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCephalotaxus 3aDNA fragmentation 3aWestern blotting 3aacetone 3aalternative medicine 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acaspases 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amethanol 3aneoplasm cells 3apetroleum 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asmall interfering RNA 3atelomerase 3athin layer chromatography1 aLaishram, Surbala1 aBorah, Jagat Chandra1 aKalita, Mohan Chandra1 aTalukdar, Narayan Chandra0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.305-305dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-3053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245025400168300001400422520137700436592002801813650001501841650002001856650001401876650001701890650001601907650001501923650001501938650004301953650001101996650001402007650001302021650001502034650001302049650002702062650001302089650001602102700002102118700001902139700001802158700001702176773009402193856008402287852000902371655001202380IND60113118920221120110207.0141111e20131011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011311892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarfi, Behruz10aSimplified miniaturized ultrasound-assisted matrix solid phase dispersion extraction and high performance liquid chromatographic determination of seven flavonoids in citrus fruit juice and human fluid samples: Hesperetin and naringenin as biomarkers  ap. 30-40.  aIn the present study, for the first time, a simplified miniaturized ultrasound-assisted matrix solid-phase dispersion (SM-USA-MSPD) method with a different application for liquid matrices was developed to extract different flavonoids (hesperidin, diosmin, eriocitrin, narirutin, naringin, hesperetin and naringenin) from citrus fruit juice and human fluid samples prior to their determination using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Different effective parameters were studied and under the optimum conditions (including sample volume: 150μL; solid phase: silica-based C18, 200mg; eluting solvent: methanol, 500μL; pH: 4; and sonication: 6min; at room temperature), limits of detection and limits of quantification were ranged from 23.3 to 46.8ngmL⁻¹ and 74.8 to 141.5ngmL⁻¹, respectively. Once optimized, analytical performance of the method was studied in terms of linearity (0.074–198.5μgmL⁻¹, r²>0.991), accuracy (recovery=84.6–101.5%), and precision (repeatability: intra-day precision<5.9%, and inter-day precision<7.2%). At the end, SM-USA-MSPD method was successfully applied to estimate the levels of hesperetin and naringenin in plasma and urinary excretion -after ingestion of orange, grapefruit and lime juices- and the obtained results confirmed that these compounds could be used as good biomarkers of citrus fruit juice intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adetection limit 3aexcretion 3afruit juices 3agrapefruits 3ahesperetin 3ahesperidin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aingestion 3amethanol 3anaringenin 3anaringin 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aAsghari, Alireza1 aRajabi, Maryam1 aBarfi, Azadeh1 aSaeidi, Iman0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Oct. 11, v. 1311 p.30-40dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04633naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245015800175520333000333592002803663650001803691650002903709650001803738650002403756650001803780650002203798650001203820650001503832650001903847650001903866650001303885651001503898651002003913700001503933700002103948700001803969700001703987773012604004856008404130852000904214655001204223IND60757676920221121060930.0211125e20211104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075767692DNAL7 a10.3390/environments81101212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Mohammad Emran10aModeling of Forest Ecosystem Degradation Due to Anthropogenic Stress: The Case of Rohingya Influx into the Cox’s Bazar–Teknaf Peninsula of Bangladesh  aOverdependence and cumulative anthropogenic stresses have caused world forests to decrease at an unprecedented rate, especially in Southeast Asia. The Cox’s Bazar–Teknaf Peninsula of Bangladesh is not an exception and follows the global deforestation trend. Despite being one of the country’s richest forest ecosystems with multiple wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests, and influential wildlife habitats, the peninsula is now providing shelter for nearly one million Rohingya refugees. With the global deforestation trend coupled with excessive anthropogenic stresses from the Rohingya population, the forests in the peninsula are continuously deteriorating in terms of quality and integrity. In response to deforestation, the government invested in conservation efforts through afforestation and restoration programs, although the peninsula faced a refugee crisis in August 2017. The impact of this sudden increase in population on the forest ecosystem is large and has raised questions and contradictions between the government’s conservation efforts and the humanitarian response. Relocation of the refugees seems to be a lengthy process and the forest ecosystem integrity needs to be preserved; therefore, the degree of stresses, level of impacts, and pattern of deforestation are crucial information for forest conservation and protection strategies. However, there are a lack of quantitative analyses on how the forest ecosystem is deteriorating and what future results would be in both space and time. In this study, the impact of the sudden humanitarian crisis (i.e., Rohingya refugees) as anthropogenic stress in Cox’s Bazar–Teknaf peninsula has been spatiotemporally modeled and assessed using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and other collateral data. Using the density and accessibility of the Rohingya population along with the land cover and other physiographic data, a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique was applied through the Markov cellular automata technique to model the forest vegetation status. The impact of deforestation differs in cost due to variability of the forest vegetation covers. The study, therefore, developed and adopted three indices for assessment of the forest ecosystem based on the variability and weight of the forest cover loss. The spatial severity of impact (SSI) index revealed that out of 5415 ha of total degraded forest lands, 650 ha area would have the highest cost from 2017 to 2027. In the case of the ecosystem integrity (EI) index, a rapid decline in ecosystem integrity in the peninsula was observed as the integrity value fell to 1190 ha (2019) from 1340 ha (2017). The integrity is expected to further decline to 740 ha by 2027, if the stress persists in a similar fashion. Finally, the findings of ecosystem integrity depletion (EID) elucidated areas of 540 and 544 hectares that had a severe EID score of (−5) between 2017 and 2019 and 2017 and 2027, respectively. The displacement and refugee crisis is a recurrent world event that, in many cases, compromises the integrity and quality of natural space. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to have significant global and regional implications to help managers and policymakers of forest ecosystems make decisions that have minimal or no impact to facilitate humanitarian response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3aanthropogenic activities 3adeforestation 3aforest conservation 3aforest damage 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3aspace and time 3awildlife 3aBangladesh 3aSouth East Asia1 aZhang, Li 1 aMahmood, Riffat 1 aGuo, Huadong 1 aLi, Guoqing 0 tEnvironments.g2021 Nov. 04, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27132x2076-32987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments81101213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03875naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245014200212300001800354520217100372592002802543650002802571650002002599650001002619650001602629650002802645650001402673650001602687650001502703650001802718650000802736650002602744650002002770650001202790650002902802650001302831650001402844650001502858650002002873650001102893650001002904653001502914653003902929653002902968653001902997653001503016653001103031700002603042700001903068700001803087773011203105856008303217852000903300655001203309IND60584166120221121073418.0181127e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058416612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2017.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshimura, Yoshihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7545-417910aPrevalence of sarcopenia and its association with activities of daily living and dysphagia in convalescent rehabilitation ward inpatients  ap. 2022-2028.  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia following stroke, musculoskeletal disease, or hospital-associated deconditioning in convalescent rehabilitation ward inpatients. The association between the activities of daily living (ADLs), dysphagia, and sarcopenia was also assessed.A cross-sectional study was performed in consecutive patients admitted to convalescent rehabilitation wards. Sarcopenia was defined as a loss of skeletal muscle mass and decreased muscle strength. The primary outcome was the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score. Body mass index, Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form score, Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, premorbid modified Rankin scale, time from onset, reason for admission, bioelectrical impedance analysis for skeletal muscle mass and fat mass, and handgrip strength were also assessed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine whether ADLs and dysphagia were associated with sarcopenia.The study included 637 patients (mean age: 74 years; 271 men and 366 women). Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 343 (53.0%) patients (141 men and 202 women). Sarcopenia was identified in 53.6% (125/233) of stroke patients (59.8%, 50.0%, and 34.6% of patients with brain infarctions, brain hemorrhages, and subarachnoid hemorrhages, respectively). Sarcopenia was found in 51.3% (154/300) of patients with musculoskeletal diseases (59.5%, 53.6%, and 36.5% of patients with hip fractures, vertebral compression fractures, and total knee arthroplasty, respectively). Of patients with hospital-associated deconditioning, 61.5% (64/104) had sarcopenia (95.1% and 39.7% of patients with pneumonia and other acute diseases, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that FIM motor domain and FILS scores were independently associated with skeletal muscle mass loss and decreased muscle strength.The prevalence of sarcopenia in convalescent rehabilitation ward inpatients was 53.0%. ADLs and dysphagia were independently associated with sarcopenia in this study population. Sarcopenia with disabilities should be assessed for all patients in rehabilitation settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody mass index 3abrain 3acomorbidity 3across-sectional studies 3adysphagia 3afood intake 3ahemorrhage 3ahip fractures 3amen 3amultivariate analysis 3amuscle strength 3amuscles 3amusculoskeletal diseases 3apatients 3apneumonia 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle 3astroke 3awomen 0aDisability 0aHospital-associated deconditioning 0aMusculoskeletal diseases 0aRehabilitation 0aSarcopenia 0aStroke1 aWakabayashi, Hidetaka1 aBise, Takahiro1 aTanoue, Maiko0 tClinical nutrition.g2018 Dec., v. 37, no. 6 p.2022-2028dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2017.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002700188245011100215300001400326506007600340520078400416592002801200506003701228650001901265650000901284650001901293650002301312650001601335650001601351650001301367650001301380650001301393650001201406650002901418650001101447650004801458650004801506650004001554650003201594650002101626650004101647650003901688650004401727700002101771700001801792700002601810700001901836700002201855700002301877773010701900856004802007852000902055655001202064IND50062890220221207072405.0130323e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006289022DNAL7 a231804632pmid7 aPMC35650912pmcid7 a10.1007/s11259-012-9546-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweatman, Jennifer L.,14aThe radiographic anatomy of the normal ovine digit, the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints  ap. 51-57.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this project was to develop a detailed, accessible set of reference images of the normal radiographic anatomy of the ovine digit up to and including the metacarpo/metatatarsophalangeal joints.

These data were analysed with repeatability and random regression models. The highest heritabilities for energy efficiency traits were obtained in the beginning and the end of the 30 week lactation period (0.21–0.40). The results suggest that the energy efficiencies in early- and mid-lactation periods are partially different traits. The genetic correlations of REI were moderate to high and positive with the other studied traits, and high and positive for ECE with milk, but moderate to low and negative with dry matter intake, BW and body condition score.

In July 1999, Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data were acquired in northeastern Wyoming, near Devils Tower National Monument. Using the reflectance spectrum of flowering leafy spurge, leafy spurge occurrence was determined using a new method of spectral mixture analysis, Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF). Ground reference data (146 sites) were obtained 2 weeks before and after AVIRIS overflight to test the classification accuracy of leafy spurge. For 3 land cover types: mixed prairie, riparian, and coniferous woodlands, the presence or absence leafy spurge was detected with an overall accuracy of 95%% using a 0.10 threshold for detection. Differences in classification thresholds resulted in a trade-off between false positives, pixels that were mapped as leafy spurge but did not contain leafy spurge on the ground, and false negatives, areas that had leafy spurge on the ground but were not mapped as leafy spurge. Detection of leafy spurge occurrence was best for mixed prairie and riparian cover types, and somewhat less successful for conifer woodlands because of interference from tree crowns and their shadows. The advantage of the MTMF technique is it allows automated processing of hyperspectral imagery to generate accurate maps of leafy spurge occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEuphorbia esula L 0aremote sensing 0aspectral mixture analysis 0aclassification accuracy 0aAVIRIS1 aHUNT, E.

Compared with inorganic-based photodetectors, PPDs, based on low-bandgap conjugated polymers with the chemical structures easy to be tuned, can achieve a wide range of spectral responses. On the other hand, this kind of polymers can enhance the short-circuit current (JSC) in TOPV by extending the absorption spectrum range. In this review, our focus will be on the development of low-bandgap conjugated polymers extending over 1000 nm and the performance of PPDs or OPVs. The perspective article summarizes the design strategy of such polymers, the derivation process of the useful heterocycles, absorption, bandgap, and energy levels. Thereafter, we will draw attention to the challenges and the possible research direction in the future to provide readers with a deeper understanding of the design of NIR polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectric current 3aenergy 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aphotothermotherapy 3apolymers 3asolar energy 3aspectral analysis 3awavelengths1 aLan, Ning1 aChen, Weiming1 aYan, Yunnan1 aZeng, Wei1 aLiu, Shengjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8492-31760 tJournal of materials science.g2021 May, v. 56, no. 14 p.8334-8357dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-05825-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03864naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006300145245013000208300001800338500001900356500002000375520226900395592002802664596007202692596003802764650002402802650001402826650001502840650002602855650000902881650001502890650001902905650002802924700002402952700006902976700002203045700003303067700006203100700005903162773012103221856007903342852000903421655001203430IND60714377220221120034110.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071437722DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.134492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ain ‘t Zandt, Dina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6487-027310aLocal soil legacy effects in a multispecies grassland community are underlain by root foraging and soil nutrient availability  ap. 2243-2255.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant‐soil legacies consisting of species‐specific microbial communities are hypothesized to play a critical, structuring role in plant species coexistence processes. Plant species are thought to perform worse on soil conditioned by the same species compared to soil of other species, which serves as a self‐limitation mechanism and averts monodominance of strong competitors. Here, we test in a multispecies community setting, whether root colonization and resource utilization of soil patches with distinct soil legacies are consistent with this hypothesis. We grew eight grassland species together in an outdoor mesocosm set‐up in unconditioned soil and created soil patches in these communities conditioned by one of four plant species, or a soil mixture of all four. During two subsequent growing seasons, we tested the effect of these conditioned soil patches on below‐ground root colonization into the patches of each surrounding plant species using a novel sequencing‐based approach. In addition, we tested the effect of soil conditioning on local root functioning by injecting tracers into the soil patches and measuring the recovery in above‐ground biomass. Against expectations, plant species did not place less roots in own soil patches compared to foreign soil patches, nor did species take up less tracer from own compared to foreign soil patches. Using structural equation modelling, we found that tracer uptake of the plant species was to a varying degree explained by root densities in the various soil patches and by differing soil nutrient availability of the soil patches. We conclude that soil legacy effects are inextricably connected to soil nutrient availability, which needs to be taken into account in plant‐soil feedback research to understand the processes that shape plant communities. Synthesis. We found that soil legacy effects in complex, multispecies semi‐field conditions did not match expectations based on theory and experiments in controlled conditions. Among the many complicating factors that may modify or even overrule soil legacy effects in semi‐field settings, we identified soil nutrient availability as a critical force that may, together with soil biota, shape plant species coexistence processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a824.01.003cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek  a655771cMarie Skłodowska‐Curie 3aaboveground biomass 3aequations 3agrasslands 3anutrient availability 3asoil 3asoil biota 3asoil nutrients 3asoil-plant interactions1 aHoekstra, Nyncke J.1 aWagemaker, Cornelis A.

We conducted a controlled experiment with six populations of the tall form of S. alterniflora: three transported from its introduced range in Jiangsu Province, China, and three from its native range in Georgia, USA. Plants were grown in a greenhouse and subjected to one of two levels of nitrogen availability for several months. Growth, biomass accumulation, biomass allocation, and photosynthetic and morphological traits, as well as the corresponding trait plasticities, were measured and compared between the populations. Nitrogen addition significantly affected individual traits of both invasive Jiangsu and native Georgia S. alterniflora populations, with invasive populations having stronger responses to nitrogen addition in RGR, total biomass, total leaf number (TLN), total leaf area (TLA) and maximum culm height (MxCH) than native populations according to the results of both reaction norms and the relative distance plasticity index (RDPI). Invasive S. alterniflora was more vigorous than its native conspecific as shown by greater total biomass and higher light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Pₘₐₓ). Several morphological traits (MxCH, TLN and LAR) and most of the biomass allocation traits of invasive populations were found to differ from native populations. Our results indicated probable genetic shifts in plant traits in the introduced populations relative to the native populations of the tall form of S. alterniflora. Such genetic shifts may play a vital role in their success as invasive plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina alterniflora 3abiomass production 3adry matter partitioning 3agreenhouses 3ainvasive species 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aChina 3aGeorgia1 aYao, Yihan1 aXiao, Yan1 aHu, Fengqin1 aSun, Yixiang1 aZhou, Changfang1 aAn, Shuqing0 tActa oecologica.g2011 , v. 37, no. 1 p.23-30dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2010.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02084naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008500169300001600254520094900270592002801219650001501247650002801262650001201290650001001302653004701312653002801359653000901387653002101396653001901417700001701436700001701453700002401470773013601494856008301630852000901713655001201722IND60636757620221118041246.0200106e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063675762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eaef.2019.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorio, Yoshinari10aField scene recognition for self-localization of autonomous agricultural vehicle  ap. 325-340.  aIn this study, a field scene recognition system was developed to estimate a self-position of a traveling vehicle along a farm road by using an original capture system with three cameras, a vector quantization method to express the features of field scenes, a machine learning based scene recognition algorithm, and a vehicle position estimation algorithm with an original voting method.

This study investigates the effects of LR on the anti-allergy mechanism. LR inhibited the release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells by compound 48/80 in a dose-dependent manner. LR orally administered at 6.59 mg/100 g also inhibited the anti-DNP IgE-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction. LR inhibited the PMA plus A23187-induced increase in IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α expression in HMC-1 cells. In addition, LR also inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and IκB-α degradation. These results show that LR had an inhibitory effect on the atopic allergic reaction. Furthermore, the in vivo and in vitro anti-allergic effect of LR suggests possible therapeutic applications of this agent for inflammatory allergic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithospermum erythrorhizon 3aanaphylaxis 3aanti-allergic agents 3abiotechnology 3adose response 3aeczema 3afrostbite 3aherbal medicines 3ahistamine 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3arats 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aLithospermi radix 0aHMC-1 cell 0apassive cutaneous anaphylaxis 0acytokine 0anuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)1 aKim, Eun-Young,1 aMOON, Phil-Dong1 aUM, Jae-Young1 aKim, Hyung-Min,1 aLEE, Hyun-Sam1 aSOHN, Youngjoo1 aPARK, Seong Kyu1 aJUNG, Hyuk-Sang1 aSOHN, Nak-Won0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2007 Dec. 23, v. 71, no. 12 p.2886-2892dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.702083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011100174300001800285500001900303520105500322592002801377650001301405650003201418650001701450650002001467650002001487650001101507650002401518650001501542700002101557700002201578700005601600773012101656856008201777852000901859655001201868IND60728550020221117171559.0210220e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072855002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-021-05829-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhuiyan, Anamul Hoque10aUtilization of polyvinyl butyral-zirconium alkoxide hybrid hollow tube as an enzyme immobilization carrier  ap. 8668-8678.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe developed a Polyvinyl butyral (PVB)-zirconium alkoxide hybrid hollow tube by air-gap spinning. Enzyme (β-galactosidase and lipase) was physically entrap-immobilized and disseminated throughout the hollow tube architecture. The enzyme immobilized PVB-Zr hybrid tube shown its stability in phosphate buffer solution, electrolyte solution, and other organic solvents. The apparent Michaelis constant Kₘ for immobilized β-galactosidase (IβG) was 0.079 mol/l compared to 0.067 mol/l for free enzyme. The maximum velocity Vₘₐₓ was 4.9 μmol.min⁻¹, whereas it was 11.5 μmol.min⁻¹ for free enzyme. The preserved activity of IβG was found to be 90%, after ten reaction cycles. Moreover, up to 70% conversion for citronellyl acetate after 50 h. was achieved by immobilized lipase (IL) in hexane solution. The activity of IL was found to be 62% after 8 repeated uses where free enzyme retained 15% activity. Overall, it was considered that the enzyme activity employed both in the interior and the vicinity of the hollow tube surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme kinetics 3ahexane 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aphosphates1 aNagakawa, Takuma1 aZakaria, Mohammad1 aNakane, Koji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2338-95870 tJournal of materials science.g2021 May, v. 56, no. 14 p.8668-8678dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-05829-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01849naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300001600274520087900290592002801169650002601197650001701223650001401240650001601254651001101270700002001281700006201301773009401363856008101457852000901538655001201547IND60725025520221118061125.0210124e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072502552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTseliou, Areti10aData on thermal sensation, perception and microclimatic parameters in a city with Mediterranean climate  ap. 563-565.  aThis data article presents the data collected through an extensive research work conducted in urban areas in the city of Athens (Greece) during the period 2010–2012.

The catalysis of MtnA is a novel isomerization of an aldose phosphate harboring a phosphate group on the hemiacetal group. This enzyme is distributed widely among bacteria through higher eukaryotes. The isomerase reaction analyzed using the recombinant B. subtilis enzyme showed a Michaelis constant for MTR-1-P of 138 μM, and showed that the maximum velocity of the reaction was 20.4 μmol min⁻¹ (mg protein)⁻¹. The optimum reaction temperature and reaction pH were 35 °C and 8.1. The activation energy of the reaction was calculated to be 68.7 kJ mol⁻¹. The enzyme, with a molecular mass of 76 kDa, was composed of two subunits. The equilibrium constant in the reversible isomerase reaction [MTRu-1-P]/[MTR-1-P] was 6.

We do not yet know how agronomic factors influence weed suppression at high crop density. We performed a field experiment to ask how crop density, spatial pattern and irrigation interact to influence weed suppression and grain yield in semi-arid croplands. The experimental was a factorial design with 4 factors: wheat cultivar (Ningchun4, Xihan2), irrigation level (control, irrigated), sowing density (low, 196 seeds m⁻²; moderate, 400 seeds m⁻²; high, 625 seeds m⁻²), and spatial sowing pattern (rows, uniform). Weed growth was effectively suppressed by increased crop density and spatial uniformity. Effects of crop density on weed suppression and grain yield were more pronounced in the uniform pattern than in crop rows. Weed biomass was 55.7% lower and grain yield increased 29.7% higher in the high density uniform pattern compared to the low density and row pattern. Crop density interacted with cultivar in determining both weed biomass and grain yield, potentially reflecting different traits regulating crop competitive ability. Irrigation and crop density had additive effects on weed biomass but interacted to influence grain yield. Our findings support the idea that increased crop density and spatial uniformity can make a valuable and environmentally friendly contribution to weed control in wheat, reducing the need for chemical or mechanical weed control. We need a better understanding of the interactions among climate, agricultural management and crop genotype to improve our ability to effectively suppress weeds with high crop density and spatial uniformity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural management 3aapplied ecology 3abiomass 3aclimate 3acultivars 3aecological competition 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3airrigation rates 3amechanical weed control 3aplant available water 3aplant density 3aweeds 3awheat 0aCrop density 0aIrrigation 0aSize-asymmetric competition 0aSpatial pattern 0aSustainable cropping systems 0aWeed suppression1 aWu, Yue1 aWeiner, Jacob1 aZhang, Da Yong,0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2022 June, v. 61 p.20-29dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2022.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012000163300001200283520110500295592002801400596010401428596010401532650001701636650001901653650001501672650001701687650001701704650003101721650002501752650003001777650001301807650002201820700001401842700002001856700001701876700001801893773012901911856008302040852000902123655001202132IND60779422220221122092249.0220929e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077942222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-022-02992-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Le, Ve10aHymenobacter cyanobacteriorum sp. nov., isolated from a freshwater reservoir during the cyanobacterial bloom period  ap. 369.  aA Gram-negative, red-colored, and rod-shaped bacterial strain, DH14ᵀ, was isolated from a eutrophic reservoir. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain DH14ᵀ was most closely related to Hymenobacter terrigena (98.3% similarity) and Hymenobacter terrae (98.1%). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between strain DH14ᵀ and its related type strains were below 82.9% and 27.2%, respectively. Strain DH14ᵀ contained iso-C₁₅:₀ (32.6%), anteiso-C₁₅:₀ (14.0%), and summed feature 3 (C₁₆:₁ ω6c and/or C₁₆:₁ ω7c) (25.8%) as major cellular fatty acids. The main polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminophospholipids, and one unidentified lipid. The respiratory quinone was menaquinone 7 (MK-7). The genomic DNA G + C content was 62.1%. These evidences support the classification of strain DH14ᵀ as a novel species in the genus Hymenobacter, for which the name Hymenobacter cyanobacteriorum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is DH14ᵀ (= KCTC 92040ᵀ = LMG 32425ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data  a2019R1A2C2007038cNational Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT)  a2021R1A2C1005151cNational Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) 3aHymenobacter 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3amenaquinones 3amicrobiology 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aquinones 3asequence analysis1 aKo, So-Ra1 aKang, Mingyeong1 aOh, Hee-Mock1 aAhn, Chi-Yong0 tArchives of microbiology.g2022 July, v. 204, no. 7 p.369-369dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-022-02992-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01380naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245005200173300001800225520045000243592002800693650003100721650002200752650001300774650003300787650004000820650002400860700002100884773008200905856008200987852000901069655001201078IND60092609320221119013638.0141103e20111209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009260932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerendsen, Agnes D.10aTankyrase Loses Its Grip on SH3BP2 in Cherubism  ap. 1222-1223.  aCherubism, a case of bone remodeling gone haywire, is associated with mutations in the adaptor protein SH3BP2.

Compounds (−)-4, (+)-4, (−)-5, (+)-5, and (−)-6 showed potent cytotoxicities against a colon cancer cell line HCT116 with IC50 values of 2.60, 7.02, 1.47, 3.37, and 4.14μM, respectively, which were better than the standard control doxorubicin (IC50 9.74μM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGarcinia 3aX-ray diffraction 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaf extracts 3amedicinal plants 3aneoplasm cells 3aspectroscopy 3axanthone 0aGarcinia propinqua 0aScalemic caged xanthones 0aCytotoxicity 0aElectronic circular dichroism1 aTantapakul, Cholpisut1 aAndersen, Raymond J.1 aPatrick, Brian O.1 aPyne, Stephen G.1 aMuanprasat, Chatchai1 aSeemakhan, Sawinee1 aBorwornpinyo, Suparerk1 aLaphookhieo, Surat0 tFitoterapia.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0367-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2017.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012400162300001600286520098300302592002801285650001501313650001901328650002701347650001301374650002601387650001301413650004401426650001301470650001301483650001701496650001701513653002701530653002001557653001601577653001901593700001401612700001801626700005301644773012501697856008301822852000901905655001201914IND60597086820221119205914.0200628e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059708682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Shuju10aHeteroatom-rich porous organic polymers constructed by benzoxazine linkage with high carbon dioxide adsorption affinity  ap. 457-462.  aWe report the synthesis and characterization of a new type of porous organic polymers linked by benzoxazine. The polymers were readily synthesized by condensation reaction of diamines, triphenol and paraformaldehyde. The formation of the linkage and porous structures were studied by infrared spectroscopy, solid-state ¹³C-CP MAS NMR and nitrogen sorption measurements. The porosity study revealed the resultant polymers are porous materials with surface area as high as 231m²g⁻¹. Benzoxazine backbone endows the polymers with abundant heteroatoms (N and O), which makes these polymers promising candidates for carbon dioxide adsorption and storage. We found that the best polymer showing the highest carbon dioxide adsorption up to 6.81wt% at 273K and 1bar, which is due to the most microporous structure and largest adsorption affinity. These results demonstrate a convenient approach to synthesize heteroatom-rich porous organic polymers for gas adsorption and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acondensation reactions 3adiamines 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asurface area 0aPorous organic polymer 0aHeteroatom-rich 0aBenzoxazine 0aGas adsorption1 aHe, Jiang1 aJin, Shangbin1 aTan, Bien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7181-347X0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 509 p.457-462dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013200158300001200290500002000302520085700322592002801179596007001207596002701277650001601304650002101320650001201341650001501353650001101368650000901379650001401388650001401402650002501416700001901441700001601460700001601476700002001492773012401512856007401636852000901710655001201719IND60787622820221119151226.0220809e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078762282DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.1040662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawkins, M.

The authors here describe the use of an inexpensive camera system that monitors the movements of broiler flocks throughout their lives and suggest that it is possible to predict, even in young birds, the cross‐sectional prevalence at slaughter of footpad dermatitis and hockburn before external signs are visible. The skew and kurtosis calculated from the authors’ camera‐based optical flow system had considerably more power to predict these outcomes in the 50 flocks reported here than water consumption, bodyweight or mortality and therefore have the potential to inform improved flock management through giving farmers early warning of welfare issues. Further trials are underway to establish the generality of the results.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/K001388cBiotechnology and Biological Science Research Council  cCargill Meats (Europe) 3abody weight 3abroiler chickens 3acameras 3adermatitis 3aflocks 3ameat 3amortality 3aslaughter 3astatistical analysis1 aRoberts, S.

The samples were prepared using 3% (w/w) rice starch, with 10% or 30% (w/w) sugar (trehalose or allose) added and 10% or 30% (w/w) oil (canola or coconut). The droplet size of the film suspension increased with increasing oil concentration both in trehalose and allose, which blended with oil. The flow behavior of the film suspensions showed shear‐thinning behavior as calculated by the Power Law model. The apparent viscosity tended to increase with the addition of sugar and oil. The breaking stress of the films blended with sugar and oil was less than that of control. On preparation day and after 7 days’ storage, the breaking strain tended to increase more with the addition of coconut oil than with that of canola oil. However, breaking stress and breaking strain decreased after 28 days’ storage. Adding sugar had correlation with mechanical properties whereas adding oil had correlation with film suspension characteristics, allowed the sugar and oil to interact and inhibited starch chain mobility due to concentration, sugar type, and oil type. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Trehalose, allose, canola oil, and coconut oil could be used as a plasticizer in a starch edible/biodegradable film system. The preparation process of filmogenic solution was depended on the combination of sugar and oil that could change the flow behavior and affected the mechanical properties of the edible film. The sugar and oil might improve the mechanical properties of the film by a hydroxyl group of sugar and lubricating properties of the oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallose 3abiodegradability 3acanola 3acanola oil 3acoconut oil 3acoconuts 3adroplet size 3aedible films 3afood science 3amathematical models 3aplasticizers 3arice starch 3astarch 3atrehalose 3aviscosity1 aGohtani, Shoichi0 tJournal of food science.g2020 Oct., v. 85, no. 10 p.3372-3379dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.154553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100001700167245006200184300001600246520099600262592002801258653002501286653002001311653002101331653001801352653001501370653001701385653002601402700001601428700001401444700001901458700001801477773015401495856011501649852000901764655001201773IND60128978720221119155332.0151124e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012897872DNAL7 a10.2987/8756-971X(2006)22[629:HFPOMV]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPARIDA, S.K.10aHost feeding patterns of malaria vectors of orissa, india  ap. 629-634.  aBlood meals of 1,491 Anopheles fluviatilis sensu lato ((s.l.)), 1,690 An. culicifacies s.l., 719 An. annularis s.l., and 358 An. varuna sensu stricto were examined by gel diffusion method.

Results show that: (1) trip modes have significant influence on spatial equity and that the geography of spatial equity varied with trip modes; (2) the spatial equity value in Changchun is overall kept to a very low level. Most areas in urban fringes and urban core areas belong to underserved areas, and the capacity of nursing home, travel cost and the number of seniors, are the main influencing factors; (3) the geography of spatial equity in different scenarios show a very similar ring structure; namely, the spatial equity value within the urban core and at the most urban periphery is lower than that in intermediate areas.

Polyolefins modified with maleic anhydride, which have been frequently used for wood and polyolefin composites, are not effective for poly(lactic acid) composites. Because compounds with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups are potential compatibilizers, cellulose esters of several carboxylic acids, RCOO-cellulose (R = CH₃, C₂H₅, C₃H₇, C₄H₉, C₅H₁₁, C₁₁H₂₃), were synthesized and their effects as compatibilizers of wood/poly(lactic acid) composites (WPLC) were examined in this study. The mechanical properties of WPLC were improved with a small amount of added cellulose esters, especially cellulose butyrate or cellulose valerate. The relevant effect of added cellulose esters on the thermal properties of wood/PLA composite was analyzed by measuring dynamic viscoelasticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutyrates 3acellulose 3alactic acid 3amechanical properties 3aplastics 3athermal properties 3aviscoelasticity 3awood 3awood properties1 aIkeda, Kohei1 aSakamoto, Kei1 aOkamoto, Tadashi0 tJournal of wood science.g2008 Feb., v. 54, no. 1 p.54-61dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-007-0911-y3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02218naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100002500189245012700214300001600341506007600357520086800433592002801301506003701329650002401366650001801390650001301408650004201421650001301463653002001476653001301496653002201509653001901531653002601550700002601576773012601602856008301728852000901811655001201820IND60636758020221207124636.0201230s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063675802DNAL7 aPMC64824312pmcid7 a310491662pmid7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2019.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBohannan, Zachary S.10aCalling Variants in the Clinic: Informed Variant Calling Decisions Based on Biological, Clinical, and Laboratory Variables  ap. 561-569.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDeep sequencing genomic analysis is becoming increasingly common in clinical research and practice, enabling accurate identification of diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive determinants. Variant calling, distinguishing between true mutations and experimental errors, is a central task of genomic analysis and often requires sophisticated statistical, computational, and/or heuristic techniques. Although variant callers seek to overcome noise inherent in biological experiments, variant calling can be significantly affected by outside factors including those used to prepare, store, and analyze samples. The goal of this review is to discuss known experimental features, such as sample preparation, library preparation, and sequencing, alongside diverse biological and clinical variables, and evaluate their effect on variant caller selection and optimization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomedical research 3abiotechnology 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amutation 0aVariant calling 0aGenomics 0aClinical oncology 0aBioinformatics 0aComputational biology1 aMitrofanova, Antonina0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2019, v. 17 p.561-569dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2019.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245007800158520141100236592002801647650001701675650001101692650000901703650001101712700002801723700002201751700002401773773015801797856007501955852000902030655001202039IND60649235220221117101230.0190703e20190509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064923522DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi80502242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Jinjin 10aTop-Bounded Spaces Formed by the Built Environment for Navigation Systems  aNavigation systems help agents find the right (optimal) path from the origin to the desired destination. Current navigation systems mainly offer the shortest (distance or time) path as the default optimal path. However, under certain circumstances, having a least-top-exposed path can be more interesting. For instance, on a rainy day, a path with as many places as possible covered by roofs/shelters is more attractive and pragmatic, since roofs/shelters can offer protection from rain. In this paper, we name environments that covered by roofs/shelters but not completely enclosed like indoors as &ldquo;top-bounded environments/spaces&rdquo; (e.g., porches), which are generally formed by built structures. This kind of space is completely missing in current navigation models and systems. Thus, we investigate how to use it for space-based navigation. After proposing a definition, a space model, and attributes of top-bounded spaces, we introduce a projection-based approach to generate them. Then, taking a pedestrian as an example agent, we select generated spaces considering whether the agent can visit/use the identified spaces. Finally, examples and a use case study demonstrate that our research can help to include top-bounded spaces in navigation systems/models. More navigation path types (e.g., least-top-exposed) can be offered for different agents (such as pedestrians, drones or robots).  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3amodels 3arain 3arobots1 aDiakité, Abdoulaye  A.1 aZlatanova, Siyka,1 aAleksandrov, Mitko 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2019 May 09, v. 8, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi80502243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245009500208300001800303506007600321520103900397592002801436506003701464650001501501650003901516650001001555650001801565650001201583650002501595650001101620700002301631700002101654700002301675700002301698773008301721856008201804852000901886655001201895IND60092609620221207064022.0141103e20111223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009260962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.0512doi7 aPMC32864902pmcid7 a221967262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrcek, Tatjana10aSingle-Molecule mRNA Decay Measurements Reveal Promoter- Regulated mRNA Stability in Yeast  ap. 1484-1497.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMessenger RNA decay measurements are typically performed on a population of cells. However, this approach cannot reveal sufficient complexity to provide information on mechanisms that may regulate mRNA degradation, possibly on short timescales. To address this deficiency, we measured cell cycle-regulated decay in single yeast cells using single-molecule FISH. We found that two genes responsible for mitotic progression, SWI5 and CLB2, exhibit a mitosis-dependent mRNA stability switch. Their transcripts are stable until mitosis, when a precipitous decay eliminates the mRNA complement, preventing carryover into the next cycle. Remarkably, the specificity and timing of decay is entirely regulated by their promoter, independent of specific cis mRNA sequences. The mitotic exit network protein Dbf2p binds to SWI5 and CLB2 mRNAs cotranscriptionally and regulates their decay. This work reveals the promoter-dependent control of mRNA stability, a regulatory mechanism that could be employed by a variety of mRNAs and organisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomplement 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amitosis 3anucleotide sequences 3ayeasts1 aLarson, Daniel R.,1 aMoldón, Alberto1 aQuery, Charles C.1 aSinger, Robert H.0 tCell.g2011 Dec. 23, v. 147, no. 7 p.1484-1497dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.11.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01650naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245009000176520073900266592002801005650001301033650002001046650001401066700005801080700006201138773009401200856008101294852000901375655001201384IND60725025920221118061043.0210124e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072502592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.12.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKayode-Adedeji, Tolulope10aDataset on Online mass media engagements on YouTube for terrorism related discussions  aThe data examined 150 mass media YouTube videos on Al-Shahab, Boko Haram and IS terrorist groups from 2014 to 2016 to ascertain the kind of discussions about terrorist groups online.

Following mowing, (1) height, spinescence, and tannin content in sprouts produced after burning; (2) nutrient and fiber contents in sprouts of the 3 study species; and (3) utilization of sprouts of each species in burned and unburned plots were determined in each of blackbrush acacia (Acacia rigidula Benth.), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.), and spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida Torr.). Averaged across sampling periods, burned blackbrush acacia and honey mesquite had 54%% and 94%%, respectively, shorter thorns than unburned plants. Burned and unburned spiny hackberry plants had similar thorn lengths. Averaged across species, sprouts of burned plants had similar tannin levels as unburned plants 6 and 12 weeks after burning. Sprouts of burned blackbrush acacia had higher levels of tannin than sprouts of unburned plants 34 weeks after burning. Leaf material from sprouts of burned spiny hackberry plants had higher crude protein and digestible protein than leaf material from unburned plants. Blackbrush acacia sprouts in burned plots contained lower digestible dry matter and digestible energy than plants in unburned plots. Honey mesquite sprouts in burned plots contained higher digestible dry matter and digestible energy than plants in unburned plots. Burning appears to be a desirable follow-up treatment to mowing because it temporarily increases nutritional value of shrub sprouts, decreases physical defenses, and suppresses growth of shrub species that have low palatability to white-tailed deer.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAcacia rigidula 0ablackbrush acacia 0abrush management 0aCeltis pallida 0amowing 0asouthern Texas 0aspiny hackberry 0awhite-tailed deer1 aFulbright, Timothy E.,1 aForbes, T.

Accumulating large-scale methylation data motivates the development of analytic tools to facilitate methylome data mining. One critical phenomenon associated with dynamic DNA methylation is the altered DNA binding affinity of transcription factors, which plays key roles in gene expression regulation. In this study, we conceived an algorithm to predict epigenetic regulatory modules through recursive motif analyses on differentially methylated loci. A two-step procedure was implemented to first group differentially methylated loci into clusters according to their correlations in methylation profiles and then to repeatedly identify the transcription factor binding motifs significantly enriched in each cluster. We applied this tool on methylome datasets generated for mouse brains which have a lack of DNA demethylation enzymes TET1 or TET2. Compared with wild type control, the differentially methylated CpG sites identified in TET1 knockout mouse brains differed significantly from those determined for TET2 knockout. Transcription factors with zinc finger DNA binding domains including Egr1, Zic3, and Zeb1 were predicted to be associated with TET1 mediated brain methylome programming, while Lhx family members with Homeobox domains were predicted to be associated with TET2 function. Interestingly, genomic loci from a co-methylated cluster often host motifs for transcription factors sharing the same DNA binding domains. Altogether, our study provided a systematic approach for epigenetic regulatory module identification and will help throw light on the interplay of DNA methylation and transcription factors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA demethylation 3aDNA methylation 3aalgorithms 3abinding capacity 3abinding proteins 3abiotechnology 3abrain 3adata collection 3aenzymes 3aepigenetics 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3aknockout mutants 3aloci 3amice 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif 0aDNA methylation 0aTranscription factor 0aMotif 0aBrain development 0aRegulatory module 0aGene expression1 aWei, Xiaoran1 aXie, Hehuang0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2019, v. 17 p.507-515dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2019.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100003000167245008800197300001600285520136500301592002801666653002701694653003001721653002201751653001101773700002701784700002901811700002601840700002501866700003801891700003301929700003301962700002001995700003302015773015402048856011502202852000902317655001202326IND60128979120221119155416.0151124e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012897912DNAL7 a10.2987/8756-971X(2006)22[654:HPOCQI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aELIZONDO-QUIROGA, ARMANDO10aHost-feeding preference of culex quinquefasciatus in monterrey, northeastern mexico  ap. 654-661.  aStudies were conducted to determine the host selection patterns of Culex quinquefasciatus in the municipalities of Guadalupe and Escobedo near Monterrey, northeastern Mexico. Mosquitoes were captured inside and outside houses. Chickens and humans were the most common blood sources for all Cx. quinquefasciatus females, accounting for nearby 70%% of blood meals. Human blood was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 36.4%% and 28.4%% of engorged females resting inside houses in Guadalupe and Escobedo, respectively. The proportions of indoor resting females fed on chicken blood were 38.7%% and 56.7%%, respectively. The weighted and unweighted human blood index ((HBI)) values were calculated, by using indoor and outdoor data, from the proportions of humanfed mosquitoes. Weighted means ((HBI)) estimates for Guadalupe and Escobedo were 23.0%% and 15.4%%, respectively. The forage ratios ((FRs)) for humans were <1.0 ((with or without chicken populations)); consequently, it seems that these mosquitoes feed on humans with less frequency in comparison with chickens, horses, and pigs. The FRs for chickens were the highest of all available hosts ((1.7 and 3.2)), and they were the most abundant hosts in Escobedo, and the second most abundant in Guadalupe, indicating a selective bias of Cx. quinquefasciatus for chickens ((i.e. ornithophagic)).  aPublisher supplied data 0aCulex quinquefasciatus 0ablood meal identification 0ahuman blood index 0aMexico1 aFLORES-SUAREZ, ADRIANA1 aELIZONDO-QUIROGA, DARWIN1 aPONCE-GARCIA, GUSTAVO1 aBLITVICH, BRADLEY J.1 aCONTRERAS-CORDERO, JUAN FRANCISCO1 aGONZALEZ-ROJAS, JOSE IGNACIO1 aMercado Hernández, Roberto,1 aBEATY, BARRY J.1 aFernández Salas, Ildefonso,0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2006 Dec., v. 22, no. 4 p.654-661dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F8756-971X%282006%2922%5B654%3AHPOCQI%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245015900207300001600366520125700382592002801639650001001667650002001677650002701697650003501724650001101759650003301770650001301803700002001816700001801836773009401854856008101948852000902029655001202038IND60725026120221118061108.0210124e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072502612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArtoni, Fiorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0967-664312aA visual working memory dataset collection with bootstrap Independent Component Analysis for comparison of electroencephalographic preprocessing pipelines  ap. 787-793.  aHere we present an electroencephalographic (EEG) collection of 71-channel datasets recorded from 14 subjects (7 males, 7 females, aged 20–40 years) while performing a visual working memory task with a T set of 150 Independent Component Analysis (ICA) decompositions by Extended Infomax using RELICA, each on a bootstrap resampling of the data.

These bootstrap ICs may be used as benchmarks for different data preprocessing pipelines and/or ICA algorithms, allowing investigation of the effects that noise or insufficient data have on the quality of ICA decompositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3adata collection 3aelectroencephalography 3aindependent component analysis 3amemory 3aprincipal component analysis 3avariance1 aDelorme, Arnaud1 aMakeig, Scott0 tData in Brief.g2019 Feb., v. 22 p.787-793dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009400168300001600262500001500278520135500293592002801648650001901676650001601695650002101711650001201732650001601744650001301760650001201773650001701785650002801802650001101830650001101841650001101852650002001863650001801883650002001901650002201921651001201943651001801955653001501973653003601988653001002024700001502034700002102049700001702070773013302087856008302220852000902303655001202312IND60127991620221122074412.0151114e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012799162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-006-9022-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarretero, C.

The same cassava clones were cultivated in greenhouse conditions on a sandy soil substratum and irrigated with 20%% strength Hoagland solution, and additions of 0, 4, and 8 g L⁻⁻¹ of NaCl. Salinity negatively affected the survival, development, leaf water content, and mineral composition (mainly by accumulation of Cl and Na) of both in vitro and ex vitro plants, but with different intensity in each clone. In both conditions of culture (in vitro and ex vitro) clone SOM-1, from a desert arid saline zone of Somalia, was the most tolerant and clone ““05””, from a rainy region of Ivory Coast, the most sensitive. Clone ““50”” tolerance to in vitro salt treatments, although lower, was not significantly different from that of SOM-1 but the ex vitro response was similar to ““05””. In general, there was a correlation between in vitro and ex vitro behavior of the cassava plant regarding salt tolerance, which would allow the in vitro culture method to be used for selection of salt-tolerant plants of this crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3asalt tolerance 3asandy soils 3ain vitro culture 3acassava 3agreenhouses 3asalinity 3asucrose 3amyo-inositol 3aplant growth substances 3aclones 3aleaves 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3awater content 3amineral content 3aManihot esculenta 3aSomalia 3aCote d'Ivoire 0aGreenhouse 0aSalt tolerance In vitro culture 0acrops1 aCantos, M.1 aGarcíía, J.

A variety of measurements have been adopted to systemically characterize the RD-derived ACs. The micro-morphology, pore structures and surface chemistry property were fully investigated by SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, N₂ adsorption–desorption analysis, XPS and IR, respectively. The RD-derived ACs possess as large specific surface area as up to 1416.966m²g⁻¹ and the pore size distribution concentrates on 1–2, 2–5, 5–15 and 25–35nm, indicating their hierarchically porous structures. Furthermore, electrochemical measurements including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were conducted to estimate RDAC's supercapacitive performance and rate capability. The investigations illustrated that RD derived ACs reached as high specific capacitance as 170.5 and 153.2Fg⁻¹ at a scan rate of 5mVs⁻¹ in 1M H₂SO₄ and 1M Et₄NBF₄/AN, respectively. In addition, the RD-derived ACs demonstrated good long-term cycling stability and more than 90% initial capacity have been retained after 6400 cycles at a large current density of 1Ag⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acapacitance 3achlorides 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3anitrogen 3aoils 3aporosity 3arapeseed 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfuric acid 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc 0aRapeseed dregs 0aHierarchically porous 0aHeteroatom-doped 0aCarbons 0aSupercapacitors1 aZhu, Hui1 aWang, Chuanyi1 aSun, Kang1 aYin, Jiao0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 509 p.369-383dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010100173300001600274520125000290592002801540653001401568653001301582653000901595653000901604653001801613653001701631653001401648700001801662700002201680700002401702700002301726773010401749856008401853852000901937655001201946IND60607570520221116140640.0180731e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060757052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matdes.2016.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMogha, Navin Kumar10aBiocompatible ZrO2- reduced graphene oxide immobilized AChE biosensor for chlorpyrifos detection  ap. 312-320.  aBased on Acetylcholinestrase (AChE) inhibition, a novel biosensing electrode involving Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) supported Zirconium Oxide (ZrO2/RGO) nanoparticles is fabricated for Chlorpyrifos (pesticide) detection. AChE/ZrO2/RGO biosensor when used for pesticide detection, exhibited high sensitivity towards Chlorpyrifos. Typically AChE/ZrO2/RGO biosensing electrode is capable of detecting Chlorpyrifos concentration as low as 10⁻¹³M (with 28% enzyme inhibition). Furthermore the enzyme inhibition is remarkable high (>70%) in case of high Chlorpyrifos concentration (up to 10⁻⁴M). Our results indicate that AChE/ZrO2/RGO is an efficient and biocompatible electrode that can be used for Chlorpyrifos detection in ultra low concentrations. Electrochemical sensing response of AChE/ZrO2/RGO sensor revealed two different linear ranges of chlorpyrifos detection. The first linear response was observed from 10⁻¹³M to 10⁻⁹M whereas the second linear range was observed between 10⁻⁹M to 10⁻⁴M revealing complete saturation of enzyme active sites by Chlorpyrifos. Ameperometric response of AChE/ZrO2/RGO electrode demonstrates constant decrease in the current with respect to increase in the Chlorpyrifos concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBiosensor 0aGraphene 0aZrO2 0aAChE 0aNanocomposite 0aChlorpyrifos 0aPesticide1 aSahu, Vikrant1 aSharma, Meenakshi1 aSharma, Raj Kishore1 aMasram, Dhanraj T.0 tMaterials and design.g2016 Dec. 05, v. 111 p.312-320dElsevier LtdwJournal:26823x0264-12757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2016.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03969naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011900167300001600286520179400302592002802096650001502124650001202139650002502151650001102176650002302187650002302210650002902233650001002262650002402272650002402296650002002320650002702340650001302367650001302380650002102393650002502414650002102439650002402460650001102484650002002495650001302515650002502528650002002553650002402573650002102597650002202618650001802640650001002658650002702668650002202695650001702717650001402734653002302748653002102771653002002792653002702812653001802839653002402857653001702881653002602898700002102924700001902945700002402964773013302988856008103121961001203202852000903214655001203223IND60127991720221120103043.0150430e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012799172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-007-9026-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPijut, Paula M.10aTechnological advances in temperate hardwood tree improvement including breeding and molecular marker applications  ap. 283-303.  aHardwood forests and plantations are an important economic resource for the forest products industry worldwide and to the international trade of lumber and logs. Hardwood trees are also planted for ecological reasons, for example, wildlife habitat, native woodland restoration, and riparian buffers. The demand for quality hardwood from tree plantations will continue to rise as the worldwide consumption of forest products increases. Tree improvement of temperate hardwoods has lagged behind that of coniferous species and hardwoods of the genera Populus and Eucalyptus. The development of marker systems has become an almost necessary complement to the classical breeding and improvement of hardwood tree populations for superior growth, form, and timber characteristics. Molecular markers are especially valuable for determining the reproductive biology and population structure of natural forests and plantations, and the identity of genes affecting quantitative traits. Clonal reproduction of commercially important hardwood tree species provides improved planting stock for use in progeny testing and production forestry. Development of in vitro and conventional vegetative propagation methods allows mass production of clones of mature, elite genotypes or genetically improved genotypes. Genetic modification of hardwood tree species could potentially produce trees with herbicide tolerance, disease and pest resistance, improved wood quality, and reproductive manipulations for commercial plantations. This review concentrates on recent advances in conventional breeding and selection, molecular marker application, in vitro culture, and genetic transformation, and discusses the future challenges and opportunities for valuable temperate (or “fine”) hardwood tree improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aPopulus 3aasexual reproduction 3aclones 3aeconomic resources 3aforest plantations 3aforest products industry 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic markers 3agenetic transformation 3agenotype 3ahardwood 3ahardwood forests 3aherbicide resistance 3ain vitro culture 3ainternational trade 3alumber 3apest resistance 3aplanting 3apopulation structure 3aprogeny testing 3aquantitative traits 3ariparian buffers 3atimber production 3atree breeding 3atrees 3avegetative propagation 3awildlife habitats 3awood quality 3awoodlands 0aClonal propagation 0aCryopreservation 0aForest genetics 0aGenetic transformation 0aOrganogenesis 0aPlantation forestry 0aRegeneration 0aSomatic embryogenesis1 aWoeste, Keith E.1 aVengadesan, G.1 aMichler, Charles H.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2007 Aug., v. 43, no. 4 p.283-303dThe Society for In Vitro Biologyx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-007-9026-93Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245012700207300001800334500001900352500002000371520099800391592002801389596003101417650002501448650001301473650000901486650001001495650001701505650001401522650001101536650001301547650002601560650003301586700006401619700006701683700005701750700005601807773012601863856007901989852000902068655001202077IND60714377920221120034202.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071437792DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.154482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeshavarzi, Maryam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1112-013110aEnhancement of polyphenolic content extraction rate with maximal antioxidant activity from green tea leaves by cold plasma  ap. 3415-3422.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) atmospheric cold plasma was evaluated as a tool to increase the extraction rate of total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity from green tea leaves.

Recently, natural polymers have received greater importance in regenerative medicine, mainly in the process of healing wounds and burns due to their unique properties which also include safety, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. In this respect, starch is considered to be one of the reliable natural polymers to promote the process of wound healing at a significantly faster rate. Starch and starch-based electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds have been used for the wound healing process which includes the process of adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration of cells. It also possesses significant activity to encapsulate and deliver biomaterials at a specific site which persuades the wound healing process at an increased rate. As the aforementioned scaffolds mimic the native extracellular matrix more closely, may help in the acceleration of wound closure, which in turn may lead to the promotion of tissue reorganization and remodeling. In-depth knowledge in understanding the properties of nanofibrous scaffolds paves a way to unfold novel methods and therapies, also to overcome challenges associated with wound healing. This review is intended to provide comprehensive information and recent advances in starch-based electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds for wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3acost effectiveness 3aextracellular matrix 3amedicine 3ananofibers 3astarch 0aStarch-based materials 0aElectrospinning method 0aNanofibrous scaffolds 0aWound healing application1 aCui, Bo1 aZhang, Hongxia1 aGunasekaran, Vinoth Prasanna1 aAriyo, Adeniran Lateef1 aJayaraman, Selvaraj1 aRajagopal, Ponnulakshmi1 aLong, Qianfa0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 28, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.09.274  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007700162300001600239500001500255520165300270592002801923650001601951650002501967650001301992650001802005650001502023650002602038650001802064650001202082650002602094650001602120650001002136650001802146650002002164653003402184653001002218653002302228653002602251700001602277773013302293856008102426852000902507655001202516IND60127991820221122054104.0150430e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012799182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-007-9045-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Y.

The highest frequency (1.1%) of ESM was obtained with explants from cones collected on July 1. All excised embryos of the July 1 collection were at the early proembryo stage. Two different culture media were compared. Forty-eight ESM lines were initiated on Pinus taeda basal medium (P6) (0.97%) with 13.5 μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 4.4 μM benzyladenine (BA). However, only four ESM were obtained on a modified Murashige and Skoog medium (MSG; 0.55%). Most of the ESM arose from the seeds that were at the stages ranging from late cleavage polyembry-ony to the early staged proembryo. Out of 52 lines (0.46%) that were produced from 11,388 explants, only two viable lines (0.018%) (PRT11 and PRT28) survived. As for somatic embryo maturation, the highest number (224/g⁻¹ FW) of matured cotyledonary somatic embryos (line PRT 28) was obtained on a medium containing 100 μM abscisic acid (ABA), 0.2 M maltose, and 1.2% gellan gum. For germination of the somatic embryos, the cotyledonary somatic embryos derived from maturation medium were transferred on half-strength Litvay medium (LM) plus 0.4% gellan gum. The germination rates were high (71.4–96.3%%) regardless of the concentrations of either ABA or gellan gum in the maturation medium. Approximately 500 somatic plants were recovered from the germination medium and transferred to the green house; finally most of them were transplanted successfully to the experimental field.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermination 3adevelopmental stages 3aexplants 3aculture media 3agellan gum 3asomatic embryogenesis 3abenzyladenine 3amaltose 3afield experimentation 3aPinus taeda 3a2,4-D 3aabscisic acid 3asomatic embryos 0aEmbryogenic tissue initiation 0aseeds 0aPlant regeneration 0aSomatic embryogenesis1 aMoon, H.

The present study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of this assay using canine sera from a collection of diagnostic accessions. Diagnostic sensitivity was assessed by testing 37 acute‐phase and 9 corresponding convalescent‐phase sera from dogs with a confirmed diagnosis of leptospirosis. Specificity was determined by testing sera from sick dogs with non‐leptospiral infections (n=15) and healthy dogs with incomplete history of vaccination (n=45). During acute phase of illness, LFA scored positive for 28/37 sera with a sensitivity of 75.7 per cent while only 9/37 (24.3 per cent) samples were positive on microscopic agglutination test. The specificity of the LFA was 98.3 per cent (59/60). This test showed 89.7 and 100 per cent overall agreements with clinical diagnosis for acute‐phase and convalescent‐phase sera, respectively. The impact of vaccination on the LFA was also determined and vaccine‐stimulated IgM responses were negative in 19/25 (76 per cent) dogs at 12 weeks post vaccination. In conclusion, the LFA is a rapid and reliable test for early detection of Leptospira‐specific IgM during acute phase of canine leptospirosis. However, interpretation of a positive result must be made in the context of clinical signs and vaccination history.  aPublisher supplied data  cZoetis 3aagglutination tests 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3adogs 3aleptospirosis 3avaccination 3aEurope1 aGrahlmann, M.1 aHapke, H.1 aVelineni, S.1 aLin, D.1 aKohn, B.0 tVeterinary record.g2017 May, v. 180, no. 21 p.517-517dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.1041343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014900165500002200314500002200336520181600358592002802174650004402202650001702246650002502263650001202288650002502300650001402325650002302339650002102362650001802383650001502401650001102416650001802427650001802445650001902463650004402482650001302526650001302539650001202552650001402564650003302578650001502611650001702626650001602643700001302659700001402672700001302686700001902699773008802718856008502806852000902891655001202900IND60584389920221120175629.0181029s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058438992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Peng,10aRETRACTION: Novel polysulfone membrane covalent bearing functionalized ionic liquids and its catalytic performance for biomass inulin hydrolysis  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aPolysulfone powders covalently linked with acidic ionic liquids (ILs) as catalyst (PSF-ILs) were synthesized. It was prepared into casting solution to fabricate membrane via non-solvent induced phase separation method. Chemical structure of the PSF-ILs was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. The microstructure of PSF-ILs membranes was characterized by the scanning electron microscopy, pore size, porosity and contact angle measurements. The effects of the covalently incorporated ILs on the water flux, bovine serum albumin rejection and especially catalytic performance were investigated systematically to elucidate the microstructure-performance relationships. The structure of the membrane was regulated subtly by varying solvent or polymer concentration. Compared with the finger-like membrane, the resultant sponge-like membrane exhibited better catalytic performance for inulin hydrolysis due to higher porosity and specific surface area. Moreover, the effects of membrane thickness, porosity, reaction temperature and flux on catalytic performance of membrane that was constructed as a reactor were investigated. Interestingly, the turnover number of PSF-ILs membrane, i.e. the number of products generated by each active site of catalyst in unit time, was higher than the homogeneous ILs and PEK-C-ILs powders. Furthermore, the extended trial of the membrane demonstrated its reusability with only a little loss of catalytic activity. This novel catalytic membrane was first designed and prepared, not only subtly avoided the recycling of homogeneous ILs catalyst, but also effectively strengthened the mass transfer of substrates between the bulk of the feed and active sites on the pore wall, consequentially, improved the catalytic activity of ILs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aartificial membranes 3abiomass 3abovine serum albumin 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acontact angle 3ahydrolysis 3ainulin 3aionic liquids 3amass transfer 3amicrostructure 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3aporosity 3apowders 3arecycling 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseparation 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aWang, Xi1 aMao, Heng1 aLi, Shuo1 aZhao, Zhi-Ping0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011000164520124500274592002801519650001701547650002401564650001501588700001701603700001901620773012001639856007901759852000901838655001201847IND60748583320221122033637.0210827e20210814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074858332DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120807272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Danfeng 10aDiel and Circadian Patterns of Locomotor Activity in the Adults of Diamondback Moth (Plutella xylostella)  aThe Diamondback Moth (Plutella xylostella) is a highly destructive lepidopteran pest of cruciferous crops. However, there still is relatively little known about the locomotor activities of diel and the circadian patterns in P. xylostella. Here, we present an analysis of the diel locomotion of P. xylostella under several laboratory settings. We established a system for measuring the individual locomotor activities of P. xylostella and found that both males and females showed a nocturnal pattern of activity under 26 or 20 °C LD conditions, with activity peaking immediately after lights off and quickly declining after lights on. In addition, we showed that it is difficult to assess the free-running circadian rhythms of P. xylostella under 26 °C DD conditions. However, we found that males showed a higher power, rhythm index (RI) and rhythmic ratio than females under 20 °C DD conditions, which indicated that males in low-temperature conditions are much more suitable to study the free-running circadian rhythms of P. xylostella. The findings of this study will help us to have a better understanding of the diel activity of P. xylostella and may provide a foundation for the development of an effective pest management strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicaceae 3aPlutella xylostella 3alocomotion1 aYang, Guang 1 aChen, Wenfeng 0 tInsects.g2021 Aug. 14, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120807273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002100167245014500188300001600333520107300349592002801422653002501450653001401475653001501489653002401504653002901528653000801557653001501565653001301580700002601593700002201619700002601641700003401667773015401701856011501855852000901970655001201979IND60128979620221119155615.0151124e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012897962DNAL7 a10.2987/8756-971X(2006)22[689:IBRITP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMUENWORN, VITHEE10aInsecticide-induced behavioral responses in two populations of anopheles maculatus and anopheles sawadwongporni, malaria vectors in thailand  ap. 689-698.  aBehavioral responses of 2 wild-caught populations of Anopheles maculatus ((Theobald)) and Anopheles sawadwongporni Rattanarithikul and Green to operational field doses of DDT ((2 g/m²)) and permethrin ((0.5 g/m²)) were characterized using an excito-repellency test system.

Specimens from 2 test populations quickly escaped from direct contact with treated surfaces from 2 insecticides compared with paired controls. Noncontact repellency response to DDT was significantly pronounced in An. sawadwongporni ((P < 0.05)) and comparatively weak in An. maculatus, but it was statistically greater than individually paired controls ((P < 0.05)). We conclude that contact irritancy is a major behavioral response of both field populations when exposed directly to DDT and permethrin, whereas noncontact repellency to DDT also produced a significant escape response in An. sawadwongporni.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBehavioral avoidance 0airritancy 0arepellency 0aAnopheles maculatus 0aAnopheles sawadwongporni 0aDDT 0apermethrin 0aThailand1 aAKARATANAKUL, PONGTEP1 aBANGS, MICHAEL J.1 aPARBARIPAI, ATCHARIYA1 aCHAREONVIRIYAPHAP, THEERAPHAP0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2006 Dec., v. 22, no. 4 p.689-698dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F8756-971X%282006%2922%5B689%3AIBRITP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010100168300001600269520069000285592002800975650001801003650001701021650001501038650002601053650001501079650001401094650001501108650000901123651001001132653002401142653002701166653001601193653002301209653004101232700002001273700001601293700001301309700001801322700002101340773016501361856008501526852000901611655001201620IND60636758820221118041032.0190410e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063675882DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(18)61929-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPAN, Xing-lu10aProgress of the discovery, application, and control technologies of chemical pesticides in China  ap. 840-853.  aPesticides, which have the dual characteristics of being both helpful and harmful, are important materials for ensuring food security and human health.

GAP builds regionally based independent and sustainable influenza vaccine production capacity to mitigate the overall global shortage of influenza vaccines. The program also ensures adequate influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity in the event of an influenza pandemic.Since 2009, PATH has worked closely with two DCVMs in Vietnam: the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC) and VABIOTECH. Beginning in 2013, PATH also began working with Torlak Institute in Serbia; Instituto Butantan in Brazil; Serum Institute of India Private Ltd. in India; and Changchun BCHT Biotechnology Co. (BCHT) in China.The DCVMs supported under the GAP program all had existing influenza vaccine manufacturing capability and required technical support from PATH to improve vaccine yield, process efficiency, and product formulation. PATH has provided customized technical support for the manufacturing process to each DCVM based on their respective requirements.Additionally, PATH, working with BARDA and WHO, supported several DCVMs in the clinical development of influenza vaccine candidates progressing toward national licensure or WHO prequalification. As a result of the activities outlined in this review, several companies were able to make excellent progress in developing state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and completing early phase clinical trials. Licensure trials are currently ongoing or planned for several DCVMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDepartment of Health and Human Services 3aWorld Health Organization 3abiotechnology 3ablood serum 3abusiness enterprises 3aclinical trials 3adeveloping countries 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccines 3amanufacturing 3aresearch and development 3aBrazil 3aIndia 3aSerbia 3aVietnam 0aInfluenza vaccine manufacturing 0aClinical trial implementation 0aQuality management systems1 aHolt, Renee1 aHjorth, Richard1 aBerlanda Scorza, Francesco0 tVaccine.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 34, no. 45 p.5430-5435dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.07.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007200156300001200228500002000240520124800260592002801508650003201536650001501568650001101583650001301594650000901607650002301616650002001639650001401659700001701673700002301690700001901713700001901732700001601751773012501767856007401892852000901966655001201975IND60787623620221119104544.0220809e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078762362DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.1039262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, A.10aRole of canine circovirus in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea  ap. 542.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCanine circovirus (CanineCV) has been detected in some dogs with severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea, but its pathogenic role is unclear. This study evaluated a suspected association between the presence of CanineCV and acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS) in dogs. The prevalence of CanineCV in dogs with AHDS was compared with that in healthy dogs and those infected with canine parvovirus (CPV). Additionally, time to recovery and mortality rate were compared between CanineCV‐positive and CanineCV‐negative dogs. Faecal samples of dogs with AHDS (n=55), healthy dogs (n=66) and dogs infected with CPV (n=54) were examined by two real‐time TaqMan PCR assays targeting the replicase and capsid genes of CanineCV. CanineCV was detected in faecal samples of two dogs with AHDS, three healthy controls and seven dogs infected with CPV. Among the three groups, there was no significant difference in prevalence of CanineCV. CPV‐infected animals that were coinfected with CanineCV had a significantly higher mortality rate compared with those negative for CanineCV. CanineCV does not appear to be the primary causative agent of AHDS in dogs, but might play a role as a negative co‐factor in disease outcome in dogs with CPV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3aCircovirus 3acapsid 3adiarrhea 3adogs 3aetiological agents 3amixed infection 3amortality1 aHartmann, K.1 aLeutenegger, C.

Methane production yields and biodegradation kinetics in reactors operated under wet semi-dry and dry conditions were investigated. The experimental results showed a reduction in the specific final methane production yield of 57% and 63% in, respectively, semi-dry (TS = 14.8%) and dry (TS = 23.4%) conditions compared to wet (TS = 4.8%) conditions. The total VFA concentration and speciation are proposed as indicators of process development at different total solids content. High VFA concentrations were found in dry conditions, with a maximum total VFA concentration of 2110 mg/kg in dry conditions, 930 mg/kg in semi-dry conditions and 180 mg/kg in wet conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradation 3aenvironmental technology 3amethane 3amethane production 3arice straw 3atotal solids 3avolatile fatty acids 0aTotal solid 0adry anaerobic digestion 0avolatile fatty acids 0arice straw1 aEsposito, Giovanni1 aFabbricino, Massimiliano1 avan Hullebusch, Eric D.1 aLens, Piet N.L.1 aPirozzi, Francesco1 aPontoni, Ludovico0 tEnvironmental technology.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 37, no. 5 p.505-512dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2015.10742883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245016800180500002200348520140800370592002801778650001401806650001301820650002301833650001601856650001301872650001201885650002301897650001201920650001501932650001101947653001801958653001801976653002001994700002802014700002402042700002102066700002302087773012002110856005302230852000902283655001202292IND60795438720221118131030.0221004e20220928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079543872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.09.2782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiseh, Roohallah Saberi10aNano/microencapsulation of plant biocontrol agents by chitosan, alginate, and other important biopolymers as a novel strategy for alleviating plant biotic stresses  aPre-press version  aBiological biocides have the potential to reduce plant biotic stresses and boost development, but they tend to be unstable and degrade quickly. BCAs inhibit plant diseases and enhance crop productivity while being eco-friendly. Encapsulation research has increased in recent decades in response to the growing need for BCAs. These formulations can address the difficulties of free-form formulations. They can improve the efficacy of BCAs by prolonging their shelf life and offering the controlled release of biological components. Using a novel approach, they can be a potential platform for controlling biotic stressors, especially plant pathogens. Chitosan and alginate are two important biopolymers with great potential in enclosing BCAs. These can also be used alone for encapsulation, but their application in composite form eliminates the disadvantages of using them alone. However, several other biopolymers have significant roles in formulating BCAs, such as gums, gelatin, starch, and pectin. Given the amazing potential of these new formulations, this comprehensive review highlights more recent developments about encapsulating BCAs based on nano and micro-materials and their appliances in reducing plant biotic stressors. These prospects might provide the foundation for future opportunities to expand the efficacy and application BCAs by formulation technologies to combat plant pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiocides 3abiological control 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3agelatin 3amicroencapsulation 3apectins 3ashelf life 3astarch 0aEncapsulation 0aNanomaterials 0aBiotic stresses1 aHassanisaadi, Mohadeseh1 aVatankhah, Masoumeh1 aSoroush, Fatemeh1 aVarma, Rajender S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 Sept. 28, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.09.278  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011700169300001600286520135800302592002801660650002701688650002401715650001901739650001601758650001501774650001701789650002701806650002101833650001701854650001401871650002001885650001501905650001401920650002901934650001601963651000901979651001801988653002002006653002402026653001702050653001402067653002002081653001502101700001302116700001502129700001602144700002102160773016502181856008502346852000902431655001202440IND60636759020221118041017.0190410e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063675902DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(18)61972-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTONG, Hao-jie10aInvasion biology of the cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley: Current knowledge and future directions  ap. 758-770.  aThe cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), which is native to North America, emerged as a major invasive insect pest of multiple crops in Asia at the beginning of the 21st century. Considering the economic significance of this insect and its rapid worldwide spread, we examined the possible factors driving its invasions. In this paper, we summarize the life history traits of P. solenopsis conceivably related to population development in invaded regions; these traits include its use of diverse host plants, reproductive capacity and mode, adaptation to temperature, response to food shortage, and insecticidal resistance. Then, focusing on the multiple trophic interactions that may promote or hinder invasion, we review the mutualistic relationship of this mealybug with ants and predation and parasitism by natural enemies. Finally, we suggest topics for future research and provide our perspective on the biological invasions of this mealybug. We speculate that specific biological factors associated with this mealybug, particularly its wide host range, high reproductive potential, evolved changes in life history traits, and mutualism with ants have played important roles in its invasions, allowing this pest to become established and rapidly increase its population upon its introduction into new regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhenacoccus solenopsis 3aecological invasion 3afood shortages 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainvasive species 3alife history 3amutualism 3anatural enemies 3aparasitism 3apredation 3areproductive performance 3atemperature 3aAsia 3aNorth America 0acotton mealybug 0abiological invasion 0areproduction 0amutualism 0anatural enemies 0aadaptation1 aAo, Yan,1 aLI, Zi-hao1 aWang, Ying,1 aJIANG, Ming-xing0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2019 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.758-770dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

Winged adult males present such remarkable morphological differences from females that, to the untrained eye, conspecific adults of both sexes of P. solenopsis may be considered as two different insect species. A method to investigate sex-dimorphic mechanisms is by evaluating gene expression using RT-qPCR. However, the accuracy and consistency of this technique depend on the reference gene(s) selected. In this study, we analyzed the expression of 10 candidate reference genes in male and female P. solenopsis at different development stages, using common algorithms including the ΔCt method, NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, and a web-based analysis tool, RefFinder. The results showed that EF1-β, RP-L32 and RP-18S were selected as the most stable genes by both the ΔCt method and NormFinder; TUB-α was the most stable gene identified by BestKeeper; and RP-L40 and RP-L32 were the most stable genes ranked by geNorm. RefFinder, a comprehensive analysis software, ranked the ten genes and determined EF1-β and RP-L32 as the most suitable reference genes for the various developmental stages in male and female P. solenopsis. Furthermore, the two most suitable reference genes were validated by examining expression of the juvenile hormone acid O-methytransferase (JHAMT) gene. Results of the validation portion of the study showed that JHAMT expression was sex-biased towards males and exhibited a dynamic and classic expression pattern among the P. solenopsis developmental stages. The results can help further our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphic development in P. solenopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aPhenacoccus solenopsis 3aadults 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3afemales 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainsects 3ajuvenile hormones 3amales 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asexual dimorphism 3atransferases 0aPhenacoccus solenopsis 0aRT-qPCR 0asexual dimorphic development 0areference gene 0agene stability1 aZHANG, Zhi-jun1 aZHANG, Jin-ming1 aLI, Xiao-wei1 aHuang, Jun,1 aLIN, Wen-cai1 aLI, Wei-di1 aLI, Chuan-ren1 aLU, Yao-bin0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2019 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.854-864dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

Two different enzymes including papain and alcalase 2.4L were used in the hydrolysis process. The papain enzyme significantly increased the degree of hydrolysis (20.62%) and decreased the ζ‐potential (12.4 ± 1.31 mV) as compared to the alcalase enzyme, which represented 15.55% and 15.53 ± 0.77 mV, respectively. Alcalase 2.4L hydrolysate exhibited smaller particle size (822.047 ± 61.26 nm) than papain hydrolysate (1425.39 ± 44.82 nm). Hydrolysis by papain and alcalase 2.4L enzymes decreased the molecular weights (MW ≤ 1,000 Da) to 98.27% and 86.84%, respectively. The surface hydrophobicity and turbidity of the hydrolysates significantly affected by enzyme type and protein concentrations. By using the X‐ray diffraction analysis, the papain hydrolysate showed a higher relative crystallinity degree (30.33%) than alcalase 2.4L hydrolysate (29.40%), whereas the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed more clearly peaks for the amide bands of alcalase hydrolysate. The thermal properties also affected by enzymatic hydrolysis conditions, since the melting temperatures were 159.17 and 149.58 °C, whereas the rate of mass loss was 67.04% and 62.8%, for papain and alcalase hydrolysates, respectively. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The enzymatic hydrolysis process of proteins is employed to obtain the nutritionally and functionality important peptides that result during the preparation of fish protein hydrolysate. The objective of this study was to investigate the structural and physicochemical characteristics of protein hydrolysate prepared from Chinese sturgeon. This study showed that these characteristics were affected by enzymatic hydrolysis conditions especially enzyme type. The finding of this study may be useful in terms of providing new information on the properties of the protein hydrolysate and the structural changes resulting from controlled enzymatic hydrolysis conditions. Overall, these conditions could potentially alter the secondary structure of the protein hydrolysates or peptides and enhance their functional properties.  aPublisher supplied data  aBK20150152cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province 3aAcipenser sinensis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afish protein hydrolysate 3afood science 3afreeze drying 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3apapain 3aparticle size 3apeptides 3asubtilisin 3aturbidity1 aAli, Abdelmoneim H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0929-28501 aAL‐Bukhaiti, Wedad Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6581-86961 aMahdi, Amer Ali1 aXia, Wenshui0 tJournal of food science.g2020 Oct., v. 85, no. 10 p.3313-3322dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.153453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245006500165520137500230592002801605650001401633650001701647650001701664650001401681650001101695650001501706650001501721650001001736650001701746700001901763700001901782773015801801856007501959852000902034655001202043IND60649236120221117101040.0190703e20190518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064923612DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi80502322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Jennings 10aCorporate Editors in the Evolving Landscape of OpenStreetMap  aOpenStreetMap (OSM), the largest Volunteered Geographic Information project in the world, is characterized both by its map as well as the active community of the millions of mappers who produce it. The discourse about participation in the OSM community largely focuses on the motivations for why members contribute map data and the resulting data quality. Recently, large corporations including Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook have been hiring editors to contribute to the OSM database. In this article, we explore the influence these corporate editors are having on the map by first considering the history of corporate involvement in the community and then analyzing historical quarterly-snapshot OSM-QA-Tiles to show where and what these corporate editors are mapping. Cumulatively, millions of corporate edits have a global footprint, but corporations vary in geographic reach, edit types, and quantity. While corporations currently have a major impact on road networks, non-corporate mappers edit more buildings and points-of-interest: representing the majority of all edits, on average. Since corporate editing represents the latest stage in the evolution of corporate involvement, we raise questions about how the OSM community&mdash;and researchers&mdash;might proceed as corporate editing grows and evolves as a mechanism for expanding the map for multiple uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acorporations 3adata quality 3adatabases 3ahiring 3alandscapes 3amotivation 3aroads 3aspatial data1 aSarkar, Dipto 1 aPalen, Leysia 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2019 May 18, v. 8, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi80502323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007100148245011300219300001200332520160900344592002801953596008301981596008202064650001202146650001102158650001702169650001502186650003302201650001202234650002002246650001502266650001502281650001702296650002002313650001702333651001102350700002502361700002202386700002802408700004002436773015102476856008302627852000902710655001202719IND60779423420221122143733.0220831e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077942342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-10167-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Reginaldo Barboza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2171-707312aA soil quality physical–chemical approach 30 years after land-use change from forest to banana plantation  ap. 482.  aBananas are a worldwide cultivated crop and one of the main agricultural activities in Brazil. The banana orchards cultivated in the region of São Paulo State are under native areas of the Atlantic Forest biome. The Atlantic Forest has suffered agricultural and urban pressure for many years. Banana crops require soil management and superficial vegetation removal in the first cycles. We conducted a study aiming to understand the impact of long-standing banana cultivation in the Atlantic forest region. Soil samples in banana plantations (EBP) and forest remnants (FR) were collected from trenches with 0- to 100-cm layers. The soil bulk density in EBP until 30-cm depth was 12.76% higher than that in FR. Quantifications of macropores and micropores in FR reached values higher than those in EBP. The results showed that carbon stocks decreased from the top to the deeper layers. Thirty years after the conversion, the FR treatment accumulated 28.23% more carbon than EBP. Considering our results, it was evident that changes in physical and chemical properties reflected the negative impacts of the banana plantations, cropped through conventional management, when converted from forest even in regard to a remnant one. These findings, showed for the first time, lead us to understand the soil management of banana plantations, following conventional agriculture systems, as a potential carbon stock reducer and a factor resulting in the loss of soil quality in the region. Additionally, our data can be used by environmentalists and government policymakers to promote environmental sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data  a380875/2021-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a48165/2018-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3abananas 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aforests 3aland use change 3amacropores 3amicropores 3asoil density 3asoil management 3asoil quality 3aBrazil1 aRosa, Jéssica Silva1 aPacker, Ana Paula1 aBento, Camila Bolfarini1 ade Melo Silva, Francisca Alcivânia0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 July, v. 194, no. 7 p.482-482dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10167-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245005000192300001600242520154500258592002801803653002001831653000901851653002301860653001801883653001401901700003701915700002601952700002201978773013602000856010302136961001302239852000902252655001202261IND60130000920221122041512.0151126e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013000092DNAL7 a10.2111/1551-5028(2004)057[0248:PBEOGD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVERMEIRE, LANCE T.10aPatch burning effects on grazing distribution  ap. 248-252.  aPost-fire forage growth is known to be a strong attractant for large herbivores. However, fire has generally been avoided as a grazing distribution tool for fear of localized over utilization of forage resources. Our objectives were to examine whether forage utilization was affected by season of burn, determine cattle grazing preference for burned sites relative to non-burned sites, determine forb response to patch burning, and describe the relationship between end-of-season standing crop and distance from burned sites. Sixteen, 4-ha plots were burned in mid-November or mid-April and left exposed to cattle grazing for the duration of the growing season. Burn treatments were blocked within pastures to allow individual herds access to fall-burned, spring-burned, and non-burned sites. Standing crop estimates for grasses, forbs, and total herbage were made in September by clipping on burned sites and at 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 m distant from the plot's edge. Standing crop was also sampled in exclosures on burned and non-burned sites. Cattle showed no preference for one burn season over the other. Cattle were strongly attracted to burned sites, reducing grass standing crop 78%% within burns compared to 19%% outside the influence of burns. Grass standing crop decreased in a predictable manner with proximity to burned plots. Forbs increased 60%% to 1,095 kg ha⁻⁻¹ on grazed burned plots, but were unaffected by distance from burns. Patch burning can be employed as an effective, inexpensive grazing distribution tool.  aPublisher supplied data 0aanimal behavior 0afire 0agrazing management 0amixed prairie 0aselection1 aMitchell, Rob't B.q(Robert B.),1 aFUHLENDORF, SAMUEL D.1 aGILLEN, ROBERT L.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2004 May, v. 57, no. 3 p.248-252dAlliance Communications GroupwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111/1551-5028(2004)057[0248:PBEOGD]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013200167300001600299520155700315592002801872650002801900650003001928650001501958650000901973650001401982650001201996650001002008650001202018650001402030650001602044653001902060653002202079653001702101653001402118653002202132700001802154700002102172700001802193700001702211773016502228856008502393852000902478655001202487IND60636759220221118041147.0190410e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063675922DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(18)61974-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLÜ, Jia-le10aQuantitative impact of mating duration on reproduction and offspring sex ratio of Phytoseiulus persimilis (Acari: Phytoseiidae)  ap. 884-892.  aPhytoseiulus persimilis is an important biological control agent, commercially produced worldwide. To increase understandings of its reproduction, herein we provided quantitative descriptions of the inflation and deflation of its spermathecae as a function of time and copulation duration, and the quantitative impact of copulation termination on volume of spermatheca vesicle, fecundity, and offspring sex ratio. After mating started, at least one spermatheca started to inflate immediately, but no egg was produced until spermatheca volume reached 1021 µm3. Beyond this size, cumulative fecundity was linearly correlated with vesicle volume. Producing one egg required 36 µm3 volume increase of the vesicle. Each spermatheca vesicle reached its peak size at the end of mating duration (ca. 2.38 h after mating started), and started to shrink immediately. In 24 h, ca. 71% individuals had one completely shriveled spermatheca, while in 72 h all individuals had at least one shriveled spermatheca. The estimated maximum cumulative fecundity per female after a single mating is (69.4±7.7) eggs. No significant impact of mating termination on offspring sex ratio was observed after mating duration reached 60 min, while higher proportion of male offspring was observed when mating duration is 15 or 30 min. This study is the first step to investigate possible male impact on offspring sex ratio in P. persimilis. Our results suggested the number of sperms received during mating be a restriction factor of P. persimilis offspring sex ratio regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytoseiulus persimilis 3abiological control agents 3acopulation 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3amales 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3aspermatheca 0apredatory mite 0apseudoarrhenotoky 0aspermathecae 0afecundity 0asex determination1 aZHANG, Bao-he1 aJIANG, Xiao-huan1 aWANG, En-dong1 aXU, Xue-nong0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2019 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.884-892dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

Navigational assistance for disabled or aged people, guidance for robots, augmented reality for gaming, and tourism or training emergency assistance units are just a few examples of the emerging applications requiring real three-dimensional (3D) spatial data of indoor scenes. This work proposes the use of point clouds for obstacle-aware indoor pathfinding. Point clouds are firstly used for reconstructing semantically rich 3D models of building structural elements in order to extract initial navigational information. Potential obstacles to navigation are classified in the point cloud and directly used to correct the path according to the mobility skills of different users. The methodology is tested in several real case studies for wheelchair and ordinary users. Experiments show that, after several iterations, paths are readapted to avoid obstacles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adata collection 3arobots 3aspatial data 3atourism 3aurban population1 aBoguslawski, Pawel 1 aKhoshelham, Kourosh 1 aLorenzo, Henrique 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2019 May 19, v. 8, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi80502333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03569naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245008300215300001800298506007600316520197200392592002802364506003702392650001402429650002502443650001402468650002302482650001902505650001302524650001202537651002002549653001202569653001402581653001302595653001302608653001502621653001302636653000802649653000802657653000802665653000802673653000802681653000902689653000802698653000902706700002502715700002002740700001802760700001902778773009902797856008602896852000902982655001202991IND60607571120221207092643.0190319e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060757112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.08.0192doi7 aPMC53577072pmcid7 a275314112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLean, Kenneth A.14aThe 2015 global production capacity of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine  ap. 5410-5413.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA global shortage and inequitable access to influenza vaccines has been cause for concern for developing countries who face dire consequences in the event of a pandemic. The Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines (GAP) was launched in 2006 to increase global capacity for influenza vaccine production to address these concerns. It is widely recognized that well-developed infrastructure to produce seasonal influenza vaccines leads to increased capacity to produce pandemic influenza vaccines. This article summarizes the results of a survey administered to 44 manufacturers to assess their production capacity for seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza vaccine production. When the GAP was launched in 2006, global production capacity for seasonal and pandemic vaccines was estimated to be 500million and 1.5billion doses respectively. Since 2006 there has been a significant increase in capacity, with the 2013 survey estimating global capacity at 1.5billion seasonal and 6.2billion pandemic doses. Results of the current survey showed that global seasonal influenza vaccine production capacity has decreased since 2013 from 1.504billion doses to 1.467billion doses. However, notwithstanding the overall global decrease in seasonal vaccine capacity there were notable positive changes in the distribution of production capacity with increases noted in South East Asia (SEAR) and the Western Pacific (WPR) regions, albeit on a small scale. Despite a decrease in seasonal capacity, there has been a global increase of pandemic influenza vaccine production capacity from 6.2 billion doses in 2013 to 6.4 billion doses in 2015. This growth can be attributed to a shift towards more quadrivalent vaccine production and also to increased use of adjuvants. Pandemic influenza vaccine production capacity is at its highest recorded levels however challenges remain in maintaining this capacity and in ensuring access in the event of a pandemic to underserved regions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadjuvants 3adeveloping countries 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccines 3ainfrastructure 3apandemic 3asurveys 3aSouth East Asia 0aVaccine 0aInfluenza 0aSeasonal 0aPandemic 0aProduction 0aCapacity 0aGAP 0aEUR 0aAMR 0aEMR 0aWPR 0aSEAR 0aAFR 0aLMIC1 aGoldin, Shoshanna​1 aNannei, Claudia1 aSparrow, Erin1 aTorelli, Guido0 tVaccine.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 34, no. 45 p.5410-5413dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014900169300001400318520063400332592002800966650001900994650001201013650001301025650002301038650003901061650001601100700002201116773009501138856008401233852000901317655001201326IND60113116220221121060643.0141111e20130927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011311622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVajda, Péter,10aEffects of the back pressure and the temperature on the finite layer thickness of the adsorbed phase layer in supercritical fluid chromatography  ap. 41-47.  aThe excess adsorption isotherm of ethanol from liquid carbon dioxide on a silicagel column was determined in a range of back pressures and temperatures.

The analysis of the linear decreasing part of the excess isotherm around its inflection point provided the finite layer thickness of the adsorbed phase.

The evaluation of various experiences and calculations of the most representative variables on the subject showed that in the short and medium term, there are no conditions for corn ethanol becoming a widespread practice, neither in Brazil nor in any other South American country. A comparative analysis was conducted considering three variables: Leveled Cost of Fuel (LCOF); Energy Return on Investment (EROI) and Land use. The LCOF calculations show that corn ethanol LCOF is 43% cheaper in Mato Grosso State (MT) than in Sao Paulo State (SP). Corn ethanol’s LCOF is 2.8 times and 1.26 times cheaper than the sugarcane ethanol LCOF in SP and MT states, respectively. Sugarcane ethanol EROI is 27% higher than corn ethanol EROI. For land use, it took 18 × 10⁶ ha to produce 1,054,858 L of corn ethanol in MT during the 2019 harvesting season. This surface is 1 × 10⁶ hectares bigger than the area used to produce the same amount of sugarcane ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aland use 3asugarcane 3asugars 3aBrazil1 aAlves, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4370-49910 tSugar tech.g2022 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.857-869dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-021-01103-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245006500203300001100268506007600279520139000355592002801745506003701773650001301810650001201823650001401835650001201849650001101861650001101872650002601883650001101909650001301920650002101933700001701954700001801971773010101989856007902090852000902169655001202178IND60440820720221207050144.0170721e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044082072DNAL7 a10.1186/1999-3110-55-282doi7 aPMC54328202pmcid7 a285109662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wen-Zhe10aFrom leaf and branch into a flower: Magnolia tells the story  ap. 28.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In the classical doctrines, Magnolia was frequently considered the archetype among flowering plants, and its conduplicate carpel with marginal placentation was assumed to be derived from a leaf-like organ bearing ovules along its margins. Although the robustness of this concept has been seriously questioned by advances in botanical research, especially the emergence of Magnolia deeper in the angiosperm tree of life in molecular systematics, it remains the most-taught interpretation for the origin of carpels. RESULTS: To test the validity of this classical doctrine, we performed comparative anatomical analyses of the vascular bundles in the flowers of Magnolia using fine (8-μm) paraffin -sections. We document the presence of two independent vascular systems in the carpels: the collateral bundles of the dorsal and ventral veins arising from the stelar bundle, and the amphicribral ovular bundles arising from the cortical bundles. This observation in conjunction with data from other fields concurrently suggests that the ovary wall is equivalent to a foliar organ whereas the placenta represents an ovule-bearing shoot. CONCLUSIONS: Our observation on the former model plant, Magnolia, nullifies the classical doctrine of carpel evolution and supports the Unifying Theory. This conclusion prompts a reconsideration of the concept of angiosperm flower evolution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMagnolia 3acarpels 3aevolution 3aflowers 3aleaves 3amodels 3amolecular systematics 3aovules 3aplacenta 3avascular bundles1 aHilu, Khidir1 aWang, Yaling,0 tBotanical studies.g2014 Dec., v. 55, no. 1 p.28-28dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1999-31107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1999-3110-55-283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01662naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003700150245010100187300001600288520059200304592002800896650001300924650001200937650001500949650001500964650001100979650001400990650001501004653002001019653002501039653001901064700002701083773010801110856008501218852000901303655001201312IND50087733020221118234838.0200514e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008773302DNAL7 a10.1080/01916122.2011.5581732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOverballe-Petersen, Mette Venås14aThe selection of small forest hollows for pollen analysis in boreal and temperate forest regions  ap. 146-153.  aSmall forest hollows represent a specialised site type for pollen analysis, since they mainly record the vegetation within an approximate radius of 20–100 m from the hollow.

We characterised the genetic constitution of 18 U. crassus populations in Germany and Sweden originating from six major drainage systems using a set of nine microsatellite markers. U. crassus populations from Northern Germany and Sweden revealed similar genetic constitution with high genetic diversity, whereas populations from Southern Germany showed higher proportions of common ancestors and a stronger host-dependent diversification. The structured spatial genetic patterns suggest two glacial refugia and a strong north–south differentiation. The Elbe river basin was likely an important source for recolonisation northwards to Sweden, and populations from the low mountain range in the Danube–Rhine systems acted as a source for recolonisation southwards to the Alps after retreating glaciations. We identified three major conservation units for the analysed U. crassus populations which should be considered in future conservation efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnio 3aUnionida 3aancestry 3adrainage systems 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aglaciation 3amountains 3amussels 3apopulation structure 3arefuge habitats 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aAlps region 3aGermany 3aNorthern European region 3aSweden1 aGeist, Juergen1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7698-34431 aKuehn, Ralph0 tHydrobiologia.g2018 Mar., v. 810, no. 1 p.177-189dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3134-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245014700206300001100353506007600364520181600440592002802256506003702284650001302321650002502334650002602359650001102385650001202396650002202408650001902430650001002449650001402459650001602473650001102489650001302500650001502513650000902528650001302537650001202550650001502562650001202577650001402589700001602603700001702619700001902636773010102655856007902756852000902835655001202844IND60440820920221207050136.0170721e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044082092DNAL7 a10.1186/1999-3110-55-402doi7 aPMC54327722pmcid7 a285109682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ching-Hui10aMultiple resistance-activating substances produced by Humicola phialophoroides isolated from soil for control of Phytophthora blight of pepper  ap. 40.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Microorganisms capable of utilizing vegetable tissues for multiplication in soil were isolated, cultivated in liquid medium prepared from the same vegetable tissues, and tested for ability to activate resistance in pepper leaves against Phytophthora blight caused by Phytophthora capsici. RESULTS: Among the 121 microorganisms isolated, a fungus Humicola phialophoroides showed distinct ability to produce substances capable of activating resistance. The resistance-activating substances produced by H. phialophoroides were mostly retained in the mycelium, and were readily extracted from the mycelium powder with polar solvents. The extract was not inhibitory to zoospore germination or germ tube growth of P. capsici. In pepper leaves, the extract took only about 12 h to activate resistance against P. capsici. After activation, washing treated leaf surface with water did not have much effect on the resistance expression. In addition to being able to move from the upper leaf surface to lower leaf surface, the resistance-activating substances were capable of moving 5 mm acropetally and 10 mm basipetally in pepper leaves, Chromatography of the extract on silica gel column suggests that there are probably more than three components in the extract with resistance-activating ability. The resistance-activating activity of the mycelium extract was not affected by treatment with either cation or anion exchange resins, indicating that none of the active components have positive or negative charges on their molecules. CONCLUSION: Results show that H. phialophoroides is capable of producing multiple resistance-activating substances which are mostly retained in the mycelium. The study also indicates that none of the active components have positive or negative charges on their molecules.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHumicola 3aPhytophthora capsici 3aanion exchange resins 3ablight 3acations 3achemical elements 3achromatography 3afungi 3agerm tube 3agermination 3aleaves 3amycelium 3asilica gel 3asoil 3asolvents 3atissues 3avegetables 3awashing 3azoospores1 aLin, Mei-Ju1 aSu, Huey-Jen1 aKo, Wen-Hsiung0 tBotanical studies.g2014 Dec., v. 55, no. 1 p.40-40dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1999-31107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1999-3110-55-403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245012100205300001800326520089000344592002801234650002401262650001501286650002001301650002101321650001701342650002401359650001301383700002101396700002501417773013501442856008001577852000901657655001201666IND60685668620221117062057.0200305e20200206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068566862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b106552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasprzyk, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5513-875010aStudy of Properties of Solutions Based on Ethylene Carbonate and Poly(ethylene glycol)s with Different Chain Lengths  ap. 5046-5052.  aElectrolytes based on new binary solvent mixtures and well-known salts (LiTDI or LiPF₆) show no signs of crystallization, even when reaching extremely low temperatures such as −70 °C. This work involves studying mixtures of poly(ethylene glycol)s (both PEG350ME and PEG500DME) with ethylene carbonate. The new electrolytes derived from these mixtures display rather high conductivity values (around 2 mS cm–¹) at room temperature. A large influence of oligomer chain lengths and its ending groups was observed when forming noncrystallizing systems. Both thermal and electrochemical studies are presented. Along with a drop in temperature, the lack of crystallization in these systems may prevent the sudden drop in conductivity and sudden changes in the volume of such systems. This may be the answer to various issues that arise in cells which are exposed to low temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbonates 3acrystallization 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3apolyethylene glycol 3asolvents1 aZalewska, Aldona1 aWieczorek, Wladyslaw0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 06, v. 124, no. 9 p.5046-5052dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b106553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002600169245011700195300001600312520173400328592002802062653001802090653001402108653001302122653002002135700002202155700001902177700002302196773012702219856011702346852000902463655001202472IND60127918220221120112008.0151114e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012791822DNAL7 a10.1290/1071-2690(2002)038<0326:EAFCLD>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Michael J.,10aEPITHELIAL AND FIBROBLAST CELL LINES DERIVED FROM A SPONTANEOUS MAMMARY CARCINOMA IN A MMTV/neu TRANSGENIC MOUSE  ap. 326-333.  aFemale murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV)/neu transgenic mice, expressing a wild-type rat neu oncogene driven by an MMTV promoter, develop focal mammary adenocarcinomas that are pathologically very similar to human breast tumors. Two new cell lines were established from a mammary tumor that arose in a female MMTV/neu transgenic mouse. One of these lines, mammary carcinoma from Neu transgenic mouse A (MCNeuA), has an epithelial morphology, is cytokeratin positive, and expresses high levels of the neu transgene. Karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization analyses demonstrated genomic alterations in the MCNeuA cell line. The other line, N202Fb3, has a fibroblast morphology, is cytokeratin negative, and expresses the neu transgene at a very low level. This cell line also expresses smooth muscle αα-actin, suggesting that it is a myofibroblast line. The MCNeuA cell line is tumorigenic when injected into syngeneic MMTV/neu transgenic mice, with an in vivo doubling time of about 14 d. The rationale for establishing this tumor cell line was to provide a tumor transplantation system for rapidly assessing immunotherapeutic interventions before testing in the more cumbersome model of spontaneous tumor development in the MMTV/neu transgenic mice. Mice immunized with a Neu extracellular domain protein vaccine were protected against a subsequent inoculation of MCNeuA cells, indicating that this cell line will be useful for evaluating cancer vaccine strategies. This tumor cell line may also prove useful in studying the biological properties of the neu oncogene and its role in the malignant process. In addition, the tumor-derived fibroblast line may be useful for studying tumor––stromal cell interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 0abreast cancer 0acell line 0aHER2/neu 0atransgenic mice1 aWOLLISH, WENDY S.1 aLOBO, MARGARET1 aESSERMAN, LAURA J.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2002 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.326-333dTissue Culture Associationx1543-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1290%2F1071-2690%282002%29038%3C0326%3AEAFCLD%3E2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010000165500001900265520141200284592002801696650001801724650001601742650001801758650001801776650001901794650002201813650001201835653002301847653001601870653002301886653001101909700001601920700001601936700001601952700001801968700001501986700001702001700001502018700001602033700001802049700001602067700001402083700001502097700001602112700001702128700001502145700001702160700001502177700001202192700001502204700001702219700001702236773010702253856008502360852000902445655001202454IND60717110620221122064742.0201230e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071711062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1089212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhijun10aLipid raft-associated PI3K/Akt/SREBP1 signaling regulates coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) replication  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCoxsackievirus A16 (CA16) is one of predominant Enterovirus that possesses high pathogenicity. Lipid rafts, as cholesterol ­ and sphingolipid ­ enriched membrane nanodomains, are involved into many aspects of the virus life cycle. Our previous study found that lipid rafts integrity was essential for CA16 replication, but how lipid rafts regulate CA16 replication through activating downstream signaling remains largely unknown. Thus, in this study, we revealed that lipid rafts were required for activation of PI3K/Akt signaling at early stage of CA16 infection. Treatment with wortmannin significantly reduced the expression of virus protein, indicating PI3K/Akt signaling was beneficial for early stage of virus infection. In addition, lipid rafts integrity was also indispensable for PI3K/Akt activation during the late stage of CA16 infection, which played critical functions in mediating sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1 (SREBP1) maturation. Whereas, over-expression of SREBP1 exhibited inhibition on virus replication, suggesting that PI3K/Akt signaling and SREBP1 might positively and negatively influence virus replication in two different stages of infection, respectively. Taken together, our study demonstrates an important role of the lipid raft-associated PI3K/Akt/SREBP1 signaling in modulating CA16 replication, which will deepen our understanding mechanism of CA16 infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus A 3acholesterol 3apathogenicity 3asphingolipids 3aviral proteins 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aCoxsackievirus A16 0aLipid rafts 0aPI3K/Akt signaling 0aSREBP11 aLi, Xingzhi1 aGuo, Dexuan1 aLi, Pengfei1 aZhang, Yating1 aZou, Dehua1 aWang, Xianhe1 aXu, Jiaxin1 aWu, Xuening1 aShen, Yujiang1 aLi, Yuchang1 aYao, Lili1 aLi, Liyang1 aXiao, Lijie1 aSong, Baifen1 aMa, Jinzhu1 aLiu, Xinyang1 aXu, Shuyan1 aXu, Xin1 aZhang, Hua1 aZheng, Liang1 aCao, Hongwei0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2021 Jan., v. 252 p.108921-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1089213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009600158300001600254500002000270520134000290592002801630650002201658650002601680650001301706650002101719650001801740650002001758650001801778650002001796650001501816650001901831650001801850650001101868650002001879650003701899650001301936650001501949650003201964650002501996650002502021650001502046650001602061700001802077700001702095773012802112856007302240852000902313655001202322IND60587214920221120093500.0171215e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058721492DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.84902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Xiaofang10aEffect of applying cinnamaldehyde incorporated in wax on green mould decay in citrus fruits  ap. 527-533.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Green mould caused by Penicillium digitatum is the most damaging postharvest diseases of citrus fruit. Cinnamaldehyde (CA) is a food additive that has potential use in controlling postharvest disease of fruits and vegetables. In this study, the effectiveness of wax with CA (WCA) in controlling Ponkan (Citrus reticulata Blanco) green mould was investigated. RESULTS: The mycelial growth of P. digitatum was inhibited by CA in a dose‐dependent manner. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were both 0.50 mL L⁻¹. In vivo tests demonstrated that WCA (1 × and 10 × MFC) applied to Ponkan fruits inoculated with P. digitatum could significantly decrease the incidence of green mould for up to 5 days. The WCA treatment increased the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, polyphenol oxidase, as well as the total phenols and flavonoids contents. Meanwhile, the treatment remarkably decreased the weight loss rate of fruits and maintained fruit quality. These results indicated that WCA treatment might induce defence responses against green mould in citrus fruit. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that WCA might be a promising approach in controlling green mould of citrus fruits. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus reticulata 3aPenicillium digitatum 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3acitrus fruits 3adisease control 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3aflavonoids 3afood additives 3afruit quality 3afruits 3ain vivo studies 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amycelium 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apostharvest diseases 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avegetables 3aweight loss1 aOuYang, Qiuli1 aTao, Nengguo0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Jan., v. 98, no. 2 p.527-533dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.84903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010800171300001600279520173100295592002802026650001602054650001702070650002102087650001802108650002102126650001502147650001602162650001002178650001002188650001502198650001202213650001402225650001402239650001402253650003802267650000902305650002102314650002002335650001402355650002402369650002602393650002202419650001402441650001602455650001602471700002502487700002902512700002502541700002302566773009702589856008102686852000902767655001202776IND60579682420221118232548.0170829e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057968242DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-017-9703-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiri, Mrunmay Kumar10aRice MYC2 (OsMYC2) modulates light-dependent seedling phenotype, disease defence but not ABA signalling  ap. 501-508.  aArabidopsis MYC2 (AtMYC2) is a bHLH class transcription factor that mediates light-dependent seedling development, disease defence, JA and ABA signalling. AtMYC2 gene modulates hypocotyl elongation and expression of chlorophyll A/B binding protein 1 (CAB1) and rubisco small subunit protein1 (RBCS1) under blue light. The atmyc2 mutants are resistant against virulent bacterial pathogens. MYC2 orthologues from several crop plants have been characterized. The rice gene Os10g42430 has been referred earlier as OsMYC2 and has been shown to promote expression of JA-inducible genes. However, the role of OsMYC2 in seedling development under ABA, dark or light of specific wavelengths was not known. It was also not known whether OsMYC2 complements AtMYC2 function in Arabidopsis. We show here that expression of OsMYC2 in the atmyc2 mutant of Arabidopsis complements the blue-light-mediated defects in hypocotyl elongation and expression of CAB1 and RBCS1. We generated multiple transgenic rice lines for over-expression and RNAi-mediated suppression of OsMYC2. In agreement with AtMYC2 function, OsMYC2 over-expression and RNAi lines showed enhanced and suppressed seedling growth compared to WT plants respectively under blue light, and showed little effect under white light or dark. In agreement with the negative regulatory role of AtMYC2 in disease defence, the RNAi lines showed enhanced resistance against bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. However, in contrast to AtMYC2 function, OsMYC2 influences seedling development under red light and show no effect in ABA-mediated seed germination. Thus, the results suggest evolutionarily conserved as well as the distinct role of OsMYC2 in comparison with AtMYC2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aOryza sativa 3aRNA interference 3aabscisic acid 3abinding proteins 3ablue light 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3agenes 3ahypocotyls 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3ared light 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3arice 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic plants 3avirulence 3awavelengths 3awhite light1 aGautam, Janesh Kumar1 aBabu Rajendra Prasad, V.1 aChattopadhyay, Sudip1 aNandi, Ashis Kumar0 tJournal of biosciences.g2017 Sept., v. 42, no. 3 p.501-508dSpringer Indiax0250-59917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-017-9703-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245016100161300001800322520068400340592002801024650001501052650001101067650001901078650001801097650002001115650001401135650001501149650001301164650001601177650004401193700001601237700001801253700002501271700002301296700001801319773012101337856007401458852000901532655001201541IND60641449920221120175847.0190505e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064144992DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26439e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Ramesh C.10aSynthesis and application of a new class of D–π–A type charge transfer probe containing imidazole – naphthalene units for detection of F⁻ and CO₂  ap. 4941-4949.  aA new class of D–π–A type charge transfer probe, 3 and 4, containing imidazole – naphthalene moieties as donor and acceptor, respectively, has been synthesized via a Suzuki coupling reaction.

It is important to evaluate the long-term biochar CS potential by integrating the complex physical interferences and biochemical reactions in real soil. This study incorporated biochar into a biogeochemical field model and established a daily-resolution simulator to assess 5-, 50-, 500-year CS potential upon Soil-Biochar-Plant interaction. Through the scenario simulation of burying 7.5–75 t/ha BC-C in a 50 cm-depth rainfed cropland soil with corn planted, we found biochar could retain 483–557 kg C/t BC-C after 500 years' natural decomposition, although soil pedoturbation and plant erosion accelerated its mineralization. Moreover, biochar provided labile-C to compensate microbial decomposition and modified long-term soil climate, resulting in a decrease in soil organic carbon degradation of 44–265 kg C/t BC-C. Furthermore, biochar promoted plant photosynthetic performance by offering exogenous nutrients, equivalent to capturing 66–1039 kg C/t BC-C over 50 years. But biochar limited endogenous nutrient release and inhibited plant growth after exogenous nutrients exhausted, so total CS decreases yearly after reaching an upper limit (1030–1722 kg C/t BC-C). A total of 651–725 kg C/t BC-C could be sequestered after 500 years. And biochar is more potential in infertile and arid soils. Overall, this study indicates the necessity of taking the biogeochemical reactions into consideration to assess biochar long-term CS, and it further demonstrates biochar soil implementation is a prospective carbon-negative strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3abiodegradation 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3acorn 3acropland 3aenvironment 3amineralization 3amodels 3apedoturbation 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3asoil organic carbon 0aBiochar soil carbon sequestration 0aBiogeochemical field model 0aSoil climate 0aSoil organic carbon 0aPlant roots1 aZhao, Ling1 aXu, Xiaoyun1 aLi, Deping1 aQiu, Hao1 aCao, Xinde0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 May 20, v. 822 p.153576-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1535763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002000167245007800187300001800265500001500283520152500298592002801823650001601851650000901867650002101876650002601897650001601923650001401939650001001953650002801963650003101991650002402022650001702046650001002063650001902073650001402092650001602106650001802122650002002140650002502160650003802185650001502223650003702238650001702275650002002292650001102312650002902323650002102352650002202373653001602395653001602411700002102427773010502448856008202553852000902635655001202644IND60091470120221118032937.0141103e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009147012DNAL7 a211595012pmid7 a10.1016/j.bios.2010.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Joong Hyun10aNaked eye detection of mutagenic DNA photodimers using gold nanoparticles  ap. 2805-2809.  a2019-12-06  aWe developed a method to detect mutagenic DNA photodimers by the naked eye using gold nanoparticles. The stability of gold nanoparticles in a high ionic strength solution is maintained by straight ssDNA adsorbed physically on the AuNPs. However, we found that UV-irradiated DNA was less adsorptive onto gold nanoparticles because of a conformational change of UV-irradiated DNA. The accumulated deformation of the DNA structure by multiple-dimer formation triggered aggregation of the gold nanoparticles mixed with the UV-irradiated DNA and thus red to purple color changes of the mixture, which allowed colorimetric detection of the DNA photodimers by the naked eye. No fragmented mass and reactive oxygen species production under the UVB irradiation confirmed that the aggregation of gold nanoparticles was solely attributed to the accumulated deformation of the UV irradiated DNA. The degree of gold nanoparticles-aggregation was dependent on the UVB irradiated time and base compositions of the UV-irradiated oligonucleotides. In addition, we successfully demonstrated how to visually qualify the photosensitizing effect of chemical compounds in parallel within only 10min by applying this new method. Since our method does not require any chemical or biochemical treatments or special instruments for purifying and qualifying the DNA photolesions, it should provide a feasible tool for the studies of the UV-induced mutagenic or carcinogenic DNA dimers and accelerate screening of a large number of drug candidates.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3agold 3aoligonucleotides 3aultraviolet radiation 3acolorimetry 3aequipment 3adrugs 3areactive oxygen species 3aphotosensitivity disorders 3asingle-stranded DNA 3amutagenicity 3acolor 3aionic strength 3ascreening 3airradiation 3ananoparticles 3acarcinogenicity 2aColorimetryxmethods 2aDNAxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aDNA Damage 2aDNA Mutational Analysisxmethods 2aDimerization 2aGoldxchemistry 2aHumans 2aNanoparticlesxchemistry 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aVisual Perception 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aChung, Bong Hyun0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 26, no. 5 p.2805-2809dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2010.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013700155300001600292500002000308520127500328592002801603650001601631650001601647650001401663650001701677650000901694650000901703650001901712650001401731650000701745650003901752650001301791650002101804650002001825650002401845650002001869650001201889650002701901700001601928700001601944700001601960700001701976700001201993700001702005700001802022773012802040856007302168852000902241655001202250IND60587215220221120093604.0171215e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058721522DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.85282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Mangang10aRheology and microstructure of myofibrillar protein–olive oil composite gels: effect of different non‐meat protein as emulsifier  ap. 799-806.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Heat‐induced composite gels were prepared with 20 g kg⁻¹ (2%) myofibrillar protein (MP) sol and 100 g kg⁻¹ (10%) olive oil pre‐emulsified by MP or non‐meat protein in 0.6 mol L⁻¹ NaCl, at pH 6.2. The effect of different non‐meat protein (soy protein isolate, egg‐white protein isolate and sodium caseinate) pre‐emulsions on the rheological properties and microstructure of MP gel was evaluated. RESULTS: Adding emulsion enhanced the gel strength of MP gel except for the soy protein isolate (SPI) as emulsifier group, but all emulsion group markedly improved (P < 0.05) the water‐holding capacity and the storage modulus (G′) of MP gels. SDS‐PAGE show that some non‐meat protein bands partially participated in the formation of MP composite gels with different kinds of emulsion added. Micrographs revealed that these emulsions made the gels become denser and more compact with subtle diverse effects. CONCLUSION: Different meat or non‐meat proteins as emulsifier have varied impacts on the rheology and microstructure of MP gels, indicating the potential and feasibility of these non‐meat proteins as emulsifiers to modify the textural properties in comminuted meat products. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aegg albumen 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3agel strength 3agels 3ameat 3amicrostructure 3aolive oil 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arheology 3asodium caseinate 3asodium chloride 3asoy protein isolate 3astorage modulus 3atexture 3awater holding capacity1 aFei, Litian1 aZhuang, Tao1 aLei, Shumin1 aGe, Qingfeng1 aYu, Hai1 aWang, Jiahao1 aWang, Yaosong0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Jan., v. 98, no. 2 p.799-806dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.85283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245004700168300001600215520070800231592002800939650001500967650001500982650001100997650001201008650001901020650001401039650001501053650002001068650002601088700002101114773010801135856008101243852000901324655001201333IND60591507320221121003238.0180905e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059150732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2015.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Miguel P.10aMicrobiota Control of Malaria Transmission  ap. 120-130.  aStable mutualistic interactions between multicellular organisms and microbes are an evolutionarily conserved process with a major impact on host physiology and fitness.

In this area, one of the most important crops is hazelnut, in which the species can cause severe damage through feeding on nuts. Therefore, semi-field trials were carried out in NW Italy to compare the harmfulness of H. halys with that of the local hazelnut bug species, such as Gonocerus acuteangulatus, Nezara viridula, and Palomena prasina. Additionally, a 2-year field survey was conducted in hazel groves in NW Italy and W Georgia, another important hazelnut cropping area, to assess the presence and abundance of the new invasive species and to evaluate the damage at harvest. Monitoring was carried out by plant beating and by commercial traps throughout the growing season. In semi-field trials, H. halys was the most harmful species, causing the highest damage in kernels, and was able to survive and reproduce at higher rates. During field surveys in NW Italy, H. halys was sampled in groves late in the season in 2015 and, with higher populations, throughout the season in 2016. In W Georgia, bug population levels consistently increased in the 2-year period, resulting in a significant increase in damage at harvest in 2016. A similar trend is hence expected also in NW Italy in the following years. Moreover, data on individuals collected in different points of the hazelnut groves confirmed the border-driven behavior of this pest, leading to consideration of potential integrated pest management solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalyomorpha halys 3aNezara viridula 3aPalomena 3acrops 3agroves 3agrowing season 3ahazelnuts 3aintegrated pest management 3ainvasive species 3amonitoring 3aseeds 3asurveys 3atraps 3aItaly 3aRepublic of Georgia1 aMoraglio, SilviaT.1 aTavella, Luciana1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4733-72790 tJournal of pest science.g2018 Mar., v. 91, no. 2 p.661-670dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870064x1612-47587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-017-0937-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011500155300001400270520136200284592002801646650001801674650001101692650001901703650001901722650001301741650002201754650001901776650002301795700001501818700001901833700001501852700001801867700001801885773013701903856007402040852000902114655001202123IND60678897920221119230147.0191218e20191217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067889792DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta10568a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinze10aPositively charged Pt-based cocatalysts: an orientation for achieving efficient photocatalytic water splitting  ap. 17-26.  aConsiderable effort has been made to develop efficient water-splitting photocatalysts, which are generally composed of light-absorbing semiconductors and so-called cocatalysts that play a key role in accelerating the reaction kinetics of water splitting. Platinum (Pt)-based catalysts have been widely regarded as excellent cocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting, but the relationship between their valence state and reaction activity for photocatalytic water splitting had never been summarized. This review presents positively charged Pt nanoparticles, clusters and even single atoms that can boost the reaction activity dramatically, and summarises several strategies and techniques to tailor the positive valence states of Pt-based cocatalysts such as by using oxygen atoms. By tailoring the valence states of Pt-based cocatalysts, the capacities of these cocatalysts for water splitting can be significantly enhanced. Moreover, the operando analyses that can determine the real structures of this type of cocatalyst under working conditions are also discussed. These developments suggest that positively charged Pt-based cocatalysts could determine the direction and efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting, which may provide an ideal orientation to design state-of-the-art catalysts for achieving efficient photocatalytic water splitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aplatinum 3areaction kinetics 3asemiconductors 3aworking conditions1 aLi, Yuhang1 aZhou, Xiaodong1 aJiang, Hao1 aYang, Hua Gui1 aLi, Chunzhong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Dec. 17, v. 8, no. 1 p.17-26dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta10568a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012200152300001800274520118700292592002801479650001701507650001701524650002201541650001101563650001901574650001801593650001401611650002301625650001301648650001101661650002101672650001701693650002201710650001501732650001301747650001701760650001601777700001501793700002001808700001701828700001801845700001801863773012201881856007402003852000902077655001202086IND60641450220221118005856.0190505e20170120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064145022DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26454a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rui10aPrevention of active-site destruction during the synthesis of high performance non-Pt cathode catalyst for fuel cells  ap. 6622-6630.  aActive-site destruction during the synthesis of porous non-Pt catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is investigated in detail. Because of the carbon erosion caused by CO₂ generated from the decomposition of CaCO₃ template, active-sites are destroyed during the formation of the macroporous carbon-supported cobalt catalyst (Co/N-MPC) using Co-coordinated glucose–urea resin and a CaCO₃ template. Removal of the CaCO₃ template before its decomposition can effectively suppress this site destruction, thereby leading to a higher content of catalytic nitrogen species in the catalyst. Nitrogen-containing active-sites are unstable at temperatures over 800 °C. After optimizing the template removal and carbonization temperatures, the synthesized Co/N-MPC exhibits high catalytic activity towards ORR in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Its electron transfer number reaches 3.65 in alkaline and 3.75 in acidic electrolytes, respectively. The direct borohydride fuel cell with the synthesized Co/N-MPC shows a power density as high as 215 mW cm⁻², which is comparable to that of the cell using 28.6 wt% Pt/C as a cathode catalyst under ambient conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aborohydrides 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonization 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3afuel cells 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3atemperature1 aGe, Yu Jun1 aHe, Fan,d1978-1 aDou, Li Ting1 aLiu, Bin Hong1 aLi, Zhou Peng0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 20, v. 7, no. 11 p.6622-6630dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26454a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100005500185245016400240300001600404520148400420592002801904650002201932650001501954650002801969650001101997650001402008650001402022650001202036650001102048650001402059650002102073650002102094650001402115650001302129650001402142650001502156650001002171650001202181650000902193650001102202651001802213700002602231700002002257700002102277773012902298856008202427852000902509655001202518IND60590163820221121071839.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059016382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-017-0930-42doi7 a10.1007/s10340-017-0930-42chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazin, Maria1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6666-063214aThe mushroom sciarid fly, Lycoriella ingenua, benefits from its association with green mold disease (Trichoderma aggressivum) in commercial mushroom production  ap. 815-822.  aThe mushroom fly, Lycoriella ingenua Dufour (Diptera: Sciaridae), is a pest in white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) farming in North America. The main risk associated with sciarid flies inside mushroom farms is that the adult can potentially vector mushroom green mold disease caused by the pathogenic fungus Trichoderma aggressivum Samuels & W. Gams (Hypocreales). Flies are attracted to T. aggressivum-infected compost and, through subsequent movement, are suspected to spread the spores. The present study evaluated whether there is a fitness benefit for the sciarid flies from their association with T. aggressivum. Lycoriella ingenua was reared on three substrates: (1) spawned mushroom compost inoculated with the T. aggressivum, (2) spawned mushroom compost and (3) unspawned mushroom compost. Developmental time from larva to adult, adult longevity, adult fecundity and female body size were used as indicators of fly fitness. There was a fitness benefit for the sciarid fly when larvae develop on spawned mushroom compost parasitized by green mold, including higher adult emergence rate, faster development time from larva to adult and larger adult females. Fly fitness declined when the compost was fully colonized by A. bisporus mycelia and T. aggressivum was not present. This suggests that sciarid larvae benefit from the T. aggressivum parasitism on A. bisporus and the green mold. Benefits may include improved nutrition, defense suppression or pre-digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aLycoriella 3aTrichoderma aggressivum 3aadults 3abody size 3afecundity 3afemales 3alarvae 3alongevity 3amushroom compost 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3amycelium 3anutrition 3aparasitism 3apests 3arearing 3arisk 3aspores 3aNorth America1 aAndreadis, StefanosS.1 aJenkins, NinaE.1 aRajotte, EdwinG.0 tJournal of pest science.g2018 Mar., v. 91, no. 2 p.815-822dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870064x1612-47587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-017-0930-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01186naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006000158300001800218520027600236592002800512650002300540650002300563650004400586700001800630700001600648700001600664773013300680856007400813852000900887655001200896IND60660761720221119004347.0190827e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066076172DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07751b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Liangjie12aA single-scan method for NMR 2D J-resolved spectroscopy  ap. 1234-1236.  aA single-scan method is proposed to shorten the acquisition time for an NMR 2D J-resolved spectrum to 1 second.

The study used histological and stereological methods to determine gonad structure, changes in reproductive follicles during gametogenesis, oocyte development, glochidia structure, and brooding periods. Water in the channel of the “Dolna Odra” power plant did not freeze during the winter, and its mean annual temperature was 18.4°C. The population sex ratio was female biased (χ ² = 25.70, df = 1, P < 0.0001). Ovaries in mussels were formed by reproductive follicles. Previtellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes were attached to the follicle wall via the cytoplasmic stalk, and mature ovulated oocytes were present in the follicle lumen. Individuals with mature oocytes in gonads were present over the whole two-year study period, which indicates the continuous activity of gonads. Hooked glochidia had a larval thread. Females incubated the offspring in gill marsupia of outer demibranchs and were characterized by multiple tachytictic brooding periods. All gravid individuals presented mature and spent stages of gonadal development. The study provides the first direct information about the reproductive dynamics of this invasive species outside its original Asiatic range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnodonta woodiana 3afemales 3afreezing 3agametogenesis 3agonads 3ahistology 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3amussels 3aoocytes 3apower plants 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3atemperature 3awinter1 aDomagała, Józef,0 tHydrobiologia.g2018 Mar., v. 810, no. 1 p.57-76dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2835-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01778naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008600166300001400252520071700266592002800983650001801011650001501029650001801044650002201062650001801084650001401102650002501116653001401141653003001155700002601185700002101211773010601232856008101338852000901419655001201428IND60591507520221121035845.0180905e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059150752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2015.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrunz, Eric C.10aSoil-Transmitted Helminthiasis and Vitamin A Deficiency: Two Problems, One Policy  ap. 10-18.  aVitamin A deficiency (VAD) and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) represent two widely prevalent and often overlapping global health problems. Approximately 75% of countries with moderate or severe VAD are coendemic for STH. We reviewed the literature on the complex relationship between STH and VAD. Treatment for STH significantly increases provitamin A (e.g., β-carotene) levels but is associated with minimal increases in preformed vitamin A (retinol). Interpretation of the data is complicated by variations in STH infection intensity and limitations of vitamin A biomarkers. Despite these challenges, increased coordination of STH and VAD interventions represents an important public health opportunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-carotene 3abiomarkers 3ahelminthiasis 3aissues and policy 3apublic health 3avitamin A 3avitamin A deficiency 0avitamin A 0asoil-transmitted helminth1 aSuchdev, Parminder S.1 aAddiss, David G.0 tTrends in parasitology.g2016 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.10-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:6336x1471-49227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245018200167300001600349500002000365520142800385592002801813650001801841650002801859650001601887650001301903650000901916650002101925650001901946650001901965650002301984650002102007650001402028650003002042650001202072650001002084650001402094700002102108700002202129700002102151700003202172700002602204700003102230700002702261773012802288856007302416852000902489655001202498IND60587215420221120093521.0171215e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058721542DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.84942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCairo, Pedro Leon Gomes10aEffects of dietary supplementation of red pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi) essential oil on performance, small intestinal morphology and microbial counts of weanling pigs  ap. 541-548.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Many strategies, such as the antibiotic growth promoters, have been developed to improve intestinal health and performance of newly weaned piglets. Natural products such as essential oils have been scientifically recognized as growth enhancer feed additives for weanling pigs, replacing the antibiotics. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that Brazilian red pepper could replace performance‐enhancing antibiotics also in weanling pig diets. However, one experiment was conducted to determine the effects of dietary Brazilian red pepper essential oil or antimicrobial growth promoter on intestinal health and growth performance of weanling pigs. RESULTS: No effects of treatments were observed on performance and organ weights (P > 0.05). Overall, both additives [red pepper essential oil (RPEO) or antibiotic (ANT)] increased gut Lactobacillus counts compared to negative control, as well as reduced villi density (P < 0.05). Animals fed diets containing 1.5 g kg⁻¹ RPEO presented the lowest incidence of diarrhea (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that essential oil from Brazilian red pepper or chlorohydroxyquinoline added in weanling pig diets affect gut microbiota and histology without affecting performance and organ weights. In addition, there was an indication that high doses of essential oil could reduce the incidence of diarrhea. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aSchinus terebinthifolia 3aantibiotics 3adiarrhea 3adiet 3adigestive system 3aessential oils 3afeed additives 3agrowth performance 3agrowth promotion 3ahistology 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apiglets 3avilli 3aweanlings1 aGois, Franz Dias1 aSbardella, Maicon1 aSilveira, Hebert1 ade Oliveira, Roberto Maciel1 aAllaman, Ivan Bezerra1 aCantarelli, Vinicius Souza1 aCosta, Leandro Batista0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Jan., v. 98, no. 2 p.541-548dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.84943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01668naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245019200154300001800346520039100364592002800755650002000783650002300803650002300826650001300849650002100862650001400883650001800897650001700915650001400932650001300946650001100959700001400970700001300984700001600997700001501013700001401028773013301042856007401175852000901249655001201258IND60660761820221119004427.0190827e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066076182DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07753a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qin12al-Cysteine induced hemin/G-quadruplex concatemers electrocatalytic amplification with Pt–Pd supported on fullerene as a nanocarrier for sensing the spore wall protein of Nosema bombycis  ap. 1255-1258.  aThis work described a pseudobienzyme electrocatalytically amplified immunosensor for sensing the spore wall protein of Nosema bombycis by adopting l-cysteine as the electrocatalytic substance to generate H₂O₂in situ with the aid of hemin/G-quadruplex concatemers loaded onto C₆₀@Pt–Pd.

In an experimental study, we evaluated the timing of glochidia release by Unio crassus subjected to three spring water temperature regimes in the presence and absence of the host fish Cottus gobio. The timing of glochidia release was delayed at (i) constantly low temperatures (<10°C), in contrast to earlier and pronounced releases at (ii) natural temperature increases that level off at intermediate temperatures (10–15°C), and (iii) higher-than-normal temperatures (10–20°C). Mussels from treatment (i) that had not released glochidia during the experiment did so soon after being moved to the temperature in (ii), indicating a temperature threshold for glochidia release. Neither host fish presence nor the combined effect of temperature and host fish presence significantly affected the timing of glochidia release. The treatment with natural spring water temperatures indicated possible fitness benefits for U. crassus through combined effects of high intensities of glochidia releases and high survival of released glochidia. The furthered understanding of climate change effects on mussel and host phenology in seasonal environments, potentially inducing temporal mismatches of glochidia release to host availability, is key to mussel conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCottus gobio 3aUnio 3aclimate change 3afish 3afreshwater mussels 3aparasites 3aphenology 3areproduction 3awater temperature1 aNilsson, P.Anders1 aÖsterling, E.Martin0 tHydrobiologia.g2018 Mar., v. 810, no. 1 p.283-293dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3217-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009400168500001900262520166800281592002801949650001501977650001301992650002802005650002002033650002802053650002402081650001502105650002102120650001402141650002002155650000702175650001502182650002402197650001302221650002802234650002102262650001602283650002102299650001802320651001202338653002102350653002202371653002902393653001602422653001602438653002702454700002002481700002302501773011602524856008402640852000902724655001202733IND60717111320221120023726.0210506e20210228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071711132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1066252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Bilali, Ali10aGroundwater quality forecasting using machine learning algorithms for irrigation purposes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUsing conventional methods to evaluate the irrigation water quality is usually expensive and laborious for the farmers, particularly in developing countries. However, the applications of artificial intelligence models can overcome this issue through forecasting and evaluating the irrigation water quality indexes of aquifer systems using physical parameters as features. This paper aims forecasting the Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), Potential Salinity (PS), Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP), Magnesium Adsorption Ratio (MAR), and the Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) parameters through Electrical Conductivity (EC), Temperature (T), and pH as inputs. To achieve this purpose, we developed and evaluated Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models using 520 samples of data related to fourteen Groundwater quality parameters in Berrechid aquifer, Morocco. The results revealed that the overall prediction performances of Adaboost and RF models are higher than those of SVR and ANN. However, the generalization ability and sensitivity to the inputs analyses show that the ANN and SVR models are more generalizable and less sensitive to input variables than Adaboost and RF. Globally, the developed models are valuable in forecasting the irrigation water quality parameters and could help the farmers and decision-makers in managing the irrigation water strategies. The developed approaches in this study have been revealed promising in low-cost and real-time forecast of groundwater quality through the use of physical parameters as input variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaquifers 3aartificial intelligence 3adecision making 3aelectrical conductivity 3aexchangeable sodium 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3amagnesium 3aneural networks 3apH 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asalinity 3asodium adsorption ratio 3asodium carbonate 3atemperature 3awater management 3awater quality 3aMorocco 0aMachine learning 0aBerrechid aquifer 0aIrrigation water quality 0aSensitivity 0aUncertainty 0aPrediction performance1 aTaleb, Abdeslam1 aBrouziyne, Youssef0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Feb. 28, v. 245 p.106625-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1066253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100003100188245010400219300001800323520048500341592002800826650001600854650001200870650001600882650002800898650000900926650002400935650001700959650002300976650002000999650001801019700002501037700002201062700002101084700002201105700002301127700005901150773009501209856008201304852000901386655001201395IND60530805020221118044211.0210124e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053080502DNAL7 a271586562pmid7 aPMC48451532pmcid7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKenney-Drake, Mikaela L.10aRepeat cross-sectional data on the progression of the metabolic syndrome in Ossabaw miniature swine  ap. 1393-1395.  aOssabaw miniature swine were fed an excess calorie, atherogenic diet for 6, 9, or 12 months.

The aim of this study was to assess the extent of differences between the knowledge and attitudes of veterinary students and medical students on animal bioethics, on alternative strategies and on their right to conscientiously object to animal experimentation. To this end, a questionnaire was completed by 733 students (384 human medicine students (HMS) and 349 veterinary medicine students (VMS)). VMS were more aware than HMS (72.2% and 59.6%, respectively) of the existence of an Italian law on the right to conscientiously object to animal experimentation. However, very few of them had exercised this right. Many VMS (43.3%) felt that animal bioethics courses should be mandatory (only 17.4% of HMS felt the same way). More VMS than HMS (81.7% and 59.1%, respectively) expressed an interest in attending a course on alternatives to animal experimentation. The data suggest the need for appropriate educational interventions, in order to allow students to make choices based on ethical principles. Fostering close collaborations between departments of human medicine and veterinary medicine, for example, through shared study modules, could promote the development of ethical competence as a basic skill of students of both veterinary and human medicine courses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal experimentation 3abioethics 3alaboratories 3amedicine 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3aveterinary medicine1 aBiolatti, Bartolomeo1 aSanti, Pierluigi1 aMurialdo, Giovanni1 aBassi, Anna Maria1 aSantori, Gregorio1 aCiliberti, Rosagemma0 tATLA.

Increasingly, it is seen as having considerable potential as an adsorbent material, which could be used for environmental remediation (such as the treatment/remediation of arsenic, chromium, antimony, fluoride, and organic contaminants). This study reviews current developments, mainly in the preparation, structure, and water treatment of Schwertmannite. Several key issues are discussed in detail, such as synthetic strategy, the structure–property relationships, potential environmental applications, and related mechanisms. Soil remediation by schwertmannite is compared to water treatment, and its application is further evaluated. Finally, the methodologies for water treatment and soil remediation using schwertmannite are also taken into consideration from an environmental point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3achromium 3afluorides 3asoil remediation 3awater treatment1 aBi, Xue1 aLi, Xintong1 aZhao, Qiancheng1 aChen, Honghan0 tRSC advances.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 8, no. 59 p.33583-33599dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06025h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245010500207300001600312520130300328592002801631650002601659650002301685650002401708650002301732650002501755650002301780650001501803650001401818653005301832653001201885653003201897653003501929700001901964700001401983773010201997856008702099852000902186655001202195IND60603737120221122043831.0190620e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060373712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoerema, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5094-733X10aCost-Effectiveness Analysis of Ecosystem Management With Ecosystem Services: From Theory to Practice  ap. 207-218.  aIntegrated ecosystem management is challenging due to many, often conflicting, targets and limited resources to allocate. A valuable and straightforward approach is to integrate an ecosystem services assessment in a cost-effectiveness analysis as method to evaluate and compare the cost-effectiveness of several management scenarios to reach one or more objectives and take into account the potential effects on other ecosystem functions and services. Nevertheless, this method is not commonly used in ecosystem management evaluation but can provide an alternative for the frequently used but often contested cost-benefit analysis (which requires the step of assigning a monetary value to each benefit). The aim of this study is to apply the cost-effectiveness analysis in combination with an ecosystem services assessment on a real case-study (comparing alternative management strategies for estuaries) to derive lessons learned to go from theory to practice. The application of this method for the case-study reveals many remaining challenges such as data availability and knowledge to assess ecosystem effects of management measures. Nevertheless, the analysis demonstrates that this method can be used for making a more integrated evaluation and supporting better-informed management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost benefit analysis 3acost effectiveness 3aecological function 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 0aAverage and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 0aEstuary 0aMultiple management targets 0aIntegrated management decision1 aVan Passel, S.1 aMeire, P.0 tEcological economics.g2018 Oct., v. 152 p.207-218dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245009500194300001800289500001100307520122600318592002801544596009701572596005201669596008901721596006901810650001401879650001901893650001601912650002001928650002001948650000901968650001801977650002601995650001302021700002502034700001802059700001702077700002102094700005402115773012202169856007402291852000902365655001202374IND60775912020221119204435.0220502e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077591202DNAL7 a10.1111/are.158282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jintao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4681-858310aNonintrusive and automatic quantitative analysis methods for fish behaviour in aquaculture  ap. 2985-3000.  aREVIEW  aIn aquaculture, accurate and automatic quantification of fish behaviour can provide useful data input for production management and decision‐making. In recent years, with the focus on fish welfare, it has become urgent to study and use nondestructive quantitative methods of fish behaviour in aquaculture. In this paper, based on the literature of the past 30 years, nonintrusive and automatic quantitative methods for fish behaviour are analysed. Firstly, several important fish behaviours in aquaculture are listed, and the quantification of fish behaviour is summarized in four stages: detection, tracking, feature extraction and behaviour recognition. Then, nonintrusive methods of fish behaviour quantification, through machine vision, acoustics and sensors, and their advantages and disadvantages are also compared and discussed in detail. It is concluded that the combination of multiple methods and deep learning is a key technology for fish behaviour quantification, which has gradually become a popular focus of research and application in recent years. This review can be used as a reference to improve fish behaviour quantification in future, so as to create a more effective and economic technical method.  aPublisher supplied data  aQNJJ202014cThe Youth Research Fund of Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences  a6212007cThe Beijing Natural Science Foundation  a2021B0202070001cThe Key Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province  a2020YFD0900105cThe National Key Technology R&D Program of China 3aacoustics 3aanimal welfare 3aaquaculture 3acomputer vision 3adecision making 3afish 3afish behavior 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearch1 aBienvenido, Fernando1 aYang, Xinting1 aZhao, Zhenxi1 aFeng, Shuangxing1 aZhou, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6528-32570 tAquaculture research.g2022 June, v. 53, no. 8 p.2985-3000dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.158283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245004600170300001600216520098100232592002801213650001001241650001101251650003001262650001501292650002401307650001501331650002801346650001501374653004101389653001401430653000801444653001501452653001801467700002301485700003101508773009101539856008501630852000901715655001201724IND60551303320221119151107.0161018e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055130332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaly, Kristian10aLow calorie sweeteners and gut microbiota  ap. 494-500.  aStudies dating back to 1980s, using bacterial cultures, have reported associations between low calorie sweeteners (LCS) and alterations in bacterial composition, raising the potential that LCS might exert effects on the host via interactions with gut microbiota. However, the results of a few recent studies carried out in this area have produced controversies. There is evidence that human fecal samples, used in most human microbiome studies, may provide a poor representation of microbial contents of the proximal intestine. Furthermore, fecal short chain fatty acid levels do not exemplify the amount of short chain fatty acids produced in the intestine. Short chain fatty acids are largely absorbed in the intestine by a tightly regulated mechanism. Here we present an exemplar study showing that the determination of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the precise mode of action of a LCS on gut microbiota allows for rational and scientifically-based recommendations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afeces 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amechanism of action 3amicrobiome 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asweeteners 0aNeohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC) 0aIntestine 0aPig 0aMicrobiota 0aLactobacillus1 aDarby, Alistair C.1 aShirazi-Beechey, Soraya P.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 164 p.494-500dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006600160300002000226520054400246592002800790650001700818650002100835650002100856650001900877650001800896650001900914650001400933700001700947700001900964700001500983700001900998773012501017856007401142852000901216655001201225IND60617173920221116191118.0181024e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061717392DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra06034g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Wen-Qiang10aNovel oligopeptide nanoprobe for targeted cancer cell imaging  ap. 30887-30893.  aHere we designed and constructed a tryptophan-phenylalanine-phenylalanine-tryptophan (WFFW) tetrapeptide, which generated photostable and tunable fluorescence emission signals from 340 nm to 500 nm.

For injection test interpretation, shape factors are required to account for injection screen geometry. Shape factors act as proportionality constants between hydraulic conductivity and observed ratios of injection flow rate and injection head at steady-state. Existing results for such shape factors assume either an ideal screen (i.e., ignoring effects of screen slot geometry) or infinite screen length (i.e., ignoring effects of screen extremes). In the present work, we investigate the combined effects of circumferential screen slot geometry and finite screen length on injection shape factors. This is done in terms of a screen entrance resistance by solving a steady-state potential flow mixed type boundary value problem in a homogeneous axi-symmetric flow domain using a semi-analytical solution approach. Results are compared to existing analytical solutions for circumferential and longitudinal slots on infinite screens, which are found to be identical. Based on an existing approximation, an expression is developed for a dimensionless screen entrance resistance of infinite screens, which is a function of the relative slot area only. For anisotropic conditions, e.g., when conductivity is smaller in the vertical direction than in the horizontal, screen entrance losses for circumferential slots increase, while they remain unaffected for longitudinal slots. This work is not concerned with investigating the effects of (possibly turbulent) head losses inside the injection device including the passage through the injection slots prior to entering the porous aquifer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3ageometry 3ahydraulic conductivity 0aAquifer 0aHydraulic conductivity 0aNon-ideal screen 0aShape factor 0aMixed type boundary value problem1 aNemer, Bassel1 aHatfield, Kirk0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Apr. 16, v. 511 p.190-198dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009600174300001600270500001900286520141200305592002801717650002001745650002001765650001901785650001901804650001301823650003001836650002101866650001101887650001301898650001501911651001001926700003801936700003201974700002702006700002002033700002902053700002302082773013402105856008202239852000902321655001202330IND60722884920221119221345.0210108e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072288492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-019-01069-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKakpo, Sunday Berlioz10aSpatial distribution and impacts of climate change on Milicia excelsa in Benin, West Africa  ap. 143-150.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAfrican teak (Milicia excelsa (Welw.) C.C. Berg) is an endangered multi-use species. Understanding the impact of climate change on the distribution of this species may improve the ability to anticipate or recognize its decline or expansion and to take appropriate conservation measures if necessary. Ecological niche modeling was projected in geographical space to study the current and future distribution of M. excelsa in Bénin. MaxEnt was used to estimate the potential geographic distribution of the species under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). Miroc 5 summaries and two RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios were used as predictor variables for projections of the geographic potential of this species. The performance of the model was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), true skill statistics (TSS) and partial receiver operating characteristics (Partial ROC). From the results, M. excelsa was more a secondary species in the Guinean climatic zone and part of the Sudanian-Guinean and Sudanian climatic zone. The projections show a significant decrease in suitable habitats for the species from the two RCP scenarios. Only a part of the Guinean climatic zone remained suitable and few protected areas will conserve in situ M. excelsa. For the sustainable conservation of M. excelsa, it is essential to strengthen the protection of sacred forests located in the Guinean climatic zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMilicia excelsa 3aTectona grandis 3aclimate change 3aclimatic zones 3aforestry 3ageographical distribution 3amodel validation 3aniches 3aresearch 3astatistics 3aBenin1 aAoudji, Augustin Kossi Nounangnon1 aGnanguènon-Guéssè, Denis1 aGbètoho, Alain Jaures1 aKoura, Kourouma1 aDjotan, Géoffroy Kévin1 aGanglo, Jean Cossi0 tJournal of forestry research.g2021 Feb., v. 32, no. 1 p.143-150dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-01069-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245018100206300001800387500002000405520131900425592002801744596007101772596006901843650002501912650002701937650001801964650001801982650002902000650002502029650002402054650001602078650001602094650001302110650001602123650001602139650001002155650001502165650001302180650002102193650002002214650001602234650001302250650002502263700006802288773012202356856007402478852000902552655001202561IND60775912220221119204404.0220502e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077591222DNAL7 a10.1111/are.158142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngulo Valdés, Carlos,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7965-167910aDietary Mexican Chenopodium ambrosioides L. improved cholesterol level, bactericidal activity, humoral and antioxidant defence parameters in Pacific red snapper (Lutjanus peru)  ap. 3025-3035.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary incorporation of a medicinal plant (Mexican Chenopodium ambrosioides L.) on growth parameters, cholesterol level, immune and antioxidant parameters in serum and antioxidant enzyme gene expressions in intestine of Pacific red snapper before and upon Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. Fish were fed diets supplemented with 0.5%, 1% and 2% C. ambrosioides L. for five weeks. Samples were taken at weeks 2 and 4, and upon bacterial challenge (week 5). Dietary incorporation with 1% medicinal plant promoted fish growth. Serum cholesterol was reduced in fish fed 1% and 2% C. ambrosioides L. whereas in the group fed 0.5% plant incorporated diet bactericidal activity was the highest against A. hydrophila. Immune (antiprotease, protease, lysozyme and myeloperoxidase activities) and antioxidant (superoxide dismutase and catalase) parameters were enhanced in serum and antioxidant enzyme gene expressions (icCu/Znsod, ecCu/Znsod, Mnsod and cat) up‐regulated in intestine. In conclusion, dietary incorporation of C. ambrosioides can modulate the inmmunostimulant and antioxidant activities in Pacific red snapper. This research provides a new perspective for using C. ambrosioides L. as an option to possibly reduce the usage of antibiotics in farmed fish.  aPublisher supplied data  aINFR‐2014‐01/225924cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  aPDCPN2014‐01/248033cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aDysphania ambrosioides 3aLutjanus peru 3aanimal growth 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aaquaculture 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3afarmed fish 3agenes 3aintestines 3alysozyme 3amedicinal plants 3amyeloperoxidase 3aproteinases 3aresearch 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aReyes‐Becerril, Martha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1149-577X0 tAquaculture research.g2022 June, v. 53, no. 8 p.3025-3035dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.158143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013900166300001600305520109900321592002801420650002501448650001301473650001901486650001301505650001101518650001801529650003801547650003401585650002601619650001801645650001201663653002501675653003101700653003801731653003201769700001901801700001701820700001901837700001901856700001701875773011601892856008602008852000902094655001202103IND60602674920221119165222.0180711e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060267492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Kun10aDevelopment and evaluation of an immunochromatographic strip for rapid detection of capsid protein antigen p27 of avian leukosis virus  ap. 115-118.  aA rapid immunochromatographic strip for detecting capsid protein antigen p27 of avian leukosis virus was successfully developed based on two high-affinity monoclonal antibodies. The test strip could detect not only 600pg purified recombinant p27 protein but also quantified avian leukosis virus as low as 70 TCID50, which has comparative sensitivity to the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. For the evaluation of this test strip, 1100 samples consisting of cloacal swabs, meconium collected from the earliest stool of one day old chicken and virus isolates were assessed both by the strip and by the commercial ELISA kit. The agreement between these two tests was 93.91%, 93.42% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the strip were also calculated by using the ELISA kit as the standard. This immunochromatographic strip provides advantages of rapid and simple detection of capsid protein antigen p27 of avian leukosis virus, which could be applied as an on-site testing assay and used for control and eradication programs of avian leukosis disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian leukosis virus 3aantigens 3aavian leukosis 3achickens 3acloaca 3acoat proteins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3amonoclonal antibodies 3arapid methods 3aviruses 0aAvian leukosis virus 0aCapsid protein antigen p27 0aEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0aImmunochromatographic strip1 aLiang, You-zhi1 aYin, Li-ping1 aShao, Hong-xia1 aYe, Jian-qiang1 aQin, Ai-jian0 tJournal of virological methods.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 221 p.115-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.04.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245007300207506010400280506007600384506011700460520187200577592002802449506003702477650002202514650003002536650001102566650002202577650001302599650000902612650002002621650002302641650002402664650001702688650001102705651001002716653003002726653002102756653002702777653001402804653002002818653001802838700006002856700001202916773009302928856008603021852000903107655001203116IND60783560020221207075336.0220914e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078356002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e099932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKala, Kaveri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9371-011010aAnalysis of informal waste management using system dynamic modelling  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aThe informal sector is the backbone for sustainable waste management in a high population density country such as India. Moreover, the operations of the value chain of informal waste management provide direct or indirect benefits for the environment and human resource development. Unfortunately this sector has always been regarded as a fraudulent activity that sustains without paying taxes, creates unjust competition, and weakens unions and the regulatory structure of the government. These perceptions often lead India to pursue a policy that intentionally or inadvertently amounts to retributive measures. However, the alarming increase in the rate of waste generation has coerced the governments of several countries to incorporate the indispensable informal sector in their policy initiatives. Accordingly, this paper presents a pioneering system dynamics based model (using STELLA Architect software) to analyse the impact of the recent policies and decision strategies on the effectiveness of the informal waste management sector. The paper explores the case of Delhi, India to illustrate the model and provides valuable insights into the urban waste management process. The results of the model demonstrate that significant economic and environmental benefits can be realized by leveraging the natural strengths of the informal sector. Further, it is shown that efficient implementation of policies related to informal waste management can reduce the recyclable waste in the landfills dumped by municipal corporations or otherwise to zero. Also, waste recycling capacity can be increased from 39 percent to 100 percent by strengthening IRC (informal recycling coefficient, introduced in this paper) in a span of 30 years. This increase will have positive impact on land usage, environment degradation and operation cost used in the formal waste collection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental degradation 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alead 3aoperating costs 3apopulation density 3aresource management 3asupply chain 3awastes 3aIndia 0aInformal Waste Management 0aCircular Economy 0aSolid Waste Management 0aRecycling 0aSystem Dynamics 0aPublic Policy1 aBolia, Nomesh B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2465-81871 aSushil,0 tHeliyon.g2022 Aug., v. 8, no. 8 p.e09993-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e099933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013600170300001400306520128700320592002801607650001901635650002001654650001101674650002001685650001501705650001501720650002901735650004401764650000901808653002001817653001501837653002601852653001501878653001001893653001801903700001701921700002201938700001801960700002201978700001802000700002302018773009602041856008502137852000902222655001202231IND60554506320221119102125.0161024e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055450632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Guoqiang10aSensitive and simultaneous quantification of zinc pyrithione and climbazole deposition from anti-dandruff shampoos onto human scalp  ap. 22-26.  aA sensitive ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of zinc pyrithione (ZPT) and climbazole (CBZ) deposited onto human scalp from anti-dandruff (AD) shampoos. Scrubbing with a buffer solution was used as the sampling method for the extraction of ZPT and CBZ from scalp. Derivatization of ZPT was carried out prior to UHPLC–MS/MS analysis. The identification of ZPT and CBZ was performed by examining ratios of selected multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions in combination with UHPLC retention times. The limit of detection for ZPT and CBZ was established to be 1 and 2ng/mL, respectively. This sensitivity enables the quantification of ZPT and CBZ at deposition levels in the low ng/cm2 range. The method was successfully applied for the analysis of scalp buffer scrub samples from an in vivo study. The levels of ZPT and CBZ deposited on the scalp at different time points after application of the AD shampoo were measured. The results revealed that dual-active AD shampoo delivered more ZPT onto the scalp in a single wash than single active shampoo did. The amount of ZPT and CBZ retained on the scalp after AD shampoo application declined over 72h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3amonitoring 3ashrublands 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3azinc 0aZinc pyrithione 0aClimbazole 0aAnti-dandruff shampoo 0aDeposition 0aScalp 0aUHPLC–MS/MS1 aXie, Feifei,1 aHoptroff, Michael1 aFei, Xiaoqing1 aCollins, Luisa Z.1 aJones, Andrew1 aJanssen, Hans-Gerd0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 1003 p.22-26dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03973naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245014600202300001600348520222400364592002802588650001402616650001602630650001102646650001502657650001102672650001202683650001102695650001302706650001702719650002202736650002202758650002602780650002002806650003002826650001902856650001602875653002602891653003402917653002302951653002102974653001702995700002003012700006203032700006103094700006103155773014803216856008203364852000903446655001203455IND60591241920221122070152.0180904e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059124192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2018.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiva, Fabio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0465-408X10aElectricity access and rural development: Review of complex socio-economic dynamics and causal diagrams for more appropriate energy modelling  ap. 203-223.  aThe causal relationships between electrification and development of poor, rural communities are complex and contextual. The existing literature focuses mainly on the impact of rural electrification and electricity use on local socio-economic development, while the reverse feedbacks of various social and economic changes on electricity demand and supply have not been fully characterized. Most electricity access impact assessments assume linear, one-way effects and linear growth in electricity demand. However, the projections rarely match the reality, creating challenges for rural utilities. From a modelling perspective, the lack of attention to dynamic complexities of the electricity-development nexus prevents the appropriate modelling of electricity demand over time and, hence, informed planning for and sizing of power plants. With the goal to improve modelling of the electricity-development nexus, we undertake a comprehensive review and extensive analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on electricity access and its impact on rural socio-economic development, and vice versa. We characterize and describe the nexus between electricity access and development through graphical causal diagrams that allow us to capture, visualise and discuss the complexity and feedback loops. Based on this, we suggest guidelines for developing appropriate models able to include and simulate such complexities.Our analysis confirms that electricity use is interconnected through complex causal relations with multiple dimensions of socio-economic development, viz. income generating activities, market production and revenues, household economy, local health and population, education, and habits and social networks. The causal diagrams can be seen as a first step of the conceptualization phase of model building, which aims at describing and understanding the structure of a system. The presence of multiple uncertain parameters and complex diffusion mechanisms that describe the complex system under analysis suggests that systems-dynamic simulations can allow modelling such complex and dynamic relations, as well as dealing with the high uncertainties at stake, especially when coupled with stochastic approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aguidelines 3aincome 3amarkets 3amodels 3aplanning 3apower plants 3arural communities 3arural development 3arural electrification 3asocial networks 3asocioeconomic development 3asocioeconomics 3auncertainty 0aRural electrification 0aElectricity-development nexus 0aCausality diagrams 0aEnergy modelling 0aComplexities1 aAhlborg, Helene1 aHartvigsson, Elias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5255-98671 aPachauri, Shonali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8138-31781 aColombo, Emanuela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9747-56990 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2018 Apr., v. 43 p.203-223dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2018.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014400169300001600313520192800329592002802257650001102285650001102296650001102307650001102318650001502329650002102344650001502365650001102380650001102391650001502402650001102417650001502428651001102443653002602454653002102480653001002501653002202511653002302533653003802556700002402594700002002618700002102638700002102659700002002680700002402700700002202724773010802746856008602854852000902940655001202949IND60539682920221120133125.0190318e20140804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053968292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuza, Jessica10aPrecipitation, soil moisture and runoff variability in a small river catchment (Ardèche, France) during HyMeX Special Observation Period 1  ap. 330-342.  aFlash flooding is a potentially destructive natural hazard known to occur in the Cévennes-Vivarais region in southern France. HyMeX (Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment) is an international program focused on understanding the hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean basin. Soil moisture is known to be a useful indicator of catchment response, however, establishing a meaningful estimation of soil moisture at the catchment level can be difficult due to its high variability in space and time.In a small gauged catchment in the Cévennes-Vivarais region in southern France, a series of manual soil moisture measurements was taken from September to December 2012 at both the field and catchment scale during the Special Observation Period 1 (SOP1) as part of the HyMeX program. Six plots were selected along a trajectory of a microwave link installed in the catchment and were chosen to represent different elevations in the catchment. Within each field plot, surface soil moisture was measured along a 50m transect at 2m intervals. This allowed the study of changes in within-field variability as well as between-field variability in response to precipitation events and during the drying out phase.Several precipitation events occurred over this autumn 2012 period which caused a significant wetting-up of the catchment, allowing the study of soil moisture processes over a wide range of wetness conditions. The influence of antecedent catchment conditions (soil moisture) on rainfall–runoff dynamics is demonstrated through the comparison of storm hydrographs for the various events. Dry catchment conditions result in minimal response in event flow, whereas large precipitation events occurring during wetter conditions produce much stronger responses in event flow. This further confirms the importance of quantifying catchment initial conditions to enhance the prediction of flash flood occurrences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abasins 3adrying 3afloods 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic cycle 3aprediction 3arivers 3arunoff 3asoil water 3astorms 3awatersheds 3aFrance 0aInitial soil moisture 0aSmall catchments 0aHyMeX 0aRunoff generation 0aTemporal stability 0aSoil moisture spatial variability1 aTeuling, Adriaan J.1 aBraud, Isabelle1 aGrazioli, Jacopo1 aMelsen, Lieke A.1 aNord, Guillaume1 aRaupach, Timothy H.1 aUijlenhoet, Remko0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Aug. 04, v. 516 p.330-342dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03867naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012500154300002000279520120200299583146401501592002802965650001402993650001503007650001903022650001003041650001503051650001103066650001903077650001003096650001903106650001303125650002403138700001703162700001303179700001503192700001603207700001503223773012403238856007403362852000903436655001203445IND60617174120221116191107.0181024e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061717412DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra06041j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pei10aRETRACTION: FOXC1 silencing promotes A549 cell apoptosis through inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/hedgehog/Gli2 signaling pathway  ap. 33786-33793.  aLung cancer begins in the lung and is a leading cause of premature death. Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) has been reported to play an important role in different types of cancer, and evidence suggests that FOXC1 is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the function and molecular mechanism of FOXC1 in the NSCLC cell line A549 is still unclear. In the present study, we indicate that FOXC1 is expressed in the NSCLC cell lines A549, H460, and SK-MES-1 at a high level compared with control human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. FOXC1 silencing promotes A549 cell apoptosis, whereas it inhibits cell survival. The levels of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 decreased and the expression of pro-apoptosis protein Bax increased in FOXC1 silenced cells. Further studies show that FOXC1 knockdown inhibits the PI3K/AKT/hedgehog/Gli2 pathway. Overexpressed AKT or Gli2 reversed the effects of FOXC1 silencing on A549 cell survival and apoptosis. Taken together, our results conclude that FOXC1 silencing reduced the survival of cancer cells and promoted their apoptosis, and that the PI3K/AKT/hedgehog/Gli2 pathway plays an important role in the functioning of FOXC1 silencing.  aRetracted: Jan. 22, 2021, v.11(8), p.4572, 10.1039/d1ra90016azRetraction of ‘FOXC1 silencing promotes A549 cell apoptosis through inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/hedgehog/Gli2 signaling pathway’ by Pei Wang et al., RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 33786–33793, DOI: 10.1039/C8RA06041J. The Royal Society of Chemistry hereby wholly retracts this RSC Advances article due to concerns with the reliability of the data. The images in the article, and the raw data provided by the authors, were screened by an image integrity expert. In Fig. 1 and 2, there is no apparent background to the western blots. In the raw data provided by the authors, some background is displayed, but it is not clear whether this is genuine. For the FOXC1 panel in Fig. 1 and the β-actin panel in Fig. 2, the area immediately around the bands in the raw data has a different appearance to the rest of the raw data, indicating that the row of bands may have been placed on a false background. Analysis of the western blots in Fig. 4 shows that all 4 panels have the same background, indicating that these images have been manipulated.

They have advantages such as low toxicity, biodegradability and low-cost relative to the synthetic ones. Telfairia occidentalis is a creeping plant that is cultivated for food in some African countries. The leaves, stem and root of the plant have been investigated as potential sources of medicine. This study aimed at evaluating the fruit pulp as a potential suspending agent. The ripe fruits of the plant were harvested and authenticated at the Department of Herbal Medicine, KNUST. The fruit pulp was extracted, freeze-dried and evaluated for its anti-microbial, phytochemical, physicochemical and anti-oxidant properties. Different concentrations of the dried pulp were used as a suspending agent in calamine lotion formulations, using bentonite as reference. The extract contained alkaloids, tannins, saponins, coumarins, glycosides, terpenoids magnesium and potassium. No antimicrobial and antioxidant activities were detected. The extract at all tested concentrations produced some level of suspendability. The test suspensions have good flow rates, high sedimentation volumes, high degree of flocculation, and relative ease of re-dispersion. However, these parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) lower (except flow rate) compared to those of bentonite as a suspending agent.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTelfairia occidentalis 3aantioxidants 3abentonite 3abiodegradability 3acoumarins 3aflocculation 3afreeze drying 3afruit pulp 3aherbal medicines 3amagnesium 3amedicine 3aphytochemicals 3apotassium 3aroots 3asaponins 3asmithsonite 3aterpenoids 3atoxicity 0aNatural products 0aTelfairia occidentalis 0aExcipients 0aSuspensions1 aNoble, Kuntworbe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4203-217X1 aMichael, Sekyere1 aRaphael, Johnson1 aWilliam Akuffo, Owusu Frederick1 aPhilomena, Entsie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4858-83391 aFrancis, Amankwah1 aKwabena, Ofori-Kwakye0 tHeliyon.g2022 July, v. 8, no. 7 p.e09997-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e099973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008600170300001600256520144400272592002801716650002501744650002301769650001501792650001201807650001501819650001301834650001701847650001701864650001801881650001601899650001501915651001001930653003001940653001501970653002401985653003302009700001502042700001702057700001502074700001802089773010202107856008702209852000902296655001202305IND60603737720221122043753.0190620e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060373772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Mingyue10aMapping Watershed-Level Ecosystem Service Bundles in the Pearl River Delta, China  ap. 106-117.  aManaging multiple ecosystem services (ES) is a pressing field in sustainability research. ES bundles (ESBs), which closely link ES trade-offs and synergies, provide a comprehensive approach to exploring the relationship between natural ecosystems and human well-being. In this study, we quantified eight ES in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural services using geographical data and other available information (both ecological and social) in the Pearl River Delta, China. We identified ESBs based on K-means clustering and redundancy analysis. The results showed that spatial patterns of each ES were quite heterogeneous at watershed level. Provisioning services were mainly distributed in watersheds with high proportion of cultivated land and waterbody. Remote forest areas provided high regulating services. Moreover, densely populated urban areas provide high cultural services. Five ESBs were detected ranging from 2941 to 16,249 km2. According to the Pearson correlations and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), we detected the trade-offs between provisioning and cultural services, and between regulating and cultural services, and synergies happened within regulating services. Intensive land-use and management in urban areas contributed to ES trade-offs. These results provide deeper understanding of the relationship between ES and land-use type at watershed level and detailed guidelines for ecosystem management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aguidelines 3aland use 3ariver deltas 3aspatial data 3asurface water 3aurban areas 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aEcosystem service bundles 0aTrade-offs 0aLand use management 0athe Pearl River Delta, China1 aPeng, Jian1 aLiu, Yuanxin1 aLi, Tianyi1 aWang, Yanglin0 tEcological economics.g2018 Oct., v. 152 p.106-117dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016000163300001400323500001900337520110300356592002801459650001501487650001601502650001801518650002501536650001001561650001001571650001701581650001501598700001601613700002401629700001501653700006001668700002201728700002201750773012601772856008201898852000901980655001201989IND60722885320221121042947.0210108e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072288532DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-020-03403-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubo, Yuki10aEnhanced Production of Astaxanthin without Decrease of DHA Content in Aurantiochytrium limacinum by Overexpressing Multifunctional Carotenoid Synthase Gene  ap. 52-64.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAurantiochytrium limacinum produces both docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and astaxanthin, respectively. Organisms that produce these industrially important materials more efficiently than microalgae are currently needed. In this study, we overexpressed a putative homolog of CarS, which is involved in synthesizing the astaxanthin precursor, β-carotene, in A. limacinum to increase carotenoid synthesis with the goal of obtaining strains that produce large amounts of both DHA and carotenoids. AlCarS transformants #1 and #18 produced significantly increased amounts of astaxanthin as assessed according to culture (up to 5.8-fold) and optical density (up to 9.3-fold). The improved astaxanthin production of these strains did not affect their DHA productivity. Additionally, their CarS expression levels were higher than those of the wild-type strain, suggesting that CarS overexpression enhanced β-carotene production, which in turn improved astaxanthin productivity. Although cell yields were slightly decreased, these features will be valuable in health food, medical care, and animal feed fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aastaxanthin 3abiotechnology 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3afeeds 3agenes 3ahealth foods 3amicroalgae1 aShiroi, Mai1 aHigashine, Tokuhiro1 aMori, Yuki1 aMorimoto, Daichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7789-05291 aNakagawa, Satoshi1 aSawayama, Shigeki0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2021 Jan., v. 193, no. 1 p.52-64dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-020-03403-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011600169300001400285520127500299592002801574650001001602650001201612650001701624650001001641650000901651650002601660650001801686650000901704650001101713650002901724653001101753653000801764653000801772653001101780653000701791653000801798653001001806653001001816653001601826653002401842653002901866653002901895653001601924700003001940700001701970700002001987773009602007856008502103852000902188655001202197IND60554506520221119102429.0161024e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055450652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtoki, Yurika10aMS/MS and LC-MS/MS analysis of choline/ethanolamine plasmalogens via promotion of alkali metal adduct formation  ap. 85-92.  aTandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has been used for the analysis of plasmalogen (Pls), a physiologically important class of vinyl ether-linked phospholipid. However, MS/MS generally causes little fragmentation of Pls, especially choline Pls (PC-Pls). Previous MS/MS studies reported an increased formation of product ions of PC-Pls (and also ethanolamine Pls (PE-Pls)) in the presence of ‘alkali metals.’ Therefore, use of alkali metals considerably leads to the development of a method for analysis of both PC- and PE-Pls. In this study, this notion was evaluated using quadrupole-time-of-flight MS/MS and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with MS/MS. Results from MS/MS confirmed that alkali metals (e.g., sodium) produced significant fragmentation of PC-Pls and PE-Pls. A number of structure-diagnostic product ions exhibiting high intensities were observed under optimized MS/MS conditions using alkali metals. Moreover, the ability to selectively and sensitively identify PC-Pls and PE-Pls at the molecular species level in biological samples (rat brain and heart) was demonstrated using LC-MS/MS. Therefore, the herein developed method appears to be a powerful tool for analyzing Pls and may provide a better understanding of their physiological roles in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acholine 3aethanolamine 3aheart 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3aphospholipids 3arats 3asodium 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aPC-Pls 0aCID 0aESI 0aPE-Pls 0aLC 0aPls 0aPUFAs 0aMS/MS 0aPlasmalogen 0aCholine plasmalogen 0aEthanolamine plasmalogen 0aTandem mass spectrometry 0aRat tissues1 aNakagawa, K.q(Kiyotaka),1 aKato, Shunji1 aMiyazawa, Teruo0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 1004 p.85-92dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001400160245015600174300001800330520159500348592002801943650001201971650001301983650001301996650001902009650001102028650002202039650001502061650001902076650003702095650000902132650002702141650001602168650001202184650001202196650002302208650002202231650001302253650004702266650003702313700001602350700001702366773010502383856008102488852000902569655001202578IND4477023020221119055159.0120502e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447702302DNAL7 a220800082pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2011-017212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzadi, F.10aGenetic diversity of the major histocompatibility complex region in commercial and noncommercial chicken flocks using the LEI0258 microsatellite marker  ap. 2711-2717.  aMicrosatellite marker LEI0258 was used as an indicator to examine the variability of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in 2 commercial layer flocks, 1 experimental layer cross, and 5 noncommercial flocks (used for free-run and free-range meat and egg production). We hypothesized that the populations from noncommercial sources may have more diversity in MHC genes than that in the commercial-source populations. Two related parameters, heterozygosity and the number of alleles harbored by a population, were used to assess the genetic variability. The different combinations of the 22 alleles created 66 genotypes in the 8 chicken populations that were studied. The noncommercial populations, except for the Silkies (SK), harbored more alleles than those in the 2 commercial populations, Lohmann Brown and Lohmann White. The observed heterozygosity of the MHC region was high in all of the populations, except for SK. Considering the 2 parameters we have examined, we can generalize that the intensively selected commercial egg-layer varieties seem to have less genetic variability in their MHC regions compared with that of the noncommercial flocks, which are less intensively selected. The LEI0258 variants can be used as markers to detect most of the MHC haplotypes, but in the different populations the same allele size may not always be associated with the same serologically defined haplotype. The information obtained from this study will be useful for genetic resource conservation and the development of breeding stocks that are suitable for free-range production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abreeding 3achickens 3aegg production 3aflocks 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3ameat 3amicrosatellite repeats 2aAgriculture 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complexxgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics1 aRitland, C.1 aCheng, K.

A simplistic, economical, and green approach was adopted for biomimetic mineralization to prepare multilayered nano-entrapped ECL, which were then applied as biocatalysts for the production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). The optimal ECL (0.8 mg protein/mL) and CuSO₄∙5H₂O (1.2 mM) showed the highest capacity for enzyme loading. The ECL-CuSO₄-hybrid showed an 89.7% conversion of triacylglycerides into FAME via transesterification and a 98.7% conversion of oleic acid into FAME via esterification at 72 h. The ECL-CuSO₄-hybrid gave 65% and 78.7% FAME production after 5 successive reuses via transesterification and esterification reactions, respectively. Therefore, these ECL-inorganic hybrid biocatalysts have high economical potential to be used for the production of biodiesel as the future petrodiesel replacement.  aPublisher supplied data  aTHE-AC 024/2015cThailand’s Education Hub for Southern Regions of ASEAN Countries Project Office of the Higher Education Commission  aAGR6202081ScPrince of Songkla University  aRTA6280014cThailand Research Fund 3abiodiesel 3abiomimetics 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acost effectiveness 3adiesel fuel 3aesterification 3afatty acid methyl esters 3amineralization 3aoleic acid 3atransesterification 3atriacylglycerols1 aUpaichit, Apichat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3044-32461 aCheirsilp, Benjamas0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2021 Jan., v. 193, no. 1 p.165-187dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-020-03404-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245006600173300001400239520135800253592002801611650001301639650001001652650002201662650001901684650001101703650002801714650001401742650001301756653002601769653004001795653003001835653001601865700002701881700001901908700002901927700006201956773009402018856008302112852000902195655001202204IND60530172120221116155402.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053017212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.05.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKontou, Panagiota I.10aNetwork analysis of genes and their association with diseases  ap. 68-78.  aA plethora of network-based approaches within the Systems Biology universe have been applied, to date, to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of various human diseases. In the present study, we perform a bipartite, topological and clustering graph analysis in order to gain a better understanding of the relationships between human genetic diseases and the relationships between the genes that are implicated in them. For this purpose, disease-disease and gene-gene networks were constructed from combined gene-disease association networks. The latter, were created by collecting and integrating data from three diverse resources, each one with different content covering from rare monogenic disorders to common complex diseases. This data pluralism enabled us to uncover important associations between diseases with unrelated phenotypic manifestations but with common genetic origin. For our analysis, the topological attributes and the functional implications of the individual networks were taken into account and are shortly discussed. We believe that some observations of this study could advance our understanding regarding the etiology of a disease with distinct pathological manifestations, and simultaneously provide the springboard for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies and its underlying genetic mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aetiology 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3amulticultural diversity 3aphenotype 3atopology 0aHuman disease network 0aHuman disease-related genes network 0aGene-disease associations 0aDrug design1 aPavlopoulou, Athanasia1 aDimou, Niki L.1 aPavlopoulos, Georgios A.1 aBagos, Pantelis G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4935-23250 tGene.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 590, no. 1 p.68-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.05.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245013000159300002000289520092900309592002801238650001701266650001101283650002401294650001301318650001701331700001301348700002101361700001601382700001501398700001701413700001301430700002901443700002401472700002001496700001901516773013501535856007801670852000901748655001201757IND60580492420180904000000.0170921e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058049242DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b074572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yingbo12aA Synthetic Route for Crystals of Woven Structures, Uniform Nanocrystals, and Thin Films of Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks  ap. 13166-13172.  aDeveloping synthetic methodology to crystallize extended covalent structures has been an important pursuit of reticular chemistry. Here, we report a homogeneous synthetic route for imine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) where crystallites emerge from clear solutions without forming amorphous polyimine precipitates. The key feature of this route is the utilization of tert-butyloxycarbonyl group protected amine building blocks, which are deprotected in situ and gradually nucleate the crystalline framework. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by crystallizing a woven covalent organic framework (COF-112), in which covalent organic threads are interlaced to form a three-dimensional woven framework. The homogeneous imine COF synthesis also enabled the control of nucleation and crystal growth leading to uniform nanocrystals, through microwave-assisted reactions, and facile preparation of oriented thin films.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallites 3aimines 3amicrowave treatment 3amoieties 3ananocrystals1 aGuo, Lei1 aGándara, Felipe1 aMa, Yanhang1 aLiu, Zheng1 aZhu, Chenhui1 aLyu, Hao1 aTrickett, Christopher A.1 aKapustin, Eugene A.1 aTerasaki, Osamu1 aYaghi, Omar M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 139, no. 37 p.13166-13172dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b074573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008900170300001600259500001900275520165800294592002801952596003601980650002202016650001702038650002302055650001902078650001802097650002102115650001802136650000702154650002102161650001202182650002002194650001602214700002402230700003002254773012802284856008202412852000902494655001202503IND60722885620221121053251.0210108e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072288562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-020-03410-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz, Juan Pablo10aScale-up of a Fibonacci-Type Photobioreactor for the Production of Dunaliella salina  ap. 188-204.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, the previously proposed Fibonacci-type photobioreactor is scaled up and evaluated to produce Dunaliella salina. First, the composition of the culture medium was optimized to achieve maximal productivity. Next, the Fibonacci-type reactor was scaled up to 1250 L maintaining high solar radiation interception capacity of this type of reactor. Finally, the performance of the reactor for the production of green cells of Dunaliella salina at the environmental conditions prevailing in the Atacama Desert was evaluated. Data demonstrated that the proposed photobioreactor allows the temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen concentration to be maintained within the optimal ranges recommended for the selected strain. Both better exposure to solar radiation and photonic flow dilution avoids the use of cooling systems to prevent overheating under outdoor conditions. The system allows up to 60% more solar radiation to be intercepted than does the horizontal surface, likewise, allowing to maintain the pH efficiently through CO₂ injection and to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration in acceptable ranges, thanks to its adequate mass transfer capacity. The biomass concentration reached up to 0.96 g L⁻¹, three times higher than that obtained in a raceway reactor under the same environmental conditions, whereas productivity was up to 0.12 g L⁻¹ day (2.41 g m⁻² day). Maximum specific outdoor growth rates reached up to 0.17 day⁻¹. Undoubtedly, this technology scaled up constitutes a new type of photobioreactor for use at the industrial scale since it is capable of maximizing biomass productivity under high light conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a727874cH2020 Excellent Science 3aDunaliella salina 3abiochemistry 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3aculture media 3adissolved oxygen 3amass transfer 3apH 3aphotobioreactors 3aphotons 3asolar radiation 3atemperature1 aInostroza, Cristian1 aAcién, Francisco Gabriel0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2021 Jan., v. 193, no. 1 p.188-204dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-020-03410-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011900171300001600290500001500306520161800321592002801939650001401967650001501981650001101996650002002007650001602027650001602043650001402059650001102073650001202084650001602096650001802112650001802130650001602148650001602164653001402180653001302194653001502207653001402222653003202236653001802268700001702286700001802303773010802321856008602429852000902515655001202524IND60539683420221120112946.0190318e20140416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053968342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostelloe, J.F.10aUncertainties around modelling of steady-state phreatic evaporation with field soil profiles of δ18O and chloride  ap. 229-241.  a2019-12-06  aThe application of the general advection–diffusion equation to model phreatic evaporation flux rates from solute concentration soil profiles has been applied to a variety of arid zone locations but the effects of heterogeneous and uncertain field data on modelling performance are rarely described. We revisit and extend the model by accounting for the effects of variable water content and sediment type on the impedance factor, and in turn, effective diffusion coefficient. We explore the local sensitivity of the extended model to its major assumptions and parameter values. The mean diffusion coefficient of the soil profile data is most sensitive to the volumetric water content close to the evaporation front and so modelled evaporation results can be very sensitive to uncertainty around the position of the evaporation front. The uncertainty in the position of the groundwater reservoir and its concentration has little effect where the lower part of the profile shows an asymptotic trend towards a representative value of groundwater concentration but can vary substantially with different values of groundwater depth and concentration if this is not the case. Field data from the southern margin of the Great Artesian Basin are shown to exhibit considerable uncertainty around the boundary conditions of the advection–diffusion model (e.g. position of evaporation front, depth and concentration of lower groundwater boundary condition). Resulting phreatic evaporation flux estimates show a wide range that needs to be considered when using these data in water balance studies of groundwater systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3aarid zones 3abasins 3abalance studies 3auncertainty 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3amodels 3asolutes 3aevaporation 3awater content 3asoil profiles 3agroundwater 3awater table 0aArid zone 0aIsotopes 0aTortuosity 0aimpedance 0aAdvection–diffusion model 0awater balance1 aIrvine, E.C.1 aWestern, A.W.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Apr. 16, v. 511 p.229-241dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001600193245012000209300001400329506007600343520141200419592002801831506003701859650001401896650002401910650001401934650001701948650002501965650002801990650001002018650002002028650001302048650001502061650001502076650001802091650005202109650001702161650001902178650001602197650001302213650001202226651001302238653001402251653001002265653001202275653001302287653001202300653002002312653002302332653001502355700002102370700002002391700002302411700002002434700002202454773011402476856008602590852000902676655001202685IND60602675520221207115842.0180711e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060267552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.05.0072doi7 aPMC46054052pmcid7 a260220832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTam, Ka Ian10aEvaluation of BBL™ Sensi-Discs™ and FTA® cards as sampling devices for detection of rotavirus in stool samples  ap. 41-46.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRotavirus is the most important cause of severe childhood gastroenteritis worldwide. Rotavirus vaccines are available and rotavirus surveillance is carried out to assess vaccination impact. In surveillance studies, stool samples are stored typically at 4°C or frozen to maintain sample quality. Uninterrupted cold storage is a problem in developing countries because of power interruptions. Cold-chain transportation of samples from collection sites to testing laboratories is costly. In this study, we evaluated the use of BBL™ Sensi-Discs™ and FTA® cards for storage and transportation of samples for virus isolation, EIA, and RT-PCR testing. Infectious rotavirus was recovered after 30 days of storage on Sensi-Discs™ at room temperature. We were able to genotype 98–99% of samples stored on Sensi-Discs™ and FTA® cards at temperatures ranging from −80°C to 37°C up to 180 days. A field sampling test using samples prepared and shipped from Cameroon, showed that both matrices yielded 100% genotyping success compared with whole stool and Sensi-Discs™ demonstrated 95% concordance with whole stool in EIA testing. The utilization of BBL™ Sensi-Discs™ and FTA® cards for stool sample storage and shipment has the potential to have great impact on global public health by facilitating surveillance and epidemiological investigations of rotavirus strains worldwide at a reduced cost.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRotavirus 3aambient temperature 3achildhood 3acold storage 3adeveloping countries 3aepidemiological studies 3afeces 3agastroenteritis 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astorage time 3atransportation 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aCameroon 0aRotavirus 0aStool 0aStorage 0aShipment 0aAmbient 0aVirus isolation 0aEnzyme immunoassay 0aGenotyping1 aEsona, Mathew D.1 aWilliams, Alice1 aNdze, Valantine N.1 aBoula, Angeline1 aBowen, Michael D.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 222 p.41-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007800165300001400243520135700257592002801614506003701642650002701679650001901706650002101725650001101746650001101757650001701768650002201785650001901807773012401826856008101950852000902031655001202040IND60774721320221207133533.0220714e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077472132DNAL7 a10.1177/02611929209113392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalls, Michael10aIt’s Time to Reconsider The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique  ap. 40-46.  aIn the 60 years since the publication of The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique, the Three Rs (Reduction, Refinement, Replacement) proposed by William Russell and Rex Burch have gradually been accepted throughout the world as ways of facing up to the ethical and scientific dilemmas involved in animal experimentation. However, the scale of animal use and the use of animals as models of humans has continued, seemingly almost unchallenged in much of the scientific community, despite the warnings about models, species differences and human variation spelled out in the The Principles. In this Comment, it is proposed that it is time to move away from the animal welfare focus of the Three Rs, in favour of a wider concept of humanity, which also embraces human welfare. In addition, since less than 10% of new drugs successfully pass from preclinical testing, which is highly reliant on animal procedures, to acceptance for clinical use, it is argued that the aim should not be to directly replace animal testing with non-animal methods with similar aims and which produce similar results, but to take advantage of developments in cell and molecular biology and in computer science, to devise new, different, appropriate, specific and intelligent stand-alone preclinical testing strategies that are applicable to particular human situations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal experimentation 3aanimal welfare 3acomputer science 3aethics 3ahumans 3alaboratories 3amolecular biology 3asocial welfare0 tATLA.

The first needs true process intensification and the second, among others, new eco-efficient starting and product materials. In this context, a new application for glycerol is reported with increasing industrial interest and tested here under highly intensified conditions. Starting from prior batch processing experience, it is reported about the transfer to a continuous process to transform dichloropropyl pivaloate, prepared from glycerol, into 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl ester. The continuous microreactor based process has up to three orders-of-magnitude reduced reaction times (5760×) by virtue of exploiting unusual experimental conditions in organic chemistry (Novel Process Windows), i.e. superheated pressurised processing much above the boiling point. The yields are fully comparable with the ones obtained under batch conditions, but with (expected) loss in selectivity through enhanced diproduct formation. This principally enables the new continuous process to target much higher productivities; however this also results in a more complex reaction mixture therefore the ease of separation and commercial value of the second product will decide its exploitation. Beyond such benefits for the individual reaction under investigation, this is among the very first reports about a superheated reaction with a distinct selectivity issue with two known byproduct pathways, and thus provides the first respective generic information after an upheavalled reporting on capillary- or microreactor-based superheated processing, so far mostly done for less complex reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch systems 3aboiling point 3abyproducts 3aenvironmental impact 3aglycerol 3agreen chemistry 3aorganic chemistry1 aHessel, Volker1 aRothstock, Sonja1 aEras, Jordi1 aCanela, Ramon1 aLöb, Patrick0 tGreen chemistry.g2011 July 5, v. 13, no. 7 p.1799-1805dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0gc00655f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245017600202300001800378520086000396592002801256650001401284650001901298650002001317650001801337650001101355650001201366650001801378700001501396700001701411700001601428700001401444700001501458773009501473856008201568852000901650655001201659IND60530806420221118044133.0210124e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053080642DNAL7 a277615062pmid7 aPMC50638072pmcid7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Yuan10aData for the gene expression profiling and alternative splicing events during the chondrogenic differentiation of human cartilage endplate-derived stem cells under hypoxia  ap. 1438-1442.  aThis article contains relevant data of the research article titled Global profiling of the gene expression and alternative splicing events during the hypoxia-regulated chondrogenic differentiation in human cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (Yao et al., 2016) [1].

The development of branchless lines will provide important germplasms for breeding watermelon varieties and is an important method for genetic improvement. In this study, the watermelon accession, Wu Cha Zao (WCZ) is a branchless inbred line that carries the branchless gene Clbl, which was used as the donor parent to develop branchless near isogenic lines (NILs). To construct the NILs of Clbl, WCZ crossed with the normal branching watermelon inbred line WT20 which was used as the recurrent parent. The co-segregating markers dCAPS10 and Indel1 with Clbl were used for foreground selection, and a total of 108 SSR markers was selected with good polymorphism between two parental lines for background selection which had relatively uniform distribution across 11 chromosomes. Using these markers to select individuals from the BC₁F₁, BC₂F₁, and BC₂F₂ generations, three NILs with a proportion of recurrent parent genome (PRPG) > 99% were finally obtained. The lateral branch and plant height phenotypes did not significantly differ between the NILs and WCZ, indicating that the NILs of Clbl under the genetic background of WT20 has been successfully developed. These results provide ideal materials for further in-depth analysis of the genetic mechanisms of lateral branch development and ideal plant architecture breeding in watermelon.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenes 3agenetic background 3agenetic improvement 3agermplasm 3ahorticultural crops 3ainbred lines 3aplant architecture 3aplant height 3awatermelons 0aWatermelon 0aBranchless 0aClbl 0aNear isogenic lines 0aMarker assisted selection1 aWang, Yinping1 aYang, Huihui1 aNiu, Huanhuan1 aLiu, Dongming1 aYang, Sen1 aZhu, Huayu1 aSun, Shouru1 aYang, Luming0 tHorticultural plant journal.g2022 Sept., v. 8, no. 5 p.627-636dElsevier B.V.aChinese Society for Horticultural Science (CSHS) and Institute of Vegetables and Flowers (IVF), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS).wJournal:23309x2468-01417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hpj.2022.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009700177300001600274520152600290592002801816650001101844650002101855650001401876650001101890650001501901650001101916650002301927650002201950650001701972651001101989651002602000653002002026653001902046653002602065653001902091700002302110773010802133856008602241852000902327655001202336IND60539683720221120112812.0190318e20140416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053968372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Z.q(Zhuoheng),10aReconstructing river discharge trends from climate variables and prediction of future trends  ap. 267-278.  aA number of studies suggest a significant decline of river discharge in the Canadian Plains that drain the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and elsewhere in Canada. Analyses of these trends suggested that apparent decline rates may represent long-term discharge variation as a result of anthropogenic induced change in seasonal flow and/or may also represent true long-term declines in annual flow. Potential for significant declines in river discharge raises concern over future water supply for this region. However, extracting accurate trends in river discharge is challenging for basins with relatively short periods of record as quasi-periodic decadal and multi-decadal oscillations are found to be important components of long-term natural variability. In order to reconstruct historic river flows, a correlation model between river flow and climate variables (that normally have longer periods of record) was developed. This empirical relationship was used as a proxy to reconstruct natural modes of river discharge, allowing a means to extend short term discharge records further back in time. The Athabasca River was used as an example to demonstrate the application of the proposed methods. The resulting long-term Athabasca River flow trends show variation is strongly related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Previous studies suggesting decline flows on this river have been biased by examining short-term records of flow, that by chance corresponded with the down limb of a long term cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimatic factors 3ahydrology 3amodels 3aprediction 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3atopographic slope 3awater supply 3aCanada 3aRocky Mountain region 0aRiver flow rate 0aClimate change 0aLong term variability 0aTrend analysis1 aGrasby, Stephen E.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Apr. 16, v. 511 p.267-278dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008200169300001200251500001500263520193100278592002802209650002402237650001702261650000802278650001202286650001902298650002202317650002402339650001702363650002802380650001002408650001302418650001202431650001502443650002202458650001402480650001102494651001202505653002202517653002602539653002502565653002802590653005102618653001202669653002002681700002002701700001802721700002602739700002402765700003002789700002002819773008702839856008502926852000903011655001203020IND60551304420221119151011.0161018e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055130442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzmen, Süay10aOlfactory and erectile dysfunction association in smoking and non-smoking men  ap. 1-5.  a2019-12-06  aThe studies evaluating the effect of smoking on olfaction reveals opposite results. In vitro and animal studies and epidemiological evidence from volunteers and patients, demonstrated the association between olfaction and erectile functions. In smoking man the reduction of olfactory acuity could adversely affect sexuality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between erectile dysfunction (ED) and olfactory dysfunction (OD) by comparing a group of healthy adult men with a group of smoking adult men. This prospective study involved 62 volunteers, who were recruited and divided into two groups; one consisted of 35 smoking adult men, and the other included 27 healthy non-smoking men. All participants in both groups were examined in detail for any condition with the potential to cause OD. They all had a normal genitourinary system suffered from no circulatory diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease nor hyperlipidemia; they had no history of medication affecting genitourinary system. Butanol threshold test and sniffin' stick® (Burghart, Wedel; Germany) screening test was used to asses olfactory functions in both groups. Participants' sexual desire was assessed using an International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scale. The means of sniffin' sticks scores, butanol threshold scores and IIEF-5 scores were statistically higher in non-smoking group. Butanol threshold scores and sniffin' sticks scores are correlated statistically with IIEF-5 in non-smoking and smoking groups. This study found an association between olfaction and erectile function in smoking and non-smoking men. As far as we know this study is the third published study to show the relationship olfactory and erectile function. In the future studies electrophysiological olfactory methods could be used to confirm in large cohorts the results obtained by the psychophysical approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprospective studies 3adrug therapy 3amen 3aanimals 3ahyperlipidemia 3adiabetes mellitus 3aolfactory disorders 3ahypertension 3acoronary artery disease 3asmell 3apatients 3abutanol 3avolunteers 3aelectrophysiology 3ascreening 3aadults 3aGermany 0aButanol threshold 0aOlfactory dysfunction 0aErectile dysfunction 0aepidemiological studies 0aInternational Index of Erectile Function scale 0aSmoking 0aSniffin' sticks1 aDülger, Seyhan1 aÇoban, Soner1 aÖzmen, Ömer Afşın1 aGüzelsoy, Muhammed1 aDikiş, Özlem Şengören1 aAkdeniz, Önder0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 June 01, v. 160 p.1-5dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010500155300002000260520131200280592002801592650003701620650001301657650001001670650001501680650000901695650002001704650001801724650001101742650001301753700001501766700001601781700001501797700001701812700001301829700001601842700001701858700001701875700001701892700001501909700001701924700001601941700001701957700001501974773012501989856007402114852000902188655001202197IND60617174920221116191002.0181024e20180917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061717492DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra06075d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlaria, A.10aSilica coated iron nanoparticles: synthesis, interface control, magnetic and hyperthermia properties  ap. 32146-32156.  aThis work provides a detailed study on the synthesis and characterization of silica coated iron nanoparticles (NPs) by coupling Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and magnetic measurements. Remarkably, iron NPs (of 9 nm of mean diameter) have been embedded in silica without any alteration of the magnetization of the iron cores, thanks to an original protocol of silica coating in non alcoholic medium. Tuning the synthesis parameters (concentration of reactants and choice of solvent), different sizes of Fe@SiO₂ composites can be obtained with different thicknesses of silica. The magnetization of these objects is fully preserved after 24 h of water exposure thanks to a thick (14 nm) silica layer, opening thus new perspectives for biomedical applications. Hyperthermia measurements have been compared between Fe and Fe@SiO₂ NPs, evidencing the self-organization of the free Fe NPs when a large amplitude magnetic field is applied. This phenomenon induces an increase of heating power which is precluded when the Fe cores are immobilised in silica. High-frequency hysteresis loop measurements allowed us to observe for the first time the increase of the ferrofluid susceptibility and remanence which are the signature of the formation of Fe NPs chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acoatings 3afever 3ahysteresis 3airon 3amagnetic fields 3ananoparticles 3asilica 3asolvents1 aSoulé, S.1 aHallali, N.1 aOjo, W.-S.1 aMirjolet, M.1 aFuks, G.1 aCornejo, A.1 aAllouche, J.1 aDupin, J.

Five isonitrogenous (313.34 g kg⁻¹) and isolipidic (81.82 g kg⁻¹) experimental diets were formulated. A total of 450 fingerlings (5.02 ± 0.1 g per fish) were randomly distributed into 15 tanks and fed thrice a day. The final weight gain was significantly improved in fish fed FO (45.7 ± 0.72 g/fish), BSFLO (45.53 ± 1.32 g/fish) and MO diet (47.2 ± 0.26 g/fish) when compared to BCSO (36.3 ± 1.05 g/fish) and FSO (35.83 ± 0.71g/ fish) diets. The lower value of daily weight gain was recorded in the FSO and BCSO treatments compared with other oils could be due to effects on stress resistance and immunosuppression in fish, whereas the whole‐body EPA and DHA content of fish fed with FSO and FO diets was substantially higher than fish fed with other experimental diets. However, the relative expression of Myo D and Myogenin was upregulated in fish fed with FO, BSFLO and MO diet than the BCSO and FSO diet. Present results indicate that the juveniles can be reared on diets in which FO has been replaced with BSFLO and MO, with no significant effects on fish performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3aNigella sativa 3aPangasianodon hypophthalmus 3aaquaculture 3adigestive enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acid composition 3afish oils 3agene expression 3aimmunosuppression 3ajuveniles 3alinseed oil 3amyogenin 3aresearch 3astress tolerance 3avegetables 3aweight gain1 aAhilan, Baboonsundaram1 aFelix, Nathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3530-59231 aUma, Arumugam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9429-40751 aChidambaram, Pushparaj1 aPrabu, Elangovan0 tAquaculture research.g2022 June, v. 53, no. 8 p.3097-3111dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.158233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245014600204300001300350520176200363592002802125650003702153650002002190650001402210650003102224650001402255650004202269650002202311650001502333650001902348650001602367650001302383650002402396650001802420650002002438650001302458650001002471653000802481653000902489653001202498653000802510653000902518653001202527653001402539653002502553653001102578653001502589653001502604653001802619653002102637700001602658700001802674700001602692700001902708700001902727700001702746773009302763856008302856852000902939655001202948IND60530172620221121004000.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053017262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Quanquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0971-366710aTranscriptome analysis of genes related to resistance against powdery mildew in wheat-Thinopyrum alien addition disomic line germplasm SN6306  ap. 5-17.  aWheat powdery mildew, which is mainly caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), seriously damages wheat production. The wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium alien addition disomic line germplasm SN6306, being one of the important sources of genes for wheat resistance, is highly resistant to Bgt E09 and to many other powdery mildew physiological races. However, knowledge on the resistance mechanism of SN6306 remains limited. Our study employed high-throughput RNA sequencing based on next-generation sequencing technology (Illumina) to obtain an overview of the transcriptome characteristics of SN6306 and its parent wheat Yannong 15 (YN15) during Bgt infection. The sequencing generated 104,773 unigenes, 9909 of which showed varied expression levels. Among the 9909 unigenes, 1678 unigenes showed 0 reads in YN15. The expression levels in Bgt-inoculated SN6306 and YN15 of exactly 39 unigenes that showed 0 or considerably low reads in YN15 were validated to identify the genes involved in Bgt resistance. Among the 39 unigenes, 12 unigenes were upregulated in SN6306 by 3–45 times. These unigenes mainly encoded kinase, synthase, proteases, and signal transduction proteins, which may play an important role in the resistance against Bgt. To confirm whether the unigenes that showed 0 reads in YN15 are really unique to SN6306, 8 unigenes were cloned and sequenced. Results showed that the selected unigenes are more similar to SN6306 and Th. intermedium than to the wheat cultivar YN15. The sequencing results further confirmed that the unigenes showing 0 reads in YN15 are unique to SN6306 and are most likely derived from Th. intermedium (Host) Nevski. Thus, the genes from Th. intermedium most probably conferred the resistance of SN6306 to Bgt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3acrop production 3acultivars 3agene expression regulation 3agermplasm 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amolecular cloning 3apathotypes 3apowdery mildew 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 3awheat 0aBgt 0aGISH 0aRT-qPCR 0ahai 0aRPKM 0aRNA-seq 0aBSMV-VIGS 0aWheat powdery mildew 0aSN6306 0aYannong 15 0aResistance 0aTranscriptome 0aReal-time RT-PCR1 aNiu, Zubiao1 aBao, Yinguang1 aTian, Qiuju1 aWang, Honggang1 aKong, Lingrang1 aFeng, Deshun0 tGene.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 590, no. 1 p.5-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03906naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010400170300001600274500001500290520211900305592002802424650002602452650001802478650001902496650001702515650001902532650002302551650001302574650001302587650001502600650001002615650002002625650001902645650001602664650002302680650001302703650001902716650002602735650003402761650001302795650001002808651002102818653002502839653002602864653001902890653002602909653002202935653002602957700002102983700002103004700002303025700002103048700002003069773010803089856008603197852000903283655001203292IND60539683920221120092327.0190318e20140416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053968392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsmaeili, Sara10aQuantitative global sensitivity analysis of the RZWQM to warrant a robust and effective calibration  ap. 567-579.  a2019-12-06  aSensitivity analysis is a useful tool to identify key model parameters as well as to quantify simulation errors resulting from parameter uncertainty. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) has been subjected to various sensitivity analyses; however, in most of these efforts a local sensitivity analysis method was implemented, the nonlinear response was neglected, and the dependency among parameters was not examined. In this study we employed a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis to quantify the contribution of 70 model input parameters (including 35 hydrological parameters and 35 nitrogen cycle parameters) on the uncertainty of key RZWQM outputs relevant to raspberry row crops in Abbotsford, BC, Canada. Specifically, 9 model outputs that capture various vertical-spatial and temporal domains were investigated. A rank transformation method was used to account for the nonlinear behavior of the model. The variance of the model outputs was decomposed into correlated and uncorrelated partial variances to provide insight into parameter dependency and interaction. The results showed that, in general, the field capacity (soil water content at −33kPa) in upper 30cm of the soil horizon had the greatest contribution (>30%) to the estimate of the water flux and evapotranspiration uncertainty. The most influential parameters affecting the simulation of soil nitrate content, mineralization, denitrification, nitrate leaching and plant nitrogen uptake were the transient coefficient of fast to intermediate humus pool, the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the fast humus pool, the organic matter decay rate in fast humus pool, and field capacity. The correlated contribution to the model output uncertainty was <10% for the set of parameters investigated. The findings from this effort were utilized in two calibration case studies to demonstrate the utility of this global sensitivity analysis to reduce the risk of over-parameterization, and to identify the vertical location of observations that were the most effective to use as RZWQM calibration targets when water flux estimates are a key focus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparameter uncertainty 3asoil horizons 3afield capacity 3acase studies 3amineralization 3asoil water content 3avariance 3aleaching 3asoil water 3ahumus 3adenitrification 3arisk reduction 3araspberries 3aevapotranspiration 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3anitrates 3acrops 3aBritish Columbia 0aSensitivity analysis 0aParameter correlation 0aorganic matter 0aOver-parameterization 0aLinear regression 0aAutomatic calibration1 aThomson, Neil R.1 aTolson, Bryan A.1 aZebarth, Bernie J.1 aKuchta, Shawn H.1 aNeilsen, Denise0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Apr. 16, v. 511 p.567-579dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.01.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03903naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011200166300001500278520186400293592002802157650003102185650002102216650002002237650001402257650001902271650001902290650001402309650001502323650002302338650001402361650001802375650001902393650002402412650001002436650002002446650001102466650001802477650001102495650004302506650005202549650001302601651001802614653000802632653000802640653001202648653000902660653000902669653001002678653001002688653000802698653001002706653000802716653001202724653000902736653000802745653002202753653001102775653001002786653001402796700001602810700001902826700001302845700001302858700001402871700001902885700001202904700001802916773009502934856008303029852000903112655001203121IND60530172720221120233528.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053017272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Guixian10aLncRNA-uc.167 influences cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation of P19 cells by regulating Mef2c  ap. 97-108.  aIn our previous study we screened thousands of lncRNAs for their relationship with ventricular septal defect. Among these lncRNAs, uc.167 attracted our attention for its high level of conservation and that it was antisense to the Mef2c gene, which encodes myocyte enhancer factor 2C. This study aims to investigate the role of uc.167 during cardiomyocyte maturation in P19 cells induction and possible mechanism. The uc.167 expression level in human heart tissue of ventricular septum defect (VSD) was evaluated by qRT-PCR. The UCSC database was searched to investigate the bioinformatics of uc.167. We constructed overexpression vector of uc.167 and Mef2c. To detect proliferation and apoptosis, we combined cell cycle analysis and CCK8, Hoechst staining, flow cytometry and caspase-3 assays, respectively. The cardiomyogenesis related RNAs (cTnT, GATA4, and Mef2c) and proteins were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. In this study, we found that uc.167 expression was significantly increased in VSD heart tissues. uc.167 is on the opposite strand to the coding gene Mef2c. The expression model of Mef2c and uc.167 showed an opposite correlation in the embryonic development and process of differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of uc.167 inhibited proliferation but promoted apoptosis in P19 cells compared with the vector group, and those relative mRNAs and proteins decreased during the differentiation process. Whereas, co-expression of Mef2c and uc.167 can partially reverse the negative effects of uc.167 on proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Taken together, our findings suggest that uc.167 contributes to the development potential of VSD and may constitute a potential therapeutic target in this disease. uc.167 influences cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation of P19 cell by regulating Mef2c.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGATA transcription factors 3aWestern blotting 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3abioinformatics 3acardiomyocytes 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3adatabases 3aembryogenesis 3aflow cytometry 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aheart ventricle 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3aUnited States 0aCHD 0aVSD 0alncRNAs 0acTnT 0aUCEs 0aGAPDH 0aGATA4 0aGFP 0aMEF2C 0aPBS 0aqRT-PCR 0aDMSO 0aFBS 0aHeart development 0auc.167 0aMef2c 0aP19 cells1 aShen, Yahui1 aRuan, Zhongbao1 aLi, Xing1 aSu, Hui,1 aYuan, Wei1 aDing, Xiangwei1 aZhu, Li1 aQian, Lingmei0 tGene.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 590, no. 1 p.97-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009400177300001600271500001900287520178100306592002802087650001102115650002802126650002902154650001602183650001702199650001502216650001302231650002102244650003702265650001902302650001002321650001302331650002302344650002002367650001702387650001002404650001402414650001902428650001802447653003602465653001702501653001202518653001802530653001302548700002202561700003402583700002602617773013302643856008502776852000902861655001202870IND60720220220221121081603.0201210e20200902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072022022DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2020.18337632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbrosio, Carmen M.S.10aMicroencapsulation Enhances the in vitro Antibacterial Activity of a Citrus Essential Oil  ap. 985-997.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEssential oils (EOs) have become a promising alternative to antibiotic use in animal breeding because of their biological properties. Citrus EOs, a by-product of citrus processing industries, could be a feasible alternative due to their vast production worldwide. Encapsulation techniques, such as microencapsulation, could enable EO application in animal feed, preserving EO bioactivity. This study analyzes the use of foodgrade polymers, chitosan and modified starch, for microencapsulation of a commercial citrus EO, Brazilian orange terpenes (BOT), by spray-drying. Physical properties characterization showed that the microencapsulated BOT (MB-OT) had a moisture content = 5.39 %, aw = 0.40 and bulk density = 0.42 g/mL. Overall, microparticles presented a slight irregular-spherical shape, with a mean diameter of 2.77 μm and high polydispersity. Encapsulation efficiency reached 61.17 %. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity results showed that MBOT exerted a higher activity on enterotoxigenic E. coli U21 (isolated from pig gut) than on Lactobacillus rhamnosus, thus presenting a selective antibacterial activity between the pathogenic and beneficial bacteria. Moreover, MBOT exerted a higher selective antibacterial performance than the raw BOT, meaning the antibacterial performance of the raw BOT was enhanced by encapsulation. This is probably because wall material besides protects the raw BOT against volatilization; it could have interacted in synergism with the raw BOT enhancing the antibacterial effect of the MBOT powder. Finally, limonene was detected as the major compound in BOT by polar/non-polar GC-MS. Therefore, the modified starch-chitosan matrix could result in advantageous to encapsulate BOT and turn feasible its application in animal feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abulk density 3abyproducts 3achitosan 3adigestive system 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aessential oils 3afeeds 3alimonene 3amicroencapsulation 3amodified starch 3aspray drying 3aswine 3asynergism 3avolatilization 3awater content 0amodified starch-chitosan matrix 0aspray-drying 0aE. coli 0aLactobacillus 0apig feed1 aAlvim, Izabela D.1 aContreras Castillo, Carmen J.1 aDa Gloria, Eduardo M.0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2020 Sept. 2, v. 23, no. 5 p.985-997dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2020.18337633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012000163300001600283500002000299520172900319592002802048650002402076650001302100650001602113650001002129650002202139650001302161650001802174650001102192650000902203650001302212650000902225650001202234700002402246700002102270700002302291700001902314773010802333856007402441852000902515655001202524IND60587212620221122113400.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058721262DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.122702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancebo, Camino M.10aEffect of oil and shortening in rice bread quality: Relationship between dough rheology and quality characteristics  ap. 597-606.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOne of the main problems with gluten‐free breads is their texture and their rapid staling. Fats are widely used for the improvement of texture and other quality parameters in gluten‐free breads. The effect of oil and shortening in rice‐breads quality and its correlation with dough rheology has been analyzed. The inclusion of oil increased the specific volume of the breads and reduced their hardness, particularly with lower levels of hydration, whereas shortening did not modify specific volume or reduced it when hydration levels were higher. Oil, at levels of up to 30%, reduced the cohesiveness, springiness and resilience of breads, as well as the brightness of the crust, and increased the a* and b* values. Breads with oil also exhibited a greater number of pores per cm², especially in doughs with higher levels of hydration. An inverse correlation between G′ and G′′ and bread specific volume has been observed, being the reciprocal‐Y model a better predictor than the linear model to relate the bread specific volume. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study showed that the type and quantity of fat added in rice based breads affect the bread quality in a different way. In general, it can be said that the incorporation of up to 20% oil improved rice based breads. Oil increased the specific volume, the a* and b* parameters of the crust and the cell density. It also decreases hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, resilience, and the L* parameter. Converse to breads made with oil, the addition of shortening can negatively affect the quality of the breads. Moreover, the correlation analysis has demonstrated that the study of dough rheology could be a good predictor of gluten‐free bread quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreadmaking quality 3acohesion 3acorrelation 3adough 3agluten-free bread 3ahardness 3alinear models 3alipids 3aoils 3arheology 3arice 3atexture1 aMartínez, Mario M.1 aMerino, Cristina1 ade la Hera, Esther1 aGomez, Manuel,0 tJournal of texture studies.g2017 Dec., v. 48, no. 6 p.597-606dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-49017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jtxs.122703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245017400174520130800348592002801656650002501684650001101709650001601720650001201736650002101748650002001769650001601789650001001805650001001815650001101825650001801836650001401854650001401868650001001882650000901892650001801901650001701919653002101936653002001957653002001977653003001997653002102027653002402048700002402072700002602096700002202122700002002144700001902164700002502183700002102208773011802229856008802347852000902435655001202444IND60765973620221119165351.0220606e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076597362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1535272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimunová, Diana10aEnvironmental circulation of the anthelmintic drug albendazole affects expression and activity of resistance-related genes in the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus  aVeterinary anthelmintics excreted from treated animals pass to soil, subsequently to plants and then to their consumers. This circulation might have various consequences, including drug-resistance promotion in helminths. The present study was designed to follow the effect of the environmental circulation of the common anthelmintic drug albendazole (ABZ) in real farm conditions on the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus in vivo. Two fields with fodder plants (clover and alfalfa) were fertilized, the first with dung from ABZ-treated sheep (at the recommended dosage), the second with dung from non-treated sheep (controls). After a 10-week growth period, the fresh fodder from both fields was used to feed two groups of sheep, which were infected with H. contortus. Eggs and adult nematodes from the animals of both groups were isolated, and various parameters were compared. No significant changes in the eggs' sensitivity to ABZ and thiabendazole were observed. However, significantly increased expression of several cytochromes P450 and UDP-glycosyl transferases as well as increased oxidation and glycosylation of ABZ and ABZ-sulfoxide (ABZ-SO) was found in the exposed nematodes. These results show that ABZ environmental circulation improves the ability of the helminths to deactivate ABZ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aadults 3aalbendazole 3aalfalfa 3acytochrome P-450 3adrug resistance 3aenvironment 3afarms 3afeces 3aforage 3aglycosylation 3ahelminths 3aoxidation 3asheep 3asoil 3athiabendazole 3atransferases 0aVeterinary drugs 0aDrug resistance 0aMicropollutants 0aUDP-glycosyl transferases 0aCytochromes P450 0aEfflux transporters1 aMatoušková, Petra1 aNavratilova, Martina,1 aNguyen, Linh Thuy1 aAmbrož, Martin1 aVokřál, Ivan1 aSzotáková, Barbora1 aSkálová, Lenka0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 May 20, v. 822 p.153527-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1535273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245007700163300001800240520119200258592002801450650001801478650001601496650002501512650001101537650002301548650002401571700001701595700005401612773013501666856008001801852000901881655001201890IND60685666420221117062312.0200305e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068566642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c008982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yaguang10aLarge Second Harmonic Generation in Elemental α-Sb and α-Bi Monolayers  ap. 5506-5513.  aDifferent from the extensively studied polynary compounds for second-order nonlinear optics (NLO), for the first time, we demonstrate that large intrinsic second harmonic generation (SHG) can also exist in two-dimensional (2D) elemental materials such as monolayers α-Sb and α-Bi that have been recently synthesized with large scale and high quality where the Jahn–Teller-like distortions induced by the insufficient sp³ hybridization break the centrosymmetry, thus meeting the requirements for NLO response and leading to huge values of static SHG susceptibilities, which are two orders of magnitude larger than those of hotly studied MoS₂ and h-BN. By analyzing the evolution of density matrix, we further show that the major intraband contributions to SHG susceptibilities are from the significant linear dispersions near the band gaps in the two studied systems. Moreover, different from the alternating even–odd behaviors observed in other nonelemental 2D sheets, the SHG response remains in the multilayered α-Sb and α-Bi regardless of their thickness. These findings are of significance in promoting the applications of 2D α-Sb and α-Bi sheets for future NLO devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3adispersions 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aoptics 3aphysical chemistry 3areaction mechanisms1 aZhu, Huaiqiu1 aWang, Qian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9766-46170 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 07, v. 124, no. 9 p.5506-5513dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c008983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245020700161300001600368520156900384592002801953650001401981650002201995650001602017650002002033650002002053650001402073650002602087650002802113650000902141650001802150650002102168650002902189651001002218700001402228700001102242700001602253700001902269700005302288773011802341856008202459852000902541655001202550IND60590160820221123025650.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059016082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-017-3464-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Shuai10aSimultaneous Determination of Trace Levels of 12 Steroid Hormones in Soil Using Modified QuEChERS Extraction Followed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS)  ap. 435-445.  aSteroid hormones, mainly secreted by vertebrates, are discharged into the soil environment through surface runoff and land application of animal manure, sewage sludge, and organic fertilizers. The adequate analytical methods for steroid hormones in soil are lacking due to the requirement of rigorous sample pre-treatment. In this study, a rapid and effective modified QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) method was developed for trace simultaneous analysis of 12 steroid hormones (estrogen, androgens, and progestogens) in soil samples using ultra performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). Samples were extracted by the mixture of acetonitrile and acetate buffer, and then cleaned with PSA/C18 absorbents. The QuEChERS method was validated by evaluating the linearity, repeatability, accuracy and precision. A suitable linear relationship was obtained in the mass concentration range of 1–100 ng g⁻¹ with high correlation coefficients (> 0.9927). The method enabled the determination of the target analytes with limits of detection between 0.0014 and 0.462 ng g⁻¹ and limits of quantification between 0.0047 and 1.54 ng g⁻¹. Soil was spiked at 5, 50 and 100 ng g⁻¹, and the recoveries ranged from 75.17 to 110.33% with relative standard deviations ≤ 9.45. The developed method was successfully applied to the analysis of soil samples collected in Beijing, and five hormones (E1, E3, αE2, And, and Tes) were detected with the concentrations ranging from 0.35 to 7.09 ng g⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandrogens 3achemical analysis 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3aedaphic factors 3aestrogens 3aliquid chromatography 3aprogestational hormones 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3asteroid hormones 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aChina1 aHan, Ping1 aLi, An1 aWang, Jihua1 aFeng, Xiaoyuan1 aWang, Meng1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9513-36280 tChromatographia.g2018 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.435-445dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-017-3464-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003500132024001100167040001800178100001600196245014000212300001600352500001500368506017300383520145500556650001902011650002102030650002402051650001702075650001302092650001702105650002202122650001502144650001502159650002602174650001202200651001102212653001902223653001102242700002602253700002602279700002002305700001802325700002202343700001902365773009602384856011202480856004802592956008302640961000902723852000902732655001202741IND50058946420221214223804.0140701e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005894642DNAL7 a2495352aris7 a10113/590222hdl7 a10.1007/s10457-012-9550-42doi8 ans4878  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaia, F.

Organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling and microbial biomass were investigated in cacao agroforestry systems on Latosols and Cambisols in Bahia, Brazil. The objective of this study was to characterize the microbial C and N, mineralizable N and organic P in two soil orders under three types of cacao agroforestry systems and an adjacent natural forest in Bahia, Brazil and also to evaluate the relationship between P fractions, microbial biomass and mineralized N with other soil attributes. Overall, the average stocks of organic C, total N and total organic P across all systems for 0–50 cm soil depth were 89,072, 8,838 and 790 kg ha-1, respectively. At this soil depth the average stock of labile organic P was 55.5 kg ha-1. For 0–10 cm soil depth, there were large amounts of microbial biomass C (mean of 286 kg ha-1), microbial biomass N (mean of 168 kg ha-1) and mineralizable N (mean of 79 kg ha-1). Organic P (total and labile) was negatively related to organic C, reflecting that the dynamics of organic P in these cacao agroforestry systems are not directly associated with organicCdynamics in soils, in contrast to the dynamics of N. Furthermore, the amounts of soil microbial biomass, mineralizable N, and organic P could be relevant for cacao nutrition, considering the low amount of N and P exported in cacao seeds. 3amineralization 3anitrogen content 3asoil organic carbon 3aplant litter 3anitrogen 3aagroforestry 3amicrobial biomass 3asoil depth 3aphosphorus 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aforests 3aBrazil 0aorganic matter 0acarbon1 aGama-Rodrigues, A.

In the North Channel of the St. Clair River, juvenile lake sturgeon (3–7years old and 582–793mm in length) were studied to determine movement patterns and habitat usage. Fourteen juveniles were implanted with ultrasonic transmitters and tracked June–August of 2004, 2005 and 2006. Telemetry data, Geographic Information System software, side-scan sonar, video images of the river bottom, scuba diving, and benthic substrate samples were used to determine the extent and composition of habitats they occupied. Juvenile lake sturgeon habitat selection was strongly related to water depth. No fish were found in <6m of water and over 97% of the relocations were found at depths greater than 9m. Available water depths exceeding 18m only represented 3.5% of the available habitat, however 34.9% of the relocations were found at depths exceeding 18m. Juvenile lake sturgeon did not use most areas in proportion to their availability. Sturgeon avoided clay ledges and shallow areas with silt or soft clay, which comprised approximately 39% of the benthic habitat in the North Channel. A total of 300 out of 351 documented locations were on sand and gravel habitat types mixed with clay. Lake sturgeon >700mm in length selected sand and gravel areas mixed with zebra mussels and areas dominated by zebra mussels, while fish<700mm used these habitat types in proportion to their availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aclay 3acomputer software 3afish 3ageographic information systems 3agravel 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alakes 3arivers 3asand 3asilt 3atelemetry 3aultrasonics 3aGreat Lakes 3aMichigan 0aJuvenile lake sturgeon 0aHabitat 0aAcipenser fulvescens 0aSide-scan sonar 0aZebra mussels1 aManny, Bruce A.1 aDonald, Katherine A.L.1 aKennedy, Gregory W.1 aDiana, James S.1 aThomas, Michael V.1 aChiotti, Justin A.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2014, v. 40 p.81-88dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2013.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245007400168300001600242520072400258592002800982650001301010650000901023650001701032650001501049650001401064651001001078653000801088653003101096653002501127653002201152653002501174653002401199700002301223700002101246773010901267856008101376852000901457655001201466IND60591504620221121233055.0180905e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059150462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2015.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Cesare, Angela10aFelid Lungworms and Heartworms in Italy: More Questions than Answers?  ap. 665-675.  aNematodes infecting the cardiorespiratory system of cats have recently stimulated high scientific interest.

In this review, we underline and discuss current knowledge of, and new doubts relating to, feline lungworms and heartworms, with the aim of stimulating new studies to fill gaps of basic (i.e., epidemiology and biology) and applied (i.e., clinical aspects) knowledge of the old and new parasites affecting the cardiorespiratory system of cats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3acats 3aepidemiology 3aheartworms 3alungworms 3aItaly 0acat 0aAelurostrongylus abstrusus 0aTroglostrongylus spp 0aOslerus rostratus 0aCapillaria aerophila 0aAngiostrongylus spp1 aVeronesi, Fabrizia1 aTraversa, Donato0 tTrends in parasitology.g2015 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.665-675dElsevier LtdwJournal:6336x1471-49227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2015.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001800170245012800188300001600316520211700332592002802449650000802477650001302485650001202498650002002510650001102530650002202541650001302563650001602576650002002592650001102612650002802623650001402651650001602665650003202681650002102713650001402734650003002748651002102778653000802799653001802807653002102825653001402846653000902860700002002869700001702889773010402906856008503010852000903095655001203104IND60113329420221118052014.0160903e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011332942DNAL7 a238921352pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Mincheol10aApplication of Delphi-AHP methods to select the priorities of WEEE for recycling in a waste management decision-making tool  ap. 941-948.  aThe management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) or electronic waste (e-waste) has become a major issue of concern for solid waste communities due to the large volumes of waste being generated from the consumption of modern electrical and electronic products. In 2003, Korea introduced the extended producer responsibility (EPR) system to reduce the amount of electronic products to be disposed and to promote resource recovery from WEEE. The EPR currently regulates a total of 10 electrical and electronic products. This paper presents the results of the application of the Delphi method and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) modeling to the WEEE management tool in the policy-making process. Specifically, this paper focuses on the application of the Delphi-AHP technique to determine the WEEE priority to be included in the EPR system. Appropriate evaluation criteria were derived using the Delphi method to assess the potential selection and priority among electrical and electronic products that will be regulated by the EPR system. Quantitative weightings from the AHP model were calculated to identify the priorities of electrical and electronic products to be potentially regulated. After applying all the criteria using the AHP model, the results indicate that the top 10 target recycling products for the expansion of the WEEE list were found to be vacuum cleaners, electric fans, rice cookers, large freezers, microwave ovens, water purifiers, air purifiers, humidifiers, dryers, and telephones in order from the first to last. The proposed Delphi-AHP method can offer a more efficient means of selecting WEEE than subjective assessment methods that are often based on professional judgment or limited available data. By providing WEEE items to be regulated, the proposed Delphi-AHP method can eliminate uncertainty and subjective assessment and enable WEEE management policy-makers to identify the priority of potential WEEE. More generally, the work performed in this study is an example of how Delphi-AHP modeling can be used as a decision-making process tool in WEEE management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acleaners 3acookers 3adecision making 3adryers 3aelectronic wastes 3afreezers 3ahumidifiers 3amicrowave ovens 3amodels 3apolluter pays principle 3arecycling 3auncertainty 2aDecision Support Techniques 2aElectronic Waste 2aRecycling 2aWaste Managementxmethods 3aKorean Peninsula 0aAHP 0aDelphi method 0aElectronic waste 0aRecycling 0aWEEE1 aJang, Yong-Chul1 aLee, Seunguk0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 128 p.941-948dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012200157300001600279500002000295520114800315592002801463650002601491650002501517650002601542650002401568650002101592650002101613650002501634650001201659650001201671650002501683650001001708651000901718700001601727700001401743700001701757700001501774700001701789700001601806773012801822856007301950852000902023655001202032IND60587212820221120103653.0171215e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058721282DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.84962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xiaoman10aApplication of high‐resolution melting analysis for authenticity testing of valuable Dendrobium commercial products  ap. 549-558.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The accurate identification of botanical origin in commercial products is important to ensure food authenticity and safety for consumers. The Dendrobium species have long been commercialised as functional food supplements and herbal medicines in Asia. Three valuable Dendrobium species, namely Dendrobium officinale, D. huoshanense and D. moniliforme, are often mutually adulterated in trade products in pursuit of higher profit. RESULTS: In this paper, a rapid and reliable semi‐quantitative method for identifying the botanical origin of Dendrobium products in terminal markets was developed using high‐resolution melting (HRM) analysis with specific primer pairs to target the trnL‐F region. The HRM analysis method detected amounts of D. moniliforme adulterants as low as 1% in D. huoshanense or D. officinale products. CONCLUSION: The results have demonstrated that HRM analysis is a fast and effective tool for the differentiation of these Dendrobium species both for their authenticity as well as for the semi‐quantitative determination of the purity of their processed products. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendrobium officinale 3aadulterated products 3abotanical composition 3adietary supplements 3afunctional foods 3aherbal medicines 3ahybridization probes 3amarkets 3amelting 3aproduct authenticity 3atrade 3aAsia1 aJiang, Chao1 aYuanyuan,1 aPeng, Daiyin1 aLuo, Yuqin1 aZhao, Yuyang1 aHuang, Luqi0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Jan., v. 98, no. 2 p.549-558dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.84963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009000160300001600250520217100266592002802437650001902465650001702484650001902501650001302520650002102533650001802554650001402572650001002586650001302596650001502609650001602624650001902640650001402659650002202673650001002695653002802705653002002733653001602753653002302769653002102792653001402813700001602827773009602843856008102939852000903020655001203029IND60545007820221118052032.0160901e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054500782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHovi, A.10aReal and simulated waveform-recording LiDAR data in juvenile boreal forest vegetation  ap. 665-678.  aAirborne small-footprint LiDAR is replacing field measurements in regional-level forest inventories, but auxiliary fieldwork is still required for the optimal management of young stands. Waveform (WF) -recording sensors can provide a more detailed description of the vegetation than discrete return (DR) systems through accurate characterization of the backscattered signal. Furthermore, knowing the signal shape facilitates comparisons between real data and those obtained with simulation tools. We performed calibration and quantitative validation of a Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) -based LiDAR simulator against real data, and used simulations and real data to study small-footprint WF-recording LiDAR for the classification of juvenile boreal forest vegetation. The simulations were based on geometric-optical models of three species: birch (Betula pendula Roth), raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), and fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium (L.) Holub). Simulated WF features were in good agreement with the real data (differences of −19% to 11% in radiometric features, −0.23m to 0.45m in mean height), and relative interspecies differences were preserved. We used simulated data to study the effects of sensor parameters on the classification among the three species. An increase in footprint size improved the classification accuracy up to 0.30–0.36m in diameter, while the emitted pulse width and the WF sampling rate showed minor effects. Finally, we used real data to classify four silviculturally important vegetation functional groups (conifers, broad-leaved trees, low vegetation (green), low vegetation (barren)+abiotic material). Classification accuracies of 68.1–86.7% (kappa 0.50–0.80) showed slight improvement compared with existing studies on DR LiDAR and passive optical data. The results of simulator validation serve as a basis for the future use of simulation models, e.g. in LiDAR survey planning or in the simulation of synthetic training data, while the other findings clarify the potential of small-footprint WF data for characterizing vegetation in intensively managed forest stands at seedling and sapling stages in the boreal region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aRubus idaeus 3aboreal forests 3aconifers 3aforest inventory 3aforest stands 3ajuveniles 3alidar 3aplanning 3aradiometry 3araspberries 3aremote sensing 3aseedlings 3asimulation models 3atrees 0aMonte Carlo ray tracing 0aSystem waveform 0aCalibration 0aRadiative transfer 0aForest inventory 0aFootprint1 aKorpela, I.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Jan., v. 140 p.665-678dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015000164300001600314520133600330592002801666650001701694650001301711650001101724650001701735650001901752650001401771650001301785650001001798650001101808650001901819650001301838650002501851650001401876650001201890650002301902651002101925651001001946700002001956700001701976773012501993856008202118852000902200655001202209IND60590230020221116160912.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059023002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-017-3477-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelle, Simon10aGlacier dynamics influenced carbon flows through lake food webs: evidence from a chironomid δ13C-based reconstruction in the Nepalese Himalayas  ap. 285-295.  aUsing a sediment core covering the last 3,500 years, we analysed photosynthetic pigments’ concentrations in lake sediments and carbon stable isotopic composition of chironomid (Diptera, Chironomidae) remains (δ¹³CHC). We aimed to reconstruct temporal changes in aquatic primary productivity and carbon resources sustaining chironomid larvae in a high mountain lake (Lake Pyramid Inferior; 5,067 m a.s.l.) located in the Nepalese Himalayas. Both pigments and δ¹³CHC trends followed a similar fluctuating pattern over time, and we found significant positive relationships between these proxies, suggesting the strong reliance of benthic consumers on the aquatic primary production. Temporal trends matched well with main known climatic phases in the Eastern part of the Himalayan Mountains. Past glacier dynamics and associated in-lake solute concentrations appeared to be the main driver of autochthonous primary productivity, suggesting then the indirect impact of climate change on carbon processing in the benthic food web. During warm periods, the glacier retreat induced a rise in in-lake solute concentrations leading to an increasing primary productivity. Complementary investigations are still needed to strengthen our understanding about the response of past aquatic carbon cycling in CO₂-limiting environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aaltitude 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate change 3afood webs 3aglaciers 3alakes 3alarvae 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3aprimary productivity 3asediments 3asolutes 3atemporal variation 3aHimalayan region 3aNepal1 aMusazzi, Simona1 aLami, Andrea0 tHydrobiologia.g2018 Mar., v. 809, no. 1 p.285-295dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3477-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01433naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245003400166300001600200520044500216592002800661650002100689650002300710650001200733650002800745650001400773650001400787650001200801650002000813700002400833700002500857773013000882856007401012852000901086655001201095IND60660759020221119005853.0190827e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066075902DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07675c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalewska, Malgorzata,10aSynthesis of vinyl germylenes  ap. 276-278.  aA disilylated germylene phosphine adduct was obtained by reaction of tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl potassium with PMe₃ and GeCl₂·dioxane.

Developing a method specifically bind to the IgE epitope is necessary for testing BLG and its allergenic residues. RESULTS: The monoclonal antibody (1G9) specific to the IgE linear epitope for BLG was identified as high affinity and specificity. Based on 1G9, a sensitive fluorescent sandwich enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (sELISA) was successfully developed using catalase‐mediated fluorescence quenching of thiolated CdTe quantum dots in the presence of hydrogen peroxide as fluorescent signal output. The fluorescent sELISA showed high sensitivity and specificity, the limit of detection was 0.49 ng mL⁻¹, which was 16‐fold lower than horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐based sELISA. The linear range for BLG detection were 125–4000 ng mL⁻¹ (r = 0.9939) and 0.48–62.5 ng mL⁻¹ (r = 0.9919). The recoveries and coefficients of variation were 94.25–109.83% and 4.38–20.29%, respectively. Allergenic residues were also detected in hydrolysed infant formulas. The results of fluorescent sELISA showed good performance as HRP‐based sELISA and commercial sELISA kit. CONCLUSION: This proposed fluorescent sELISA could be employed to detect BLG and its allergenic residues in food with highly sensitivity, reliability, and recovery. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acattle 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3afluorescence 3afood allergies 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrolysis 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainfant formulas 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aperoxidase 3aquantum dots1 aLi, Xin1 aGao, Jinyan1 aTong, Ping1 aChen, Hongbing0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Jan., v. 98, no. 2 p.519-526dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.84893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012900170300001600299520135100315592002801666650001301694650002901707650002801736650002601764650002401790650001301814650002201827650001201849650001601861650001201877650000901889651002501898653002301923653002401946653003101970700002602001700002102027773009202048856008202140852000902222655001202231IND60546557020221122235156.0160903s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054655702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2013.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenning, Brian F.10aNearshore fish assemblage structure and habitat relationships in protected and open habitats in the upper St. Lawrence River  ap. 154-163.  aBiological integrity of nearshore habitat in the Thousand Islands region of the upper St. Lawrence River is threatened by the cumulative effects of anthropogenic stressors such as water level regulation, habitat alteration, and invasion of non-native plant and animal species. To better understand how fish-habitat associations and fish assemblage structure differed based on existing environmental conditions, fish assemblages were compared from three protected and five open nearshore habitats within embayments. Two distinct and diverse fish assemblages were identified: a protected nearshore and an open nearshore assemblage. Protected nearshore areas contained a diverse fish assemblage that harbored predominantly phytophilic species dependent upon densely vegetated habitats whereas open nearshore areas contained a diverse assemblage of Notropis sp. minnows dependent on wind exposed habitats with firmer substrates. Increased macrophyte column density was associated with protected nearshore assemblages whereas firmer substrates and increased fetch were correlated with open nearshore assemblages. Nearshore areas within the Thousand Islands region support populations of sensitive and intolerant fish species. Management strategies should focus on protecting high-quality nearshore habitats and restoring connectivity between habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNotropis 3aanthropogenic activities 3aanthropogenic stressors 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aintroduced plants 3aislands 3amacrophytes 3aminnows 3awind 3aSaint Lawrence River 0aSt. Lawrence River 0aConnecting channels 0aNearshore fish assemblages1 aKapuscinski, Kevin L.1 aFarrell, John M.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2014, v. 40 p.154-163dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2013.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01382naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013400168300001600302520037600318592002800694650001500722650001300737650001400750651001800764651001400782700001800796700002300814700001900837773012100856856008200977852000901059655001201068IND60579680320221121113110.0180619e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057968032DNAL7 a10.1134/S00329452170400512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaramushko, O.V.10aFirst record of juvenile northern wolffish Anarhichas denticulatus Krøyer, 1845, on the continental slope of Northeast Greenland  ap. 633-638.  aThe first record of the juvenile northern wolffish Anarhichas denticulatus was reported 570 km away from the nearest border of the species natural habitat near the island of Jan Mayen, on the continental slope of Northeast Greenland.

Channels connecting the Laurentian Great Lakes discharge large volumes of water equal to or greater than most other large rivers in the world that is of consistent high quality and volume, all year. Owing to creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway through the Great Lakes, the connecting channels have been modified by dredging over 200km of deep-draft shipping lanes with a maintained depth of no less than 8.2m. Combined with modification of their shorelines for housing and industries, use of the connecting channels for discharges of industrial and municipal wastes and shipping has resulted in numerous beneficial use impairments, such as restrictions on fish and wildlife consumption, degradation of fish and wildlife populations, and losses of fish and wildlife habitat. Various options for remediation of native fish populations and their habitats in the Great Lakes connecting channels, including construction of spawning habitat for threatened and high-value food fishes, such as lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), walleye (Sander vitreus), and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), have been implemented successfully in two of the channels, and form the basis for further recommended research described in this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3aCoregonus clupeaformis 3aSander vitreus 3adredging 3afish 3ahabitat conservation 3aindigenous species 3aindustry 3alakes 3aremediation 3arivers 3ashipping 3ashorelines 3aspawning 3awastes 3awildlife 3awildlife habitats 3aGreat Lakes 0aFish 0aConnecting channels 0aHabitat restoration 0aSt. Clair River 0aDetroit River 0aLake St. Clair1 aRoseman, Edward F.1 aManny, Bruce A.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2014, v. 40 p.23-30dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2013.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012700167300001600294520146400310592002801774650001701802650001001819650001201829650002001841650001101861650001101872650000701883650005801890650001601948700001801964700001901982700002102001700005702022773011802079856008202197852000902279655001202288IND60590161320221123035211.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059016132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-018-3477-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemasson, Elise10aCharacterization of Retention Mechanisms in Mixed-Mode HPLC with a Bimodal Reversed-Phase/Cation-Exchange Stationary Phase  ap. 387-399.  aMixed-mode HPLC (MM-HPLC), combining different interactions or retention modes in a single column, can be an interesting alternative to reversed-phase HPLC, notably to achieve the combined retention of polar and non-polar species. In the present fundamental study, we have selected one bimodal stationary phase allowing for both reversed-phase and weak cation-exchange retention modes (Acclaim mixed-mode WCX-1 LC). First, the mobile phase buffer composition (buffer pH ranging from 5 to 7 and concentration ranging from 20 to 100 mM) was explored with a small set of probe compounds (15 acids, bases and neutrals) to ensure adequate retention and peak shapes for the target compounds, and to evaluate the relative contributions of reversed-phase and ion-exchange mechanisms. Second, retention values measured for 63 probe compounds with various proportions of acetonitrile (ranging from 30 to 80%) served to establish linear solvation energy relationships based on (a) the usual and (b) a modified version of the solvation parameter model comprising additional descriptors to take account of interactions with ionizable species to bring some insights into the retention mechanisms. Finally, temperature effects at the low (30%) and high (60%) proportions of acetonitrile were observed between 20 and 40 °C (with 5 °C increments) and Van’t Hoff plots were drawn to measure the changes in interactions energies when the mobile phase composition changed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aacids 3abuffers 3acation exchange 3aenergy 3amodels 3apH 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atemperature1 aRicher, Yoann1 aBertin, Sophie1 aHennig, Philippe1 aWest, Caroline1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7595-67770 tChromatographia.g2018 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.387-399dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-018-3477-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012100165300001600286520217000302592002802472650001502500650002302515650001002538650002002548650002602568650001102594650002502605650005002630650002202680650001902702650001902721650001802740650002502758650002302783650002002806651001102826653001002837653002802847653002502875653003102900653000802931653003402939653001902973653001902992653003103011700002703042700001503069700001603084700001903100700002103119700001703140773009603157856008103253852000903334655001203343IND60545008120221118051730.0160901e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054500812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPekel, J. F.,12aA near real-time water surface detection method based on HSV transformation of MODIS multi-spectral time series data  ap. 704-716.  aIn the face of global population growth and the uneven distribution of water supply, a better knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water resources is critical. Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of ongoing processes, which addresses the intricate nature of water surfaces and allows an assessment of the pressures placed on aquatic ecosystems. However, the main challenge in identifying water surfaces from remotely sensed data is the high variability of spectral signatures, both in space and time. In the last 10years only a few operational methods have been proposed to map or monitor surface water at continental or global scale, and each of them show limitations. The objectives of this study are to develop, demonstrate and validate the adequacy of a generic multi-temporal and multi-spectral image analysis method to detect water surfaces automatically, and to monitor them in near real-time at the African continental scale as a first step towards global scale coverage. The proposed approach, based on a transformation of the RGB color space into HSV, provides dynamic information at the continental scale. Two different validations were done at the continental scale over Africa: i) The algorithm validation checked the ability of the proposed algorithm to perform as effectively as human interpretation of the image: it showed an accuracy of 96.6% and no commission errors. ii) The product validation was carried out by using an independent dataset derived from high resolution imagery: the continental permanent water surface product showed an accuracy of 91.5% and few commission errors. Potential applications of the proposed method have been identified and discussed. The methodology that has been developed is generic: it can be applied to sensors with similar bands with good reliability, and minimal effort. Moreover, this experiment at the African continental scale showed that the methodology is efficient for a large range of environmental conditions. Additional preliminary tests over other continents indicate that the proposed methodology could also be applied at the global scale without too many difficulties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acolor 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3ahumans 3aimage interpretation 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3apopulation growth 3aremote sensing 3aspace and time 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3awater distribution 3awater resources 3aAfrica 0aMODIS 0aWater surface detection 0aTime series analysis 0aColor space transformation 0aHSV 0aSpatial and temporal dynamics 0aMulti-temporal 0aMulti-spectral 0aPixel-based image analysis1 aVancutsem, Christelle,1 aBastin, L.1 aClerici, M.1 aVanbogaert, E.1 aBartholomé, E.,1 aDefourny, P.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Jan., v. 140 p.704-716dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245016500204300001600369520140200385592002801787650002601815650003001841650001101871650002101882650002001903650000901923650002101932650001201953650001101965650001501976650001901991650001602010651003302026651002002059773012502079856008202204852000902286655001202295IND60590230420221116160607.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059023042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-017-3455-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChessman, B.C.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4173-802310aDissolved-oxygen, current and temperature preferences of stream invertebrates estimated from field distributions: application to assemblage responses to drought  ap. 141-153.  aPreferences of stream invertebrate families in south-eastern Australia for dissolved oxygen (‘hydroaerophily’), current velocity (rheophily) and temperature (‘thermophily’) were estimated from occurrences in an extensive multi-year dataset covering New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and tested with another dataset covering the entire Murray–Darling Basin (MDB). As hypothesised, all three traits were strongly associated with long-term climate (annual precipitation and average temperature), whereas taxonomic richness had only weak associations with these climatic variables. Moreover, average hydroaerophily and rheophily of families in samples from the MDB decreased between 2004 and 2010 during the intense ‘Millennium Drought’, while average thermophily rose. These changes were reversed during 2010–2012 after the drought broke. Hydroaerophily, rheophily and thermophily were correlated with one another and with respiration mode, suggesting a trait syndrome related to adaptation to rhithron versus potamon and lentic environments. Hydroaerophily, rheophily and thermophily have the capacity to identify species that are vulnerable to future climatic warming and drying. These traits are also correlated with diet, indicating potential consequences for ecosystem processes of climate-related shifts in the composition of stream invertebrate assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3adiet 3adissolved oxygen 3adrought 3adrying 3aecosystems 3aglobal warming 3atemperature 3aAustralian Capital Territory 3aNew South Wales0 tHydrobiologia.g2018 Mar., v. 809, no. 1 p.141-153dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3455-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009300170300001400263520118600277592002801463650002701491650001001518650001701528650001901545650001501564651001701579653002501596653001901621653001701640653003001657653002001687700001901707773008901726856005101815852000901866655001201875IND50087731020221118234450.0140412e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008773102DNAL7 a10.2989/00306525.2013.7720792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLittle, Rob M.,10aPerceptions towards Egyptian Geese at the Steenberg Golf Estate, Cape Town, South Africa  ap. 85-87.  aThe number of Egyptian Geese Alopochen aegyptiaca has increased in the Western Cape province, South Africa, during the past few decades and they are allegedly perceived as a problem on golf courses. However, attitudes towards the geese on golf courses in the province have not been empirically assessed. We surveyed the residents and members of the Steenberg Golf Estate, Cape Town, during April 2012 to evaluate perceptions towards Egyptian Geese on the estate. A standardised, anonymous questionnaire was sent to 548 estate residents and non-resident golfing members. Of the 112 respondents, the majority (92, or 84%) considered that geese are a problem on the estate. The ranking of the perceived problem was: 16 (15%) minimal problem, 34 (33%) moderate problem and 54 (52%) severe problem. The majority also considered that the goose population should be reduced by 50% or more (90, or 86% of all respondents). Dealing with Egyptian Geese numbers and activities on golf courses is complex. The option of designing golf courses and adjacent vegetation so that they are attractive to local bird species, while simultaneously being less attractive to Egyptian Geese, is available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3ageese 3agolf courses 3aquestionnaires 3avegetation 3aSouth Africa 0aAlopochen aegyptiaca 0aEgyptian Goose 0agolf courses 0ahuman–wildlife conflict 0aproblem animals1 aSutton, Jess L0 tOstrich.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 84, no. 1 p.85-87dTaylor & Francis Groupx1727-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2013.772079  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009600158300001800254520157800272592002801850650001801878650001701896650002001913650003301933650001001966650001101976650001901987650002002006650001902026650001102045650001102056650002002067650003202087700002502119700002402144700002302168700002402191700002002215700001802235773012102253856007402374852000902448655001202457IND60641447720221122111032.0190505e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064144772DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26359c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeda, Yūko,10aReinforcing biofiller “Lignin” for high performance green natural rubber nanocomposites  ap. 5222-5231.  aHigh performance eco-friendly natural rubber biocomposites filled with 5, 10, 20, and 40 parts per one hundred rubber by weight (phr) of lignin were prepared from sodium lignosulfonate and natural rubber (NR) latex using the soft processing method. The formation of network-like lignin structures was detected around the rubber phases even when the amount of lignin was increased to 40 phr. The Payne effect clearly suggested the presence of filler–filler interaction of lignin in the biocomposites. The distinguishably superior reinforcement effects of lignin at different levels of content were clearly apparent in the biocomposites. Specifically, the tensile stresses of the biocomposites significantly increased with an increase in the lignin content. Under dynamic conditions, the biocomposites showed larger storage moduli and lower dissipative loss with low glass transition temperatures with increasing amount of lignin. The generation of crystallites by strain-induced crystallization (SIC) was evaluated by using quick time-resolved wide-angle X-ray diffraction/tensile measurements, and a stepwise SIC phenomenon was observed for the lignin-filled NR soft biocomposites. This is a first report on the organic filler filled NR nanocomposite. The lignin content did not significantly affect the generation of crystallites of the NR biocomposites. This characteristic could strongly influence the development of rubber science and technology. Sodium lignosulfonate will be applicable as a good reinforcing biofiller for the preparation of green NR nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocomposites 3acrystallites 3acrystallization 3aglass transition temperature 3alatex 3alignin 3alignin content 3alignosulfonates 3ananocomposites 3arubber 3asodium 3astorage modulus 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aPhakkeeree, Treethip1 aJunkong, Preeyanuch1 aYokohama, Hiroyuki1 aPhinyocheep, Pranee1 aKitano, Ritsuko1 aKato, Atsushi0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 17, v. 7, no. 9 p.5222-5231dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26359c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013200166300001500298520147800313592002801791650001501819650002001834650002601854650001601880650000901896650001401905650001701919650001101936650001801947650001301965651001401978700002001992700002102012700001902033773012402052856008202176852000902258655001202267IND60590230520221116160945.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059023052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-017-3451-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Dale10aSubfossil chironomid head capsules reveal assemblage differences in permanent and temporary wetlands of south-eastern Australia  ap. 91-110.  aSubfossil chironomid head capsules have been used extensively as proxies to characterise past environmental conditions of waterbodies. To date, their potential to distinguish between temporary and permanent waterbodies has not been determined. This study set out to assess if subfossil chironomid head capsules could be used to distinguish between temporary and permanent floodplain wetlands from the Ovens River, south-eastern Australia. Twenty-six taxa were collected in both wetland types: one taxon (Paracladopelma spp.) was found exclusively in permanent wetlands; and five taxa (Cladopelma spp., Cryptochironomus spp., Microchironomus spp., Microtendipes spp. and Cricotopus spp.) were found exclusively in temporary wetlands. The overall concentrations of chironomid head capsules were greater in permanent than temporary wetlands. Furthermore, eight taxa were found in significantly higher concentrations in permanent than temporary wetlands but, apart from the unique taxa, the concentrations of no other taxa were significantly greater in the temporary than permanent wetlands. The temporary and permanent wetlands had distinct chironomid assemblages, as evidenced by the abundance and presence/absence data. This study highlights the importance of heterogeneity in the environment to maintain chironomid diversity and suggests that chironomid subfossils have the potential to be useful in palaeoecological studies aiming to reconstruct past changes in hydrology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCricotopus 3aMicrochironomus 3aenvironmental factors 3afloodplains 3ahead 3aorganisms 3apaleoecology 3arivers 3asurface water 3awetlands 3aAustralia1 aHumphries, Paul1 aMcCasker, Nicole1 aNielsen, Daryl0 tHydrobiologia.g2018 Mar., v. 809, no. 1 p.91-110dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3451-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245015600160300001800316520161500334592002801949650001701977650001901994650002002013650001402033650002302047650001602070650003002086650001702116650001302133650001602146650001202162650001102174650001402185650001102199650002402210700002402234700001602258700001402274700005002288773013502338856008002473852000902553655001202562IND60685667120221117062105.0200305e20200213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068566712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b098562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Zan10aCritical Role of Interfacial Sites between Nickel and CeO₂ Support in Dry Reforming of Methane: Revisit of Reaction Mechanism and Origin of Stability  ap. 5118-5124.  aDry reforming of methane (DRM) is one of the effective catalytic routes to utilize methane and carbon dioxide molecules. The supported Ni catalysts on lanthanide oxides show remarkable reactivities and stabilities in DRM. However, it remains inconclusive regarding the mechanism and origin of stability of supported Ni catalysts. In this work, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to investigate the catalytic properties of CeO₂-supported Ni-based catalyst. The reactivities of several sites including metal, support, interface, and vacancy on support and interface are evaluated on the same footing for the activation of reactants, CH₄ and CO₂. The distinct features revealed from comparisons provide the decisive proof to identify the active sites in DRM. Moreover, the different routes leading to the formation of products of H₂ and CO are described. Besides CO₂ dissociation, CO is also possibly formed from the successive oxidation of CH*. The stability of catalysts is attributed to the facile elimination of cokes, which are mostly consumed by the interfacial oxygen. The calculations also indicate the inadequate description provided by the current accepted mechanism of supported Ni. Instead, an updated reaction mechanism is proposed, which is consistent with the experimental observations and underscores the importance of interface. The current work not only deepens the understanding of catalytic properties of supported Ni catalysts in DRM but also signifies the effectiveness of interface engineering for the improvement of catalytic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3ahydrogen 3alanthanides 3amethane 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3areaction mechanisms1 aOlanrele, Samson O.1 aSi, Chaowei1 aYang, Min1 aLi, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8895-20540 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 13, v. 124, no. 9 p.5118-5124dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b098563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03978naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002100147040001800168072000900186072000900195072000900204072000900213100001300222245012000235300001600355500002400371500001500395520205700410650002102467650002502488650003102513650001302544650001402557650002602571650001602597650003802613650002402651650002002675650001402695650001202709650002202721650004502743650001902788650003802807653002802845653002602873653001902899700001702918700001502935773012402950852000903074856008603083856011203169930003303281945002503314946001303339961001203352655001203364IND4365067220221119053554.0041019e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436506722DNAL7 a149948042pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-96.2.3772doi7 a10113/113322hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK001 0aF300 0aF2001 aChen, Z.10aVariation in budburst phenology of Douglas-fir related to western spruce budworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) fitness  ap. 377-387.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aVariation in budburst phenology among individual trees of interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca [Beissn.] Franco) may influence their susceptibility to western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis Freeman) defoliation. We tested the hypothesis that phenological asynchrony between Douglas-fir and the western spruce budworm is a mechanism of resistance using clones derived from parent trees that showed resistance versus susceptibility to C. occidentalis defoliation in the field. Susceptible clones had earlier budburst phenology compared with resistant clones when they were grown in a common greenhouse environment, demonstrating a genetic basis for parallel phenological differences exhibited by the parent trees. We tested the importance of phenological asynchrony as a factor influencing fitness of C. occidentalis using two different greenhouse bioassay experiments. One experiment compared western spruce budworm performance on equivalent phenological stages of susceptible and resistant clones by matching larval feeding to the columnar (fourth) bud development stage of each clone. Larvae reared on resistant clones had greater realized fitness (i.e., number of F1 offspring produced) than those reared on susceptible clones when the influence of variation in budburst phenology was minimized. In the other experiment, western spruce budworm larvae were placed on all trees on the same date when approximately = 50% of all terminal buds in the population were in the yellow (second) budburst stage. Larvae reared on susceptible clones had greater realized fitness than those reared on resistant clones when the influence of phenological asynchrony was expressed. Our results suggest that resistant phenotypes of Douglas-fir have negative effects on survival and reproduction of C. occidentalis under the natural conditions that insects and trees experience in the field. Genetic variation among trees in budburst phenology has an important influence on interactions between the western spruce budworm and Douglas-fir. 3aclonal variation 3aphytophagous insects 3aChoristoneura occidentalis 3abudbreak 3abioassays 3aresistance mechanisms 3adefoliation 3aPseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca 3ainsect reproduction 3apest resistance 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aMothsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Diseases 2aPseudotsugaxgrowth & development 0aphenological asynchrony 0aPseudotsuga menziesii 0ainsect fitness1 aClancy, K.M.1 aKolb, T.E.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2003 Apr., v.  96, no.  2 p.377-387dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-96.2.3773Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/113323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aINDdNZMe2004/11/10  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02799naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009800172300001600270500001900286520150700305592002801812596002001840650002101860650002701881650002701908650001101935650001901946650002401965650002201989650001602011653001802027653001902045700002002064700002502084700002602109700002702135773013302162856008502295852000902380655001202389IND60720221020221122070020.0201210e20200902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072022102DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2020.18435462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl kharraf, Sara10aTwo Extraction Methods of Essential Oils: Conventional and Non-conventional Hydrodistillation  ap. 870-889.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe traditional extraction of essential oils exposes plant material to high temperatures for hours, which may lead to the production of artifacts, even originating unpleasant odors and loss of quality. In addition, this procedure is energy-consuming, which makes it an expensive method. The present work has been focused on a method that combines hydrodistillation and subsequent extraction with water vapor and volatiles of essential oil in the same apparatus, that we called non-conventional hydrodistillation (NCH). Three aromatic plants were used: Rosmarinus officinalis leaves (X₁), Lavandula angustifolia flowers (X₂), and Citrus aurantium leaves (X₃). In the processes, the operating parameters as vegetal mass moisture, total sum vegetal mass used, and water flux rate have been fixed at 17 %, 100 g, and 0.97 L/h, respectively. The extraction process was made using mixture experimental design, taking into account the plants used (one plant, binary and ternary combinations); the position of the plants in the apparatus to study essential oils’ yields. The results showed that NCH of binary and ternary mixtures allows obtaining higher yields than expected with values superior to 2 % for the following combinations: X₁:X₂ (50:50), X₁:X₃ (50:50); X₁:X₂:X₃ (33:33:33) and X₁:X₂:X₃ (0.67: 0.16:0.16). The new NCH had a high kinetic coefficient k (2.98) and lower extraction time (70 min) than conventional hydrodistillation (CH), which means less energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data  aUIDB/05183/2020 3aCitrus aurantium 3aLavandula angustifolia 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aenergy 3aessential oils 3aexperimental design 3ahydrodistillation 3awater vapor 0akinetic study 0amixture design1 aFarah, Abdellah1 aMiguel, Maria Graça1 aEl-Guendouz, Soukaina1 aEl Hadrami, El Mestafa0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2020 Sept. 2, v. 23, no. 5 p.870-889dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2020.18435463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01584naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245005700171300001600228520042500244592002800669650002200697650002000719650002100739650001400760650001800774650002900792650002600821653002200847653001000869653000800879653003200887653001100919653001800930700002000948700001900968773010900987856008101096852000901177655001201186IND60591505320221120184417.0180905e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059150532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2015.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLüder, Carsten G.K.10aReleasing the Brake on IFN-γ Signaling on Infection  ap. 456-459.  aToxoplasma gondii effectively inhibits the responsiveness of its host cell to interferon gamma (IFN-γ).

We used data from systematic mist-netting of savanna birds in Nigeria, between 2001 and 2008, to estimate survival for 40 Afrotropical bird species. Best-supported models were those incorporating constant survival (27 of 40) or the effects of transience (13 of 40). Survival ranged from 0.269 to 0.948 (mean ± SE = 0.64 ± 0.02), varied within and between families, and showed a positive relationship with mass in passerines. Survival was highest in the insectivorous Malaconotidae (0.79 ± 0.13) and lowest in the granivorous Estrildinae (0.51 ± 0.04). This pattern was also evident in a comparison of survival between guilds (highest in insectivores and lowest in granivores) suggesting that these species encounter seasonal starvation risks or exhibit a seasonal response to water availability, i.e. emigration from the study area leading to reduced site fidelity and lower apparent survival. Our estimates of adult survival are higher than those previously obtained from this site, comparable with those from other Afrotropical studies (i.e. >0.60) and higher than those from temperate zones (0.53 ± 0.01, n = 79).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3aadults 3abirds 3ainsectivores 3alife history 3amodels 3aphilopatry 3arisk 3asavannas 3astarvation 3asurvival rate 3atemperate zones 3aNigeria 0asurvival 0atropical savanna species 0aWest Africa1 aOttosson, Ulf1 aMcGregor, Ross1 aBrandt, Miriam1 aCresswell, Will0 tOstrich.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 84, no. 1 p.11-25dTaylor & Francis Groupx1727-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2013.772544  aDNAL 7aarticle01312naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009300157300001800250520027500268592002800543650001600571650002300587650002300610650001500633650001700648700001900665700002400684700001400708700001900722700001700741773013300758856007400891852000900965655001200974IND60660759620221119005657.0190827e20141218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066075962DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07699k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lichan10aSignal-on electrochemiluminescent aptasensors based on target controlled permeable films  ap. 1035-1038.  aA novel permeability gate-based electrochemiluminescent (ECL) aptasensor has been constructed by utilizing target-responsive polyelectrolyte–aptamer film deposited on the solid-state ECL electrode to control the rate of diffusion of a coreactant that triggers the ECL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaptasensors 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aelectrodes 3apermeability1 aZeng, Xiaoting1 aFerhan, Abdul Rahim1 aChi, Yuwu1 aKim, Dong-Hwan1 aChen, Guonan0 tChemical communications.g2014 Dec. 18, v. 51, no. 6 p.1035-1038dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc07699k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010100163300001600264520142100280592002801701650000801729650001201737650001101749650002001760650000901780650002201789650001201811650002101823650003201844700002201876700002201898700001801920700002501938700003701963773013902000856007402139852000902213655001202222IND60678895920221119230252.0191218e20191217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067889592DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta07980g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHovish, Michael Q.10aCrystallization kinetics of rapid spray plasma processed multiple cation perovskites in open air  ap. 169-176.  aRapid Spray Plasma Processing (RSPP) is a high throughput, scalable, and open-air route toward manufacturing perovskite solar modules. The plasma exposure is dosed such that the perovskite precursor solution is cured in milliseconds using a combination of rapid heating, reactive species, and UV photons. We implemented in situ wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) to characterize the crystal growth in multiple cation, mixed halide perovskite thin films—Csₓ(MAzFA₁₋z)₁₋ₓPb(Br₀.₁₇I₀.₈₃)₃ for 0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.25—fabricated in open air. The use of synchrotron radiation and high detector speeds resolved the formation and dissolution of a transient intermediate crystalline phase during the tens of milliseconds when the perovskite crystallized. Increasing the mole fraction of cesium and methylammonium resulted in a decrease in the intermediate phase and an increase in the average grain diameter. Increasing the cesium fraction suppressed phase segregation, as observed in photoluminescence. Calculations showed the refractive index decreased and the extinction coefficient increased with cesium fraction. Based on the rapid crystallization kinetics, RSPP perovskite films exhibit residual stress values >5× lower than spin coated films. Understanding the kinetics of perovskite formation enables the design of perovskite films with improved thermomechanical and operational stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acations 3acesium 3acrystallization 3aheat 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotons 3arefractive index 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aRolston, Nicholas1 aBrüning, Karsten1 aHilt, Florian1 aTassone, Christopher1 aDauskardt, R.

The chemical compounds were analyzed by GC and GC/MS. The oil analysis resulted in the identification of 45 compounds representing 96.75% of the oil. Thymol (36.81 %) and ρ-cymene (30.90 %) were the main components of the oil. The oil was tested for in vitro antifungal activity against three phytopathogenic fungi included Drechslera spicifera, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceris and Macrophomina phaseolina by the agar dilution method. According to the results of the antifungal assay, the antifungal activity of the oil increased with rising in concentration. All of the tested concentrations of essential oil could completely inhibit fungal growth on 1600 μLL⁻¹. Although thyme oil on 800 μLL⁻¹ was not completely effective against the M. phaseolina, prevented from mycelia growth of other fungi, perfectly. In this study fungicidal activity only was observed on F. oxysporum and D. spicifera at higher concentrations than 800 μLL⁻¹. The antifungal activity of T. vulgaris essential oil probably due to the high concentration of oxygenated monoterpenes (thymol) and monoterpene hydrocarbons (ρ-cymene).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurvularia spicifera 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aThymus vulgaris 3aagar 3aantifungal properties 3achemical composition 3afungal growth 3ahydrodistillation 3amonoterpenoids 3amycelium 3aoils 3athyme oil 3athymol 3aIran 0acomposition 0aphytopathogenic fungi 0aρ-cymene1 aMehdizadeh, Leila0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2020 Sept. 2, v. 23, no. 5 p.1072-1083dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2020.18435473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014200168300001600310520128000326592002801606650001701634650000901651650002101660650001601681650001001697650004601707650002101753650001501774650000701789650002001796650005801816700001901874773011801893856008202011852000902093655001202102IND60590161620221123035310.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059016162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-018-3468-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalunke, Nishant10aStability Indicating LC-DAD Method for Determination of Nadifloxacin and Characterization of Its Degradation Products by LC–ESI–MS/MS  ap. 469-478.  aNadifloxacin, a second generation fluoroquinolone, is a topical antibiotic prescribed for acne vulgaris. For any drug, understanding the stability profile is of vital significance as it correlates with the safety and potency of the drug. In the present study, the degradation behaviour of nadifloxacin was studied under different forced degradation conditions. The drug was subjected to acidic, basic, neutral, thermal, photolytic and reduction degradation conditions to evaluate its intrinsic stability. The forced degradation study showed extensive degradation under acidic and reduction conditions, with the formation of nine degradants. A RP-HPLC gradient method was developed for the separation of nadifloxacin and its degradants on a Kromasil C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) HPLC column, using ammonium acetate pH 4.5 and acetonitrile as mobile phase. The developed HPLC method has been validated as per ICH guidelines for specificity, linearity, accuracy, LOD and LOQ, precision and robustness. LC–ESI–MS ⁿ helped in structural elucidation of degradants and a degradation pathway for nadifloxacin has been proposed. The developed HPLC method can thus be employed as stability indicating method for routine quality control analysis of the drug in bulk samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aacne 3aammonium acetate 3aantibiotics 3adrugs 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afluoroquinolones 3aguidelines 3apH 3aquality control 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography1 aPandita, Nancy0 tChromatographia.g2018 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.469-478dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-018-3468-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245016500210300001100375506007600386520129200462592002801754506003701782650002401819650001501843650001401858650002201872650001801894650001801912650001101930650001201941650001601953650001801969650001701987650001802004650002102022650002202043650001302065651001102078700002202089700001702111700002102128700002002149700001802169773010102187856008102288852000902369655001202378IND60440819720221207074257.0170721e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044081972DNAL7 a10.1186/s40529-014-0078-y2doi7 aPMC54328272pmcid7 a285109572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Tsung-Hsien10aAntioxidant, cell-protective, and anti-melanogenic activities of leaf extracts from wild bitter melon (Momordica charantia Linn. var. abbreviata Ser.) cultivars  ap. 78.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Several wild bitter melon (WBM; Momordica charantia Linn. var. abbreviata Ser.) cultivars were developed in Taiwan. However, little information is available regarding biological function of WBM leaf. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the nutrient content, antioxidant, cell protection and anti-melanogenic properties of wild bitter melon leaf. RESULTS: Methanolic leaf extracts were prepared from a variety and two cultivars of WBM. All extracts exerted potent nitric oxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacities. Furthermore, all extracts effectively reduce the production of reactive oxygen species and prevent cell death in UVB-irradiated HaCaT keratinocytes. The cell protective effect of leaf extract was also investigated by the prevention of HaCaT cells from sodium nitroprusside or menadione-induced toxicity, and significant cyto-protective activities were observed for all of them. Additionally, all extracts significantly suppressed tyrosinase activity and melanin levels in B16-F10 melanocytes. CONCLUSIONS: WBM leaf extract showed significant antioxidant, cyto-protective and anti-melanogenic activities. These findings suggested that WBM leaves may be beneficial for preventing the photo-oxidative damage and melanogenesis of skin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMomordica charantia 3acell death 3acultivars 3ahydroxyl radicals 3akeratinocytes 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amelanin 3amelanocytes 3amelanogenesis 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3anutrient content 3aprotective effect 3atoxicity 3aTaiwan1 aHuang, Ching-Jang1 aWu, Wen-Huey1 aHuang, Wen-Cheng1 aChyuan, Jong-Ho1 aTsai, Po-Jung0 tBotanical studies.g2014 Dec., v. 55, no. 1 p.78-78dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1999-31107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40529-014-0078-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012400162300001400286520212600300592002802426650001102454650002002465650002602485650000802511650002002519650001502539650001902554650002802573650002902601650000902630651001102639653003102650653000802681653002602689653004402715653002702759653003002786653003102816653004302847700001702890700002402907773009702931856008103028852000903109655001203118IND60545008520221118051919.0160901e20140205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054500852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Linlin12aA comparative study of different classification techniques for marine oil spill identification using RADARSAT-1 imagery  ap. 14-23.  aThe discrimination of oil spills and look-alike phenomena (e.g., low wind area, wind front area and natural slicks) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is a crucial task in marine oil spill detection. Many classification techniques can be employed for this purpose. In order to make the best use of the large variety of statistical and machine learning classification methods, it is necessary to assess their performance differences and make recommendations for classifier selection and improvement. The objective of this paper is to compare different classification techniques for oil-spill detection in RADARSAT-1 imagery. The data of this study consists of 15 features of 192 oil spills and look-alikes identified by Canadian Ice Service between 2004 and 2008 off Canada's east and west coastal areas. The studied classifiers include the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), tree-based ensemble classifiers (bagging, bundling and boosting), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Penalized Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA). Two performance measures, the specificity at fixed sensitivity (80%) and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), were estimated using cross-validation to evaluate the performance of classifiers at a high sensitivity. Overall, the bundling technique which achieved a median specificity of 90.7%, at sensitivity of 80%, significantly outperformed the second best (i.e. bagging) by 1.5 percentage points, and the worst (i.e. ANN) by 15 percentage points. The median values of AUC measure indicated consistent results. Bundling and bagging achieved comparable median AUC values of about 92%, followed by GAM and PLDA, with ANN yielding the smallest. Most classifiers (SVM, bundling and especially PLDA and ANN) performed significantly better on datasets pre-processed by log-transformation and standardization than on the original dataset. These results demonstrate the importance and benefit of selecting the optimal classifiers for oil spill classification, and configuring the classifiers by proper feature construction techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3aice 3aneural networks 3aoil spills 3aremote sensing 3asupport vector machines 3asynthetic aperture radar 3awind 3aCanada 0aMarine oil-spill detection 0aSAR 0aClassifier comparison 0aBootstrap-aggregated tree-based methods 0aSupport vector machine 0aArtificial neural network 0aGeneralized additive model 0aPenalized linear discriminant analysis1 aLi, Jonathan1 aBrenning, Alexander0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2014 Feb. 05, v. 141 p.14-23dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2013.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245005500161300001600216500002000232520134600252592002801598650001201626650001901638650001301657650001301670650001301683650002101696650002901717650001801746650000901764650002101773650001801794650002201812650001901834700002801853700003301881700002401914773012801938856007302066852000902139655001202148IND60587213620221120103709.0171215e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058721362DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.85252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos, Odirley R10aNitrogen release from urea with different coatings  ap. 775-780.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Coatings or urease inhibitors are designed to reduce losses of ammonia [NH₃₍g₎] from urea fertilizers. However, nitrogen (N) release and its effects on soil solution have not previously been evaluated under standardized conditions in soils. In this study, the urea fertilizers were incubated in chambers filled with sandy loam soil, adapted for the collection of NH₃₍g₎ and soil solution by centrifugation. RESULTS: In the fast‐release N fertilizers, around 93% and 100% of urea‐N applied was recovered within the first hours of incubation. In contrast, in the slow‐release N fertilizers, less than 40% of urea‐N applied, was recovered at 19 days of incubation. The maximum N release from the fertilizers followed the order: UP1 (106%) ≈ UNBPT (102%) ≈ urea (93%) > USP2 (57%) ≈ USP3 (57%) > USP4 (31%) ≈ USP5 (18%). NH₃₍g₎ volatilization accounted for only 3% of the applied N in the slow‐release fertilizers, which corresponded to about 88% less than the NH₃₍g₎ loss from prilled urea. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated distinct N release patterns, which changed the N dynamics in the soil. Some coatings effectively delayed urea release from granules and reduced NH₃₍g₎ gas losses, while other were not efficient. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acentrifugation 3acoatings 3agranules 3anitrogen 3asandy loam soils 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asoil solution 3aurea 3aurea fertilizers 3aurea nitrogen 3aurease inhibitors 3avolatilization1 aMattiello, Edson Marcio1 aCantarutti, Reinaldo Bertola1 aVergütz, Leonardus0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Jan., v. 98, no. 2 p.775-780dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.85253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01639naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245018700152300002000339520037300359592002800732650001400760650002300774650002300797650001800820650001400838650001700852650002800869650003000897700002000927700001300947700001800960700001800978700001800996700001901014773013701033856007401170852000901244655001201253IND60660759820221119005921.0190827e20141120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066075982DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07703b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Yu12aA highly efficient asymmetric synthesis of quaternary stereocenter-containing indolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids using aldehydes, nitroalkenes, and unactivated cyclic ketimines  ap. 15913-15915.  aA highly efficient approach for the construction of indolizidines and quinolizidines bearing a bridged quaternary stereocenter has been established in a one-pot fashion using aldehydes, nitroalkenes, and cyclic ketimines with excellent enantioselectivities and in high yields.

Studies in Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii in particular have revealed that these parasites are able to employ enzymes in non-traditional ways, while utilizing multiple anaplerotic routes into a canonical tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to satisfy their energy requirements. Importantly, some life stages of these parasites previously considered to be metabolically quiescent are, in fact, active and able to adapt their carbon source utilization to survive. We compare energy metabolism across the life cycle of malaria parasites and consider how this varies in other apicomplexans and related organisms, while discussing how this can be exploited for therapeutic intervention in these diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium 3aToxoplasma gondii 3acarbon 3aenergy metabolism 3aenergy requirements 3aenzymes 3amalaria 3aparasites 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0ametabolism 0aPlasmodium 0aToxoplasma 0amitochondrion 0aTCA cycle 0aApicomplexa1 aWaller, Ross F.1 aSoldati, Dominique,1 aMacPherson, Dougal A.1 aMacRae, James I.0 tTrends in parasitology.g2016 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.56-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:6336x1471-49227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2015.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005200151245014900203520143800352592002801790650002201818650001601840650001401856650001901870650001601889650001301905650001801918650001101936650001901947650001901966650002101985650002602006653001602032653001802048653001902066653001702085653000902102700001602111700001302127700001202140700001602152700005502168773011402223856008602337852000902423655001202432IND60685193220221119135923.0200503e20200705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068519322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1224142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7400-910210aAccelerated photoelectron transmission by carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrin for organic contaminants removal: An alternative to noble metal catalyst  aApplications of noble metal decorated photocatalytic nanomaterials are restricted by its high cost. In this study, carboxymethyl β-cyclodextrin (CM-β-CD), as an alternative to gold nanoparticle, was used to modified titanium dioxide (CM-β-CD-P25) to accelerate photoelectron transmission and enhance the organic contaminants removal from water. Several of emerging organic contaminants, such as bisphenol A (BPA), phenol and sulphanilamide (SA), were used to evaluate their photocatalytic activities. Carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin not only provide hydrophobic sites to entrap organic contaminants but also provide a “bridge” for accelerated transmission of photogenerated charges without introducing the recombination interface. Consequently, 91.6 % of BPA, 71.9 % of phenol and 97.1 % of SA could be removed by CM-β-CD-P25(2:1) under 1 h UV light irradiation. The photooxidation rate constant of BPA, phenol and SA by CM-β-CD-P25(2:1) were 0.039 min⁻¹, 0.021 min⁻¹ and 0.062 min⁻¹, respectively, which are much higher than that of pristine P25 and Au-P25. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of CM-β-CD-P25(2:1) remains almost unchanged in repeated cycle test owing to its high stability. The reasonable mechanism of CM-β-CD-P25 were investigated. CM-β-CD-P25 hybrid nanoparticles completely surpasses Au-P25 in organic contaminants removal, and shows great potential to replace noble metal as mediator.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abisphenol A 3acatalysts 3ahydrophobicity 3airradiation 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotooxidation 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 0aBisphenol A 0aSulfanilamide 0aPhotocatalysis 0aCyclodextrin 0aTiO21 aLiu, Qiming1 aLu, Jian1 aHe, Jie1 aLiu, Yongdi1 aZhou, Yanbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1756-70730 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 July 05, v. 393 p.122414-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1224143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245016600163520131200329592002801641650002201669650003501691650002701726650001201753650001101765650001501776650000901791650001701800650001101817650000901828650001401837650001901851650001201870650000901882700002801891700002201919773012001941856007502061852000902136655001202145IND60748448720221120195521.0210827e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074844872DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110824542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrąg-Kozak, Ewa 10aCadmium Accumulation and Depuration in the Muscle of Prussian Carp (Carassius gibelio Bloch) after Sub-Chronic Cadmium Exposure: Ameliorating Effect of Melatonin  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the bioaccumulation of cadmium in the muscle tissue of Prussian carp during 7 and 13 weeks of exposure to different concentrations of this metal in water (0.4 and 4.0 mg/L), and the depuration of cadmium from muscle during the following 6-week depuration period in the presence of melatonin implants. Furthermore, the relationship between cadmium accumulation and the levels of essential bioelements (copper, zinc, iron) in muscle was evaluated, as well as the bioconcentration factor of cadmium. Heavy metal concentration was determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. Cadmium accumulation in fish muscle increased with the duration of exposure. Cd concentrations exceeded the permissible levels for human consumption in groups exposed to the higher concentration of this metal. Moreover, a significant increase of Zn and Fe levels in the muscle was observed. In the fish that received melatonin implants and were exposed to Cd, its level in the muscle was significantly lower. The depuration of accumulated cadmium depended mainly on the duration of the elimination period. This is the first study to report that melatonin co-administration can effectively protect the fish from the accumulation of cadmium in muscle tissue and changes in trace metal levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius gibelio 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3acopper 3adepuration 3afish 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3airon 3amelatonin 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3azinc1 aŁuszczek-Trojnar, Ewa 1 aSocha, Magdalena 0 tAnimals.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110824543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015800171300001600329520140600345592002801751650003701779650002201816650001301838650002301851650001301874650001801887650003101905650001901936650001901955650001501974650001501989650001102004650002002015653002902035653003002064653002002094653003002114700002202144700002202166773013402188856008602322852000902408655001202417IND60552774020221122102955.0170607e20140220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055277402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeki, Daisuke10aPrevention of bacterial adhesion on polyamide reverse osmosis membranes via electrostatic interactions using a cationic phosphorylcholine polymer coating  ap. 171-176.  aA simple and easy anti-adhesive coating method against bacteria via electrostatic interaction was developed for polyamide reverse osmosis (RO) membranes using a cationic phosphorylcholine polymer. A commercial polyamide RO membrane was immersed into an aqueous solution of phosphorylcholine polymer containing cationic amino groups, poly[2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC)-co-2-aminoethylmethacrylate (AEMA)] (p(MPC-co-AEMA)). From the results of contact angle and surface potential measurements, the surface of the coated RO membrane became more hydrophilic than that of raw membranes and had a neutral charge. Conversely, the surface of an RO membrane immersed in an aqueous solution of MPC homopolymer without AEMA groups was not coated by the polymer. Therefore, p(MPC-co-AEMA) was adsorbed via electrostatic interaction between the cationic amino groups of AEMA and anionic carboxylic groups on the polyamide RO membrane. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the existence of phosphorylcholine groups from p(MPC-co-AEMA) on the coated membranes. The result of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring measurements showed that adsorbed p(MPC-co-AEMA) was hardly desorbed from the polyamide surface in a high ionic strength solution at least for one day. The coated RO membrane had high resistance to bacterial adhesion and retained its original rejection performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophilicity 3aionic strength 3amonitoring 3apolyamides 3aquartz 3areverse osmosis 0aReverse osmosis membrane 0aPhosphorylcholine polymer 0aAnti-biofouling 0aElectrostatic interaction1 aTanimoto, Tatsuya1 aMatsuyama, Hideto0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Feb. 20, v. 443 p.171-176dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012700167300001600294520138900310592002801699650001501727650001801742650003101760650001701791650001201808650001001820650001801830653001301848653002501861653001801886653001501904653001801919653001001937653001201947700002101959700003301980700002202013773014502035856008202180852000902262655001202271IND60124191920221123012309.0151024e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012419192DNAL7 a10.3161/150811013X6790802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodinho, Lisa N.14aThe Effect of Ectoparasites on the Grooming Behaviour of Gould's Wattled Bat (Chalinolobus Gouldii): An Experimental Study  ap. 463-472.  aGrooming is an important behaviour for the control of ectoparasites in mammals but it is also energetically costly. Therefore, the time an animal allocates to grooming may be used to evaluate the potential cost of an ectoparasite to its host. Most mammals are host to more than one ectoparasite species, which may impose different costs. We experimentally evaluated the relative cost of three ectoparasite species by observing the grooming response of their host, Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii), to the manipulation of parasite load. The parasite that spent its entire lifecycle on the host, the mite Spinturnix novaehollandiae, triggered the greatest increase in grooming. A grooming response was not as evident for the other parasites (a smaller mite, Trichonyssus womersleyi, and a bat fly, Basilia troughtoni), possibly because part of their lifecycle occurred in the roost, which the host may avoid by discriminative roost selection. Grooming behaviour, although not significantly altered by parasites other than S. novaehollandiae, was performed by most bats, which maintained a baseline grooming rate even when relatively parasite free. This study suggests heterogeneity in the costs imparted on a host by members of its ectoparasite community and the potential importance of considering parasite life-history when evaluating the influence of parasites on the host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aectoparasites 3agrooming (animal behavior) 3alife history 3amammals 3amites 3aparasite load 0agrooming 0aChalinolobus gouldii 0aectoparasites 0aSpinturnix 0aNycteribiidae 0amites 0abat fly1 aCripps, Jemma K.1 aCoulson, G.

Environmental consciousness has increased, and sustainability has become an important requirement for the management of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). The proper management of ELVs can bring improved sustainability performance for any society or organisation. There are several alternative options for ELVs management such as reuse, repair, reconditioning, remanufacturing and recycling. Environmental legislation is forcing original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to manage their products at the end of their life cycle to reduce their potential environmental impact. An appropriate selection model for sustainable ELV management alternatives in the dynamic, competitive and regulatory environment can enable a firm to satisfy economic, environmental, social and technological requirements. This study proposes an integrated model to select the dimensions and criteria for evaluating sustainable alternatives for the proper management of ELVs. First, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used to select the most important dimensions and criteria for sustainable alternative selection. Next, a hierarchy has been constructed to develop a systematic technique to solve the alternatives selection problem. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and extent analysis method on the fuzzy AHP (FEAHP) model have been used based on the hierarchy to evaluate the most suitable alternatives from the sustainability point of view. The strength of the proposed model is that it compares the results of both methods, the imprecision of experts’ opinions is considered in the evaluation process and the model is easy to use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aautomobiles 3aconsciousness 3adecision making 3aecology 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental protection 3aexperts 3aindustry 3amodels 3arecycling 3asociety 3asustainable development 0asustainability 0aenvironment 0aend-of-life vehicle 0aDEMATEL 0aAHP 0afuzzy extent analysis1 aAhmed, Shamsuddin1 aShumon, Md.

The data were collected with a resolution of 12.5 km during the satellite overflights at 02–04 UTC and 16–18 UTC and referenced to the height of 10 m. The quality of the data was carefully checked, and necessary adjustment was applied to remove the contaminated recordings. Wind speed and direction were compared with those registered on the islands of Kihnu and Ruhnu. It has been shown that allowing lenient filtering of rain-contaminated data derives larger wind speed estimates but increases considerably the quantity of data, allowing separate analysis of the northern and southern parts of the gulf. Wind speed in the northern part is slightly higher, the wind roses for the early morning measurements are similar, but those for the evening measurements show that in spring and summer, the most frequent winds in the southern part are northwesterly and in the northern part are westerly. Wind speed measured on the islands is less than that estimated from the satellite even in the case when rain contamination is removed through application of strict criteria. Wind roses measured at Kihnu are practically similar to those estimated from satellites for the northern part of the gulf in the evening but show some differences during the early morning. In winter, ground-based measurements show maximal frequency of southerly winds, and satellite measurements show southwesterly winds. In spring, the secondary maximum in the wind rose shows northwesterly winds in ground-based records and easterly winds in satellite measurements. Ground-based wind directions are well correlated with those measured by the satellite showing correlation coefficients of over 0.9. For wind speed, this quantity is somewhat lower, i.e. around 0.6.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa 3acorrelation 3aislands 3arain 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspring 3asummer 3awind direction 3awind speed 3awinter 3aBaltic Sea1 aKeevallik, Sirje0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 34, no. 16 p.5731-5747dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.796098  aDNAL 7aarticle03613naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008600165300001400251520191100265592002802176650001302204650002402217650001502241650002102256650002002277650001602297650001902313650001502332650001302347650002002360650001502380650001102395650002102406650001302427650001302440650002502453650001602478650001402494653000802508653000802516653000902524653000802533653000802541653000902549653000602558653000802564653000802572653000802580653000802588653001202596653003302608653001802641653002102659653001502680653001502695700002202710700002202732773010602754856008202860852000902942655001202951IND60567677820221118095256.0190403e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056767782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2017.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Mingwei10aAdaption of the AmaizeN model for nitrogen management in sweet corn (Zea mays L.)  ap. 27-38.  aProduction of irrigated sweet corn on sandy soils requires ample N inputs and results in substantial leaching of nitrate to groundwater. The irrigation infrastructure of this system provides the opportunity for fertilizer additions throughout the season, opening the prospect for adaptive, real-time and site-specific management that might synchronize N availability with crop demand, minimizing leaching. This requires validated process-based and mechanistic simulations of the crop N budget and soil N cycling. We adapted the AmaizeN model to sweet corn, validated the model for groundwater NO3-N leaching estimation on sandy soils, and assessed the potential of model application for adaptive, in-season N management in this cropping system. The model was calibrated and tested with a two-season dataset by comparing predicted and measured leaf area index (LAI), above ground biomass (AGB), yield, and cumulative crop N uptake (CNUP). The model prediction and measurement comparisons yielded high coefficients of determination (R2, 0.82–0.95) and low root-mean-square errors (RMSE, 6.0–9.5%) for the whole range of the target crop attributes across years and wide-ranging N treatments. The difference between simulated and measured groundwater NO3-N loadings from lysimeter experiments ranged from 2.1–19.8% as relative absolute errors in 2014, and 1.7–7.2% in 2015. The adaptive N management strategy was proposed and demonstrated in a moderate-N treatment using the model prediction for real-time soil N availability and crop N demand dynamics. This approach significantly enhanced crop productivity by approximately 40% compared to conventional practice, while reducing N fertilizer inputs and NO3-N loading by 30–48% and 27–52%, respectively, relative to the highest N input treatments. The adaptive strategy shows potential to achieve target crop yields while minimizing NO3-N leaching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aaboveground biomass 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3adata collection 3agroundwater 3ainfrastructure 3airrigation 3aleaching 3aleaf area index 3alysimeters 3amodels 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asandy soils 3asweetcorn 0aLAI 0aAGB 0aCNUP 0aRUE 0aPAR 0aFINT 0aK 0aSLN 0aPCU 0aCSA 0aPAN 0aDemNmax 0aAdaptive nitrogen management 0aAmaizeN model 0aNitrate leaching 0aSweet corn 0aSandy soil1 aRuark, Matthew D.1 aBland, William L.0 tField crops research.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 209 p.27-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013500163300001800298520110600316592002801422650001101450650001501461650001501476650001001491650001801501650001401519650002601533650002101559650001201580650001101592700002601603700002301629700001401652700002001666700002601686700001801712700001501730773013401745856007501879852000901954655001201963IND60538292920221120224616.0160815e20150708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053829292DNAL7 a10.1021/ie505035r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRollins, Derrick K.13aAn Extended Static and Dynamic Feedback–Feedforward Control Algorithm for Insulin Delivery in the Control of Blood Glucose Level  ap. 6734-6748.  aThe potential for successful automatic control of blood glucose concentration (BGC) has entered a new era because of recent technological advancements in insulin pumps and blood glucose sensors. However, a critical advancement necessary for full automation and long-term use is a control algorithm that can effectively maintain tight control of BGC under extreme variation of important disturbances such as activity, stress, and food consumption. Because feedforward control (FFC) models disturbances directly, it has the potential to eliminate the effects of disturbances completely. A Wiener-type feedforward control law is limited to the inclusion of only input (i.e., modeled disturbances and the manipulated variable) dynamics. Using a semicoupled modeling network that includes pseudo-blood insulin concentration, this work presents a more phenomenological FFC law that includes input dynamics, blood insulin and blood glucose dynamics, and blood glucose levels. Modeling results on 15 adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus for the proposed method are nearly identical to Wiener modeling results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3achemistry 3adrug delivery systems 3afood consumption 3ainsulin 3amodels1 aGoeddel, Christina

A method for rapid characterization of AAAs in serum was developed using ion mobility spectrometry coupled with mass spectrometry (IMS-MS). Five AAAs, containing four aristolochic acids and one aristolactam, were separated and identified within milliseconds. AAAs were separated in gas phase based on the difference of their ion mobility (K₀), and then identified based on their K₀ values, m/z, and product ions from MS/MS. Quantitative analysis of AAAs was performed using an internal standard with a satisfactory sensitivity. Limits of detection (signal-to-noise = 3) and quantification (signal-to-noise = 10) were 1–5 ng/mL and 3–8 ng/mL, respectively. The method was validated and successfully applied to the pharmacokinetics study of AAAs in rats, offering a promising way for fast screening and evaluation of AAAs in biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.16KG143cKey Projects subsidized by Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau  aNo. 21874153cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2462017BJB09cScience Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing 3aAristolochia 3aAsarum 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaristolochic acids 3ablood serum 3amass spectrometry 3anephrotoxins 3apharmacokinetics 3aquantitative analysis1 aHan, Yehua1 aDong, Chenglong1 aLi, Chen1 aLiang, Tuo1 aLing, Guannan1 aNie, Honggang0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 July, v. 413, no. 16 p.4247-4253dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03371-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014100170506010400311506007600415520147400491592002801965506003701993650002102030650001302051650001502064650002002079650002102099650002102120650002502141650001802166650001302184650001802197650002402215650001902239650002502258653001802283653003402301653002502335653002102360700002502381700002102406700001902427700001802446700001802464773011802482856008602600852000902686655001202695IND60717898820221207101613.0220421e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071789882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1115632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValkova, Tanya12aA method to estimate the direct nitrous oxide emissions of municipal wastewater treatment plants based on the degree of nitrogen removal  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N₂O) is produced in activated sludge tanks as a byproduct of nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification. Insufficient knowledge on how microbiological N₂O generation and degradation pathways impact N₂O emissions in activated sludge tanks still hampers the development of effective mitigation strategies. Our research contributes to overcome this gap by quantifying N₂O emissions through extensive measurement campaigns at ten full-scale wastewater treatment plants and correlating them to relevant operating parameters by multivariate regression analysis. Measurements revealed that N₂O production depends mainly on the activity of nitrifying bacteria and is triggered by high ammonium concentrations. In contrast, well-performing heterotrophic denitrification plays a key role as a sink of N₂O in activated sludge tanks. Following these patterns, low loaded plants achieving high nitrogen removal (83–92%) exhibited the lowest N₂O emission intensity (0.0012 ± 0.001 kg N₂O–N emitted per kg TKN in the influent wastewater). The regression analysis corroborated these results by revealing a negative linear correlation between the N₂O emission factor and the total nitrogen removal degree of the plants.

Mulching has become an important practice for maintaining soil moisture, reducing weed growth, mitigating soil erosion and improving soil temperatures in arid and semiarid areas. In northeast China, winter snow is heavy and spring drought frequently occurs, partially due to the loss of melted snow water by evaporation in spring. As such, this study assessed the use of plastic mulching in potato crops to minimize drought by accumulating and reserving water from winter snowfall. In field experiments conducted at two locations in the Heilongjiang Province, China (Keshan in 2011 and 2013, Heihe in 2011 and 2012), black and colorless transparent films were used as mulch during the thickest snow from late winter to early spring. The effects of plastic mulching on soil moisture content and temperature at various soil depths and its influence on potato growth and yield were evaluated. The results showed that film mulching increased the temperature and moisture content of the plow layer (0–10cm). Black film retained more solid snow than colorless film. The black and colorless films advanced potato emergence by 7 and 14days, respectively, compared with the control; higher temperatures under the colorless film resulted in earlier emergence than under the black film. The colorless and black film mulching increased soil water contents by 2.5 and 1.5 percentage points, respectively, compared with the control. Average tuber yield over the three-year study at both sites increased by 68.6% and 110.9% with black and colorless film, respectively, with yield increases more apparent in the year with spring drought. The effect of film mulching on yield mainly depended on differences in soil water content between mulching treatments and the control. Snow conserved by winter film mulching supplied water to the plow layer. Our results revealed that film mulching in winter significantly increases soil moisture content, ensures good stand establishment, and effectively solves a severe problem with spring drought in northeast China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplastic film mulches 3asoil temperature 3adrought 3asoil depth 3atubers 3acrop yield 3aevaporation 3afood security 3apotatoes 3afield experimentation 3awinter 3asoil water content 3asoil water 3awater content 3aweeds 3asnowmelt 3amulching 3asemiarid zones 3aspring 3asnow 3asoil erosion 3aChina 0aPotato 0aNortheast China 0aWinter snowfall 0aFilm mulching 0aSpring drought 0acrops1 aZhang, Yong1 aTian, Shiyan1 aEmon, Reza Mohammad1 aYang, Xingyong1 aYan, Hongrui1 aWu, Tingting1 aLu, Wencheng1 aSiddique, Kadambot H.M.1 aHan, Tianfu0 tField crops research.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 209 p.58-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013800160300001800298520204900316592002802365596004402393650002502437650003002462650001502492650001702507650004602524650002902570650001202599650002202611650001902633650001802652650001302670650002502683650002002708650001302728700002602741700002802767700002202795773014802817856008202965852000903047655001203056IND60742380920221116210058.0210624e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074238092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-021-03374-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Nan10aNon-aqueous electrophoresis integrated with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a thiol-ene polymer–based microchip device  ap. 4195-4205.  aNon-aqueous capillary electrophoresis (NACE) on microfluidic chips is still a comparatively little explored area, despite the inherent advantages of this technique and its application potential for, in particular, lipophilic compounds. A main reason is probably the fact that implementation of NACE on microchips largely precluded the use of polymeric substrate materials. Here, we report non-aqueous electrophoresis on a thiol-ene-based microfluidic chip coupled to mass spectrometry via an on-chip ESI interface. Microchips with an integrated ESI emitter were fabricated using a double-molding approach. The durability of thiol-ene, when exposed to different organic solvents, was investigated with respect to swelling and decomposition of the polymer. Thiol-ene exhibited good stability against organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, N-methylformamide, and formamide, which allows for a wide range of background electrolyte compositions. The integrated ESI emitter provided a stable spray with RSD% of the ESI signal ≤8%. Separation efficiency of the developed microchip electrophoresis system in different non-aqueous buffer solutions was tested with a mixture of several drugs of abuse. Ethanol- and methanol-based buffers provided comparable high theoretical plate numbers (≈ 6.6 × 10⁴–1.6 × 10⁵ m⁻¹) with ethanol exhibiting the best separation efficiency. Direct coupling of non-aqueous electrophoresis to mass spectrometry allowed for fast analysis of hydrophobic compounds in the range of 0.1–5 μg mL⁻¹ and 0.2–10 μg mL⁻¹ and very good sensitivities (LOD ≈ 0.06–0.28 μg mL⁻¹; LOQ ≈ 0.20–0.90 μg mL⁻¹). The novel combination of non-aqueous CE on a microfluidic thiol-ene device and ESI-MS provides a mass-producible and highly versatile system for the analysis of, in particular, lipophilic compounds in a wide range of organic solvents. This offers promising potential for future applications in forensic, clinical, and environmental analysis.

The present work aimed to microencapsulate VD₃ in complexes formed by Amaranth protein isolates (APIs) and lactoferrin (Lf). The encapsulation was conducted at pH 6.5 and a ratio of 1:3 (API:Lf, w/w) after confirming these complexes affinity with zeta potential and isothermal titration calorimetry analysis. The microcapsules showed a spherical morphology with sizes below 600 nm and high encapsulation efficiency (up to 90%). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data confirmed the encapsulation of VD₃. During simulated gastrointestinal digestion of the microcapsules, the highest percentage (70%) of VD₃ release was observed in the intestinal phase, with a high bioaccessibility (approximately 46%). Compared to unencapsulated VD₃, microencapsulation protected VD₃ from degradation under stress conditions (ultraviolet radiation and storage at room temperature) by a factor of up to three times. Furthermore, API: Lf heteroprotein complexes also protected (86%) VD₃ during a simulation of bread production. Microcapsules added to bread showed release profile kinetics of the first order when exposed to simulated intestinal fluid. These results suggest that VD₃ microcapsules formed as API: Lf complexes can be applied successfully for food fortification and baking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3abioavailability 3abreads 3acalorimetry 3acholecalciferol 3afood fortification 3ahuman health 3ahydrocolloids 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestinal secretions 3aintestines 3alactoferrin 3amicroencapsulation 3apH 3atitration 3aultraviolet radiation 3azeta potential 0aAmaranth protein isolate 0aLactoferrin 0aCholecalciferol 0aWhey protein 0aBaking1 aGarcia-Rojas, Edwin Elard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3388-84240 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Aug., v. 129 p.107636-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245016300180300001600343520110700359592002801466650001501494650002601509650002001535650001801555650001901573650002001592650002301612651001001635700002301645700002101668700002001689773012301709856008701832852000901919655001201928IND60084685120221119205855.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008468512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2011.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarvishzadeh, Roshanak10aMapping grassland leaf area index with airborne hyperspectral imagery: A comparison study of statistical approaches and inversion of radiative transfer models  ap. 894-906.  aStatistical and physical models have seldom been compared in studying grasslands. In this paper, both modeling approaches are investigated for mapping leaf area index (LAI) in a Mediterranean grassland (Majella National Park, Italy) using HyMap airborne hyperspectral images. We compared inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model with narrow band vegetation indices (NDVI-like and SAVI2-like) and partial least squares regression (PLS). To assess the performance of the investigated models, the normalized RMSE (nRMSE) and R² between in situ measurements of leaf area index and estimated parameter values are reported. The results of the study demonstrate that LAI can be estimated through PROSAIL inversion with accuracies comparable to those of statistical approaches (R²=0.89, nRMSE=0.22). The accuracy of the radiative transfer model inversion was further increased by using only a spectral subset of the data (R²=0.91, nRMSE=0.18). For the feature selection wavebands not well simulated by PROSAIL were sequentially discarded until all bands fulfilled the imposed accuracy requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasslands 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aleaf area index 3aleast squares 3anational parks 3aphysical models 3aradiative transfer 3aItaly1 aAtzberger, Clement1 aSkidmore, Andrew1 aSchlerf, Martin0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2011 Nov., v. 66, no. 6 p.894-906dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2011.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007500160300001800235520182700253592002802080650000802108650001102116650002502127650000902152650001502161650001902176650001102195650000902206700002202215700002202237700002002259700002102279773012002300856007302420852000902493655001202502IND60534193420170519000000.0160802e20140918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053419342DNAL7 a10.1021/ef501067b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinderholm, Carl10aUse of Low-Volatile Solid Fuels in a 100 kW Chemical-Looping Combustor  ap. 5942-5952.  aCarbon capture and storage (CCS) can be used to mitigate climate change. Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is an innovative carbon-capture technology with potential to drastically reduce the capture cost. In CLC, oxygen is transported from combustion air to fuel by means of metal-oxide particles, called oxygen carrier. This work presents findings from a 100 kW CLC reactor system, which is designed as interconnected fluidized beds. The 100 kW unit was operated with ilmenite as the oxygen carrier. Swedish wood char and Mexican petcoke, both having low volatile content, were used as fuel. High gas conversion was achieved with both fuels. The carbon capture efficiency was high with wood char, but not as high with petcoke. The duration of operation was 34.5 h with fuel, of which the majority, 31 h, was achieved with wood char. Oxygen demand was strongly correlated with the solids inventory in the fuel reactor, as has been observed in previous works. Using wood char as fuel, gas conversion was 90–95.3%, except during high fuel power, and carbon capture efficiency was 93–97%, except during high fuel power. The gas conversion should be compared to what has previously been observed in the 100 kW unit, where the highest gas conversion was 84%, using a bituminous coal. Furthermore, comparatively high solid fuel conversion was seen in many tests with wood char - the highest value was 89%. Using petcoke as fuel, high gas conversion was achieved even when employing very high fuel power, 148 kW. The highest gas conversion for petcoke was 89%. The carbon capture efficiency was, however, much lower than what has been observed with pulverized coal and wood char. In summary, this study shows that important improvements can be achieved regarding gas conversion in the 100 kW unit by using low-volatile fuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acoal 3acombustion 3afluidized beds 3aoxygen 3awood1 aSchmitz, Matthias1 aKnutsson, Pavleta1 aKällén, Malin1 aLyngfelt, Anders0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2014 Sept. 18, v. 28, no. 9 p.5942-5952dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ef501067b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04331naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009400171520285300265592002803118650000903146650002903155650002103184650002003205650001803225650001403243650001303257650002503270650002803295650001203323650000903335650001903344651002003363651002303383653001303406653001403419653001503433653000903448653001903457653001103476700002403487700002203511700001803533700001803551700001703569700001403586773011803600856008603718852000903804655001203813IND60717899120221121064038.0220421e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071789912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1115992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElrys, Ahmed S.14aThe food nitrogen footprint for African countries under fertilized and unfertilized farms  aAlthough nitrogen (N) is a limiting factor for food production (FP) in Africa, and African food security is seriously threatened by the phenomenon of soil N depletion, there is a dearth of information that shows the points to focus on throughout the chain of FP and food consumption (FC) in all African countries to minimize N loss while securing food N supply. Food N footprint (NF) is an indicator for tracing the losses of reactive N (Nr) with regard to the FP and FC chain. This is the first study to calculate the food NF for all African countries under fertilized and unfertilized farms, by calculating two sets of virtual N factors (VNFs; kg Nr released to the environment kg⁻¹ N in consumed product): one for unfertilized farms (the unfertilized scenario) and one for fertilized farms (the fertilized scenario). The fertilized and unfertilized VNFs were utilized to calculate a weighted average set of VNFs (the combined scenario). From the percentage of farms that utilize N fertilizer, and the N percentage in production that comes from soil depletion, the proportion used for the combined scenario was determined. Soil N depletion factors (SNDFs; kg N taken from the unfertilized soil kg⁻¹ N in food consumed) were also computed to identify the quantity of N extracted from the soil for food production. We have also provided the changes in N inputs, N outputs, and N use efficiency (NUE) for North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) during the last 57 years. The average total N input to croplands increased from 24 and 19 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in 1961–1965 to 100 and 42 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in 2010–2017 for North Africa and SSA, respectively. The NUE declined from 109% and 67% (1961–1965) to 47% and 63% (2010–2017) for North Africa and SSA, respectively. The total average per-capita food NF was 11 and 5.8 kg N cap⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in unfertilized farms; 21 and 14 kg N cap⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in fertilized farms; and 19 and 7.5 kg N cap⁻¹ yr⁻¹ under the combined scenario for North Africa and SSA, respectively. Vegetable-fruit and beef have the highest SDNFs in Africa. FP in Africa contributes approximately 70% of the total food NF. Therefore, if possible, the best way for Africans to reduce soil N depletion and N emissions is to encourage the production and consumption of livestock and crops products with less VNF and SNDF. However, African people do not have this luxury of choice because of poverty and ignorance. Therefore, African policy-makers must adopt integrated approaches that provide effective tools to control the production of animals and crops in conjunction with the improvement of NUE. Trying to completely change the African agricultural system is impossible, but strategies must be developed to reduce soil depletion in a gradual way, as well as a shift towards low-VNF foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3aenvironmental management 3afood consumption 3afood production 3afood security 3alivestock 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3apoverty 3asoil 3atotal nitrogen 3aNorthern Africa 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aNitrogen 0aFootprint 0aFertilizer 0aFood 0aSoil depletion 0aAfrica1 aDesoky, El-Sayed M.1 aAlnaimy, Manal A.1 aZhang, Huimin1 aZhang, Jin-bo1 aCai, Zu-cong1 aCheng, Yi0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 279 p.111599-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1115993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04180naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013100177300001600308520214900324592002802473650002102501650004402522650002202566650002702588650001902615650002202634650001502656650001502671650002902686650002202715650001202737650001302749650002002762650003802782650001502820650003702835650001302872650001202885650002102897650001902918650003702937650001602974650000702990650002502997650001603022650003303038650001603071650002103087650003703108650002003145650002303165653002203188653001803210653001203228653001903240653002803259700002303287773011303310856008603423852000903509655001203518IND60634078720221117032215.0191214e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063407872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.03.1612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddiqui, Sharf Ilahi10aNanohybrid composite Fe2O3-ZrO2/BC for inhibiting the growth of bacteria and adsorptive removal of arsenic and dyes from water  ap. 849-868.  aThe aim of the present study was to make effort to provide sustainable and affordable water purification technique for complete cleaning of polluted water. For this purpose, an economical organic-inorganic advance nanohybrid composite, binary iron-zirconium oxide decorated Black cumin seed, was prepared by following one step co-precipitation method. The prepared composite was used for inhibition of growth of bacterial cells, and remediation of arsenic, and dyes, from water. The nanohybrid composite was characterized by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry etc. techniques. The composite has shown excellent antimicrobial activity towards Gram-negative bacteria strain, Escherichia coli, with 25 mm diameter of zone inhibition, and 0.030 mgmL−1 minimum inhibitory concentration. The nanohybrid composite was investigated, in batch mode, for adsorption of arsenic and Methylene blue, from their aqueous solutions. The process was studied under the influence of adsorbent dosage, initial concentration, pH of solutions, contact time, and temperature. The Langmuir adsorption capacity of nanohybrid composite, for arsenic and Methylene blue, was found to be 1.01 and 38.10 mgg−1, respectively. The enthalpy, entropy, and free energy changes, of the adsorption process, were found to be 0.20 kJmol-1, -0.106 kJmol−1K−1 and −7.147 kJmol−1, respectively, for arsenic; and 0.065 kJmol−1, −0.00023 kJmol−1K−1, and −0.66 kJmol−1, respectively, for Methylene blue, therefore, the adsorption of both arsenic and Methylene blue were spontaneous and endothermic. The processes followed pseudo-second order kinetics which indicated specific electrostatic and hydrogen bonding between nanohybrid composite and arsenic, and Methylene blue. Therefore, antimicrobial nanohybrid composite can be an affordable, sustainable material for the complete water purification, a material which is most sought-after in the current scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGibbs free energy 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aNigella sativa 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aantimicrobial properties 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenic 3acleaning 3acoprecipitation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aendothermy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3ahydrogen bonding 3amethylene blue 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ananohybrids 3apH 3apurification methods 3aremediation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater pollution 3awater purification 0aBlack cumin seeds 0aFe2O3-ZrO2/BC 0aArsenic 0aMethylene blue 0aAntibacterial composite1 aChaudhry, Saif Ali0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 June 20, v. 223 p.849-868dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.03.1613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245011500211520170400326592002802030650001102058650001502069650001102084650001202095650001602107650001802123650001902141650001802160650001102178650001502189650001802204650001202222650002002234650000902254650002002263650001802283650001502301653002302316653002302339653003302362653001302395700001702408700006402425700006402489700001802553700005902571773010202630856008602732852000902818655001202827IND60769434120221119192147.0220509e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076943412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPutri, Novita I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2803-730210aFunctionalization of pectin-depleted residue from different citrus by-products by high pressure homogenization  aIn the valorisation of fruit and vegetable by-products by high pressure homogenization (HPH) into texturizing ingredients, the source of the by-product is an important determining factor. This study aims to demonstrate the valorisation potential of citrus residues after acidic pectin extraction (AR) and to investigate differences between citrus species (lemon, orange, grapefruit) and fruit parts (peel and pulp) as the source of the residues. Based on the results, pectin extraction is favourable in improving the storage modulus (G′) of the residue. However, residual pectin content in the different ARs, as indicated by pectic monosaccharides (e.g., GalA, Rha, Fuc), did not correlate to G′ after HPH. The G′ of all ARs suspensions, regardless of the source, improved significantly after HPH at 20 MPa. After HPH, fragmentation and subsequently aggregation of particles were observed from the particle size reduction and microscopy visualization. Particle morphology and size did not correlate with the G′ of the suspensions. Residual pectin's Rhamnogalacturonan-I contribution and degree of methyl-esterification, protein content, and glucose content related to hemicellulose were correlated to the G′ of the suspensions before HPH. However, after HPH, no correlation was found between G′ and these characteristics, likely due to changes on the structure of the particles. The results highlight the high potential of all the citrus ARs from the different sources to be functionalized as texturizing ingredients. However, the peel AR from grapefruit and lemon exhibited better rheological properties and may be considered as better sources compared to the other citrus by-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3abyproducts 3afruits 3aglucose 3agrapefruits 3ahemicellulose 3ahomogenization 3ahydrocolloids 3alemons 3amicroscopy 3aparticle size 3apectins 3aprotein content 3apulp 3astorage modulus 3atexturization 3avegetables 0aCitrus by-products 0aCell wall material 0aHigh pressure homogenization 0aRheology1 aCelus, Miete1 aVan Audenhove, Jelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1368-31411 aNanseera, Raymond P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2793-48851 aVan Loey, Ann1 aHendrickx, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3823-08510 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Aug., v. 129 p.107638-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010400172300001800276520208200294592002802376650001702404650001502421650001602436650002302452650001402475650001002489650001102499650001802510650002402528650001902552650001102571650002302582650001702605700002502622700002002647700001702667700001702684700001702701700001802718773010502736856008602841852000902927655001202936IND60578207220180731000000.0170812e20160628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057820722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b007372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourgeat-Lami, E.10aSynthesis of Polymer/Silica Hybrid Latexes by Surfactant-Free RAFT-Mediated Emulsion Polymerization  ap. 4431-4440.  aThe reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization technique was used to synthesize random copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate) (PEGA) and n-butyl acrylate (BA) and terpolymers of acrylic acid (AA), PEGA and BA with a trithiocarbonate reactive end-group. These macromolecular RAFT agents (macro-RAFTs) were subsequently adsorbed at the surface of size-monodisperse colloidal silica particles with diameters varying between 40 and 450 nm. Adsorption isotherms for both macro-RAFTs could be well fitted to the Langmuir adsorption model, the AA-based macro-RAFT agent showing however a lower maximum adsorption. The adsorbed macro-RAFT agents were subsequently chain extended with a mixture of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and BA by starved feed emulsion polymerization. Cryo-TEM analysis of the resulting hybrid latexes synthesized in the presence of the P(AA-co-PEGA-co-BA) terpolymers resulted in multipod-like particles while the P(PEGA-co-BA) copolymers showed the formation of individually and multiencapsulated silica particles depending on the silica particle size. Decreasing the total silica surface area available by decreasing the silica concentration or by increasing the silica particle size resulted in limited coagulation of the latex particles due to a less efficient use of the free nonadsorbing macro-RAFT agent. The feeding process also had a strong impact on particle morphology, and snowman-like particles could be successfully achieved under batch conditions. The use of commercial silica particles instead of homemade silica led to armored latexes illustrating the determinant role of the surface properties of the macro-RAFT-coated inorganic particles in controlling hybrid particle morphology. At last, core–shell particles with a rigid silica core and a soft copolymer shell were obtained for the first time by polymerizing a film-forming monomer mixture showing the high potential of the P(PEGA-co-BA) macro-RAFT agent for the elaboration of polymer-encapsulated silica particles for coating applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3aadsorption 3acoagulation 3acomposite polymers 3aemulsions 3alatex 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3asilica 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area1 aFrança, A.

Meyer) is a largely sought after resource due to its substantial health benefits. However, large-scale culture of ginseng seeds is limited because of its long maturation time and triple-dormancy. To develop new strategies to improve the dehiscence, germination, and breaking dormancy, we investigated the effects of stratification, gibberellin (GA₃), and/or kinetin treatments on the dehiscence, development and germination of P. ginseng. Indehiscent seeds for the dehiscence test and dehiscent seeds for the germination test were immersed in a solution containing 288.7 μM GA₃ and/or 232.3 μM kinetin for 24 h, respectively, at 25 °C. After dehiscence, a cold stratification experiment was conducted at 2 °C for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 days in the dark. Exogenous GA₃ and kinetin treatments significantly improved the dehiscence rate. In addition, both plant growth regulators (PGRs) appeared to enhance the zygotic embryo development of ginseng seeds. GA₃ on its own had a slight effect on breaking dormancy and germination, but the effect was not sufficient to serve as a complete substitute for the cold stratification requirement due to the deep physiological dormancy characteristic of P. ginseng. Kinetin treatment had a significant effect on germination and breaking dormancy, although a short period of cold stratification was also required. The combination of GA₃ and kinetin treatments was more effective at enhancing both seed dehiscence and germination than either PGR treatment alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3adehiscence 3adormancy 3adormancy breaking 3aembryogenesis 3agermination 3agibberellic acid 3akinetin 3aseeds1 aJo, Ick-Hyun1 aKim, Jang-Uk1 aHong, Chi-Eun1 aKim, Young-Chang1 aKim, Dong-Hwi1 aPark, Young-Doo0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2018 June, v. 59, no. 3 p.293-301dSpringer SingaporewJournal:21607x2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-018-0039-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012500173300001600298520139300314592002801707650006701735650002201802650001101824650001301835650001001848650001501858650001101873650001901884650002301903650002501926651001801951700001801969700002601987773012302013856008702136852000902223655001202232IND60084685420221119205947.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008468542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2011.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieczonka, Tino10aGeneration and evaluation of multitemporal digital terrain models of the Mt. Everest area from different optical sensors  ap. 927-940.  aMultitemporal digital terrain models (DTM) are an important source for many purposes such as the detection of areas, which are susceptible to natural hazards such as landslides and glacial lake outburst floods, or for the examination of changes in glacier thickness. To exploit the potential of stereo satellite and aerial imagery for time series analysis, the employed methodology and software can be critical. A statistical analysis based on quartiles is presented to eliminate the influence of registration and elevation errors in DTMs. For our analysis, we used multi-temporal airborne and spaceborne stereoscopic images. The oldest images were recorded in the 1960s by the US American reconnaissance satellite Corona, while the most recent imagery are 2007 Cartosat-1 stereo scenes, along with one ASTER stereo pair. Complex panoramic distortion and limited spatial resolution resulted in the Corona and ASTER DTMs having the highest RMSEz. Due to differing acquisition techniques, applied software packages and temporal differences DTMs will never be identical. Therefore, we propose a relative vertical accuracy assessment with a master DTM. We chose the Cartosat-1 DTM as it showed the highest absolute accuracy. Inaccuracies between the master and the slave DTMs were adjusted by means of trend surfaces and outliers were successfully eliminated applying the interquartile range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3acomputer software 3afloods 3aglaciers 3alakes 3alandslides 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3aUnited States1 aBolch, Tobias1 aBuchroithner, Manfred0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2011 Nov., v. 66, no. 6 p.927-940dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2011.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245009300180520176900273592002802042650001302070650001702083650001502100650001402115650001602129650001602145650001702161650001802178650001702196650002002213650001302233650002102246650001702267650002302284650002902307650002302336650001302359650001402372650002302386650001302409650002602422650001202448651001402460653002302474653001502497653001802512653001302530653002502543700001502568700002002583700002402603700002602627700005902653700001902712773011802731856008602849852000902935655001202944IND60717899320221121064109.0220421e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071789932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1116082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarrochi, María Natalia10aLand-use impacts on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in pampean streams (Argentina)  aIn recent decades agriculture has intensified in the Argentine Pampa, and pesticide application has also increased. Livestock fields, although being progressively replaced by crops, are still commonly interspersed with crop fields. The objective of the present work is to assess the effects of land use on the benthic invertebrate assemblages of streams in the main Argentine agricultural region. Two areas were sampled during the 2011/12 growing season (November–March): Arrecifes, a homogeneous intensively cultivated area, and La Plata, a heterogeneous area of mixed livestock pasture, cropland and biological reserve. Nutrient concentrations in water were significantly higher in the streams surrounded by cropland. Measured pesticides in stream sediments were those most commonly used in crop production: chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, endosulfan and its degradation product endosulfan sulfate. Detection frequency and pesticide concentrations were generally higher in streams surrounded by cropland than in streams surrounded by pasture or reserve. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were significantly different in streams with different land uses. Palaemonidae (Decapoda) and Caenidae (Ephemeroptera) were the taxa best represented in the reserve. Hyalellidae (Amphipoda) and Hirudinea were dominant at the streams surrounded by livestock fields. Within the streams surrounded by croplands, Oligochaeta and Hirudinea were best represented in La Plata while Chironomidae, Gastropoda and Oligochaeta were dominant at Arrecifes. Present evidence suggests that agrochemical applications contribute, in combination with other environmental variables, to the observed differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages in streams of different land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenidae 3aChironomidae 3aGastropoda 3aHirudinea 3aHyalellidae 3aOligochaeta 3aPalaemonidae 3aagrochemicals 3achlorpyrifos 3acrop production 3acropland 3acultivation area 3acypermethrin 3aendosulfan sulfate 3aenvironmental management 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3aland use 3alivestock 3amacroinvertebrates 3apastures 3apesticide application 3astreams 3aArgentina 0aMacroinvertebrates 0aPesticides 0aEcotoxicology 0aLand use 0aStream bioassessment1 aHunt, Lisa1 aSolís, Marina,1 aScalise, Ana María1 aFanelli, Silvia Laura1 aBonetto, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0843-15291 aMugni, Hernán0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 279 p.111608-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1116083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015800169520179800327592002802125650001502153650001602168650001102184650001702195650001602212650001802228650001902246650001102265650001102276650000702287650001502294650001902309650002002328653002102348653001002369653001602379653001002395653002702405653001902432700006302451700001702514700005702531700001702588700005702605700005702662700001702719700005702736773010202793856008602895852000902981655001202990IND60769434320221119192158.0220509e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076943432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Mehraj10aMapping of β-lactoglobulin − mucin interactions in an in vitro astringency model: Phase compatibility, adsorption mechanism and thermodynamic analysis  aThis study investigates the astringency-related interfacial behaviour, mechanistic parameters, and interaction mechanisms of a typical milk protein, β-lactoglobulin (β-LG), with mucin acting as model salivary protein. For a series of β-LG – mucin compositions, the most intense phase separation is observed for a 75:25 w/w mixture of mucin and β-LG at pH 3. QCM-D shows that, at pH 3, β-LG adsorption on a mucinous interface yields a heavily-hydrated viscoelastic layer with increased energy dissipation [ΔD ≤ 9.92 ± 0.01 (× 10⁻⁶], thickness (Δt = 25.51 ± 0.01 nm), and wet mass values (Δm = 2623.30 ± 1.27 ng cm⁻²). At pH 7, β-LG (Δm = 855.86 ± 0.45 ng cm⁻²) forms highly-ordered (more rigid), relatively less dissipative, but thinner interfacial layer, as indicated by the decreased Δt (7.13 ± 0.01 nm) and ΔD values [≤ 2.52 ± 0.01 (× 10⁻⁶)]. Furthermore, ΔD vs.Δf plots point to the existence of greater conformational and molecular reordering upon progressive coupling of β-LG at pH 3, as compared to pH 7. β-LG exhibits a two-step binding with mucin at pH 3; whilst a single-step (low affinity) mechanism exists at pH 7, as elucidated by fluorimetry. Thermodynamic analysis suggests two macromolecular populations interact spontaneously (ΔG < 0) regardless of pH. Interestingly, ΔS values are substantially greater at pH 3 (≥182.76–292.30 J K⁻¹M⁻¹), in comparison with pH 7 (≤17.07 J K⁻¹M⁻¹); suggesting that entropy-driven flocculation of β-LG and mucin arise from well-defined electrostatic and/or hydrophobic forces. The above results highlight the inherent complexity of pH-induced β-LG – mucin interactions, and the resulting complexity of the physicochemical basis of astringency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aastringency 3aenergy 3aflocculation 3afluorometry 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amucins 3apH 3aseparation 3athermodynamics 3aviscoelasticity 0aβ-Lactoglobulin 0aMucin 0aAstringency 0aQCM-D 0aMolecular interactions 0aThermodynamics1 aRitzoulis, Christos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9074-99791 aBushra, Rani1 aMeigui, Huang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1984-87251 aZhang, Xinyu1 aChen, Jianshe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7000-14691 aSong, Junlong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5271-81401 aJin, Yongcan1 aXiao, Huining1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3500-23080 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Aug., v. 129 p.107640-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012200171520140200293592002801695650001201723650001901735650001101754650001101765650002901776650002201805650001001827650001401837650001801851650002101869650002801890650001001918651001001928653004201938653002101980653002602001653002902027700002102056773011802077856008602195852000902281655001202290IND60717899420221121121832.0220421e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071789942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1116092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dongyang14aThe causal effect on firm performance of China's financing–pollution emission reduction policy: Firm-level evidence  aThe relationship between pollution emissions and economic development matters greatly to sustainable growth goals. China has experienced rapid growth in pollution emissions, energy consumption, and the effects of climate change. To achieve pollution reduction and energy savings targets, China's green loan policy implements a financing–pollution emissions reduction strategy for Chinese firms. Employing a difference-in-difference estimation method, we use Jiangsu Province manufacturing firm data for the period 2005 to 2013 to evaluate the effect of financing–pollution emission reduction policy tools on firm performance. Our analysis yields the following results. First, the financing–emission reduction policy has a “punishment” effect on highly polluting firm performance, including total factor productivity, profitability, and sales growth. Second, we find that these negative effects are weakened in dynamic processes. Further, pollution emissions are significantly reduced. Third, financial constraints act as the mechanism through which firm performance is punished, via the financial–emission reduction policy. Short-term and long-term bank financing decrease, while working capital and trade credit are increased to finance investment. Finally, with regard to ownership structure, state-owned firm performance is more likely to be penalized than other forms of ownership.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aclimate change 3acredit 3aenergy 3aenvironmental management 3aissues and policy 3aloans 3apollution 3aprofitability 3apublic ownership 3asustainable development 3atrade 3aChina 0aFinancial–emission reduction policy 0aFirm performance 0aFinancial constraints 0aDifference-in-difference1 aVigne, Samuel A.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 279 p.111609-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1116093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245007300200300001600273500001100289506007600300520071900376592002801095506003701123650001801160650001001178650002601188650001701214650000901231650001101240650001301251650003001264650001101294700002401305700001801329700001901347700002101366773011501387856007401502852000901576655001201585IND60627950420221207050457.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062795042DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.145222doi7 aPMC65839012pmcid7 a298028072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKroeger, Heike10aER stress and unfolded protein response in ocular health and disease  ap. 399-412.  aREVIEW  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe human eye is the organ that is able to react to light in order to provide sharp three‐dimensional and colored images.

A small peptide (P1), contains a specific sequence (Pro-Gly) and a terminal cysteine, was synthetized and immobilized to the surface of QCM electrode via the reaction between Au and thiol of the cysteine. The peptide bond between proline and glycine can be specific hydrolyzed cleavage by type IV collagenase, which enabled the modified electrode with a high selectivity toward type IV collagenase. The cleaving process caused a frequency change of QCM to give a signal related to the concentration of type IV collagenase. The morphologies of the modified electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the specific hydrolyzed cleavage process was monitored by QCM. When P1 was modified with gold nanoparticles (P1-Au NPs), the signal could be amplified to further enhance the sensitivity of the designed sensor due to the high-mass of the modified Au NPs. Compared the direct unamplified assay, the values obtained for the limit of detection for type IV collagenase was 0.96 ng mL⁻¹, yielding about 6.5 times of magnitude improvement in sensitivity. This signal enhanced peptide based QCM biosensor for type IV collagenase also showed good selectivity and sensitivity in complex matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acollagenase 3acysteine 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahydrolysis 3ananogold 3aproline 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athiols 0aType IV collagenase 0aQCM biosensor 0aPeptide 0aSignal amplification1 aJin, Xin1 aZhao, Guang-Chao0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 May 30, v. 106 p.111-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.01.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013300163300001800296520152500314592002801839650002601867650001701893650003101910650002101941650002401962650001901986650001302005650001102018650000702029650002402036650002002060700001602080700001302096700001402109700001702123773010502140856008602245852000902331655001202340IND60578207520221120040631.0170812e20160628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057820752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b007462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Hao10aAssembly and Reassembly of Polyelectrolyte Complex Formed by Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(glutamate sodium) and S5R4 Peptide  ap. 4627-4633.  aThe structure and stability of polyelectrolyte complex are controlled not only by electrostatic interaction but also by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction if they are present. The complexes formed by such multiple interactions should exhibit different responses to the environmental changes, such as ionic strength and pH. In this work, we designed a positively charged peptide S₅R₄, which can interact with poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(glutamate sodium) (PEG₁₁₄-PGlu₆₄) via electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interaction. In deionized water at pH 7.1, the complexes formed by PEG₁₁₄-PGlu₆₄ and S₅R₄ assemble into wormlike micelles, spheres, and even hierarchical “wool balls”, depending on mixing ratio. However, a distinct dissociation–reassembly process is observed when 30 mM NaCl is added to screen the electrostatic interaction. The spheres transform into loose clusters after reassembly. This process is caused by the switch of driving force from electrostatic interaction to hydrogen bonding. Similarly, when the driving force is switched from electrostatic interaction to hydrophobic interaction by increasing solution pH to above 8.7, the original structure quickly dissociates and reassembles into dense aggregates. The rich structures formed by polyelectrolyte complexes and their drastic and sensitive responses to environmental changes are helpful to understand the working mechanism of biomolecules regulated by pH or ion strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aionic strength 3amicelles 3amixing 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3asodium chloride1 aZhou, Jihan1 aPan, Wei1 aLi, Zhibo1 aLiang, Dehai0 tMacromolecules.g2016 June 28, v. 49, no. 12 p.4627-4633dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b007463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245017500213300001600388506007600404520132400480592002801804506003701832650002901869650002401898650002601922650002001948650001001968650002501978650001402003653000902017653000902026653000802035653000702043653000902050653000702059653000702066653000802073653002602081653002902107653002402136653002502160700001902185700001402204700003002218700002902248700002302277700002402300700001902324700002002343700002202363700002302385700002102408700002202429773011502451856008502566852000902651655001202660IND60543844620221207065422.0190412e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054384462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.12.0022doi7 aPMC54593762pmcid7 a254897522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Theresa J.10aGenomic sequences of six botulinum neurotoxin-producing strains representing three clostridial species illustrate the mobility and diversity of botulinum neurotoxin genes  ap. 102-113.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe whole genomes for six botulinum neurotoxin-producing clostridial strains were sequenced to provide references for under-represented toxin types, bivalent strains or unusual toxin complexes associated with a bont gene. The strains include three Clostridium botulinum Group I strains (CDC 297, CDC 1436, and Prevot 594), a Group II C. botulinum strain (Eklund 202F), a Group IV Clostridium argentinense strain (CDC 2741), and a Group V Clostridium baratii strain (Sullivan). Comparisons of the Group I genomic sequences revealed close relationships and conservation of toxin gene locations with previously published Group I C. botulinum genomes. The bont/F6 gene of strain Eklund 202F was determined to be a chimeric toxin gene composed of bont/F1 and bont/F2. The serotype G strain CDC 2741 remained unfinished in 20 contigs with the bont/G located within a 1.15Mb contig, indicating a possible chromosomal location for this toxin gene. Within the genome of C. baratii Sullivan strain, direct repeats of IS1182 insertion sequence (IS) elements were identified flanking the bont/F7 toxin complex that may be the mechanism of bont insertion into C. baratii. Highlights of the six strains are described and release of their genomic sequences will allow further study of unusual neurotoxin-producing clostridial strains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium argentinense 3aClostridium baratii 3aClostridium botulinum 3abotulinum toxin 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aserotypes 0aBoNT 0abont 0aorf 0aHA 0aNTNH 0akb 0abp 0aSNP 0aClostridium botulinum 0aClostridium argentinense 0aClostridium baratii 0aBotulinum neurotoxin1 aHill, Karen K.1 aXie, Gary1 aFoley, B.

Furthermore, few methods are available to proactively identify potential risk areas for preventing soil contamination. In this study, we selected 13 environmental factors related to the accumulation of soil heavy metals based on the source-sink theory. Then, the fuzzy k-means method in combination with the random forest (RF) method was used to classify potential risk areas. The concentrations and spatial distributions of the heavy metals were well predicted by RF, and the average values of the root mean square error of the prediction and R² were 4.84 mg kg⁻¹ and 0.57, respectively. The results indicated that the soil pH, fine particulate matter, and proximity to polluting enterprises significantly influenced the heavy metal pollution in soils, and the environmental variables varied significantly across the identified subregions. This study provides a theoretical basis for the sustainable management and control of soil pollution at the regional scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3ageostatistics 3aheavy metals 3aparticulates 3apollution control 3aprediction 3arisk 3asoil pH 3asoil pollution 0aIDW 0aPCA 0aFMDM 0aOK 0aCr 0aPb 0aCd 0aHg 0aAs 0aSOM 0aPM2.5 0aNF 0aPF 0aKF 0aOF 0aAF 0aPLSR 0aRF 0aRMSEP 0aRPIQ 0aFKM 0aFPI 0aMPE 0aS 0aCI 0aSD 0aCV 0aPC1 0aPC2 0aPC3 0aHeavy metal pollution 0aSource-Sink theory 0aMachine learning methods 0aCluster analysis 0aPotential risk areas1 aFu, Tingting1 aHu, Bifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9353-03071 aShi, Zhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3914-54021 aZhou, Lianqing1 aZhu, Youwei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 July 05, v. 393 p.122424-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1224243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245008400182300001600266520155300282592002801835650001201863650002401875650001501899650001601914650001201930650003001942650001101972650000901983650001001992650001002002650001002012650002202022650001502044650001202059650002102071650001402092650002302106650000902129650005202138700002002190700002302210773010702233856008102340852000902421655001202430IND50067307720221119223816.0140712e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006730772DNAL7 a234201432pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-013-9668-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Yukie10aAsymmetry in male lethal fight between parapatric forms of a social spider mite  ap. 451-461.  aClosely related species often show adjacent geographic distributions, albeit with some overlap. This contiguity is thought to result from secondary contact between (spatially separated) diverging groups or from parapatric speciation. Fights between males of closely related species will affect their chance to mate with females of the other species, which in turn may promote their spatial segregation and drive their speciation. Stigmaeopsis miscanthi is a social spider mite that lives in a group within self-woven nests on leaves of Chinese silver grass. This mite shows lethal male–male fight as a means to maintain a harem, and has two forms showing differences in the levels of male–male aggression, diapause intensity in females and the relative length of the first to third legs. The two forms show parapatric distributions. We found that males of one form readily engage themselves in lethal fight with males of the other form, thereby acquiring the nests and gaining access to females of this other form. Males of the aggressive form tend to win the fights with males of the other form. Their first legs are longer which may provide them with a better weapon and which also indicate a larger body width. However, another determinant of who wins the fight is the length of the third legs which can be a proxy for body length. Based on these results, we hypothesize that male killing behavior is one of the mechanisms maintaining parapatry (instead of sympatry) of the two spider mite forms apart from difference in diapause attributes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aMiscanthus sinensis 3aaggression 3abody length 3afemales 3ageographical distribution 3aleaves 3alegs 3amales 3amites 3anests 3asecondary contact 2aAggression 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBody Size 2aGenetic Speciation 2aMale 2aTetranychidaexanatomy & histologyxphysiology.1 aSabelis, M.

However, facades integration asks for collectors with various colours and/or shapes to increase the architectural acceptance. Following these constraints, a new solar thermal flat plate collector was designed and developed, having a rather small area (0.67 m2) and trapeze shape; this shape allows a much higher coverage degree of the buildings' facades, in lego-type arrays; additionally, variously coloured absorber plates (red, green) support the architectural acceptance. A trapeze demonstrator collector was developed and proved an optical efficiency of 62.38% during indoor testing using a solar simulator. Further on, this demonstrator was outdoor installed on the vertical façade of a laboratory building, in the R&D Institute of the Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania (mountain temperate climate, 45.65°N, 25.59°E, at 600 m above the sea level). The paper presents the results obtained during two years of monitoring for the outdoor installed trapeze collector, in terms of thermal power output and efficiency. Data are compared with those obtained using a commercial flat plate collector (with 2.1 m2 active area and optical efficiency of 85.1%) vertically installed on the same façade as the trapeze collector. These data are extensively discussed in the paper, considering the monthly cumulative output, the efficiency and the peak values (highest and lowest), in direct correlation with the irradiance values and outdoor temperature. It is found that the thermal energy output of vertically installed solar thermal collectors is larger during the autumn months as compared to the summer thus protecting the solar thermal system against overheating. The results show that during predominant cloudy days the infield conversion efficiency is recommended to be reported not based on instantaneous values but over longer time frames (e.g. of hours) due to an inherent time delay between the higher irradiance values and the collectors' response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abuildings 3acollectors 3acolor 3alight intensity 3amonitoring 3asea level 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asummer 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3aRomania 0aTrapeze solar thermal collector 0aOutdoor testing 0aOutdoor conversion efficiency 0aVertically mounted collectors1 aDuta, Anca1 aMoldovan, Macedon0 tRenewable energy.g2019 July, v. 137 p.37-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.01.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003200141245013000173520132200303592002801625650001201653650000901665650001201674650002301686700001601709700002101725700002001746773012001766856007501886852000901961655001201970IND60748449720221120195527.0210827e20210821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074844972DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110824622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Lázaro, Gloria 10aStrepsirrhine Primate Training Programs in North American Institutions: Status and Implications for Future Welfare Assessment  aMany articles have shown the benefits of operant conditioning training techniques in the care and welfare of several species of nonhuman primates; however, the information regarding their use in strepsirrhine species is scarce. We assessed the development and current status of training programs with these species in North American institutions. An online survey was distributed through members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums using a multiple-choice format. We collected information related to training program details; animals, behaviors, and techniques; the evaluation process; and the impact of training. Seventy-one organizations completed the survey, with the results showing that 97% of respondents trained their strepsirrhines with the main objective of husbandry and veterinary care (around 80%). Sixty-eight percent of organizations did not report any risk in training these species. The benefits reported include increases in positive human–animal interactions (97%), psychological well-being (88%), and staff awareness of animal behaviors (90%). However, a multi-dimensional approach to measure the efficacy of training could provide a deeper understanding of its impact on the welfare of strepsirrhine primates. We hope that the data offered in this survey can help in this future assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3arisk 3asurveys 3awelfare assessment1 aDye, Meg H.1 aEddie, Christie 1 aFerrie, Gina M.0 tAnimals.g2021 Aug. 21, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110824623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245005100172300001600223520092600239592002801165650002201193650001801215650001301233650002001246650001601266653002201282653002301304653002201327653002301349653002301372653001801395700002201413773013401435856008601569852000901655655001201664IND60552775220221122080838.0170607e20140220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055277522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHey, Michael J.10aEffect of pore curvature on meniscus stability  ap. 216-223.  aWe investigate the positions of stable equilibrium that may exist for a spherical fluid/liquid meniscus in various non-uniform, axisymmetric pores. The criterion we use for the analysis is based on the grand free energy potential Ω which is minimised when systems at constant volume, temperature and chemical potential achieve stable equilibrium. For given values of contact angle, surface tension and capillary pressure, we first locate equilibrium positions for a spherical meniscus in an axisymmetric pore of specified geometry and then determine whether these menisci are thermodynamically stable. We find that the local curvature of the pore, at the three-phase line of contact, determines the stability. The results should be applicable to (i) immiscible fluid displacement within the capillary spaces of porous solids and (ii) systems in which a saturated solution of a gas traps a pocket of gas in a closed pore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acontact angle 3ageometry 3asurface tension 3atemperature 0aAxisymmetric pore 0aSpherical meniscus 0aGrand free energy 0aStable equilibrium 0aCapillary pressure 0aContact angle1 aKingston, John G.0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Feb. 20, v. 443 p.216-223dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245012900214520097800343592002801321650001801349650001601367650001201383650001501395650003801410650002301448650001601471651002801487651001901515651001201534651001801546651001101564653002101575653002101596653001201617653001801629653001301647700006401660700002201724700003001746700002001776773010901796856008501905852000901990655001201999IND60685194320221119140906.0210820e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068519432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.1090662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCybulska, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5001-182X10aUse of meat juice from racoons (Procyon lotor) collected from Central Europe for immunological detection of Trichinella spp.  aThe raccoon (Procyon lotor) is a species native to North America, but which is now spreading throughout Europe. Raccoons have been found to host various Trichinella species. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using immunological testing of meat juice for determining the occurrence of Trichinella in raccoons. The studies were carried out on 139 animals from three European countries: the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland. Seven meat juice samples were found to be positive for antibodies to Trichinella by ELISA, and another seven were unclear. The ELISA results were confirmed by immunoblot: anti-Trichinella antibodies were identified in 9.35 % of the examined animals. Slight agreement (κ = 0.13) was found between the digestion method and the combined ELISA and immunoblot approach. From the results of our study, we concluded that meat juice may be used as a simple and convenient sample for detection of anti-Trichinella in racoons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcyon lotor 3aTrichinella 3aanimals 3aantibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aindigenous species 3ameat juices 3aCentral European region 3aCzech Republic 3aGermany 3aNorth America 3aPoland 0aTrichinella spp. 0aImmunoprevalence 0aRaccoon 0aProcyon lotor 0aWildlife1 aKornacka, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2733-90311 aPopiołek, Marcin1 aBień-Kalinowska, Justyna1 aMoskwa, Bożena0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2021 Sept., v. 297 p.109066-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.1090663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245009100157300001600248520225300264592002802517650001002545650001902555650002102574650001002595650001402605650001802619650001802637650002602655650001802681650001402699650000902713650000702722650003102729650001702760650002502777650003002802700001602832700001102848700001302859700001402872700001502886773011802901856007803019852000903097655001203106IND60346971120221119162410.0150812e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034697112DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2014002782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xi10aFormulation and preparation of a stable intravenous disulfiram‐loaded lipid emulsion  ap. 869-878.  aIn this study, a disulfiram‐loaded lipid emulsion (DSF‐LE) was prepared to improve its clinical application in cancer treatment. DSF‐LEs were characterized with regard to their visual appearance, particle size distribution, pH values, and percentage drug degradation. However, it was found that DSF‐LEs had poor chemical stability, which might have been affected by the pH values and lecithin used in our previous study. Buffer salts and CO₂ were used respectively to control the pH, and a significant reduction in DSF degradation in the acceleration test was observed when CO₂ was used as a protective gas. Investigations of naturally‐extracted and synthetic lecithins showed that lecithin contained more phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), causing more degradation of DSF due to its higher peroxidation. As far as the degradation mechanism was concerned, it was speculated that free radicals generated during the peroxidation process of unsaturated acyl‐groups of lecithin could react with DSF to produce unstable diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DDC), which readily broke down into CS₂ and diethylamine. Diethylamine is an alkaline compound that can increase the pH of DSF‐LEs, leading to the further degradation of DSF. Finally, an optimum DSF‐LE was obtained with good stability after being accelerated at 60°C for 5 days and at 25°C for 3 months. Practical applications: DSF is extremely unstable in gastric juice and blood, so the currently available oral formulation of DSF has limited its clinical application. Here we propose a DSF‐LE to increase the therapeutic amount of drug reaching the cancer to improve its application in cancer treatment. In addition, some influences of formulation were investigated in detail. The investigation of pH control and properties of lecithins might have some guiding significances for industrial manufacture. In this article, a stable intravenous disulfiram‐loaded lipid emulsion was developed. The influences of pH values, oil, and lecithin on the stability of drug in emulsion were researched to obtain an optimum formulation. In the end, a probable interaction of DSF with lecithin was given according to a series of investigations of naturally‐extracted and synthetic lecithins.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon disulfide 3adrugs 3aemulsions 3afree radicals 3agastric juice 3aintravenous injection 3amanufacturing 3aneoplasms 3aoils 3apH 3aparticle size distribution 3aperoxidation 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines1 aZhang, Ling1 aHu, Xi1 aLin, Xia1 aZhang, Yu1 aTang, Xing0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2015 June, v. 117, no. 6 p.869-878dWiley-VCHx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2014002783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05764naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012800185300001600313520354300329592002803872650002403900650002803924650002303952650002203975650002203997650002504019650002104044650002104065650002204086650002304108650001304131650002104144650002604165650002004191650002504211650002404236650002904260650002404289650002004313650002804333650002504361650001304386650002304399650001904422650002104441650001904462650001104481650004204492650001104534650002404545650002704569650004504596650000904641650002604650650001704676650004004693650002204733651001004755651001004765700002004775700001504795700001804810773011204828856008104940852000905021655001205030IND4479516020221121165148.0141111e20120830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447951602DNAL7 a227597012pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Jyotsana14aThe treatment of jaundice with medicinal plants in indigenous communities of the Sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India  ap. 262-291.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Inspite of tremendous advances made in allopathic medical practices, herbs still play an important role in the management of various liver diseases. A large number of plants and formulations have been claimed to have hepatoprotective activity. Jaundice is a symptom, indicative of the malfunctioning of the liver. This paper provides ethnomedicinal information on the plants used to treat jaundice by three important indigenous communities, i.e., nomadic Gujjars, Tharu and Bhoxa of Sub-Himalayan region, Uttarakhand, India. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To record herbal preparations used by the studied indigenous communities in treatment of jaundice and discuss hepatoprotective properties of the recorded plants. RESEARCH STRATEGY AND METHODS: The traditional knowledge of the studied indigenous communities on herbal preparations used for treating jaundice was collected through structured questionnaire and personal interviews. The interviews were conducted with 91 traditional healers (29 Bhoxa, 35 Tharu and 27 nomadic Gujjars) in Sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. More than 250 research papers reporting ethnomedicinal information on the hepatoprotective plants used by various communities from different parts of India were extensively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 40 medicinal plants belonging to 31 families and 38 genera were recorded to be used by the studied communities in 45 formulations as a remedy of jaundice. Bhoxa, nomadic Gujjars and Tharu communities used 15, 23 and 9 plants, respectively. To our knowledge eight plants reported in the present survey viz., Amaranthus spinosus L., Cissampelos pareira L., Ehretia laevis Roxb., Holarrhena pubescens Wall., Ocimum americanum L., Physalis divaricata D. Don, Solanum incanum L. and Trichosanthes cucumerina L. have not been reported earlier as remedy of jaundice in India. Literature review revealed that a total of 214 (belonging to 181 genus and 78 families), 19 (belonging to 18 genus and 12 families) and 14 (belonging to 14 genus and 11 families) plant species are used as internal, external and magico-religious remedies for jaundice, respectively by various communities in different parts of India. Most widely used hepatoprotective plant species for treatment of jaundice in India is Boerhavia diffusa L. followed by Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers, Saccharum officinarum L., Phyllanthus amarus Schumach. & Thonn., Ricinus communis L., Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz, Lawsonia inermis L. and Eclipta prostrata (L.) L. CONCLUSIONS: The plants recorded in the present survey have also been discussed in relation to pharmacological studies and hepatoprotective phytoconstituents present in them. Most of the recorded plants have shown hepatoprotective effects on experimental animals in earlier studies but more studies are needed to assess hepatoprotective properties of some recorded medicinal plants viz., Averrhoa carambola L., Ehretia laevis Roxb., Holarrhena pubescens Wall., Mangifera indica L., Ocimum americanum L., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz, Physalis divaricata D. Don, Solanum incanum L., Sphaeranthus senegalensis DC. and Tribulus terrestris L.. The plants enumerated in this study with high number of citations and wider distributions have given some useful leads for further biomedical research. Nevertheless more phytochemical, pharmaceutical and clinical studies are needed to evaluate hepatoprotective properties, efficacy and safety of all the claimed medicinal plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus spinosus 3aAndrographis paniculata 3aAverrhoa carambola 3aBoerhavia diffusa 3aEclipta prostrata 3aHolarrhena pubescens 3aLawsonia inermis 3aMangifera indica 3aOcimum americanum 3aPhyllanthus amarus 3aPhysalis 3aRicinus communis 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aSolanum incanum 3aTinospora cordifolia 3aTribulus terrestris 3aTrichosanthes cucumerina 3abiomedical research 3aclinical trials 3ahepatoprotective effect 3aindigenous knowledge 3ajaundice 3alaboratory animals 3aliver diseases 3amedicinal plants 2aMagnoliopsida. 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aJaundicexdrug therapy 2aLiver Diseasesxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aMale 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Preparationsxtherapeutic use 2aPlants, Medicinal 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aGairola, Sumeet1 aGaur, R.D.1 aPainuli, R.M.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 Aug. 30, v. 143, no. 1 p.262-291dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.06.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007300172300001600245520085400261592002801115650001601143650002201159650001601181650001901197650003901216650002101255650001301276650004401289650002101333650001901354650002001373650001401393653002101407653001501428653001701443653001301460700002001473700002301493700002101516700006101537700002101598700002701619773013401646856008601780852000901866655001201875IND60552775420221122080827.0170607e20140220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055277542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2013.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠkvarla, Juraj10aMicellization of Zonyl FSN-100 fluorosurfactant in aqueous solutions  ap. 209-215.  aWe report on micellization of nonionic fluorosurfactant Zonyl FSN-100 in aqueous solutions studied by means of NMR spectroscopy, light and small-angle X-ray scattering, surface tension measurements, isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy.

Flavonoids such as iridin, dihexosyl quercetin, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, rhamnosyl hexosyl methyl quercetin, gentenstein 7-glucoside, orientin, C-(O-caffeoyl-hexosyl)-O-hexoside and tricin 7-O-hexosyl-O-hexoside were identified, for the first time, from T. involucrata.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3aquercetin 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aT. involucrata 0aDPPH 0aLC/MS 0aFlavonoids1 aBalachandran, Indira0 tBeni-Suef University Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences.g2016 Sept., v. 5 p.231-235dElsevier B.V.aBeni-Suef UniversitywJournal:23478x2314-85357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjbas.2016.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011900165300001600284520185400300592002802154650002202182650001202204650002202216650002502238650001202263650002102275650001902296650001402315650001002329650002002339650001702359650002502376650001702401650001202418650003002430650002702460650003002487650001802517650003502535650001602570650001502586650001602601700001602617700002002633700001802653700001802671773013602689856008102825852000902906655001202915IND60596765220221122124455.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059676522DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-018-0045-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Hayoung10aAllelic variation in Brassica oleracea CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (BoCCA1) is associated with freezing tolerance  ap. 423-434.  aFreezing tolerance is an important horticultural trait in cabbage (Brassica oleracea). Molecular markers for freezing tolerance are needed for marker-assisted breeding of freezing-tolerant cabbage plants. To develop gene-based molecular markers for freezing-tolerance in cabbage, we focused on CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), a core circadian clock component that affects metabolic pathways and confers cold tolerance by upregulating C-repeat binding factor (CBF) pathway genes. We cloned and analyzed CCA1 genes (BoCCA1s) from seven inbred lines and one cultivar of B. oleracea ssp. capitata. Two types of BoCCA1 alleles were detected: BN106-type (freezing-tolerant; BoCCA1-1) and BN107-type (freezing-susceptible; BoCCA1-2). Numerous insertions/deletions (InDels), simple sequence repeats, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the exons and introns of BoCCA1s from the ATG start codon at the second exon to the TGA stop codon at the eighth exon. Using InDels and SNPs, we designed PCR primer pairs to distinguish the freezing-tolerant lines, and validated these markers using 102 cabbage lines and cultivars. The inbred lines possessed either the BN106-type or BN107-type allele, but most cultivars had both alleles. Freezing-tolerant cabbage plants had BN106-type InDels and/or BN106-type SNPs regardless of the presence of BN107-type InDels and SNPs, and BN106-type SNPs were more widely detected in the freezing-tolerant cabbage plants than BN106-type InDels. The expression patterns of BoCCA1-1 and BoCCA1-2 were similar under normal versus temperature-stressed conditions (low and high temperatures), suggesting a functional difference at the post-transcriptional level. Cabbage breeders should use several markers derived from different genes and independently established inbred lines from different seed companies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aalleles 3aallelic variation 3abiochemical pathways 3acabbage 3acircadian clocks 3acold tolerance 3acultivars 3aexons 3agenetic markers 3ahorticulture 3ahybridization probes 3ainbred lines 3aintrons 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseed industry 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astart codon 3astop codon 3atemperature1 aYi, Hankuil1 aHan, Ching-Tack1 aPark, Jong-In1 aHur, Yoonkang0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2018 June, v. 59, no. 3 p.423-434dSpringer SingaporewJournal:21607x2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-018-0045-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008200171300001400253520154000267592002801807650001501835650001401850650001501864650001301879650001501892650001901907650001401926650002501940650001101965650002101976650001701997653002902014653002302043653002302066653002102089700002102110773009502131856008502226852000902311655001202320IND60634079520221117032047.0190328e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063407952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.02.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFekete, István,10aNumerical and experimental study of building integrated solar tile collectors  ap. 45-55.  aThis paper is dealing with the development of a new type of shell-structured solar collector for the heat exploitation of solar energy for building use and to determine its thermal efficiency. The literature review confirms that solar collectors appreciated not only by their usefulness, but also according to their aesthetic considerations. In addition to traditional solar collectors it is viable to study the solutions how the structural elements of the buildings can also be used to capture solar energy, when the architectural design would not change, but the required surface operates as solar collector. During the modelling and simulation of the shell-structured solar system strong consideration was given to the efficiency issues. The energy balance equation of the collector includes the influencing factors especially the radiation and heat convection, which are expressed by their heat loss coefficients. Based on the measurements it can be stated that in the case of the simplest structural design (no thermal insulation, no surface covering) the working fluid can warm up to 20–25 °C. Concerning to the structural design the built-in pipe diameter cannot be increased over the half of the concrete tile thickness, and it is not suggested to increase the pipe length beyond 3 m within the tile. A recommended use of such architectural elements can be designed for renovation of buildings, along with the active utilization of solar energy in order to meet the increasingly stringent energy standards for buildings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3abuildings 3acollectors 3aconcrete 3aconvection 3aenergy balance 3aequations 3ainsulating materials 3amodels 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aTemperature distribution 0aThermal efficiency 0aInfrared recording 0aStructure design1 aFarkas, István,0 tRenewable energy.g2019 July, v. 137 p.45-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.02.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009900171300001400270520059200284592002800876650001800904650001300922650002300935650002300958650001100981650001100992650001201003650003101015650001201046651001401058651001001072653002801082653001501110653001001125700001901135700002201154700002301176700002101199700002501220700003101245700002101276700002101297700002101318773011301339856008501452852000901537655001201546IND60543845120221120112818.0190412e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054384512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorusso, Alessio12aA new member of the Pteropine Orthoreovirus species isolated from fruit bats imported to Italy  ap. 55-58.  aA novel member of the Pteropine Orthoreovirus species has been isolated and sequenced for the whole genome from flying foxes (Pteropus vampyrus) imported to Italy from Indonesia.

Its biological activity is modulated by the number of acyl-chains that are present in the lipid and by the dielectric medium, i.e., the type of counter-ions, through electrostatic interactions. In this paper, we report on a coarse-grained model of chemical variants of Lipid A based on the hybrid particle-field/molecular dynamics approach (hPF-MD). In particular, we investigate the stability of Lipid A bilayers for two different hexa- and tetra-acylated structures. Comparing particle density profiles along bilayer cross-sections, we find good agreement between the hPF-MD model and reference all-atom simulation for both chemical variants of Lipid A. hPF-MD models of constituted bilayers composed by hexa-acylated Lipid A in water are stable within the simulation time. We further validate our model by verifying that the phase behavior of Lipid A/counterion/water mixtures is correctly reproduced. In particular, hPF-MD simulations predict the correct self-assembly of different lamellar and micellar phases from an initially random distribution of Lipid A molecules with counterions in water. Finally, it is possible to observe the spontaneous formation and stability of Lipid A vesicles by fusion of micellar aggregates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abioactive properties 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ainflammation 3alipid A 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics1 aSoares, Thereza A.1 aSantos, Denys E.S.1 aBore, Sigbjørn Løland1 aSevink, G.J.

This system relies on NOAA's Coupled Forecast System (CFS) global climate model to provide initial and boundary conditions for dynamical downscaling with a high‐resolution numerical ocean model. Experiments with J‐SCOPE show that the bottom temperature on the shelf is more predictable than the sea surface temperature (SST) on seasonal time scales. While seasonal forecasts have been shown to have positive skill in terms of SST for the CCS due to El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the mechanism(s) responsible for subsurface predictability in the N‐CCS have yet to be determined. This study quantifies the relative importance of North Pacific and Tropical Pacific properties in determining the variations in temperatures at depth (TDs) on the N‐CCS shelf. A multivariable linear regression (MLR) model with selected predictors explains almost 83% of the N‐CCS TD variability with oceanic teleconnections from the North Pacific dominating the variance. The N‐CCS TD is related to (i) coastally trapped waves (CTWs) related to ENSO, originating in Tropical Pacific, (ii) west‐central Pacific spice anomalies, (iii) seasonal Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) variation, and a more local influence from (iv) anomalies south of N‐CCS, originating in North Pacific. ENSO and CTW can each impact the depth of the California Undercurrent (CUC) core with the latter most prominently following ENSO events. The results on potential sources of predictability are relevant to the continued development of current seasonal forecasting efforts off the U.S. West coast.  aPublisher supplied data  aNA17OAR4310112cNOAA's CPC MAPP 3aclimate models 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3ageophysics 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3aspices 3asurface water temperature 3avariance 3aCalifornia 3aPacific Ocean1 aSiedlecki, S.

However, concrete can easily be cracked and has a limited lifespan. Among strategies for healing cracks and recycling concrete, microbial carbonate precipitation (MCP) by nitrogen-involved heterotrophic bacteria showed great potential. In this study, an alternative technology using autophototrophs is proposed to overcome the pollution generated by urea-based MCP. We studied biomineralization of cyanobacteria Synechococcus PCC8806 in the cement solution, and investigated the impact of this process on concrete properties. Solution composition and cell viability were monitored and the morphology of precipitates was observed with scanning and transmission electron microscopy as well as atomic force microscopy. Chemical components were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Results show that Synechococcus PCC8806 were intact in the cement solution, and the biotic-formed precipitates were different in morphology and nearly doubled in amount compared with abiotic-formed ones. The experiments on concrete cubes revealed that a thick calcite-cell aggregate layer adhering to the concrete was formed biotically, while several thin carbonate patches were distributed on the concrete abiotically. This calcite-cell layer decreased the water absorption, and was resistant to sonication. Consequently, Synechococcus PCC8806 show a great potential for restoring concrete.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aSynechococcus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3abacteria 3abiomineralization 3acell viability 3acement 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3apollution 3arecycling 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCalcification 0aSynechococcus PCC8806 0aConcrete restoration 0aMicrobial carbonate precipitation1 aPaulo, Carlos1 aMerroun, Mohamed L.1 aDittrich, Maria0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Sept., v. 82 p.459-468dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011400171300001600285500001900301520131200320592002801632650002101660650001801681650001901699650001401718650001201732650001201744650002001756650001101776650002601787650001301813650002101826650000701847650003001854650001201884650001801896653003301914653003601947653003401983700001702017700002002034700001702054700001902071773013502090856008702225852000902312655001202321IND60721113220221118133617.0210121e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072111322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Hae-Rin10aCharacterization of an organic solvent-tolerant polysaccharide lyase from Microbulbifer thermotolerans DAU221  ap. 452-462.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlginate and its derivatives are annually produced approximately 30,000 tons or more and are applied to various industries as they are natural polymers. The global market for alginate and its derivatives has been growing steadily. There is little research compared to other enzymes produced through biomass degradation or modification. An alginate lyase, MtAl138, from Microbulbifer thermotolerans DAU221 was cloned and identified in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). MtAl138 contains a highly conserved motif (R⁵³⁸TELR, Q⁶⁰⁷IH⁶⁰⁹, and YFKAGVY⁷¹⁶NQ), which indicates that it belongs to the polysaccharide lyase family 7 (PL7). MtAl138, with a molecular weight of 77 kDa worked optimally at 45 °C and pH 7.4. MtAl138 showed twice as much activity as when there was no NaCl when there was between 100 and 600 mM NaCl. Moreover, its activity increased in organic solvents such as benzene, hexane, methanol, and toluene. Based on the thin layer chromatography analyses, MtAl38 is an endo-type enzyme that produces di-, tri-, or tetrasaccharides from polyG and polyM. This study provided that MtAl138 is an endoenzyme that showed outstanding enzymatic activity at concentrated salt solutions and organic solvents, which makes it a reasonably attractive enzyme for use in various industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMicrobulbifer 3aalginate lyase 3aalginates 3abenzene 3abiomass 3aenzyme activity 3ahexane 3aintracellular enzymes 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3apH 3athin layer chromatography 3atoluene 3aworld markets 0aMicrobulbifer thermotolerans 0aOrganic solvent-tolerant enzyme 0aPolysaccharide lyase family 71 aYoo, Ju-Soon1 aChoi, Yong-Lark1 aJang, Yu-Sin1 aLee, Yong Suk,0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 169 p.452-462dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03838naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245008400158300001800242520268200260592002802942650001102970650001102981650001402992650001103006650001403017650001203031650002403043650001303067650001603080650002103096650001203117650001503129651001103144700002403155700001703179700002003196700002103216773009903237856007103336852000903407655001203416IND60518951920221116182539.0160419e199509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051895192DNAL7 a10.2307/19407242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Brien, Sean T.10aDiameter, Height, Crown, and Age Relationship in Eight Neotropical Tree Species  ap. 1926-1939.  aDiameter, height, crown shape, and crown area were measured on 23—42 trees ranging in size from saplings to large adults for each of eight common dicotyledonous tree species in a neotropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Six species were canopy trees, one species was an emergent tree, and the remaining species was an understory tree. Crown areas and shapes were quantified by eight radii measured every 45° from the trunk to the vertically projected edge of the crown. areas were calculated from the areas of circles with the average radius; crown shapes were measured by the coefficients of variation of the eight crown radii. Age—diameter relationships were estimated from diameter growth increments over an 8—yr period. Observed height—diameter relationships were compared to expectations based on the theories of elastic similarity, constant stress, and geometric similarity. Slopes of log—transformed height—diameter relationships differed from the theoretically expected value of 2/3 for elastic similarity in three of eight species; two canopy species had higher slopes, but not as high as the expected value of 1.0 for geometric similarity; one canopy species was shorter, but the slope was greater than the slope of 0.5 predicted by the constant stress theory. The theory of elastic similarity also predicts that canopy mass to trunk mass ratio should remain constant during tree growth. Observed ratios based on proxy variables for the masses were constant in six of eight species–the two deviant species had heavier crowns in large trees than expected from their diameters. Crown shapes were much more variable in some species than others. The understory species had much lower r² values for height—diameter and crown—diameter relationships, suggesting that these relationships may be more variable in trees that live in the less windy understory than in trees that reach the canopy. The allometric relationships for the species in this study were not unique for each species, suggesting that it may be possible to model the allometric relationships of many species with fewer equations than species. If the primary adaptive forces acting on tree species in a diverse forest are their physical environment and the sum of competitive interactions with an ever—changing mix of neighbors, then different species may have similar resource allocation patterns. Thus, using the age—size relationships, we found three groups of species among the seven canopy species. Two groups had three species each and one species (Ocotea whitei) was in a group by itself. The understory species, Faramea occidentalis, was also in a group by itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcotea 3aadults 3aallometry 3acanopy 3aequations 3aislands 3aresource allocation 3asaplings 3atree growth 3atropical forests 3atropics 3aunderstory 3aPanama1 aHubbell, Stephen P.1 aSpiro, Peter1 aCondit, Richard1 aFoster, Robin B.0 tEcology.g1995 Sept., v. 76, no. 6 p.1926-1939dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19407243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100006100188245011500249300001600364506007600380520141000456592002801866506003701894650002301931650001201954650002401966650001301990650001102003650002002014650001702034650000902051650001102060650001502071650003302086650000902119650002702128650001402155650001302169651001902182700002602201700002902227700002202256700002202278700002502300700002202325773008302347856008102430852000902511655001202520IND60629395820221207055338.0200601s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062939582DNAL7 aPMC60536332pmcid7 a300388962pmid7 a10.1016/j.mex.2018.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenson, Nsikak U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1285-579X12aA new method for assessment of sediment-associated contamination risks using multivariate statistical approach  ap. 268-276.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper presents the assimilation of heavy metal concentration data from sequential extraction method (SEM) with metal toxicity factors to develop and propose two new sediment quality indices modified hazard quotient (mHQ) and ecological contamination index (ECI), to predict the potential ecological risks associated with sediment contamination. Chemical speciation data of five heavy metals: cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) from five coastal aquatic ecosystems of the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean were used in the assessment of the degree of heavy metal contamination. Evaluation based on ECI indicated that sediments of most aquatic ecosystems were considerably to highly contaminated. The results showed that the proposed indices are reliable, precise, and in good agreement with similar existing indices used for evaluating the severity of sediment-associated contamination by heavy metals. The principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis indicated that heavy metals in the benthic sediments were mostly from anthropogenic sources.•New indices – modified hazard quotient (mHQ) and ecological contamination index (ECI) - were developed for predicting sediment-associated risk adverse effects.•Newly proposed indices agree closely with the existing pollution indices.•Pollution indices reveal significant anthropogenic contamination by Cd and Pb.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acadmium 3achemical speciation 3achromium 3acopper 3afactor analysis 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anickel 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atoxicity 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aAdedapo, Adebusayo E.1 aFred-Ahmadu, Omowunmi H.1 aWilliams, Akan B.1 aUdosen, Essien D.1 aAyejuyo, Olusegun O.1 aOlajire, Abass A.0 tMethodsX.g2018, v. 5 p.268-276dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2018.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04517naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001700183245019800200300001800398506007600416520154600492592002802038506003702066650002502103650002202128650002102150650001202171650002502183650000902208650001602217650002402233650003002257650001202287650001702299650001202316650001302328650001202341650001602353650002702369650001702396650001102413650002402424650002402448650005302472650005902525650004002584650002502624650006002649650005202709650004302761650002402804650005502828650002302883650002802906650006802934650003003002650004003032650003603072650004303108650003003151650004203181650004403223650002303267650003403290650004003324650004903364650001703413650002303430700001903453700001803472700002303490773010803513856004503621852000903666655001203675IND4465717920221207090005.0120530e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446571792DNAL7 a224741842pmid7 aPMC33985632pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.112.0967432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitz, Sandra13aDe Novo Pyrimidine Nucleotide Synthesis Mainly Occurs outside of Plastids, but a Previously Undiscovered Nucleobase Importer Provides Substrates for the Essential Salvage Pathway in Arabidopsis  ap. 1549-1559.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNucleotide de novo synthesis is highly conserved among organisms and represents an essential biochemical pathway. In plants, the two initial enzymatic reactions of de novo pyrimidine synthesis occur in the plastids. By use of green fluorescent protein fusions, clear support is provided for a localization of the remaining reactions in the cytosol and mitochondria. This implies that carbamoyl aspartate, an intermediate of this pathway, must be exported and precursors of pyrimidine salvage (i.e., nucleobases or nucleosides) are imported into plastids. A corresponding uracil transport activity could be measured in intact plastids isolated from cauliflower (Brassica oleracea) buds. PLUTO (for plastidic nucleobase transporter) was identified as a member of the Nucleobase:Cation-Symporter1 protein family from Arabidopsis thaliana, capable of transporting purine and pyrimidine nucleobases. A PLUTO green fluorescent protein fusion was shown to reside in the plastid envelope after expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Heterologous expression of PLUTO in an Escherichia coli mutant lacking the bacterial uracil permease uraA allowed a detailed biochemical characterization. PLUTO transports uracil, adenine, and guanine with apparent affinities of 16.4, 0.4, and 6.3 μM, respectively. Transport was markedly inhibited by low concentrations of a proton uncoupler, indicating that PLUTO functions as a proton-substrate symporter. Thus, a protein for the absolutely required import of pyrimidine nucleobases into plastids was identified.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica oleracea 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenine 3abiochemical pathways 3abuds 3acauliflower 3aenzymatic reactions 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aguanine 3amitochondria 3amutants 3aplastids 3aprotons 3aprotoplasts 3apyrimidine nucleotides 3atransporters 3auracil 2aAdeninexmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiosynthetic Pathwaysxdrug effects 2aBrassicaxmetabolism 2aCarbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazonexpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGuaninexmetabolism 2aIntracellular Membranesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleobase Transport Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNucleotidesxbiosynthesis 2aPlastidsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Transportxdrug effects 2aProtoplastsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPyrimidinesxbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSubstrate Specificityxdrug effects 2aSymportersxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aUracilxmetabolism1 aJung, Benjamin1 aFürst, Sarah1 aMöhlmann, Torsten0 tplant cell.g2012 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.1549-1559dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.112.096743  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245012800159300002000287520166700307592002801974650001702002650001702019650001902036650001502055650001802070650000902088650001902097650001902116650000702135650002702142650001502169650001802184650002602202650002602228650001602254650002502270700001602295700001902311700003402330700001502364700003002379773012702409856008102536852000902617655001202626IND60586415120221121104412.0171213e20171121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058641512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b039402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei10aDGT Passive Sampling for Quantitative in Situ Measurements of Compounds from Household and Personal Care Products in Waters  ap. 13274-13281.  aWidespread use of organic chemicals in household and personal care products (HPCPs) and their discharge into aquatic systems means reliable, robust techniques to monitor environmental concentrations are needed. The passive sampling approach of diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) is developed here and demonstrated to provide in situ quantitative and time-weighted average (TWA) measurement of these chemicals in waters. The novel technique is developed for HPCPs, including preservatives, antioxidants and disinfectants, by evaluating the performance of different binding agents. Ultrasonic extraction of binding gels in acetonitrile gave good and consistent recoveries for all test chemicals. Uptake by DGT with HLB (hydrophilic–lipophilic-balanced) as the binding agent was relatively independent of pH (3.5–9.5), ionic strength (0.001–0.1 M) and dissolved organic matter (0–20 mg L–¹), making it suitable for applications across a wide range of environments. Deployment time and diffusion layer thickness dependence experiments confirmed DGT accumulated chemicals masses are consistent with theoretical predictions. The technique was further tested and applied in the influent and effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. Results were compared with conventional grab-sampling and 24-h-composited samples from autosamplers. DGT provided TWA concentrations over up to 18 days deployment, with minimal effects from biofouling or the diffusive boundary layer. The field application demonstrated advantages of the DGT technique: it gives in situ analyte preconcentration in a simple matrix, with more quantitative measurement of the HPCP analytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aantioxidants 3abinding agents 3abiofouling 3adisinfectants 3agels 3aionic strength 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apersonal care products 3aprediction 3apreservatives 3aquantitative analysis 3atime-weighted average 3aultrasonics 3awastewater treatment1 aLi, Yanying1 aChen, Chang-Er1 aSweetman, A.

In this study, a dual-interval multi-stage stochastic programming model for the planning of integrated energy-environment systems (DMSP-IEES) model is developed for integrated energy-environment systems management, in which issues of GHG-emission mitigation can be reflected throughout the process of energy systems planning. By integrating methodologies of interval linear programming (when numbers are described as interval values without distribution information), dual-interval programming (when lower and upper bounds of interval values are not available as deterministic values but as discrete intervals), and multi-stage stochastic programming, the DMSP-IEES model is capable of dealing with uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals, dual intervals, and probability distributions within a multi-stage context. Decision alternatives can also be generated through analysis of the single- and dual-interval solutions according to projected applicable conditions. A case study is provided for demonstrating the applicability of the developed methodology. The results indicate that the developed model can tackle the dual uncertainties and the dynamic complexities in the energy-environment management systems through a multi-layer scenario tree. In addition, it can reflect the interactions among multiple system components and the associated trade-offs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3alinear programming 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprobability distribution1 aHuang, G.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe characteristics observed using early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging in a group of dogs undergoing craniotomy for brain tumor removal. Two independent observers came to a consensus opinion for presence/absence of the following MRI characteristics: residual tumor tissue; hemorrhage and ischemic lesions; abnormal enhancement (including the margins of the resection cavity, choroid plexus, meninges) and signal intensity changes on diffusion‐weighted imaging. Five dogs were included in the study, having had preoperative and early postoperative MRI acquired within four days after surgery. The most commonly observed characteristics were abnormal meningeal enhancement, linear enhancement at margins of the resection cavity, hemorrhage, and a thin rim of hyperintensity surrounding the resection cavity on diffusion‐weighted imaging. Residual tumor tissue was detected in one case of an enhancing tumor and in one case of a tumor containing areas of hemorrhage preoperatively. Residual tumor tissue was suspected but could not be confirmed when tumors were nonenhancing. Findings supported the use of early postoperative MRI as a method for detecting residual brain tumor tissue in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3achoroid plexus 3adogs 3ahemorrhage 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ameninges 3aneoplasms 3aresection 3aretrospective studies1 aTyrrell, Dayle1 aLong, Sam Nicholas0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2015 Sept., v. 56, no. 5 p.531-539dAmerican College of Veterinary RadiologywJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.122483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245017200171520126900343592002801612650003001640650001201670650001601682650003401698650001201732650001801744650001401762650001201776650002501788650001101813650000901824650001301833650002601846700002601872700002001898700002501918700002101943700003101964700003101995700001802026773012702044856007402171852000902245655001202254IND60751610620221121185648.0210925e20210911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075161062DNAL7 a10.3390/md190905172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBárcenas-Pérez, Daniela 10aProduction of Fucoxanthin from Phaeodactylum tricornutum Using High Performance Countercurrent Chromatography Retaining Its FOXO3 Nuclear Translocation-Inducing Effect  aPhaeodactylum tricornutum is a rich source of fucoxanthin, a carotenoid with several health benefits. In the present study, high performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC) was used to isolate fucoxanthin from an extract of P. tricornutum. A multiple sequential injection HPCCC method was developed combining two elution modes (reverse phase and extrusion). The lower phase of a biphasic solvent system (n-heptane, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water, ratio 5/5/6/3, v/v/v/v) was used as the mobile phase, while the upper phase was the stationary phase. Ten consecutive sample injections (240 mg of extract each) were performed leading to the separation of 38 mg fucoxanthin with purity of 97% and a recovery of 98%. The process throughput was 0.189 g/h, while the efficiency per gram of fucoxanthin was 0.003 g/h. Environmental risk and general process evaluation factors were used for assessment of the developed separation method and compared with existing fucoxanthin liquid-liquid isolation methods. The isolated fucoxanthin retained its well-described ability to induce nuclear translocation of transcription factor FOXO3. Overall, the developed isolation method may represent a useful model to produce biologically active fucoxanthin from diatom biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3abiomass 3acarotenoids 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3aextrusion 3aheptane 3aisolation techniques 3amodels 3arisk 3asolvents 3atranscription factors1 aStřížek, Antonín 1 aHrouzek, Pavel 1 aKopecky, J.q(Jiri),1 aBarradas, Marta 1 aSierra-Ramirez, Arantzazu 1 aFernandez-Marcos, Pablo J.1 aCheel, José 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Sept. 11, v. 19, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md190905173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010800167300001600275520136200291592002801653650001301681650002001694650002101714650001001735650001601745650001101761650001901772650001201791650001101803650001001814650001301824650004801837650001401885650001901899650001701918653001101935653001901946653002901965653001001994653001602004653002002020700001802040700001602058773013302074856008502207852000902292655001202301IND60554069420221120065307.0180904e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055406942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2016.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBou Saab, J.10aIneffective correction of PPARγ signaling in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells undergoing repair  ap. 361-369.  aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) represents a potential target to treat airway mucus hypersecretion in cystic fibrosis (CF). We aimed to determine if PPARγ is altered in CF human airway epithelial cells (HAECs), if PPARγ contributes to mucin expression and HAEC differentiation, and if PPARγ ligand therapy corrects the CF phenotype. To this end, well-differentiated CF and NCF HAEC primary cultures were wounded to monitor the expression of key genes involved in PPARγ activation and mucus homeostasis, and to evaluate the effect of a PPARγ agonist, at different times of repair. Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD) converts prostaglandin E2 to 15-keto PGE2 (15kPGE2), an endogenous PPARγ ligand. Interestingly, PPARγ and HPGD expression dramatically decreased in CF HAECs. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the expression of MUC5B. The correlation between PPARγ and MUC5B was confirmed in an airway epithelial cell line after CFTR knock-down. Exposure of HAECs to 15kPGE2 did not correct the CF phenotype but revealed a defect in the process of basal cell (BC) differentiation. The HPGD/PPARγ axis is deregulated in primary HAEC cultures from CF patients, which may impact the maturation of BCs to differentiated luminal cells. Importantly, PPARγ therapy was inefficient in correcting the CF defect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acystic fibrosis 3aepithelial cells 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahypersecretion 3aligands 3amucins 3amucus 3apatients 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3aphenotype 3aprostaglandins 3atherapeutics 0aPPARγ 0aLigand therapy 0aAirway epithelium repair 0aMucus 0aHuman model 0aCystic fibrosis1 aBacchetta, M.1 aChanson, M.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Sept., v. 78 p.361-369dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.07.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245011900170520146700289592002801756650002801784650001201812650001901824650001701843650002501860650002101885650001601906650001701922650001501939653002001954653002001974653001901994653002502013653002102038700001902059700001402078700001302092700001902105700001402124700001802138700001602156700001802172700001702190700001502207700001602222700005702238773009302295856009102388852000902479655001202488IND60721113820221118133312.0210610e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072111382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1206032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Bin10aExtracellular matrix scaffold crosslinked with vancomycin for multifunctional antibacterial bone infection therapy  aThe treatment of acute and chronic bone infections remains a major clinical challenge. The various factors released by the bacteria, acidic environment, and bacterial colonies in the bone grooves and implanted synthetic materials collectively promote the formation of biofilms. Dormant bacteria and biofilms cause infections that are difficult to cure and that can develop chronically. Therefore, a new antibacterial material was synthesized in the present study for multifunctional bone infection therapy and consists of specific demineralized extracellular cancellous bone (SDECM) crosslinked with vancomycin (Van) by means of electrostatic interactions and chemical bonds. It was verified in vitro that the new material (Van-SDECM) not only has pH-sensitive release and biofilm inhibition properties, but also maintains sustained bactericidal ability accompanied by the degradation of the scaffold, which does not affect its favorable osteogenic performance. The infectious bone defect in vivo model further confirms the comprehensive anti-infective and osteogenic ability of the Van-SDECM. Further, these favorable properties are due to the pH-sensitive sustained release sterilization and scaffold contact antibacterial properties, accompanied by osteoclast activity inhibition, osteogenesis promotion and immunoregulation effects. This study provides a new drug-scaffold composite preparation method based on a native-derived extracellular matrix scaffold.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abiofilm 3abone formation 3acrosslinking 3aextracellular matrix 3aimmunomodulation 3aosteoclasts 3atherapeutics 3avancomycin 0aBone infections 0aAnti-microbials 0apH-sensitivity 0aExtracellular matrix 0aImmunoregulation1 aQiu, Pengcheng1 aXia, Chen1 aCai, Dan1 aZhao, Chenchen1 aChen, Yan1 aWang, Haiping1 aLiu, Shijie1 aCheng, Haomai1 aTang, Zhibin1 aWang, Bang1 aFan, Shunwu1 aLin, Xianfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1871-774X0 tBiomaterials.g2021 Jan., v. 268 p.120603-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1206033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245009200168300001600260520132100276592002801597650001501625650001501640650002701655650002701682650002101709650002001730650002501750650001701775650001301792650001901805650000701824650002101831650001101852650002701863650001101890653002701901653003101928653002401959653003601983700002602019773011302045856007702158852000902235655001202244IND60480174320221123022719.0160126e20140708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048017432DNAL7 a10.2478/aep-2014-00192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWołczyński, Marcin10aInfluence of Initial Alkalinity of Lignocellulosic Waste on Their Enzymatic Degradation  ap. 103-113.  aThe presented results of research on the effectiveness of enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic waste, depending on their initial depolymerisation in alkaline medium were considered in the context of the possibility of their further use in the fermentation media focused on the recovery of energy in the form of molecular hydrogen. The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate dose and concentration of a chemical reagent, whose efficiency would be high enough to cause decomposition of the complex, but without an excessive production of by-products which could adversely affect the progress and effectiveness of the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. The effect of treatment on physical-chemical changes of homogenates’ properties such as pH, COD, the concentration of monosaccharide and total sugars and the concentration of total suspended solids and volatile suspended solids was determined. The enzymatic decomposition of lignocellulosic complex was repeatedly more efficient if the sample homogenates were subjected to an initial exposure to NaOH. The degree of conversion of complex sugars into simple sugars during enzymatic hydrolysis of homogenates pre-alkalized to pH 11.5 and 12.0 was 83.3 and 84.2% respectively, which should be sufficient for efficient hydrogen fermentation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3abyproducts 3achemical concentration 3achemical oxygen demand 3adepolymerization 3aenergy recovery 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afermentation 3ahydrogen 3alignocellulose 3apH 3asodium hydroxide 3asugars 3atotal suspended solids 3awastes 0aLignocellulosic wastes 0aenzymatic saccharification 0aalkaline hydrolysis 0aobtaining of the organic medium1 aJanosz-Rajczyk, Marta0 tArchives of environmental protection.g2014 July 8, v. 40, no. 2 p.103-113dDe Gruyter Openx2083-48107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aep-2014-00193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245008400196500002000280520162000300592002801920596005301948596004002001650000902041650001102050650002102061650001402082650001402096650001502110650001002125650001302135650001602148650001302164650001402177650002502191700005702216700005902273700006102332700005402393773013602447856007702583852000902660655001202669IND60789783720221120064518.0220822e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078978372DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JC0162642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmador, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0476-401910aCross‐Shore Structure of Tidally Driven Alongshore Flow Over Rough Bathymetry  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA tidally driven alongshore flow on the western coast of O'ahu Hawai'i is examined using velocity measurements from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) along with time series observations of the alongshore pressure gradient. Depth‐averaged velocities over the forereef shelf are reconstructed from AUV‐based velocity observations as a function of cross‐shore distance assuming a sinusoidal tidal periodicity. Ensemble phase averages of the alongshore pressure gradient and velocities from multiple AUV surveys reveal characteristics akin to an oscillatory boundary layer, with the nearshore flow leading the offshore flow in phase and with a corresponding velocity attenuation at shallower depths. Analysis of the depth‐averaged alongshore momentum equation indicates that the cross‐shore structure and evolution of the tidal boundary layer is well described by a balance between the local acceleration, the barotropic pressure gradient, and bottom drag. This primary balance allows estimation of the drag coefficient as a function of cross‐shore distance over depths spanning from 24 to 6 m. Results indicate that drag coefficients range from 0.004 to 0.010 [±0.002] over a 600 m cross‐shore forereef section. These estimates are in good agreement with previous results obtained at the 12 m isobath using fixed observations and compare favorably with roughness estimates from LIDAR and AUV‐based mapping. Roughness data suggest that larger scales, with wavelengths of O(10 m), play a more significant role than smaller meter‐scale roughness in determining the drag on the tidal flow.  aPublisher supplied data  aN00014‐13‐1‐0340cOffice of Naval Research  aPO 1036151cArmy Corps of Engineers 3aOahu 3acoasts 3adrag coefficient 3aequations 3aevolution 3ageophysics 3alidar 3amomentum 3aperiodicity 3aresearch 3aroughness 3atime series analysis1 aArzeno, I.

This explains the interest in MuscleSound®, the first commercial system to use high-frequency ultrasound technology and image analysis from patented cloud-based software to estimate muscle glycogen content from the echogenicity of the ultrasound image. This technique is based largely on muscle water content, which is presumed to act as a proxy for glycogen. Despite the promise of early validation studies, newer studies from independent groups reported discrepant results, with MuscleSound® scores failing to correlate with the glycogen content of biopsy-derived mixed muscle samples or to show the expected changes in muscle glycogen associated with various diet and exercise strategies. The explanation of issues related to the site of assessment do not account for these discrepancies, and there are substantial problems with the premise that the ratio of glycogen to water in the muscle is constant. Although further studies investigating this technique are warranted, current evidence that MuscleSound® technology can provide valid and actionable information around muscle glycogen stores is at best equivocal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adiet 3aexercise 3aglycogen 3aimage analysis 3amuscles 3apatents 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 3awater content1 aRoss, Megan L.1 aTomcik, Kristyen A.1 aJeacocke, Nikki A.1 aMcKay, Alannah K.

This review focuses on paracrine signaling by the IL-6 family of cytokines between bone cells, bone marrow, and skeletal muscle in normal physiology and in pathological states where their levels may be locally or systemically elevated. These functions include the support of osteoclast formation by osteoblast lineage cells in response to interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 11 (IL-11), oncostatin M (OSM) and cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1). In addition it will discuss how bone-resorbing osteoclasts promote osteoblast activity by secreting CT-1, which acts as a “coupling factor” on osteocytes, osteoblasts, and their precursors to promote bone formation. OSM, produced by osteoblast lineage cells and macrophages, stimulates bone formation via osteocytes. IL-6 family cytokines also mediate actions of other bone formation stimuli like parathyroid hormone (PTH) and mechanical loading. CT-1, OSM and LIF suppress marrow adipogenesis by shifting commitment of pluripotent precursors towards osteoblast differentiation. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is released as a myokine from skeletal muscle and suppresses osteoblast differentiation and bone formation on the periosteum (outer bone surface in apposition to muscle). Finally, IL-6 acts directly on marrow-derived osteoclasts to stimulate release of “osteotransmitters” that act through the cortical osteocyte network to stimulate bone formation on the periosteum. Each will be discussed as illustrations of how the extended family of IL-6 cytokines acts within the skeleton in physiology and may be altered in pathological conditions or by targeted therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3aextended families 3ainterleukin-11 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amuscles 3anerve growth factor 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3aparacrine signaling 3aparathyroid hormone 3apathological processes and conditions 3aperiosteum 3aresorption 3askeletal muscle 3askeleton 0aC/EBPβ 0aC/EBPδ 0aCNTF 0aCNTFR 0aCLCF1 0aCRLF1 0aCT-1 0aΔFosB 0aErk 0agp130 0aIL-6 0aIL-6 0aIL-11 0aIL-11 0aIL-27Rα/WSX-1 0aJAK/STAT 0aLIF 0aLIFR 0aM-CSF 0aOSM 0aOSMR 0aPKCδ 0aPTH 0aRANKL 0aTNF 0aVEGF 0aGp130 0aIl6st 0aOsteoblast 0aOsteoclast 0aOsteocyte0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Oct., v. 79 p.14-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014900167300001600316520183700332592002802169650001502197650001502212650001602227650004902243650001702292650002302309650001202332650001102344650004402355650001302399650002302412650001402435650003702449700002502486773008302511856008102594852000902675655001202684IND60629397220221117174058.0200601s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062939722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2018.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlasgow, Ben J.10aLigand binding studies by high speed centrifugal precipitation and linear spectral summation using ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy  ap. 345-351.  aIn ligand-protein binding experiments the major challenge is to separate bound from free ligand. Equilibrium and gel filtration separation techniques are often hampered by competition for the ligand and non-specific binding. Biophysical assays have attempted to circumvent this problem using titration calorimetry and spectroscopic methods. However, insoluble ligands require solvents that can overwhelm the discernible enthalpic changes of the protein and ligands. Spectroscopic methods are effective but may suffer from insensitivity (NMR) or the need for a lipid analog e.g., fluorescence and electron paramagnetic resonance. Our purpose is to compare the standard fluorescence assay to a technique we call high speed centrifugal precipitation. High speed centrifugal precipitation is suited to ligands that are insoluble in aqueous. The method permits separation of insoluble free ligand from that bound to the protein. The concentration of the each fraction can be precisely measured by absorbance spectrophotometry.A second technique, linear spectral summation has been published for protein-ligand associations using fluorescence of labeled ligands [1]. Here, the method is altered for use with ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) absorption spectroscopy. If the ligand complex shows a shift in the peak absorption of >8?nm, the bound and free concentrations can be measured simultaneously. The composite spectra of the samples are fit by linearly scaling UV–Vis absorption spectra of pure bound and free components at each point.•Ligand- protein binding kinetics is accessible with an ordinary spectrophotometer.•Concentrations are accurately measured from molar extinction coefficients.•The methods are ideal for lipid ligands that show absorption spectral peaks shifts in the bound and free states and/or are insoluble.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3acalorimetry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3agel chromatography 3aligands 3alipids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents 3aspectrophotometers 3atitration 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aAbduragimov, Adil R.0 tMethodsX.g2018, v. 5 p.345-351dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2018.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009900168300001400267520144400281592002801725650000801753650001301761650002101774650001901795650001601814650002401830650001401854650002001868650003001888650002001918650001001938650000901948650002501957650001301982650001901995650001702014653000902031653001002040653000802050653000802058653000902066653000802075653000802083653000702091653002802098653002902126653002802155653001502183700001602198700002002214700001602234773013002250856008502380852000902465655001202474IND60554069720221120053742.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055406972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiufang10aEffects of RNAs on chromatin accessibility and gene expression suggest RNA-mediated activation  ap. 24-32.  aThe study of the interaction between RNA and DNA sequences in activating genes has important significance for understanding the mechanisms of RNA-mediated activation. Here, we used in vitro chromatin reconstitution approach to observe whether RNAs increase DNase I digestion, plasmid transfection to observe whether RNAs promote gene expression, and bioinformatics analysis to predict the binding ability of RNAs to centromere DNA (constitutive heterochromatin). Synthetic RNAs (23nt) that were complementary to mouse albumin gene and total liver RNA increased DNase I digestion sensitivity of mouse albumin gene, suggesting that RNAs can increase chromatin accessibility. Transcribed sense-antisense tandem Alu elements activated an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene after stable transfection. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the binding strength of RNA population to centromere DNAs is significantly lower than that of their flanking sequences, which suggests that the centromere is not easily affected by RNAs produced from other transcribed regions and may be the reason why centromeres consist of constitutive heterochromatin. The results in this paper illustrate that RNAs complementary to DNA sequences play roles in activating genes. Since RNA is mainly produced from the cell’s own DNA, the work presented in this paper suggests that RNAs transcribed from DNA create feedback that activates DNA transcription.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aalbumins 3abinding capacity 3abioinformatics 3acentromeres 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3adigestion 3agene expression 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aheterochromatin 3aliver 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3aplasmids 3areporter genes 3atransfection 0aDMEM 0aasRNA 0aSDS 0aFCS 0aEGFP 0aAlb 0aRSB 0aTE 0aRNA-mediated activation 0aChromatin reconstitution 0aChromatin accessibility 0aCentromere1 aMa, Zhihong1 aKong, Xianglong1 aLv, Zhanjun0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Oct., v. 79 p.24-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03745naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002300167245014000190300001600330520182400346592002802170650001602198650002102214650001402235650002202249650001702271650000902288650001302297650001102310650001102321650001702332650002402349650001302373650001202386650003902398650003402437650007102471650007502542650005402617650002902671650001102700650007302711650002902784650004402813650003802857650000902895700002102904700002302925700001802948773012002966856008403086852000903170655001203179IND4470131020221123023149.0141111e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447013102DNAL7 a228405902pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Neill, Siobhan10aEvaluation of cytokines and hormones in dogs before and after treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis and in uncomplicated diabetes mellitus  ap. 276-283.  aIn human beings, diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) are recognized as proinflammatory states and dysregulation of cytokines has been linked to some potentially fatal complications. Cytokine profiles of dogs with DM or DKA have not been reported. The objectives of this study were to compare cytokine and hormone concentrations in dogs with DKA before and after resolution of ketoacidosis, to compare these concentrations before treatment of DKA to those measured in dogs with uncomplicated DM and healthy dogs, and to compare concentrations in dogs with uncomplicated DM to those measured in healthy dogs. 27 dogs were included in this prospective clinical study. 18 dogs had naturally-occurring disease (9 DKA and 9 DM) and 9 dogs were healthy. Serum GMCSF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, CXCL8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, IFNγ, IP-10, TNFα, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), Keratinocyte Chemoattractant (KC), glucagon, leptin, adiponectin, and resistin were assayed using Milliplex MAP Canine kits.² , ³ IL-18, resistin, and GMCSF concentrations were significantly higher in dogs with DKA before treatment compared to after resolution of ketoacidosis. CXCL8, MCP-1, KC, and resistin were significantly higher in DKA dogs compared to healthy controls, and KC was also significantly higher in DKA compared to DM dogs. Additionally, CXCL8 and MCP-1 were significantly higher in dogs with DM compared to healthy controls. Significant differences were not detected in concentrations of the other measured analytes, including glucagon. It is concluded that IL-18, resistin, GMCSF, and KC may be involved in the pathogenesis of canine DKA, and their importance in this pathogenesis may be as great as that of glucagon. Dysregulation of CXCL8 and MCP-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of DM in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3achemoattractants 3acytokines 3adiabetes mellitus 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aglucagon 3ahumans 3aleptin 3apathogenesis 3aprospective studies 3aresistin 2aAnimals 2aChemokine CCL2xbloodximmunology. 2aCytokinesxbloodximmunology. 2aDiabetes Mellitusxbloodximmunologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aDiabetic Ketoacidosisxbloodximmunologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxbloodximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aDogsxbloodximmunology. 2aFemale 2aGranulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factorxbloodximmunology. 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 2aInterleukin-18ximmunologyxphysiology. 2aInterleukin-8xbloodximmunology. 2aMale1 aDrobatz, Kenneth1 aSatyaraj, Ebenezer1 aHess, Rebecka0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 148, no. 3-4 p.276-283dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003500184245008800219300002000307506007600327520101400403592002801417506003701445650000801482650001601490650002101506650001401527650001101541650000701552650002801559700001901587700001801606700002001624773017601644856008301820852000901903655001201912IND4481172820221207081906.0120502e20111213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448117282DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11136151082doi7 aPMC32501572pmcid7 a221095472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatchelor-McAuley, Christopher13aTheelectrochemistry of quinizarin revealed through its mediated reduction of oxygen  ap. 19891-19895.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAfter 35Â years the hunt for improved anthracycline antibiotics is unabated but has yet to achieve the levels of clinical success desired. Electrochemical techniques provide a large amount of kinetic and thermodynamic information, but the use of such procedures is hindered by issues of sensitivity and selectivity. This work demonstrates how by harnessing the mechanism of catalytic reduction of oxygen by the quinone functionality present within the anthracycline structure it is possible to study the reactive moiety in nanomolar concentration. This methodology allows electrochemical investigation of the intercalation of quinizarin into DNA and, in particular, the quinone oxidation and degradation mechanism. The reversible reduction of the quinizarin, which in the presence of oxygen leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species, is found to occur at -0.535Â V (vs. SCE) pHÂ 6.84 and the irreversible oxidation leading to the molecules degradation occurs at +0.386Â V (vs. SCE) pHÂ 6.84.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aantibiotics 3aelectrochemistry 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3areactive oxygen species1 aDimov, Ivan B.1 aAldous, Leigh1 aCompton, R.

In mice, knock-out of Sox9 prior to sex determination leads to XY sex reversal, while Sox9 inactivation after sex determination leads to spermatogenesis defects. SOX9 specifies the differentiation and function of Sertoli cells from somatic cell precursors, which then orchestrate the development and maintenance of other testicular cell types, largely through unknown mechanisms. Here, we describe a novel testicular target gene of SOX9, Ets variant factor 5 (ETV5), a transcription factor responsible for maintaining the spermatogonial stem cell niche. Etv5 was highly expressed in wild-type XY but not XX mouse fetal gonads, with ETV5 protein localized in the Sertoli cells, interstitial cells and germ cells of the testis. In XY Sox9 knock-out gonads, Etv5 expression was strongly down-regulated. Similarly, knock-down of SOX9 in the human Sertoli-like cell line NT2/D1 caused a decrease in ETV5 gene expression. Transcriptomic analysis of NT2/D1 cells over-expressing SOX9 showed that ETV5 expression was increased in response to SOX9. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation of these cells, as well as of embryonic mouse gonads, showed direct binding of SOX9 to ETV5 regulatory regions. We demonstrate that SOX9 was able to activate ETV5 expression via a conserved SOX site in the 5′ regulatory region, mutation of which led to loss of activation. In conclusion, we present a novel target gene of SOX9 in the testis, and suggest that SOX9 regulation of ETV5 contributes to the control of male fertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSertoli cells 3achromatin 3agene expression 3agenes 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3amale fertility 3amice 3amutation 3aprecipitin tests 3asex determination 3asex reversal 3asomatic cells 3aspermatogenesis 3astem cells 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 0aAGRF 0aAmh 0aBAC 0aCCL9 0aCSLM 0aCYP17A1 0aCyp26b1 0aCXCL12 0aDAPI 0aDgkg 0aDhh 0aDmrt1 0aDSD 0aEts 0aEtv1 0aEtv4 0aEtv5 0aFACS 0aFgfr2 0aFgf9 0aGdnf 0aGstm6 0aHA 0aKOH 0aLuc 0aNCBI 0aNOA 0aPea3 0aPtgds 0aRet 0aRIPA 0aSCO 0aSdha 0aSf1 0aSox9 0aSry 0aSSC 0aTra2b 0aVnn1 0aDisorders of sex development 0aMale infertility 0aTestis 0aDNA binding protein 0aSOX proteins 0aEts factor 0aGene transcription 0aTranscription regulation1 aLavery, Rowena1 aSvingen, Terje1 aKelly, Sabine1 aLudbrook, Louisa1 aBagheri-Fam, Stefan1 aKoopman, Peter1 aHarley, Vincent0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Oct., v. 79 p.41-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01668naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245004500171300001800216520081700234592002801051650002201079650001101101650001201112650002001124650001601144700002501160700002101185773010301206856004801309852000901357655001201366IND50063915820221121031419.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006391582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-012-0111-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolinos-Senante, M.10aTariffs and Cost Recovery in Water Reuse  ap. 1797-1808.  aIn water stressed areas, water reuse has been identified as a key component of integral water resource management. However, the economics of water reuse projects are a major barrier for their implementation. The objectives of pricing for water demand management, pricing for encouraging the use of regenerated water, and pricing for cost recovery are not simultaneously achievable. In this paper, the major constraints hindering the implementation of the cost recovery principle in water reuse have been identified. Moreover, a two-part tariff with a combination of a decreasing and increasing rate structure for the variable charge is proposed as a partial solution to improve water reuse pricing. Finally, some policy recommendations from the perspective of integrated water resource management are formulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3aprices 3atariffs 3avariable charge 3awater reuse1 aHernandez-Sancho, F.1 aSala-Garrido, R.0 tWater resources management.g2013 Apr., v. 27, no. 6 p.1797-1808dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-012-0111-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011200164300002000276520160400296592002801900650001501928650001501943650002001958650001301978650001701991650001902008650001502027650001902042650001402061650001802075650001402093650001602107650001602123650001502139650001802154650002702172650001702199650001602216650002002232700001402252700001602266700001702282700001402299700001302313700001702326773012702343856008102470852000902551655001202560IND60586415620221120115959.0171213e20171121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058641562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b041642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaolin10aRational Design of Antifouling Polymeric Nanocomposite for Sustainable Fluoride Removal from NOM-Rich Water  ap. 13363-13371.  aThe presence of natural organic matter (NOM) exerts adverse effects on adsorptive removal of various pollutants including fluoride from water. Herein, we designed a novel nanocomposite adsorbent for preferable and sustainable defluoridation from NOM-rich water. The nanocomposite (HZO@HCA) is obtained by encapsulating hydrous zirconium oxide nanoparticles (HZO NPs) inside hyper-cross-linked polystyrene anion exchanger (HCA) binding tertiary amine groups. Another commercially available nanocomposite HZO@D201, with the host of a cross-linked polystyrene anion exchanger (D201) binding ammonium groups, was involved for comparison. HZO@HCA features with abundant micropores instead of meso-/macropores of HZO@D201, resulting in the inaccessible sites for NOM due to the size exclusion. Also, the tertiary amine groups of HCA favor an efficient desorption of the slightly loaded NOM from HZO@HCA. As expected, Sigma-Aldrich humic acid even at 20 mg of DOC/L did not exert any observable effect on fluoride sequestration by HZO@HCA, whereas a significant inhibition was observed for HZO@D201. Cyclic adsorption runs further verified the superior reusability of HZO@HCA for defluoridation from NOM-rich water. In addition, the HZO@HCA column could generate ∼80 bed volume (BV) effluent from a synthetic fluoride-containing groundwater to meet the drinking water standard (<1.5 mg F/L), whereas HCA and HZO@D201 columns could only generate <5 and ∼40 BV effluents, respectively. This study is believed to shed new light on how to rationally design antifouling nanocomposites for water remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aadverse effects 3aammonium 3acrosslinking 3adefluoridation 3adesorption 3adrinking water 3aeffluents 3aencapsulation 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3ahumic acids 3amicropores 3ananoparticles 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolystyrenes 3aremediation 3azirconium oxide1 aZhang, Lu1 aLi, Zhixian1 aZhao, Jiang,1 aZheng, Qi1 aLin, Bin1 aPan, Bingcai0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2017 Nov. 21, v. 51, no. 22 p.13363-13371dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.7b041643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245015100180500002200331520125100353592002801604650001201632650001401644650001201658650002901670650001301699650001001712650001701722650001801739650001901757650001101776650002501787650001901812650001401831653002101845653002701866653001701893653001501910653001801925653002001943700002001963700002401983773005302007856008502060852000902145655001202154IND60556654820221121082032.0161102s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055665482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2016.10.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFréchette-Viens, Laurie10aPractical limitations of Single Particle ICP-MS in the determination of nanoparticle size distributions and dissolution: case of rare earth oxides  aPre-press version  aThe applicability of single particle ICP-MS (SP-ICP-MS) for the analysis of nanoparticle size distributions and the determination of particle numbers was evaluated using the rare earth oxide, La2O3, as a model particle. The composition of the storage containers, as well as the ICP-MS sample introduction system were found to significantly impact SP-ICP-MS analysis. While La2O3 nanoparticles (La2O3 NP) did not appear to interact strongly with sample containers, adsorptive losses of La3+ (over 24hours) were substantial (> 72%) for fluorinated ethylene propylene bottles as opposed to polypropylene (<10%). Furthermore, each part of the sample introduction system (nebulizers made of Perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) or glass, PFA capillary tubing, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) peristaltic pump tubing) contributed to La3+ adsorptive losses. On the other hand, the presence of natural organic matter in the nanoparticle suspensions led to a decreased adsorptive loss in both the sample containers and the introduction system, suggesting that SP-ICP-MS may nonetheless be appropriate for NP analysis in environmental matrices. Coupling of an ion-exchange resin to the SP-ICP-MS led to more accurate determinations of the La2O3 NP size distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aatomizers 3abottles 3aenvironmental assessment 3aethylene 3aglass 3aion exchange 3ananoparticles 3aorganic matter 3aoxides 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolypropylenes 3apropylene 0aRare earth oxide 0aSingle Particle ICP-MS 0aIon-Exchange 0aAdsorption 0aNanoparticles 0aLanthanum oxide1 aHadioui, Madjid1 aWilkinson, Kevin J.0 tTalanta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.10.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245010600184300001600290520136600306592002801672650001601700650001601716650002101732650001901753650002801772650001001800650001801810650001401828650002101842650000701863650002001870650001401890650001401904650001601918650002201934651002101956700001701977700001801994700002002012700001802032700001802050700001702068700002302085773009902108856008102207852000902288655001202297IND60081433020221119202112.0150217e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008143302DNAL7 a248483822pmid7 a10.1007/s12033-014-9767-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Sun Mee10aCharacterization of Cryptopygus antarcticus Endo-β-1,4-Glucanase from Bombyx mori Expression Systems  ap. 878-889.  aEndo-β-1,4-glucanase (CaCel) from Antarctic springtail, Cryptopygus antarcticus, a cellulase with high activity at low temperature, shows potential industrial use. To obtain sufficient active cellulase for characterization, CaCel gene was expressed in Bombyx mori-baculovirus expression systems. Recombinant CaCel (rCaCel) has been expressed in Escherichia coli (Ec-CaCel) at temperatures below 10 °C, but the expression yield was low. Here, rCaCel with a silkworm secretion signal (Bm-CaCel) was successfully expressed and secreted into pupal hemolymph and purified to near 90 % purity by Ni-affinity chromatography. The yield and specific activity of rCaCel purified from B. mori were estimated at 31 mg/l and 43.2 U/mg, respectively, which is significantly higher than the CaCel yield obtained from E. coli (0.46 mg/l and 35.8 U/mg). The optimal pH and temperature for the rCaCels purified from E. coli and B. mori were 3.5 and 50 °C. Both rCaCels were active at a broad range of pH values and temperatures, and retained more than 30 % of their maximal activity at 0 °C. Oligosaccharide structural analysis revealed that Bm-CaCel contains elaborated N- and O-linked glycans, whereas Ec-CaCel contains putative O-linked glycans.

Even small changes of the frequency, magnitude, and timing of drying and rewetting can episodically turn those ecosystems into a source for matter.To understand such changes we investigated the effects on top soils of three hydro-geomorphological units that are typical for floodplains: depression, levee, and plateau. They show distinct characteristics regarding soil type, trace element (TE) pollution level and hydrology. In the laboratory we used an automated biogeochemical microcosm set up to simulate oxidized–reduced cycles to monitor the effects of strong fluctuating redox potential (EH), on pH, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), sulfur (S), nitrate (NO3), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in the soil solution.The results indicated different responses regarding the course of EH/pH and different release patterns of TEs for each hydro-geomorphological unit separately. Both could be mainly allocated to their explicit spatial characteristics; due to differences in its buffer capacities and to the interaction between pH-value and microbial activity. In particular, we could demonstrate that a combination of several biogeochemical factors may influence TE release or retention in floodplain soils by means of generalized additive models (GAMs). Using those, Fe and S were identified as most important factors that determined the dynamics of TEs in all three studied soils; concentrations of As, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Zn increased with increasing Fe-concentrations whereas Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Zn seem correspondingly to be dependent on S that went along with the course of the oxidized–reduced cycle.Still, several uncertainties between environmental changes and TE release from floodplain soils may exist. Thus, the fate of dissolved TEs in river-floodplain ecosystems needs to be taken under serious consideration since the ecotoxicology threat of them is of undisputed risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial soils 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adissolved organic carbon 3adrying 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3afloodplains 3ahydrology 3airon 3amanganese 3amicrobial activity 3amodels 3anickel 3anitrates 3apH 3aplateaus 3apollution 3aredox potential 3arisk 3asulfur 3auncertainty 3azinc 0aTrace metals 0aFloodplain soils 0aMicrocosm experiments 0aClimate change1 aRinklebe, Jörg,1 aBork, H.-R.,0 tEcological engineering.g2015 Oct., v. 83 p.485-495dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011100167300001300278520207200291592002802363650002702391650001402418650001302432650002402445650001202469650002102481650002002502650001202522650002102534650002102555650001102576650000902587650003402596650002502630650002402655653002502679653001002704653002302714653001302737653001202750653001102762700001302773700001402786700001702800700001502817700001702832700001702849700001602866700001402882700001402896700001302910700001702923700001802940773012902958856008503087852000903172655001203181IND60554069920221120022523.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055406992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Chunyang10aThioredoxin-interacting protein regulates lipid metabolism via Akt/mTOR pathway in diabetic kidney disease  ap. 1-13.  aAbnormal lipid metabolism contributes to the renal lipid accumulation, which is associated with diabetic kidney disease, but its precise mechanism remains unclear. The growing evidence demonstrates that thioredoxin-interacting protein is involved in regulating cellular glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, we investigated the effects of thioredoxin-interacting protein on lipid accumulation in diabetic kidney disease. In contrast to the diabetic wild-type mice, the physical and biochemical parameters were improved in the diabetic thioredoxin-interacting protein knockout mice. The increased renal lipid accumulation, expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, and phosphorylated Akt and mTOR associated with diabetes in wild-type mice was attenuated in diabetic thioredoxin-interacting protein knockout mice. Furthermore, thioredoxin-interacting protein knockout significantly increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferaser 1 in diabetic kidneys. In vitro experiments, using HK-2 cells, revealed that knockdown of thioredoxin-interacting protein inhibited high glucose-mediated lipid accumulation, expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, as well as activation of Akt and mTOR. Moreover, knockdown of thioredoxin-interacting protein reversed high glucose-induced reduction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 and carnitine palmitoyltransferaser 1 expression in HK-2 cells. Importantly, blockade of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway with LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, replicated these effects of thioredoxin-interacting protein silencing. Taken together, these data suggest that thioredoxin-interacting protein deficiency alleviates diabetic renal lipid accumulation through regulation of Akt/mTOR pathway, thioredoxin-interacting protein may be a potential therapeutic target for diabetic kidney disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3acarnitine 3adiabetes 3afatty-acid synthase 3aglucose 3ain vitro studies 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3aknockout mutants 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3amice 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprotein deficiencies 3asignal transduction 0aDiabetic nephropathy 0aTXNIP 0aLipid accumulation 0aAkt/mTOR 0aSREBP-1 0aPPARα1 aWu, Ming1 aLiu, Huan1 aRen, Yunzhuo1 aDu, Yunxia1 aWu, Haijiang1 aWei, Jinying1 aLiu, Chuxin1 aYao, Fang1 aWang, Hui1 aZhu, Yan1 aDuan, Huijun1 aShi, Yonghong0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Oct., v. 79 p.1-13dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245008200204300001600286520168300302592002801985650001602013650002002029650001002049650002002059650001802079650001702097650001102114650002202125650001102147650001302158650001902171650000902190650001902199650001102218650001702229650001502246651001302261700002402274700002302298700002002321773012502341856008202466852000902548655001202557IND60645261020221120122737.0190528e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064526102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-019-00718-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Sarit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2140-245010aFlood damage assessment on rice crop in the Stung Sen River Basin of Cambodia  ap. 255-263.  aIn Cambodia, rice production is important for the majority of rural populations as the main source of income. However, historical extreme flood events, especially the 2011 flood, caused significant damage to rice production due to insufficient flood preparedness and mitigation. To reduce the risk of damage, flood damage assessment is critical for providing essential information about potential risks to support the decision-making process and policy development in flood risk management. In this study, a physically based rainfall–runoff–inundation (RRI) model was used to simulate flood inundation in the Stung Sen River Basin of Cambodia, and then damage to rice crops was estimated based on the simulated inundation depth and duration that resulted from the RRI model. The simulated river discharges were calibrated and validated for 2011 and 2009 flood events, respectively. Indeed, the simulated flood inundation areas were compared with flood maps derived from satellite imagery to check their accuracy. As a result, it was confirmed that these results were reasonable and adequate. In the case of the 2011 flood, a distribution map of rice crop damage was created to represent the potentially affected rice areas at various levels of damage. Furthermore, the total of estimated affected rice areas was found to be close to the reported damage data, with an overlap of 89%. Overall, the preliminary results from this study are expected to be useful for key stakeholders at all levels, especially decision-makers, in planning better risk reduction strategies, for instance, when choosing the appropriate flood control option to cope with future extreme flood events.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop damage 3acrop production 3acrops 3adecision making 3aflood control 3aflood damage 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3arice 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3astakeholders 3awatersheds 3aCambodia1 aTakeuchi, Junichiro1 aFujihara, Masayuki1 aOeurng, Chantha0 tPaddy and water environment.g2019 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.255-263dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000129x1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-019-00718-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245011100184300001600295500001500311520133700326592002801663650001601691650002201707650001601729650002001745650001501765650001401780650001601794650001801810650001601828650001001844650001601854650001401870650001501884650002301899650003401922650004401956650001002000650002802010650001102038650001102049650000902060650002902069650002302098650002302121650003002144650001602174650002402190650004702214653001602261700002202277700001902299700002102318700001502339700001802354700001902372700001602391700001902407700001802426773009002444856008202534852000902616655001202625IND4471245520221121031254.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447124552DNAL7 a220787852pmid7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2011.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsugawa, Naoko12aA novel method based on curvature analysis for estimating the dietary vitamin K requirement in adolescents  ap. 255-260.  a2019-12-05  aBACKGROUND & AIMS: Few studies have investigated the association between vitamin K status and bone health in adolescents. We established a novel method for estimating the vitamin K status in adolescents by curvature analysis using the serum concentrations of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC)—a sensitive biomarker of vitamin K status in the bone. We also compared the vitamin K concentrations required for good bone health and for normal blood coagulation. METHOD: We enrolled 1183 healthy adolescents. For the curvature analysis, we used a logarithmic regression equation obtained from vitamin K intake and serum ucOC or plasma abnormal prothrombin (PIVKA-II) concentrations (marker for blood coagulation). The cut-off point was determined to be the vitamin K intake that showed the highest curvature. RESULTS: In adolescents, the serum ucOC concentration was negatively correlated with vitamin K intake. In the curvature analysis, requirement of vitamin K intake for good bone health and normal blood coagulation were 155–188 μg/d and 62–54 μg/d [1 μg/(kg d)], respectively; the latter result was consistent with that of a previous report. CONCLUSION: Our novel method is useful for estimating the vitamin K status; moreover, this method showed that bone metabolism requires more vitamin K than blood coagulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aosteocalcin 3ablood coagulation 3acorrelation 3abone metabolism 3abiomarkers 3aequations 3aprothrombin 3ahealth status 3amethodology 3abones 3aadolescents 3avitamin K 2aAdolescent 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Coagulationxphysiology 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aChild 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutritional Requirements 2aNutritional Status 2aOsteocalcinxblood 2aProtein Precursorsxblood 2aProthrombin 2aRegression Analysis 2aVitamin Kxadministration & dosagexblood. 0anew methods1 aUenishi, Kazuhiro1 aIshida, Hiromi1 aMinekami, Takuya1 aDoi, Ayako1 aKoike, Sayaka1 aTakase, Tomoki1 aKamao, Maya1 aMimura, Yoshio1 aOkano, Toshio0 tClinical nutrition.g2012 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.255-260dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2011.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013600160520104700296592002801343650002101371650002101392650002401413650002301437650002601460650003101486650001101517650001701528650004401545650002501589650002101614650002201635700001801657700001701675700001701692700001901709700001701728773012701745856007401872852000901946655001201955IND60751611320221121222452.0210925e20210917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075161132DNAL7 a10.3390/md190905232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Giang Nam10aIsolation of Sesquiterpenoids and Steroids from the Soft Coral Sinularia brassica and Determination of Their Absolute Configuration  aTwo undescribed rearranged cadinane-type sesquiterpenoids (1–2), named sinulaketol A-B, together with one new chlorinated steroid (3), one new gorgosterol (4), one known sesquiterpene (5), one known dibromoditerpene (6) and two known polyhydroxylated steroids (7–8) were isolated from the soft coral Sinularia brassica.

The model is based on an explicit solution, using CSMP, of the heat conduction equation and allows for time and space dependence of soil thermal properties. Measured soil temperatures were taken as input for the upper boundary. Computed temperature distributions were compared with temperatures measured below a trickle irrigated row crop, which only partially shaded the soil. There was a large variation in the surface and near surface soil temperatures with distance from the row. Ranges of the daily surface soil temperature waves were about 5°C directly below the crop and about 40°C between two crop rows. Around noon the horizontal soil heat flux in the upper soil profile was much greater than the soil heat flux in the vertical direction. Better agreement was obtained between measured soil temperatures and predicted soil temperatures when horizontal heat flux was taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aheat transfer 3amicroirrigation 3amodels 3arowcrops 3asoil heat flux 3asoil profiles 3asoil temperature1 aAguirre-Luna, O.1 aWierenga, P.

The latter type is rare and currently endangered by human activity. In order to determine the effect of reduced inflow of surface water by an earth dyke on the lake trophic state, certain biological and physico-chemical parameters were evaluated. This work focuses on two lakes of similar morphometric characteristics situated in the agricultural landscape. The effect of the earth dyke on the trophic state was positively verified. The lake situated in the catchment basin, in which the inflow of surface water was reduced, was defined as meso-eutrophic, with a small amount of phytoplankton and high water transparency. The reference lake was highly eutrophic, with low water transparency and a large amount of phytoplankton. The water body surrounded by the earth dyke was macrophytes dominated (65% of the lake area), whereas the reference lake was a phytoplankton-macrophyte type (42% of the lake area). The trophic evaluation of a lake can be underestimated because of a significant amount of biogenic compounds accumulated in plant tissues. Thus, the values of Carlson’s indices in macrophyte-dominated lakes may not account for the total amount of nutrients in the water body.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abasins 3aeutrophication 3ahumans 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3amorphometry 3anutrients 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphytoplankton 3aplant tissues 3asurface water 3atrophic relationships 3awatersheds 0aEarth dyke 0amacrophytes 0aphytoplankton 0achlorophyll-a 0aCarlson’s indices1 aLenard, Tomasz0 tArchives of environmental protection.g2014 Dec. 11, v. 40, no. 3 p.3-11dDe Gruyter Openx2083-48107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aep-2014-00253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245010200167520148800269592002801757650001901785650001701804650002001821650001301841650002601854650002801880650000901908650001401917650001901931650002101950650001901971650002401990650001802014650002402032651001002056700002502066700002602091700002602117700003002143700002902173700008902202773012202291856007402413852000902487655001202496IND60745536620221120023654.0210723e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074553662DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130723762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhami, Mansi Vijaybhai10aInfant and Young Child Feeding Practices among Adolescent Mothers and Associated Factors in India  aAdequate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) improve child survival and growth. Globally, about 18 million babies are born to mothers aged 18 years or less and have a higher likelihood of adverse birth outcomes in India due to insufficient knowledge of child growth. This paper examined factors associated with IYCF practices among adolescent Indian mothers. This cross-sectional study extracted data on 5148 children aged 0–23 months from the 2015–2016 India National Family Health Survey. Survey logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with IYCF among adolescent mothers. Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding, early initiation of breastfeeding, timely introduction of complementary feeding, minimum dietary diversity, minimum meal frequency, and minimum acceptable diet rates were: 58.7%, 43.8%, 43.3%, 16.6%, 27.4% and 6.8%, respectively. Maternal education, mode of delivery, frequency of antenatal care (ANC) clinic visits, geographical region, child’s age, and household wealth were the main factors associated with breastfeeding practices while maternal education, maternal marital status, child’s age, frequency of ANC clinic visits, geographical region, and household wealth were factors associated with complementary feeding practices. IYCF practices among adolescent mothers are suboptimal except for breastfeeding. Health and nutritional support interventions should address the factors for these indicators among adolescent mothers in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3achild growth 3achild nutrition 3achildren 3acomplementary feeding 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3aeducation 3ahealth surveys 3ahousehold income 3amarital status 3anutritional support 3aprenatal care 3aregression analysis 3aIndia1 aOgbo, Felix Akpojene1 aDiallo, Thierno M.

Anti-HCV was measured, HCV-RNA was detected based on the 5’ UTR-core region, and genotyping was done by direct sequencing of the NS5b region. Antibodies to HCV were found in 13.7 % of the samples tested (96 out of 700), while HCV-RNA was positive in 73 % of the samples (70 out of 96) and in 5 out of 385 cases of occult HCV infection. Genotypes 1 to 4 were found respectively in 14.6, 7.3, 20, 30.8 %, and genotype 6 in 13.6 %, of the 75 HCV isolates. In acute viral hepatitis (AVH), the most prevalent genotype was 2a (28.6 %), while it was 4a (28 %) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and 29.4 % in cirrhosis. Males were more prone than females to HCV infection, and the highest numbers of cases of HCV infection were recorded in the age group of 40-49 years. The major risk factors were intravenous drug abuse (IVDU) (34.6 %), multiple sexual partners (20 %) and contact with professional barbers (38.6 %). The seroprevalence of HCV in Northeast India is higher than in the rest of India. This study highlights the fact that geographical variations occur with respect to HCV genotypes, which could influence the course and progress of different type of liver diseases seen in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aantibodies 3achronic hepatitis C 3adrug abuse 3afemales 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ageographical variation 3aintravenous injection 3amales 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHepacivirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aHepatitis Cxcomplicationsxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aHepatitis C Antibodiesxblood 2aHumans 2aLiver Cirrhosisxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aSex Factors 2aYoung Adult 3aIndia 0aIndiaxepidemiology.1 aGoswami, Bhabadev1 aDas, Anup K.1 aSingh, Thongam Bhimo1 aHusain, Syed Akhtar1 aSehgal, Ashok1 aKar, Premashis0 tArchives of virology.g2012 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.2083-2093dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1374-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014200168500002200310520076000332592002801092650002201120650002001142650001101162650001401173650001401187650002601201650001701227650000901244653004101253653002401294653002101318653002101339700001701360700001601377700001701393700001601410700001401426700001601440700001701456700001801473700001701491773005301508856008501561852000901646655001201655IND60556655020221121182244.0161102s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055665502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2016.10.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xinyan10aSimultaneous determination of La, Ce, Pr, and Nd elements in aqueous solution using surface-enhanced laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy  aPre-press version  aDetermination of rare earth elements (REEs) plays an important role in the extraction process.

The emission lines of La II 394.91nm, Ce II 418.66nm, Pr II 422.29nm, and Nd II 406.10nm were selected for quantitative analysis by drying the analytical samples on a Zn metal substrate surface and optimizing the experimental parameters.

The separation procedure of the enriched diglycoside fraction of the 70% (v/v) aqueous methanolic leaf extract was first optimised on analytical XBridge C18 column (100mm×4.6mm i.d., 5μm) and central composite design combined with response surface methodology was utilized to establish the optimal separation conditions. The developed method was directly transferred to preparative XBridge Prep C18 column (100mm×19mm i.d., 5μm) and the final separation was accomplished by isocratic elution with 0.5% acetic acid-methanol-tetrahydrofuran (75.2:16.6:8.2, v/v/v) as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 13.6mL/min, in less than 12min for a single run. Under these conditions, four flavonoid diglycosides: kaempferol 3-O-α-l-arabinofuranoside-7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside, kaempferol 3,7-di-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (kaempferitrin), and reported for the first time for P. spinosa kaempferol 3-O-β-d-xylopyranoside-7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside (lepidoside) and kaempferol 3-O-α-l-arabinopyranoside-7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside, were isolated in high separation yield (84.8–94.5%) and purity (92.45–99.79%). Their structures were confirmed by extensive 1D and 2D NMR studies. Additionally, the UHPLC-PDA-ESI–MS3 qualitative profiling led to the identification of twenty-one phenolic compounds and confirmed that the isolates were the major components of the leaf material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus spinosa 3aglycosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akaempferol 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenolic compounds 3aresponse surface methodology 0aPrunus spinosa 0aPreparative HPLC 0aKaempferol 3-O-β-d-xylopyranoside-7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranoside 0aCentral composite design 0aCCD1 aMagiera, Anna1 aMatczak, Magdalena1 aPiotrowska, Dorota Gabriela1 aOlszewska, Monika Anna1 aMarchelak, Anna0 tPhytochemistry letters.g2017 June, v. 20 p.415-424dElsevier LtdaPhytochemical Society of EuropewJournal:J000000131x1874-39007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytol.2017.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013900166300001400305520140800319592002801727650001401755650002001769650001401789650001601803650002801819650004301847650002801890650000901918653001101927653001101938653001001949653000901959653000801968653001001976653001001986653001401996653002102010653002602031653001502057653003502072653000802107653004302115700001102158700001902169700001902188700001802207773013002225856008502355852000902440655001202449IND60554070120221120151044.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055407012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Hanlin,10aInhibition of ANXA7 GTPase activity by a small molecule promotes HMBOX1 translation of vascular endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo  ap. 33-40.  aHomeobox containing 1 (HMBOX1) is essential for the survival of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). However, the regulatory mechanism of HMBOX1 expression is still unclear. We recently found that a small molecule 6-amino-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine (ABO) directly targeted annexin A7 (ANXA7) and inhibited its GTPase activity. In addition, both HMBOX1 and ANXA7 participated in the autophagy and apoptosis of HUVECs. But, their relationship in the regulation of HMBOX1 expression is unknown. In this study, we found that ABO could elevate HMBOX1 at translation level through inhibiting ANXA7 GTPase activity. ABO failed to increase HMBOX1 protein level in ANXA7-deficient HUVECs. TGFB2 overlapping transcript 1 (TGFB2-OT1) that was increased by ABO facilitated HMBOX1 expression by increasing La-related protein 1 (LARP1) expression. Furthermore, the protein level of HMBOX1 was decreased under oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) treatment in HUVECs and in the aortic endothelium of apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE⁻/⁻) mice, which could be reversed by ABO in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, ANXA7 was an endogenous regulator of HMBOX1, and ABO promoted HMBOX1 translation by inhibiting ANXA7 GTPase activity and enhancing TGFB2-OT1 expression. Besides, our data suggested that HMBOX1 might be a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aatherosclerosis 3aautophagy 3aendothelium 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3alow density lipoprotein 3amice 0aHMBOX1 0aHUVECs 0aANXA7 0aTIA1 0aABO 0aLARP1 0aoxLDL 0aTGFB2-OT1 0aApoE−/− mice 0aHomeobox containing 1 0aAnnexin A7 0aTGFB2 overlapping transcript 1 0aABO 0aHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells1 aSu, Le1 aZhang, ShangLi1 aKung, HsiangFu1 aMiao, JunYing0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Oct., v. 79 p.33-40dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245009200177300001600269500000900285520087500294592002801169650001401197650001001211650001201221650001401233650000901247700001901256700001901275773014701294856009601441852000901537655001201546IND60668002420221122214908.0191125e196405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066800242DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1964.03615995002800030017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPage, A.

The effects of sample weight, color, settling time, and the level of activity on the counting characteristics of scintillator media which contain soils and layer silicates are presented. Highly statistically significant linear regressions, which differed for each solid tested, were obtained between the level of activity added and the observed activity. The differences between the materials tested were related predominantly to the color which the solid imparted to the scintillator medium. A procedure for the determination of the retention of carbon compounds by layer silicates and soils is presented. The procedure described is specific, but can easily be modified to fit the needs of related studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 14 3acolor 3aliquids 3asilicates 3asoil1 aSims, James R.1 aBingham, F.

Because paddy rice is a major summer crop in Egypt and it consumes the greatest amount of water in comparison with other crops, the authors focused on monitoring and evaluating the irrigation practices of farmers during summer and examined the extent of sufficient and equitable water distribution in the Dakalt branch canal. Three tertiary canals that had been improved under IIP were selected from upstream, midstream, and downstream along the Dakalt branch canal. Two, three, and one pumping stations were selected from the upstream, midstream, and downstream, respectively, for monitoring pump operations in order to quantify the water supply. Cropping patterns and pump operation records were collected. The irrigation water requirement for each crop was estimated using the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Penman–Monteith method. Water sufficiency (WS), which is the ratio of water supply to water demand, was then calculated, and equitable water distribution among the tertiary canals was assessed based on these results. The mean WS during the mid-irrigation season of June, July, and August for two years at the downstream tertiary canal was 0.75, which was considered to be poor sufficiency, whereas the mean WS values at the upstream and midstream tertiary canals were 0.93 and 0.93, respectively, which were considered to be good sufficiency. The downstream tertiary canal received less water than required compared with the others, and this insufficient and inequitable supply affected rice yields because the average yield downstream in 2013 and 2014 was 7.6 t ha⁻¹, while those for upstream and midstream were 10.0 and 10.5 t ha⁻¹, respectively; this difference was significant. However, WS downstream of the upstream tertiary canal in 2013 and WS upstream of the midstream tertiary canal in 2014 were below 0.8. This was attributed to a drastic change in the cropping pattern at the tertiary canal level and to the insufficient water supply to the tertiary canals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3acropping systems 3acrops 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3ainfrastructure 3airrigation management 3airrigation water 3amonitoring 3arice 3ariver deltas 3asummer 3awater distribution 3awater requirement 3awater supply 3aEgypt1 aShimizu, Katsuyuki1 aAbou El Hassan, Waleed H.1 aNakumura, Kimihito1 aWatanabe, Tsugihiro0 tPaddy and water environment.g2019 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.69-74dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000129x1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-019-00698-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012100165300001400286520138600300592002801686650001801714650002001732650001101752650001901763650001601782650001201798650000901810650001601819650001901835650002501854650002001879650001001899650001001909650001901919650001101938650001201949650002801961650001801989650001102007653001602018653002202034653003502056653000902091653002602100700002002126700001902146700002102165700002502186700002202211700001602233700005902249773008802308856008602396852000902482655001202491IND60629010820221118153352.0190206e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062901082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2018.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Qin10aSubcellular localization of microcystin in the liver and the gonads of medaka fish acutely exposed to microcystin-LR  ap. 14-21.  aAmong the diverse toxic components produced by cyanobacteria, microcystins (MCs) are one of the most toxic and notorious cyanotoxin groups. Besides their potent hepatotoxicity, MCs have been revealed to induce potential reproductive toxicity in various animal studies. However, little is still known regarding the distribution of MCs in the reproductive organ, which could directly affect reproductive cells. In order to respond to this question, an acute study was conducted in adult medaka fish (model animal) gavaged with 10 μg.g−1 body weight of pure MC-LR. The histological and immunohistochemical examinations reveal an intense distribution of MC-LR within hepatocytes along with a severe liver lesion in the toxin-treated female and male fish. Besides being accumulated in the hepatocytes, MC-LR was also found in the connective tissue of the ovary and the testis, as well as in oocytes and degenerative spermatocyte-like structures but not spermatocytes. Both liver and gonad play important roles in the reproductive process of oviparous vertebrates. This observation constitutes the first observation of the presence of MC-LR in reproductive cells (female, oocytes) of a vertebrate model with in vivo study. Our results, which provide intracellular localization of MC-LR in the gonad, advance our understanding of the potential reproductive toxicity of MC-LR in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aOryzias latipes 3aadults 3aanimal ovaries 3abody weight 3afemales 3afish 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain vivo studies 3aliver 3amales 3amicrocystin-LR 3amodels 3aoocytes 3areproductive toxicology 3aspermatocytes 3atestes 0aMicrocystin 0aReproductive cell 0aImmunogold electron microscopy 0aOATP 0aReproductive toxicity1 aDjediat, Chakib1 aHuet, Hélène1 aDuval, Charlotte1 aLe Manach, Séverine1 aBernard, Cécile,1 aEdery, Marc1 aMarie, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9880-55410 tToxicon.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 159 p.14-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2018.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013100163300001600294520154900310592002801859650002601887650001901913650000901932650001601941650001801957650001001975650002301985650001502008650001102023650002202034650001502056651001202071700002402083700002102107700002702128773010302155856007302258852000902331655001202340IND60408650420221123025324.0150916e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040865042DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.122172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacdonald, S.

FFM was salvaged at two depths (15 and 40 cm) from a recently harvested native aspen forest and immediately placed at the same depths on the reclamation site. Total richness (approximately 61 species in 96 subplots) was similar in each of 3 years post‐placement; total richness for all 3 years combined was 87 including 34 typical boreal forest understory species plus 30 other natives. The deeper treatment reduced cover of all species, native and non‐native species in year 1. In year 3, the deeper treatment still had lower cover of non‐native species but had higher cover of forest understory species in years 2 and 3. The deeper treatment also resulted in lower species richness per plot, but only in year 1. In year 2 (when the biennial clover was at its tall stage), the cover crop treatment was associated with lower cover of non‐native species but did not affect the cover of native forest understory species. Direct placement of FFM can help facilitate establishment of a diverse native boreal forest understory in a reclaimed landscape. Although richness and cover may be initially higher with shallower salvage and placement, deeper salvage may ultimately be better for encouraging establishment of native forest understory species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelilotus officinalis 3aboreal forests 3acoal 3acover crops 3aforest litter 3ahumus 3aintroduced species 3alandscapes 3asowing 3aspecies diversity 3aunderstory 3aAlberta1 aSnively, Alia E.

Cultivars as Revealed by Simple Sequence Repeat and Novel Genic Markers  ap. 925-938.  a2019-12-06  aField pea (Pisum sativum L.) is an important cool season legume crop widely grown around the world. This research provides a basis for selection of pea germplasm across geographical regions in current and future breeding and genetic mapping efforts for pea improvement. Eleven novel genic markers were developed from pea expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences having significant similarity with gene calls from Medicago truncatula spanning at least one intron. In this study, 96 cultivars widely grown or used in breeding programs in the USA and Canada were analyzed for genetic diversity using 31 microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 11 novel EST-derived genic markers. The polymorphic information content varied from 0.01–0.56 among SSR markers and 0.04–0.43 among genic markers. The results showed that SSR and EST-derived genic markers displayed one or more highly reproducible, multi-allelic, and easy to score loci ranging from 200 to 700 bp in size. Genetic diversity was assessed through unweighted neighbor-joining method, and 96 varieties were grouped into three main clusters based on the dissimilarity matrix. Four subpopulations were determined through STRUCTURE analysis with no significant geographic separation of the subpopulations. The findings of the present study can be used to select diverse genotypes to be used as parents of crosses aimed for breeding improved pea cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm 3acultivars 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aloci 3apeas 3aparents 3apopulation structure 3aexpressed sequence tags 3acrossing 3achromosome mapping 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aPisum sativum 3aMedicago truncatula 3aintrons 3aCanada 3aUnited States 0agenes1 aKumar, Ajay1 aMamidi, Sujan1 aMcPhee, Kevin0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2014 Oct., v. 56, no. 10 p.925-938dSpringer-Verlagx1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-014-9772-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04378naa a2200985 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012300168300001400291520174500305592002802050650001802078650002102096650001302117650002602130650002502156650001902181650001202200650002502212650001502237650001502252650001102267650002402278650002602302650001602328650001902344650002302363650000802386650001602394650001702410650002702427650004302454650004402497650002402541650003002565650004802595650002502643650002002668653001102688653000802699653000702707653000802714653000902722653000802731653000702739653000702746653000802753653000902761653001602770653000902786653000902795653001102804653000802815653000802823653000802831653001102839653000902850653000802859653000802867653001102875653000702886653000802893653000902901653000802910653001702918653002002935653001802955653001702973700002102990700001203011700001403023700001503037700001403052700001603066700001903082700005503101773013003156856008503286852000903371655001203380IND60554070220221120151141.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055407022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeneses, M.J.10aPioglitazone increases the glycolytic efficiency of human Sertoli cells with possible implications for spermatogenesis  ap. 52-60.  aPioglitazone is a synthetic agonist for the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recently we reported that antidiabetic drugs regulate the nutritional support of spermatogenesis by Sertoli cells. Herein, we investigate the effects of pioglitazone on human Sertoli cells metabolism. Human Sertoli cells were cultured in the presence of pioglitazone (1, 10, 100μM). Protein levels of phosphofructokinase 1, lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, glucose transporters (GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3), monocarboxylate transporter 4 and oxidative phosphorylation complexes were determined by Western blot. Lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase activity were assessed and metabolite production and consumption determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. Mitochondrial membrane potential was also determined. Glucose consumption more than doubled in human Sertoli cells stimulated with pioglitazone 100μM. Mitochondrial complex II protein levels increased 50% with exposure to pioglitazone (100μM) in human Sertoli cells, though mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased by 32%. The pharmacological concentration of pioglitazone (10μM) almost doubled lactate production and established crucial correlations among key intervenient of glycolysis. Moreover, in the same concentration, alanine aminotransferase decreased more than 80%. Our results suggest that pioglitazone (10μM) increases the efficiency of the glycolytic flux and lactate production by human Sertoli cells, which is essential to sustain and preserve the spermatogenic event. Thus, pioglitazone may improve male fertility and thus, be considered a suitable antidiabetic drug for men in reproductive age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSertoli cells 3aWestern blotting 3aagonists 3aalanine dehydrogenase 3aalanine transaminase 3acultured cells 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aglycolysis 3ahexokinase 3ahumans 3ahypoglycemic agents 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactic acid 3amale fertility 3amembrane potential 3amen 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutritional support 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3aphosphofructokinases 3aspermatogenesis 0a1H NMR 0aALT 0aCI 0aCII 0aCIII 0aCIV 0aCV 0aDM 0aFBS 0aGLUT 0aHam’s F12 0aHBSS 0ahSCs 0aIgG-AP 0aITS 0aLDH 0aMCT 0aOXPHOS 0aPCOS 0aPFK 0aPio 0aPPARγ 0aSC 0aSRB 0aT2DM 0aTZD 0aPioglitazone 0aSpermatogenesis 0aSertoli cells 0aMitochondria1 aBernardino, R.L.1 aSá, R.1 aSilva, J.1 aBarros, A.1 aSousa, M.1 aSilva, B.M.1 aOliveira, P.F.1 aAlves, M.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7635-783X0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Oct., v. 79 p.52-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245011400172520118800286592002801474650002301502650002801525650001201553650002101565650001801586650001301604650001901617650000801636650001601644651001001660700002501670700002101695700002901716700002601745700002501771700003001796700003001826773012201856856007401978852000902052655001202061IND60745536920221120031619.0210723e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074553692DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130723802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Sánchez, Eduardo 10aPerceived Stress and Increased Food Consumption during the ‘Third Wave’ of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people worldwide. An increase in perceived stress can lead to unhealthy behaviors such as increased food consumption. The aim of this study was to find the level of perceived stress and its relationship with increased food consumption during the “third wave” of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. This was a cross-sectional study that employed anonline self-reported frequency of consumption questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale-10. A total of 637 subjects participated and 83.6% of respondents had moderate or high stress—more prevalent in the female and young respondents. Moreover, 36.1% of respondents reported that they had increased the frequency of consumption of some foods, mainly nuts, snacks, and jellybeans, along with coffee, tea, cocoa, and soft drinks. Eating between meals was more pronounced in those with high stress (65.1%) than in those with moderate stress (40.4%) and low stress (20.2%). Furthermore, the respondents with high stress reported greater weight gain. Thus, the results show that the level of perceived stress during the ‘third wave’ of this pandemic increased food consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3across-sectional studies 3afemales 3afood consumption 3amental health 3apandemic 3aquestionnaires 3atea 3aweight gain 3aSpain1 aDíaz-Jimenez, Jara 1 aRosety, Ignacio 1 aAlférez, Maria José M.1 aDíaz, Antonio Jesús1 aRosety, Miguel Angel1 aOrdonez, Francisco Javier1 aRosety-Rodriguez, Manuel 0 tNutrients.g2021 July 12, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130723803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04363naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245016200208300001400370506007600384520210400460592002802564506003702592650002202629650001202651650002802663650001202691650001502703650002502718650001702743650003102760650001402791650001502805650001202820650002102832650001002853650001702863650001102880650001202891650002102903650001102924650001302935650001202948650003702960650002402997650002203021650001503043650002003058650001403078653000903092653001403101653001003115653002003125653001203145653002703157653001703184653001603201700002303217700001903240700002703259700002003286700002703306700006003333773013003393856008503523852000903608655001203617IND60554070320221207132408.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055407032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0122doi7 aPMC50672042pmcid7 a275155902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlaiwy, Amro10aCessation of biomechanical stretch model of C2C12 cells models myocyte atrophy and anaplerotic changes in metabolism using non-targeted metabolomics analysis  ap. 80-92.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStudies of skeletal muscle disuse, either in patients on bed rest or experimentally in animals (immobilization), have demonstrated that decreased protein synthesis is common, with transient parallel increases in protein degradation. Muscle disuse atrophy involves a process of transition from slow to fast myosin fiber types. A shift toward glycolysis, decreased capacity for fat oxidation, and substrate accumulation in atrophied muscles have been reported, as has accommodation of the liver with an increased gluconeogenic capacity. Recent studies have modeled skeletal muscle disuse by using cyclic stretch of differentiated myotubes (C2C12), which mimics the loading pattern of mature skeletal muscle, followed by cessation of stretch. We utilized this model to determine the metabolic changes using non-targeted metabolomics analysis of the media. We identified increases in amino acids resulting from muscle atrophy-induced protein degradation (largely sarcomere) that occurs with muscle atrophy that are involved in feeding the Kreb’s cycle through anaplerosis. Specifically, we identified increased alanine/proline metabolism (significantly elevated proline, alanine, glutamine, and asparagine) and increased α-ketoglutaric acid, the proposed Kreb’s cycle intermediate being fed by the alanine/proline metabolic anaplerotic mechanism. Additionally, several unique pathways not clearly delineated in previous studies of muscle unloading were seen, including: (1) elevated keto-acids derived from branched chain amino acids (i.e. 2-ketoleucine and 2-keovaline), which feed into a metabolic pathway supplying acetyl-CoA and 2-hydroxybutyrate (also significantly increased); and (2) elevated guanine, an intermediate of purine metabolism, was seen at 12h unloading. Given the interest in targeting different aspects of the ubiquitin proteasome system to inhibit protein degradation, this C2C12 system may allow the identification of direct and indirect alterations in metabolism due to anaplerosis or through other yet to be identified mechanisms using a non-targeted metabolomics approach.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aalanine 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3aanimals 3aasparagine 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomechanics 3abranched chain amino acids 3aglutamine 3aglycolysis 3aguanine 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3amyosin 3apatients 3aproline 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein synthesis 3asarcomeres 3askeletal muscle 3aubiquitin 0aPKM1 0aTCA cycle 0aC2C12 0aBiaxial stretch 0aAtrophy 0aHypertrophy regression 0aMetabolomics 0aAnaplerosis1 aQuintana, Megan T.1 aBain, James R.1 aMuehlbauer, Michael J.1 aBrown, David I.1 aStansfield, William E.1 aWillis, Monte S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0769-58160 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2016 Oct., v. 79 p.80-92dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2016.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100006100188245010000249300001600349506007600365520199000441592002802431506003702459650001502496650001602511650001202527650002502539700002502564700002002589700002002609700002002629773008302649856008102732852000902813655001202822IND60629398320221207055534.0200601s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062939832DNAL7 aPMC60317592pmcid7 a299841912pmid7 a10.1016/j.mex.2018.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaujoks, Frederik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1712-647310aExpert-based controllability assessment of control transitions from automated to manual driving  ap. 579-592.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUp to a level of full vehicle automation, drivers will have to be available as a fallback level and take back manual control of the vehicle in case of system limits or failures. Before introducing automated vehicles to the consumer market, the controllability of these control transitions has to be demonstrated. This paper presents a novel procedure for an expert-based controllability assessment of control transitions from automated to manual driving. A standardized rating scheme is developed that allows trained raters to integrate different aspects of driving performance during control transitions (e.g., quality of lateral and longitudinal control, adequateness of signalling to other road users, etc.) into one global controllability measure based on video material of the driving situation. The method is adapted from an existing assessment procedure that has been successfully applied to assess the criticality of driving situations in manual driving conditions (e.g., assessment of substance-induced impairments, assessment of fitness-to-drive of novice drivers). This paper presents the rating procedure, including instructions of how to code relevant qualities of the drivers’ performance with accompanying video-demonstrations, and material used for rater training.•A rating procedure for an expert-based controllability assessment of control transitions from automated to manual driving based on observation of video material was adapted from an existing method used in studies on manual driving.•The advantage of this method consists in an integration of different dimensions of driving performance (e.g., operational and tactical driving behaviour, criticality of the situation) into one global controllability measure.•The method allows an assessment and comparison of diverse take-over scenarios, detached from driver performance variables.•The accompanying video-based training material allows reproducible and reliable execution of the rating procedure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautomation 3acontrollers 3amarkets 3avehicles (equipment)1 aWiedemann, Katharina1 aSchömig, Nadja1 aJarosch, Oliver1 aGold, Christian0 tMethodsX.g2018, v. 5 p.579-592dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2018.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007600169300001600245500001900261520095500280592002801235650001001263650001101273650001801284650000901302650001501311653001701326653003801343653003401381653001701415700002601432700003201458700006901490773010301559856008501662852000901747655001201756IND60706715520221119023304.0201023e20200920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070671552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraga, Vanessa10aProduction and characterization of pineapple-mint juice by spray drying  ap. 409-419.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work studied pineapple-mint juice drying by spray drying. The effect of 0, 3, and 15% of maltodextrin addition in the solution fed in the spray dryer was evaluated. The results showed that it is possible to dry pineapple-mint juice without a carrier agent. A two-level full factorial design of experiments was applied to quantify the effect of spray drying conditions (including the addition of 3% maltodextrin on pineapple-mint juice) on powder physicochemical properties. The estimated effects demonstrated that all variables have affected responses (except powder solubility). Interested in investigating pineapple-mint drying without maltodextrin, the two-level factorial design was further expanded to a central composite design, and additional experiments were realized, resulting in preservation of the natural green color of pineapple-mint juice, and a yield of 35%. The results suggest that mint may help in pineapple-mint juice drying.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3ajuices 3amaltodextrins 3amint 3asolubility 0aJuice powder 0aPowder physicochemical properties 0aFactorial experimental design 0aMaltodextrin1 aGuidi, Letícia Rocha1 ade Santana, Ricardo Corrêa1 aZotarelli, Marta Fernanda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1609-68660 tPowder technology.g2020 Sept. 20, v. 375 p.409-419dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007900169300001600248520204400264592002802308650001602336650002202352650001002374650002502384650001402409650001202423650002102435650001402456650001702470650001402487650002002501653000802521653001402529653001702543653000802560653002302568700001802591700001602609700001602625773011302641856008602754852000902840655001202849IND60634075920221117032456.0191214e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063407592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.03.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriese, Emily10aEcological network analysis of solar photovoltaic power generation systems  ap. 368-378.  aEcological network analysis (ENA) is emerging as a powerful tool for studying complex technological systems and can reveal information not captured by life cycle assessment (LCA). In this study, we developed an ENA based on the material, energy, and water life cycle inventory of CdTe photovoltaic (PV) modules. We defined one ecological (sun) and eight technological (manufacturing, construction, power grid, solar energy, fuel, water, recycling and waste treatment, and dissipation) network compartments. We studied the interactions of these compartments using throughflow analysis (TA), network utility analysis (NUA), network control analysis (NCA), and network stability analysis (NSA). The TA revealed that total throughflow of the system (TST), or quantified total size of the system is for producing 1 kWh of electricity from solar power is 604 kWh. The NUA assessed the symbiotic relationships within the system and revealed that both quantitative and qualitative beneficial relationships between compartments are prominent. Also, mutualism and synergism indexes were calculated as 2.4 and 7.0, respectively, indicating that most of the system compartments are gaining energy; thus, the system is flexible and preferable for industries when the system compartments are increasing their involvement and cycling within the system. The NCA results indicated that most of the compartments have control over the dissipation compartment, which suggested that large amounts of energy are lost in those compartments. Also, not surprisingly, almost all the compartments were dependent on fuel and water. Our NSA results showed that the current solar energy system lacks systematic diversity and resilience; it lacks the ability to return to the original state when the system is stressed. However, the main reason for these results is the low conversion efficiency of photonic energy to electricity. The same issue would apply to all other engineered power generation systems as well due to low fundamental limits of energy conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy conversion 3afuels 3alife cycle inventory 3amutualism 3aphotons 3apower generation 3arecycling 3asolar energy 3asynergism 3awaste treatment 0aENA 0aPV system 0aSolar energy 0aLCA 0aEcological network1 aPiezer, Kayla1 aCelik, Ilke1 aApul, Defne0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 June 20, v. 223 p.368-378dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.03.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245019600170520143300366592002801799650001601827650001501843650001401858650002301872650001101895650001701906650002001923650002201943650001101965650001401976650001901990650001302009650002502022653001902047653002202066653001402088653001902102653002202121700001702143700001802160700001702178700001402195773011402209856008602323852000902409655001202418IND60685191320221119045614.0200503e20200705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068519132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1223952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Changqing10aCarbonate-enhanced catalytic activity and stability of Co3O4 nanowires for 1O2-driven bisphenol A degradation via peroxymonosulfate activation: Critical roles of electron and proton acceptors  aTransition-metal catalysts (TMCs) for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation suffer from low stability (i.e. severe metal leakage and poor reusability) when maintaining high activity in water decontamination. An innovative carbonate (CO₃²⁻)-mediated method to synchronously enhance the catalytic activity and stability of TMCs was developed herein. In a model PMS/Co₃O₄ nanowire system for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation, the first-order kinetic constant and total organic carbon removal ratio were increased by 202.27% and 71.32% upon adding CO₃²⁻, respectively. Meanwhile, the cobalt release amount was significantly reduced from 4.90 to 0.03 mg/L, and the number of reuse with high efficiency (>90% of BPA removal within 10 min) was augmented from 1 to 3 times. The CO₃²⁻ buffered pH decline to repress metal leakage, and promoted Co(III) reduction into Co(II) to avoid the over-oxidation of catalyst. Under the driving of CO₃²⁻, the dominated reactive species were switched from •OH/SO₄•⁻ to ¹O₂ accompanying the migration of catalytic center from Co(II) to Co(III). The Co(III) and CO₃²⁻/OH⁻ acted as electron and proton acceptors, respectively, to accelerate PMS decomposition into SO₅•⁻ and subsequent generation of vast ¹O₂. This work proposes a green way to construct novel ¹O₂-based catalytic systems with excellent activity and stability for pollution remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3adecontamination 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3ananowires 3asinglet oxygen 3asulfates 3atotal organic carbon 0aCo3O4 nanowire 0aPeroxymonosulfate 0aCarbonate 0aSinglet oxygen 0aElectron acceptor1 aZhang, Yikun1 aFan, Zhongwei1 aLiu, Fuqiang1 aLi, Aimin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 July 05, v. 393 p.122395-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1223953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245004800166300001600214520112200230592002801352650001501380650000901395650001301404650001001417650001701427650002201444650000901466650001001475653001501485653001501500653001801515653001401533653002201547700001601569773014501585856008201730852000901812655001201821IND60124189820221119160558.0151024e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012418982DNAL7 a10.3161/150811013X6679572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Catherine10aPost-Cranial Hairs in Four Families of Bats  ap. 153-161.  aThis study identifies the presence of specialized post-cranial hairs on 66 species of bats, and speculates on their significance. While examining museum bat specimens, three main suspected sensory types of hair were discovered: toe hairs, rump hairs, and uropatagial hairs. Life history traits such as day roost type, size of roosting group, and diet were compared with the presence or absence of these hairs using Spearman's Rho tests. The presence of post-cranial hairs was extremely variable across families and genera, making their function difficult to infer. Nevertheless, our tests revealed statistically significant correlations between the presence of uropatagial hairs and using small roosts and the presence of rump hairs and using hollow tree roosts. We suggest that rump hairs may play an important role in roost navigation, while uropatagial hairs may contribute to landing or foraging abilities, especially when found on tailless bats. Toe hairs are suspected to aid in grooming. Histological analysis and further behavioral data are needed to ascertain the functional role of these post-cranial hairs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3adiet 3aforaging 3ahairs 3alife history 3aroosting behavior 3arump 3atrees 0aChiroptera 0arump hairs 0atactile hairs 0atoe hairs 0auropatagial hairs1 aReep, Roger0 tActa chiropterologica.g2013 June, v. 15, no. 1 p.153-161dMuseum and Institute of Zoology at the Polish Academy of Sciencex1733-53297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F150811013X6679573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008000172300001600252520115800268592002801426650001201454650001201466650001101478650002301489650002101512650001801533650001901551650001001570650003201580651001001612700001801622700002501640700001901665773012401684856008701808852000901895655001201904IND60084683020221119205903.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008468302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2011.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaselli, Fabio10aUse of ETM+ images to extend stem volume estimates obtained from LiDAR data  ap. 662-671.  aAirborne LiDAR techniques can provide accurate measurements of tree height, from which estimates of stem volume and forest woody biomass can be obtained. These techniques, however, are still expensive to apply repeatedly over large areas. The current paper presents a methodology which first transforms mean stand heights obtained from LiDAR over small strips into relevant stem volume estimates. These are then extended over an entire forest by applying two estimation methods (k-NN and locally calibrated regression) to Landsat ETM+ images. The methodology is tested over a coastal area covered by pine forest in the Regional Park of San Rossore (Central Italy). The results are evaluated by comparison with the ground stem volumes of a recent forest inventory, taking into consideration the effect of stand size. In general, the accuracies of two estimation methods are dependent on the size of the forest stands and are satisfactory only when considering stands larger than 5–10ha. The outputs of the parametric regression procedure are slightly more stable than those of k-NN and more faithfully reproduce the spatial patterns of the ground data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abiomass 3acoasts 3aconiferous forests 3aforest inventory 3aforest stands 3aimage analysis 3alidar 3atree and stand measurements 3aItaly1 aChiesi, Marta1 aMontaghi, Alessandro1 aPranzini, Enzo0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2011 Sept., v. 66, no. 5 p.662-671dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013200170300001600302520194100318592002802259650002002287650002602307650001102333650002602344650002102370650002102391650001802412650001102430650001302441650003302454650001602487650000902503650001502512650001602527700001402543700001202557700001502569773012402584856008702708852000902795655001202804IND60084683120221119205741.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008468312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2011.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Shalei10aWavelength selection and spectral discrimination for paddy rice, with laboratory measurements of hyperspectral leaf reflectance  ap. 672-682.  aThe objective of this research is to select the most sensitive wavelengths for the discrimination of the imperceptible spectral variations of paddy rice under different cultivation conditions. The paddy rice was cultivated under four different nitrogen cultivation levels and three water irrigation levels. There are 2151 hyperspectral wavelengths available, both in hyperspectral reflectance and energy space transformed spectral data. Based on these two data sets, the principal component analysis (PCA) and band-band correlation methods were used to select significant wavelengths with no reference to leaf biochemical properties, while the partial least squares (PLS) method assessed the contribution of each narrow band to leaf biochemical content associated with each loading weight across the nitrogen and water stresses. Moreover, several significant narrow bands and other broad bands were selected to establish eight kinds of wavelength (broad-band) combinations, focusing on comparing the performance of the narrow-band combinations instead of broad-band combinations for rice supervising applications. Finally, to investigate the capability of the selected wavelengths to diagnose the stress conditions across the different cultivation levels, four selected narrow bands (552, 675, 705 and 776nm) were calculated and compared between nitrogen-stressed and non-stressed rice leaves using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Also, wavelengths of 1158, 1378 and 1965nm were identified as the most useful bands to diagnose the stress condition across three irrigation levels. Results indicated that good discrimination was achieved. Overall, the narrow bands based on hyperspectral reflectance data appear to have great potential for discriminating rice of differing cultivation conditions and for detecting stress in rice vegetation; these selected wavelengths also have great potential use for the designing of future sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenergy 3ahyperspectral imagery 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aleast squares 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aprincipal component analysis 3areflectance 3arice 3avegetation 3awavelengths1 aGong, Wei1 aZhu, Bo1 aHuang, Xin0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2011 Sept., v. 66, no. 5 p.672-682dElsevier B.V.x0924-27167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2011.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245008200170500001900252520102500271592002801296650001801324650002401342650001201366650001101378650001101389650001601400653001401416653002501430653001901455653001501474653002101489700001601510700003301526773009401559856008401653852000901737655001201746IND60717897120221121161650.0210201e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071789712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1120092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForamitti, Joël10aEmission tax vs. permit trading under bounded rationality and dynamic markets  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA price on emissions can be achieved through an emission tax or permit trading. The advantages and drawbacks of either instrument are debated. We present an agent-based model to compare their performance under bounded rationality and dynamic markets. It describes firms that face uncertainty about future demand and prices; use heuristic rules to decide production levels, trading prices, and technology adoption; and are heterogeneous in terms of production factors, abatement costs, and trading behavior. Using multiple evaluation criteria and a wide range of parameter values, we find that the main difference between the two policies lies in the fact that permit prices fall after successful abatement. This can lead to higher production levels under permit trading, but can also drive emission-efficient firms out of the market. Scarcity rents under permit trading can further create higher profit rates for firms, the extent of which is shown to depend on the mechanisms for market-clearing and initial allocation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy policy 3ainnovation adoption 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3auncertainty 0aAbatement 0aAgent-based Modeling 0aClimate Policy 0aCarbon Tax 0aEmission trading1 aSavin, Ivan1 avan den Bergh, Jeroen C.J.M.0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Jan., v. 148 p.112009-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1120093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015600174300001300330520188100343592002802224650002902252650001202281650002102293650002802314650001602342650001202358650001402370650002202384650001602406650001502422650001102437650004302448650002302491650000902514650001902523650002402542650001802566650002502584650001502609651001002624653001402634653001502648653000902663653001702672653001002689700001502699700001902714773010102733856008502834852000902919655001202928IND60468679620221122172934.0151216e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046867962DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2015.10857362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuriithi, Faith K.10aVegetation response to intensive commercial horticulture and environmental changes within watersheds in central highlands, Kenya, using AVHRR NDVI data  ap. 1-21.  aExpansion and heterogeneous clustering of commercial horticulture within the central highlands of Kenya after the mid-1990s impact watersheds and the sustainable resource management. This is distressing since climate conditions for world horticultural regions are projected to change, making such farming extremely difficult and costly to the environment. To understand the scope of impact on vegetation, the study evaluated (1) interannual variability in averaged normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); (2) trends in average annual NDVI before and after 1990 – the presumed onset of rapid horticulture; and (3) relationship between the average annual NDVI and large-scale commercial farms, population density, and mean annual rainfall in subwatersheds. Time-series analysis of long-term Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies NDVI data were analyzed as indicator of vegetation condition. NDVI trends before 1990s (1982–1989) and after 1990s (1990–2006) were evaluated to determine the slope (sign), and the Spearman’s correlation coefficient (strength). Overall, results show considerable variations in vegetation condition due largely to mixed factors including intensive farming activities, drought, and rainfall variation. Statistical analysis shows significant differences in slopes before 1990 and after 1990 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.1 respectively). Negative (decline) trends were common after 1990, linked to increased commercial horticulture and related anthropogenic disturbances on land cover. There was decline in vegetation over densely populated subwatersheds, though low NDVI values in 1984 and 2000 were the effect of severe droughts. Understanding the linkage between vegetation responses to the effects of human-induced pressure at the subwatershed scale can help natural resource managers approach conservation measures more effectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3acommercial farms 3acommercial horticulture 3acorrelation 3adrought 3ahighlands 3aintensive farming 3ainventories 3aland cover 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apopulation density 3arain 3aremote sensing 3aresource management 3asubwatersheds 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3aKenya 0awatershed 0avegetation 0aNDVI 0ahorticulture 0aKenya1 aYu, Danlin1 aRobila, Stefan0 tGIScience & Remote Sensing.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 53, no. 1 p.1-21dTaylor & Francisx1943-72267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2015.10857363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013800172300001800310520114600328592002801474650001101502650002301513650002101536650000901557650004401566650002201610650002001632650001201652700002101664700002001685773010501705856008601810852000901896655001201905IND60578205620221120134044.0170812e20160614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057820562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b006672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerin, Spencer

The synthesis and structural characterization of new phosphaalkene–oxazolines, ArPC(Ph)(3-C₆H₄Ox) [1a,b, Ar = Mes (1a), Mes* (1b), Ox = CNOCH(ⁱPr)CH₂], are reported. The radical-initiated homo- and copolymerization of 1a with styrene affords P-functional poly(methylenephosphine) (4a: Mₙ = 5300 g mol–¹, PDI = 1.2) and poly(methylenephosphine-co-styrene) (5a: Mₙ = 4000 g mol–¹, PDI = 1.1). Multinuclear NMR spectroscopic analyses of 4a and 5a provided evidence for the predominance of an addition-isomerization mechanism for the radical polymerization of 1a. In addition, signals could be assigned to CHPh–P(CHPhAr) (i.e., S–1a) and ArCH₂–CH₂ (i.e., 1a–S) linkages in copolymer 5a. With a monomer feed ratio of 1a:S (1:2, 33 mol % 1a) the inverse gated ¹³C{¹H} NMR spectrum suggested an incorporation of 19 mol % 1a in copolymer 5a.

The interaction of tourism with the territory is captured by a novel indicator of tourism pressure based on both the pre-existing congestion and the economic contribution the tourism sector provides to the resident population. Spatial analyses detecting interdependences across Italian data at NUTS3 level (2005–2018) reveal, as foreseeable, that tourism exerts beneficial effects on growth. However, the pressure indicator proves also the existence of nonlinear effects suggesting that an excess of tourism is detrimental for per capita income in the observed area and, due to the presence of spatial spillover, also in adjacent territories. Results provide the opportunity to reflect on the circumstance that tourism has an enormous potential in terms of growth effects, but it can be exploited until it comes into conflict with the needs of the resident population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aland policy 3atourism 0aZ32 0aC31 0aP48 0aQ56 0aTerritorial pressure 0aGrowth 0aSpatial analysis 0aItalian provinces1 aCanale, Rosaria Rita0 tLand use policy.g2022 June, v. 117 p.106081-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.1060813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245010200172300001600274520224700290592002802537650001902565650001802584650002102602650001702623650002202640650001302662650002302675650002602698650000902724650001602733650001202749650001802761650001402779650001202793650001102805650002102816650001802837650001602855650001602871650001502887650001102902700002602913700002802939700002002967773012902987856007803116852000903194655001203203IND60346966220151216000000.0150812e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034696622DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2014003922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPimentel, Laisa Gouveia10aSoil N2O emissions following cover‐crop residues application under two soil moisture conditions  ap. 631-640.  aCover crops in rotation or intercropped with annual crops are important strategies to increase C and N input in agricultural soils. However, these practices may also enhance soil N₂O emissions. The effect on N₂O emissions may be dependent upon the biochemical composition of cover crop residues. A 47‐d incubation study was conducted to determine soil N₂O emissions following the addition of residues from three summer legume species [pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. Millsp.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.), lablab bean (Lablab purpureus)], one winter legume [vetch (Vicia sativa L.)], one winter monocotyledon [black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.)], and maize (Zea mays L.) under two water‐filled pore space levels (40 and 70% WFPS). Short‐term peaks of N₂O fluxes were observed after the addition of all crop residues, but were much greater under 70 than 40% WFPS (5.2 and 5133 µg N‐N₂O kg⁻¹ soil for 40 and 70% WFPS, respectively). Under both WFPS, significantly higher peaks were detected after the application of N‐rich legume residues (7.7 and 3,356 µg N‐N₂O kg⁻¹ soil under 40 and 70% WFPS, respectively) than after the application of grass residues (2.8 and 1,777 µg N‐N₂O kg⁻¹ soil under 40 and 70% WFPS, respectively). Cumulative soil N₂O produced under 70% WFPS was approx. 110 times greater than under 40% WFPS. Soil N₂O emissions increased linearly as residue N content increased. Soil N₂O emissions also increased linearly as the content of the recalcitrant compounds lignin and polyphenols increased, because residues with high N content also had high lignin and polyphenols content. When the content of C and recalcitrant compounds were expressed on an N basis, soil N₂O emission decreased linearly as residue C/N, lignin/N, polyphenol/N, and (lignin + polyphenols)/N ratios increased. Indices that include recalcitrant compounds on N basis may be useful for the selection of cover‐crop species with the least impact on soil N₂O emissions. However, our results show that these ratio indices had similar correlation coefficients compared to C/N ratio, indicating that C/N ratio is an efficient index to predict soil N₂O emission following cover crop application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena strigosa 3aCajanus cajan 3aLablab purpureus 3aVicia sativa 3aVigna unguiculata 3aZea mays 3aagricultural soils 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acorn 3acover crops 3acowpeas 3acrop residues 3aemissions 3agrasses 3alignin 3anitrogen content 3anitrous oxide 3apigeon peas 3apolyphenols 3asoil water 3asummer1 aWeiler, Douglas Adams1 aPedroso, Gabriel Munhoz1 aBayer, Cimélio0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2015 Aug., v. 178, no. 4 p.631-640dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2014003923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04239naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111024002100136040001800157072000900175072000900184100001600193245009700209300001600306500002400322500001500346520166000361650001002021650002002031650001302051650002302064650002202087650002702109650001702136650002502153650002402178650003002202650001502232650001802247650001002265650002702275650001802302650002102320650001802341650002002359650002702379650001502406650001202421650002302433650002302456650003102479650001402510650001102524650002402535650001102559650001002570650000902580650002702589650002302616650002702639650001202666650004902678650002502727651001402752651001402766653001202780653002902792653001902821653001102840700001602851700001702867700001502884700001602899700001802915773012202933852000903055856007503064856011203139930003303251945002503284946001303309961001503322655001203337IND4436558720221119231402.0100507e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443655872DNAL7 a204965892pmid7 a10.1603/ME090652doi7 a10113/428552hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aP0501 aCohen, S.B.10aHost Associations of Dermacentor, Amblyomma, and Ixodes (Acari: Ixodidae) Ticks in Tennessee  ap. 415-420.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFrom April 2007 to September 2008,1,793 adult and nymphal ixodid ticks were collected from 49 counties in Tennessee. Six species were identified, including Dermacentor variabilis (Say), Amblyomma americanum (L.), Ixodes texanus (Banks), Ixodes cookei Packard, Ixodes scapularis (Say), and Amblyomma maculatum Koch, from 13 medium- to large-sized mammalian hosts and dragging through vegetation. Raccoons were the most common vertebrate source (198 captures), accounting for 60% of ticks collected. Dermacentor variabilis was the predominant species from raccoons with a prevalence of 92% and mean intensity of 5.3. A. americanum was predominated in white-tailed deer and drags with respective mean intensities of 3.1 and 14.1 and prevalence values of 94%. All tick species were identified between April and August, coinciding with the majority of animal captures. Only A. americanum, I. texanus, and I. cookei were identified from 22 animal captures from November to March. I. texanus and I. cookei were more common in the eastern portions of the state, but this may be a result of higher raccoon captures in those areas. Only four specimens of I. scapularis were collected in this study, which may reflect the absence of small mammal or reptile captures. Two A. maculatum were collected, and we report new distribution records in Tennessee for this species. Despite unequal sampling among ecoregions, the large numbers of D. variabilis and A. americanum from multiple host species suggest their widespread distribution throughout the state. These species of ticks can transmit multiple pathogens, including spotted fever group rickettsiae and ehrlichiae. 3aticks 3adisease vectors 3areptiles 3aseasonal variation 3aIxodes scapularis 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3awild animals 3aAmblyomma americanum 3aAmblyomma maculatum 3ageographical distribution 3ahost range 3aProcyon lotor 3ahosts 3aDermacentor variabilis 3aIxodes cookei 3ahost specificity 3asmall mammals 3aarthropod pests 3ageographical variation 3avegetation 2aAnimals 2aCatsxparasitology 2aDeerxparasitology 2aDermacentorxpathogenicity 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aFoxesxparasitology 2aIxodes 2aLarva 2aMale 2aOpossumsxparasitology 2aPopulation Density 2aRaccoonsxparasitology 2aSeasons 2aTick Infestationsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aTicksxpathogenicity 3aTennessee 0aTennessee 0amammals 0ahematophagous arthropods 0aIxodes texanus 0aIxodes1 aFreye, J.D.1 aDunlap, B.G.1 aDunn, J.R.1 aJones, T.F.1 aMoncayo, A.C.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2010 May, v.  47, no.  3 p.415-420dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME090653Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/428553Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100722b20100807c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/06/10  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02681naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245016900174500001900343520132300362592002801685650001901713650001101732650001401743650001201757650002401769650002601793650001501819650001101834650001601845650001101861651001301872653002701885653002401912653001901936653002901955653003301984700002202017700002402039773009002063856008502153852000902238655001202247IND60722120620221122225955.0210305e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072212062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurlybekova, Gauhar10aQuantitative evaluation of the thermal and energy performance of the PCM integrated building in the subtropical climate zone for current and future climate scenario  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effect of PCM on the thermal and energy performance of the building located in six cities of the subtropical climate zone under the present climate conditions was evaluated. Thereafter, the effect of climate change was assessed using a hybrid downscaling approach to generate future weather data. The thermal comfort in different seasons was evaluated through maximum temperature reduction (MTR) and maximum temperature fluctuation reduction (MTFR), while the building’s energy performance was analysed utilising seasonal and annual energy consumption reduction (ECR). Finally, the influence of climate change on the building’s energy performance was studied and compared using the Degree-Day Method (DDM) and energy simulations. Based on the MTR and MTFR results; overall, PCM 18 demonstrated superior performance during the wintertime, while PCM 30 was the best in the swing and summer seasons. Both DDM and energy simulations showed that under future climate scenario (2095), the cooling energy demand would rise, whereas the heating energy demand would drop. For all cities except for Zhengzhou and Islamabad, PCM 28-PCM 30 could be used as optimum PCMs for both current and future climate scenarios. The optimum PCMs resulted in the annual ECR values of up to 37% for current and future climate scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aheat sums 3ahybrids 3ameteorological data 3aquantitative analysis 3asubtropics 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aPakistan 0aPhase change materials 0aThermal performance 0aEnergy savings 0aSubtropical climate zone 0aEnergy consumption reduction1 aMemon, Shazim Ali1 aAdilkhanova, Indira0 tEnergy.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 219 p.119587-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1195873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012300166300001800289520121700307592002801524650002201552650001501574650001001589650001601599650001101615650002301626650000901649650000901658650001201667650001501679650001301694650000701707650001101714650001801725700001501743700001401758700001601772700001801788773010601806856008201912852000901994655001202003IND60091500520221116171851.0141103e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009150052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.03.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yongming10aColorimetric detection of mercury, lead and copper ions simultaneously using protein-functionalized gold nanoparticles  ap. 4064-4069.  aA simple, cost-effective and rapid colorimetric method for any or all of Hg²⁺, Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ detection using papain-functionalized gold nanoparticles (P-AuNPs) has been developed. Papain is a protein with seven cystein residues, which can selectively bind with Hg²⁺, Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺. We functionalized gold nanoparticles with papain. The P-AuNPs could be used to simultaneously detect Hg²⁺, Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺, and showed different responses to the three ions in an aqueous solution based on the aggregation-induced color change of gold nanoparticles. The P-AuNPs displayed the most obvious response to mercury ions in water in contrast to lead and copper ions, and the real water sample analysis verified the conclusion. The sensitivity of the detection system was influenced by the pH of the P-AuNPs solution, the concentration of P-AuNPs and the size of gold nanoparticles, and we found that larger gold nanoparticles contributed to more sensitive results. The detection system can detect as low as 200nM Hg²⁺, Pb²⁺ or Cu²⁺ using 42nm gold nanoparticles. We expect our approach to have wide-ranging applications in the developing region for monitoring water quality in some areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosensors 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3aions 3alead 3amercury 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3apH 3apapain 3awater quality1 aWang, Zhuo1 aQu, Weisi1 aShao, Huawu1 aJiang, Xingyu0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 June 15, v. 26, no. 10 p.4064-4069dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010500166300001200271520087900283592002801162650001401190650002401204650002401228650001301252650002301265650001101288650001001299650001001309650001501319650001001334650001101344650001401355650002201369700002201391700002001413773008601433856008101519852000901600655001201609IND60580083320221120175548.0170908e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058008332DNAL7 a10.1007/s13199-017-0483-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZindel, Renate10aIsolation of Serratia marcescens involved in chitin degradation in the bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini  ap. 1-5.  aThere is an increasing awareness of the importance of the microbiome of arthropods to understand their host’s biology. In the bulb mite, Rhizoglyphus robini, associated bacteria have been found to be involved in its chitinolytic abilities. The bulb mite, a plant pest feeding on below-ground parts of mostly Liliaceae crops, prefers fungus-infested plants. Moreover its fitness is higher when feeding on a fungal food source than when feeding on non-infected plants. In this study we isolated a chitinolytic bacterium from mite homogenate and identified it molecularly as Serratia marcescens (Bizio 1823), which is a model organism for chitin degradation. Precise identification of the bacterium can be important for the development of biological control programs of the mite as well as for further studies investigating Serratia marcescens and its chitinolytic machinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiliaceae 3aRhizoglyphus robini 3aSerratia marcescens 3abacteria 3abiological control 3achitin 3acrops 3afungi 3amicrobiome 3amites 3amodels 3asymbiosis 3aunderground parts1 aOfek-Lalzar, Maya1 aAebi, Alexandre0 tSymbiosis.g2017 Sept., v. 73, no. 1 p.1-5dSpringer Netherlandsx0334-51147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-017-0483-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01585naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245006400159300001600223500002000239520062900259592002800888650000900916650001200925650002300937650001000960650002300970650001000993650001101003700002201014773014301036856007101179852000901250655001201259IND60680349120221119140544.0200105e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068034912DNAL7 a10.2307/12419212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeatham, David J.10aFarmers' Choice of Fixed and Adjustable Interest Rate Loans  ap. 803-812.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA discrete stochastic programming model of a midwestern crop‐hog farm was used to investigate farmers' fixed‐rate/adjustable‐rate loan decision.

The feasibility of using financial options to hedge interest rates was investigated and found to be prohibitively expensive.  aPublisher supplied data 3adebt 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3afarms 3ainterest (finance) 3aloans 3amodels1 aBaker, Timothy G.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1988 Nov., v. 70, no. 4 p.803-812dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12419213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245014800162300001600310520078500326592002801111650002701139650002601166650002401192650000901216650001401225650002501239650001601264650001001280650001701290650002401307650001601331650000901347650001101356700001501367700001401382700001701396700001801413700001801431700002201449773013101471856007801602852000901680655001201689IND60792027620221120030030.0220904e20180913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079202762DNAL7 a10.17221/260/2018-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJingang, Liang10aNo significant differences in rhizosphere bacterial communities between Bt maize cultivar IE09S034 and the near-isogenic non-Bt cultivar Zong31  ap. 427-434.  aThe release of genetically modified (GM) crops has potential to alter the bacterial population within rhizosphere. Here, the potential effect of GM maize cv. IE09S034 containing the Cry1Ie toxin gene from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) was investigated under the field conditions. The community composition and the relative abundance of the bacteria in rhizosphere soil were estimated by analysing 16S rRNA PCR amplicons. Our results indicated that Bt maize IE09S034 has no significant effects on the rhizosphere bacterial community. Instead, it was found that factors such as plant growth stage and year have a stronger effect on the bacterial population dynamics. Our findings therefore provide reliable evidence supporting the potential commercial cultivation of the cv.

They provide a pathway for the exchange of material and energy between marshes and adjacent water bodies and thereby control the hydrodynamic, morphological, and ecological processes on marsh platforms. Due to difficulties in terms of accessibility, limitations on the duration of exposure during low-water stages, and variations in morphology over time, rapid and accurate mapping of such intertidal morphological features at a high frequency is extremely challenging. Here, we present an efficient method integrated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, and spatial morphological fitting and delineation for accurately quantifying channel three-dimensional (3D) morphological features in terms width, depth, width-to-depth ratio, and cross-sectional area. We also relate these measured proxies to salt marsh species distributions. A two-step thresholding approach combining elevation and slope is developed in order to determinate TC boundaries from salt marsh and tidal flat area, and a Gaussian fit is used to estimate water-bearing channel depth and cross-sectional area. Salt marsh species are identified from fine-resolution multispectral satellite data and a field training dataset using a Random Forest classifier. Our results indicate that (1) UAV-based SfM photogrammetry can achieve centimeter-level accuracy in mapping the topography of TCs, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.7 cm — mainly from the strong reflection of light from smooth TC water surfaces and the presence of water-bearing layers; (2) the morphological features of TCs, ranging from tidal flats to salt marsh areas, demonstrate a similar tendency, which increases at first and then decreases. The maximum depth and cross-sectional area of TCs is in sparse salt-marsh area, up to 4 m and 150 m², respectively; and (3) TC morphology has a major impact on the distribution of salt marsh plants and such effects vary across different plant species. These results greatly contribute deep understanding of feedbacks between TCs and salt marsh plant species distribution and have significant implications for developing ecological and morphological salt marsh restoration guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenergy 3ageographical distribution 3ahydrodynamics 3alittoral zone 3aphotogrammetry 3aremote sensing 3asalt marsh plants 3asalt marshes 3atopography 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0aStructure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry 0aTidal channels 0aMorphological features 0aSalt marsh 0aUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)1 aZhang, Ce1 aSchwarz, Christian1 aTian, Bo1 aJiang, Wenhao1 aWu, Wenting1 aGarg, Rahul1 aGarg, Pradeep1 aAleksandr, Chusov1 aMikhail, Shilin1 aZhou, Yunxuan0 tGeomorphology.g2022 June 15, v. 407 p.108235-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.1082353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245005900175300001400234520136100248592002801609650002201637650001901659650002601678650001801704650001101722650001801733650002101751650001801772650001301790650002101803650004401824650001301868650002501881653002601906653002001932653003301952653002201985773009402007856008402101852000902185655001202194IND60556429420221119134229.0170710e20161007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055642942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2016.05.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScriba, Gerhard K.E.10aChiral recognition in separation science – an update  ap. 56-78.  aStereospecific recognition of chiral molecules is an important issue in various aspects of life sciences and chemistry including analytical separation sciences. The basis of analytical enantioseparations is the formation of transient diastereomeric complexes driven by hydrogen bonds or ionic, ion-dipole, dipole-dipole, van der Waals as well as π-π interactions. Recently, halogen bonding was also described to contribute to selector-selectand complexation. Besides structure-separation relationships, spectroscopic techniques, especially NMR spectroscopy, as well as X-ray crystallography have contributed to the understanding of the structure of the diastereomeric complexes. Molecular modeling has provided the tool for the visualization of the structures. The present review highlights recent contributions to the understanding of the binding mechanism between chiral selectors and selectands in analytical enantioseparations dating between 2012 and early 2016 including polysaccharide derivatives, cyclodextrins, cyclofructans, macrocyclic glycopeptides, proteins, brush-type selectors, ion-exchangers, polymers, crown ethers, ligand-exchangers, molecular micelles, ionic liquids, metal-organic frameworks and nucleotide-derived selectors. A systematic compilation of all published literature on the various chiral selectors has not been attempted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achromatography 3acoordination polymers 3acyclodextrins 3aethers 3aglycopeptides 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic liquids 3amicelles 3amolecular models 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteins 3avan der Waals forces 0aEnantiomer separation 0aChiral selector 0aChiral recognition mechanism 0aComplex formation0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Oct. 07, v. 1467 p.56-78dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2016.05.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04584naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009800171520325800269592002803527650002603555650001103581650001603592650001903608650001003627650001503637650001503652650001103667650001203678650001503690650001303705650001503718650001103733651001703744653001903761653001303780653001003793653001603803700001803819700002103837700001503858700001703873700001803890773009803908856008704006852000904093655001204102IND60772435920221118010313.0220502e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077243592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.1082372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnzel, Yehouda14aThe modern wave-induced coastal staircase morphology along the western shores of the Dead Sea  aThis research provides insights into the formation of the coastal cliffs comprising the staircase morphology along the western coast of the Dead Sea as a result of its anthropogenic, regressive modern (last ~50 years) lake-level fall. The analysis of this morphology is based on observations and measurements of the impact of seasonal lake-level rises of 0–0.2 m and 0.7–2 m in normal versus exceptionally wet winters, respectively. We conducted repeated detailed topographic surveys of the shores for characterizing the evolving morphology with time, and coupled them with wind speed and wave amplitude during cliff formations. The detailed lake-level curve and the almost monotonic level decline allow associating each cliff with the exact year and season of its formation. This detailed chronology allowed, in turn, to identify and associate the pronounced and well-documented seasonality in the lake-level fall with the wind and wave data during specific seasons, years, and multi-year episodes. As a result, we can point at the controlling processes and environmental conditions for cliff formation. Under the regional Mediterranean climate with its distinct seasonality, winters are characterized by eastern Mediterranean low-pressure systems, generating the Jordan River flow in its northern headwaters and its discharge into the lake; this discharge controls the level fluctuations. At the Dead Sea area, these winter systems precipitate little. However, they generate high winds and storm waves that erode an additional coastal cliff at the base of the preexisting staircase every winter. Therefore, at the seasonal scale, a clear separation exists between (a) individual, cliff-forming, stronger wind storms operating only during winters under relatively stable water levels, and (b) the ~1-m annual lake-level fall, mostly during summers. This pronounced seasonality in both the wind and lake level (a) dictates the seasonal pace of cliff formation at vertical intervals similar to the magnitude (~1 m) of the annual lake-level fall by evaporation and artificial brine diversion, and (b) facilitates the cliff separation in the landscape. This regular pacing by winter storms, the minor lake-level rises, and the annual evaporation and diversion support the preservation of the individual cliffs that assemble into the staircase morphology in the coarse-clastic delta fronts and mudflats characterizing the recently emerging coast. Anomalous lake-level rises during exceptionally wet winters are more erosive, even with regular wind storms; they create the largest lateral erosion. Under the emerging shore topography, which results from the steep bathymetry, the outcome is cliffs often much higher than the respective amplitude of their causative lake-level rises. This depends on the duration of the rise and of individual storms and indicates that under the variance of the modern hydroclimatology, the abnormal seasonal lake-level rises operating with regular winter storms, can aggressively erode the shore. Proposed plans to stabilize or raise the falling water level of the Dead Sea would induce coastal erosion and stream incision, which would threaten the existing highway and other infrastructure built close to its shore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3acoasts 3aevaporation 3ainfrastructure 3alakes 3alandscapes 3ariver flow 3astorms 3astreams 3atopography 3avariance 3awind speed 3awinter 3aJordan River 0aCoastal cliffs 0aDead Sea 0aWaves 0aWind storms1 aMushkin, Amit1 aGroisman, Matias1 aCalvo, Ran1 aEyal, Haggai1 aLensky, Nadav0 tGeomorphology.g2022 July 01, v. 408 p.108237-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.1082373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013800167300001400305520094500319592002801264650002201292650001601314650001601330650001101346650003101357650001301388650002101401650001801422653004001440653002601480653002801506653003101534653001001565700002301575700001901598773010301617856008201720852000901802655001201811IND50060294620221121005301.0190403e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006029462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2012.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEcarnot, Martin10aAssessing leaf nitrogen content and leaf mass per unit area of wheat in the field throughout plant cycle with a portable spectrometer  ap. 44-50.  aLeaf nitrogen content (LNC) and leaf mass per unit area (LMA) were assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) on fresh and dried plants of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp).

Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used for calibration and cross-validation.

The treatments were two tillage systems (no-tillage, and manual tillage), two rice straw managements (no rice straw, and rice straw mulch at 3 Mgha−1) and three nitrogen fertilizers levels (no nitrogen, recommended level of nitrogen: 60kgha−1, and high level of nitrogen: 120kgha−1). Potassium and phosphorus fertilizers were applied to be non-limiting at 40kg K2Oha−1 and 40kg P2O5ha−1. Four replications of the twelve treatment combinations were arranged in a randomized complete block design. Soil CO2 emission, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured at 5cm depth in 6–10 days intervals during the rainy season and every two weeks during the dry season. Soil moisture was the main factor explaining the seasonal variability of soil CO2 emission. Much larger soil CO2 emissions were found in rainy than dry season. No-tillage significantly reduced soil CO2 emissions compared with manual tillage. Higher soil CO2 emissions were recorded in the mulched treatments. Soil CO2 emissions were higher in fertilized treatments compared with non-fertilized treatments. Rice biomass and yield were not significantly different as a function of tillage systems. On the contrary, rice biomass and yield significantly increased with application of rice straw mulch and nitrogen fertilizer. The highest response of rice yield to nitrogen fertilizer addition was obtained for 60kg Nha−1 in combination with 3 Mgha−1 of rice straw for the two tillage systems. Soil CO2 emission per unit grain yield was lower under no-tillage, rice straw mulch and nitrogen fertilizer treatments. No-tillage combined with rice straw mulch and 60kg Nha−1 could be used by smallholder farmers to achieve higher grain yield and lower soil CO2 emission in upland rice fields in northern Benin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLixisols 3aLuvisols 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3adry season 3afarmers 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahighlands 3amulching 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ano-tillage 3apaddies 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apotassium 3arice 3arice soils 3arice straw 3aseasonal variation 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3astraw mulches 3awet season 3aBenin 0aBenin 0aManagement practices 0aSoil CO2 emission 0aUpland rice 0aYield1 aBrüggemann, Nicolas1 aJesse, Naab1 aHuat, Joël1 aAgo, Expedit Evariste1 aAgbossou, Euloge Kossi0 tSoil & tillage research.g2016 Mar., v. 156 p.44-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2015.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245008500176506011700261506007600378520109600454592002801550506003701578650000801615650001501623650001301638650001201651653002601663653002901689653002801718653002401746653003201770653000901802653000901811653000901820653000901829700002401838700002301862700001601885700002001901700002001921700001401941700002101955773010201976856008702078852000902165655001202174IND60772436020221207121229.0220426e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077243602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1061572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo-Botón, C.10aMachine learning regression and classification methods for fog events prediction  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAtmospheric low-visibility events are usually associated with fog formation. Extreme low-visibility events deeply affect the air and ground transportation, airports and motor-road facilities causing accidents and traffic problems every year. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been successfully applied to many fog formation and low-visibility prediction problems. The associated problem can be formulated either as a regression or as a classification task, which has an impact on the type of ML approach to be used and on the quality of the predictions obtained. In this paper we carry out a complete analysis of low-visibility events prediction problems, formulated as both regression and classification problems. We discuss the performance of a large number of ML approaches in each type of problem, and evaluate their performance under a common comparison framework. According to the obtained results, we will provide indications on what the most efficient formulation is to tackle low-visibility predictions and the best performing ML approaches for low-visibility events prediction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aprediction 3aresearch 3atraffic 0aLow-visibility events 0aOrographic and hill-fogs 0aClassification problems 0aRegression problems 0aMachine Learning algorithms 0a0000 0a1111 0a0000 0a11111 aCasillas-Pérez, D.1 aCasanova-Mateo, C.1 aGhimire, S.1 aCerro-Prada, E.1 aGutierrez, P.A.1 aDeo, R.C.1 aSalcedo-Sanz, S.0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 July, v. 272 p.106157-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1061573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04292naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245018000212500001900392520244800411592002802859650002402887650001602911650001902927650002002946650001802966650002102984650001603005650001503021650002403036650002303060650001103083650002403094651001203118651001003130651001203140651001203152651001003164653001403174653002803188653001303216653003603229700002103265700002003286700002103306700001703327700001703344700002203361700001303383700001603396700002303412700002603435700001703461773011503478856008803593852000903681655001203690IND60736728020221122174511.0210615e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073672802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1053742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarz, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7108-875410aAssociations between different udder health groups defined based on a combination of total and differential somatic cell count and the future udder health status of dairy cows  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMastitis, in particular in its subclinical form, which may spread unnoticeable within a herd, continues to be a major challenge in the dairy industry. Somatic cell count (SCC) is a broadly used proxy for subclinical mastitis. The recently introduced Differential SCC (DSCC) representing the combined proportion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes as a percentage of total SCC, can be used in combination with SCC to categorise cows into four different udder health groups (UHG) depending on actual test day results: UHG A: healthy/normal, ≤200,000 cells/mL and DSCC ≤65 %; B: suspicious, ≤200,000 cells/mL and DSCC >65 %; C: (subclinical) mastitis, >200,000 cells/mL and DSCC >65 %; D: chronic/persistent mastitis, >200,000 cells/mL and DSCC ≤65 %. The objective of our study was to investigate to what extent the UHG aid in determining different statuses of cows: I) leaving herd before next test day, II) having >200,000 cells/mL at the next test day, and III) having ≤200,000 cells/mL at the next 3 test days. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate these statuses based on routinely generated dairy herd improvement (DHI) data from Austria, China, Estonia, Germany, and Spain. Cows in groups C (odds ratio (OR): 2.13, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.95–2.34) and, particularly, D (OR: 3.91, 95 % CI: 3.31–4.62) were significantly more likely to leave herds compared to cows in group A. Late-lactating cows indicated the highest likelihood (OR: 16.03, 95 % CI: 14.44–17.81) to leave herds in our analysis. Interestingly, we found that cows in UHG B had significantly higher odds (OR: 2.77, 95 % CI: 2.58–2.98) to have >200,000 cells/mL at the next test day compared to cows in group A. As anticipated, cows in UHG B (OR: 0.40, 95 % CI: 0.38–0.42), C (OR: 0.08, 95 % CI: 0.07–0.09), and D (OR: 0.16, 95 % CI: 0.14–0.19) each were significantly less likely to have ≤200,000 cells/mL at the next 3 test days compared to cows in group A. Above described results are an example from Germany, but the same trends could be seen across all countries considered in our study. In conclusion, our findings illustrate that the UHG concept reveals additional valuable information about udder health and culling based a single test day over working with SCC only. Actual decisions in day-to-day farm management that could be taken were not investigated here and need to be further explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3adairy herds 3adairy industry 3afarm management 3ahealth status 3aherd improvement 3aneutrophils 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3asomatic cell count 3audders 3aveterinary medicine 3aAustria 3aChina 3aEstonia 3aGermany 3aSpain 0aDairy cow 0aUdder health management 0aMastitis 0aDifferential somatic cell count1 aKleinhans, Sonja1 aReimann, Gesine1 aStückler, Peter1 aReith, Franz1 aIlves, Kaivo1 aPedastsaar, Kalle1 aYan, Lei1 aZhang, Zhen1 aLorenzana, Roberto1 aBarreal, Marisa Luisa1 aFouz, Ramiro0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2021 July, v. 192 p.105374-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1053743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100007300149245011900222300001400341520208900355592002802444650002102472650001502493650002002508650001202528650001802540650001202558650001102570650002602581650001902607650001202626650003102638650003302669650001702702650001302719651001102732653002602743653003002769653001702799700002602816700002402842700001602866700002802882700003202910700002102942773010602963856008403069852000903153655001203162IND60525426220221123021106.0190318e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052542622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2015.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBitencourt, Dioni Glei Bonini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2837-482710aMultivariate and geostatistical analyses to evaluate lowland soil levelling effects on physico-chemical properties  ap. 63-73.  aLevelling is used in rice fields to correct land irregularities for management practice improvement. Effects of levelling have been evaluated using univariate tools from classical statistics and geostatistics, which disregard possible effects on interrelations among soil properties. This study aimed to: (i) evaluate the effect of levelling on soil physico-chemical properties using classical statistics and geostatistical tools, (ii) group soil properties in homogeneous sets using multivariate cluster analysis, (iii) reduce the dimensionality of sets by principal component analysis, and (iv) characterize and map spatial distributions of principal components to compare them with individual maps to elaborate maps of homogeneous management zones. On a 1.0ha field in Southern Brazil a grid of 10×10m points was used to sample the 0–0.20m soil layer, before and after levelling. All data sets were submitted to descriptive statistics and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test, as well as to geostatistical analysis. Maps were constructed using ordinary kriging or the inverse square distance interpolation. Groups were formed by cluster analysis. To reduce their dimensionality principal component analysis and geostatistics were used to evaluate spatial dependencies of the main principal components. Maps of the main principal components and of each soil property were visually compared to verify if they had similar patterns of spatial variability. Levelling caused an increase of the spatial range for the majority of the properties as well as an improvement of the goodness of fit of the semivariogram models. Variability structures of the majority of the properties were best modeled by Gaussian and spherical models. Levelling also caused changes in the variance and covariance structures of all properties as detected by cluster multivariate analysis. Soil bulk density and organic matter represented the sets that were most affected by land levelling, so that their maps are considered useful and accessible tools for farmers in future operations of land recuperation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3acovariance 3adata collection 3afarmers 3ageostatistics 3akriging 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganic matter 3apaddies 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil density 3avariance 3aBrazil 0aMultivariate analyses 0aSoil management practices 0aLowland area1 aBarros, Willian Silva1 aTimm, Luís Carlos,1 aShe, Dongli1 aPenning, Letiane Helwig1 aParfitt, José Maria Barbat1 aReichardt, Klaus0 tSoil & tillage research.g2016 Mar., v. 156 p.63-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2015.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245014200175300001400317520145000331592002801781650002301809650001301832650001601845650001101861650001701872650001401889650001101903650001601914650000901930650002501939650001801964650003201982650001902014650001402033650002402047650001102071650001002082650001602092650002502108650001302133653002602146653001602172653001602188653001602204653001302220653001502233700001702248773015202265856008202417852000902499655001202508IND60698650620221119004344.0211030e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069865062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2020.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPryshlakivsky, Jonathan13aAn uncertainty analysis of the energy intensity of 37 materials used in automobile manufacturing: Statistical methods and recommendations  ap. 12-25.  aLife Cycle Inventories must meet the data quality requirements set out by the goal and scope of a Life Cycle Assessment. The literature on the timing of updating inventory data to meet the data quality requirements is almost non-existent. In this study, data were taken from publicly available reports (corporate, peer-reviewed or governmental), congresses, proceedings, technical papers, international databases and LCAs. Monte Carlo simulations were used to test for variance; regression analysis was used to determine correlation between time and energy intensity. Different conventional automobile power train configurations were examined along with lightweight versions. Monte Carlo simulations were programmed for each automobile power train configuration. Least absolute residuals methods were used to confirm whether the variance seen in simulations was due to time or to other factors such as uncertainty or scattered data. The Monte Carlo simulations identified the variation by material and quantified their significance. Least absolute regression analysis identified and confirmed which materials have a clearly delineated temporal relationship: rubber, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, lead, copper, steel, recycled steel, aluminum and recycled aluminum. Consequently, recommendations are given for the time intervals for necessary data updates which, depending on the material in question, are between two and five years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aaluminum 3aautomobiles 3acopper 3adata quality 3adatabases 3aenergy 3ainventories 3alead 3alife cycle inventory 3amanufacturing 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3arecycling 3aregression analysis 3arubber 3asteel 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3avariance 0aLife cycle assessment 0aTemporality 0aUncertainty 0aMonte carlo 0aVariance 0aregression1 aSearcy, Cory0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2020 Oct., v. 24 p.12-25dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2020.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03893naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002400153245013500177300001600312520239000328592002802718650001502746650001202761650001702773650002202790650001602812650001602828650001802844650001402862650001302876650003002889650001302919650002202932650001202954650001002966650001002976650003502986650001603021650001003037650001503047650001403062650001303076650001103089650000903100651001003109700002703119700002003146700002203166773009803188856005603286852000903342655001203351IND4432653220221121004552.0120727e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443265322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2009.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerbo, Anna Rita Di10aGastrointestinal infection in goat farms in Lombardy (Northern Italy): Analysis on community and spatial distribution of parasites  ap. 102-112.  aWe conducted a study with the aim of setting out the composition of gastrointestinal parasite communities within the goat farm system in Lombardy, a region in northern Italy. A GIS was set and all the goat farms in the study area were geo-referenced. Our investigation for gastrointestinal parasite infections involved 110 farms where 2554 individual per rectum faecal samples were collected and tested. Almost all the examined goats resulted to be positive to parasites (P=96%, 95% CI: 95.1â96.7%). The taxa identified are Moniezia benedeni, Strongyloides spp., Strongylida, Nematodirus spp., Skrjabinema spp., Trichuris spp., Capillaria spp., Marshallagia spp. and Eimeria spp. Co-infection supported by more than a single parasite was observed in almost all the farms; goats could even harbour 6 taxa simultaneously. A highly positive correlation emerged between the number of parasite taxa per farm and pasture as well as extensive breeding (both showing p<0.001). When considering our data spatially, we found a clustered pattern distribution of M. benedeni, Strongylida, Skrjabinema while Strongyloides spp., Nematodirus spp., Trichuris spp. and Eimeria spp. resulted to be randomly distributed among the farms. We also assessed spatially the positive relationship of M. benedeni, Trichuris spp. and Strongylida to the pasture. As to Nematodirus, this taxon showed to be particularly linked to altitude. Assessing the widespread distribution of gastrointestinal parasites in the goat farms of Lombardy, was of particular interest to our study. In fact, even if the parasitic risk mainly derives from pasture, in some areas the role of goats as biological control agents for the renovation of pastures is getting more and more important. Nevertheless, several autochthonous goat breeds can survive in different areas of both western and eastern Lombardy where farming on extensive pasture is still carried out. In order to support the smallest farmers with keeping such breeding, we think that the control of parasites should be emphasized in these farms. Eradication of gastrointestinal parasites from the environment is generally impractical; though, infections can be limited, and control programmes should mainly minimize the deriving economic losses. For such purpose, we would suggest a regional project of permanent sanitary monitoring of goat farms all over Lombardy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapillaria 3aEimeria 3aMarshallagia 3aMoniezia benedeni 3aNematodirus 3aSkrjabinema 3aStrongyloides 3aTrichuris 3aaltitude 3abiological control agents 3abreeding 3aextensive farming 3afarmers 3afarms 3afeces 3ageographic information systems 3agoat breeds 3agoats 3amonitoring 3aparasites 3apastures 3arectum 3arisk 3aItaly1 aManfredi, Maria Teresa1 aZanzani, Sergio1 aStradiotto, Katia0 tSmall ruminant research.g2010 Feb., v. 88, no. 2-3 p.102-112dElsevier B.V.x0921-44887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2009.12.017  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167500001900255520186600274592002802140650001702168650002202185650001402207650003002221650001102251650001202262650001102274650002402285650002402309650002202333650001702355650002102372650001702393650001602410650002002426650001102446651001302457653001102470653001302481653001702494653001402511653001002525700001702535700001402552773009002566856008502656852000902741655001202750IND60722121320221121024454.0210305e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072212132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1196102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreenath, S.10a7E analysis of a conceptual utility-scale land-based solar photovoltaic power plant  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLarge scale solar PV systems have a high priority among clean energy initiatives across the world. A comprehensive and more realistic analysis of the solar PV power plant is not reported yet. This study performs the energy, exergy, economic, environmental, energoeconomic, exergoeconomic, and enviroeconomic (7E) analysis of conceptual 5 MW land-based solar photovoltaic power plant in five locations of Malaysia. Solar irradiation and climate data for each location are collected from the meteorological database of RETScreen software. The energy, economic, and environmental performance of the proposed solar PV system is predicted using RETScreen software. The exergy, energoeconomic, exergoeconomic, and enviroeconomic parameters are assessed using Microsoft excel based mathematical model. It is observed that the solar PV system proposed for all the selected locations will operate sufficiently well with a minimum 80% performance ratio (PR). The capacity utilization factor (CUF) varied between 17.04% (Site 2) and 14.25% (Site 4). The exergy efficiency varied between 11.35% (Site 2) and 12.65% (Site 4). The lowest value of the Payback period and LCOE is estimated to be 7.9 years and 0.102 respectively for the Site 2 solar PV system with consideration of GHG reduction revenue. The reduction in the GHG emissions is highest in Site 2, which is equivalent to 975.4 acres of forest and 1479.8 tonnes of waste recycled. Site 2 has the lowest exergoeconomic and energoeconomic parameters, as well as the highest enviroeconomic parameter. Hence, it is concluded that Site 2 has the best condition for implementation of solar PV system (80% PR, 17.04% CUF, 11.35% exergy efficiency, 7.9 years simple payback period, 17.10% internal rate of return, 0.102 USD LCOE, 4291 tCO₂ avoided/annum, 0.0147 kWh/USD, 1.096 kW/USD, 42,916 USD) based on 7E analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclean energy 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aenvironmental performance 3aexergy 3aforests 3aincome 3amathematical models 3ameteorological data 3apollution control 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asolar farms 3asolar radiation 3awastes 3aMalaysia 0aEnergy 0aEconomic 0aPhotovoltaic 0aRETScreen 0aSolar1 aSudhakar, K.1 aAF, Yusop0 tEnergy.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 219 p.119610-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1196103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011600177520172200293592002802015650001102043650001502054650001402069650001402083650001002097650000902107650002402116650001302140650001502153651002602168653001002194653001402204653002002218653001802238653000902256700001702265700002202282700001602304773010502320856008702425852000902512655001202521IND60772436520221118005938.0220509e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077243652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1061642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolimine, Stephen L.10aRelationships between intense convection, lightning, and rainfall over the interior Congo Basin using TRMM data  aThe lack of in situ observations across equatorial Africa creates forecasting challenges for regional populations affected by extreme weather events and makes accurate hydrological monitoring within the Congo Basin difficult. Due to the high mean convective intensity in this region, lightning observations may be particularly useful for improving satellite-based surface precipitation monitoring and forecasting. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the relative frequency of the most intense convective events in the Congo and their associated lightning – precipitation relationships through the analysis of high-resolution Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) radar and lightning observations for the years 1998–2013. Lightning and precipitation measurements associated with observed echoes were isolated and assigned to one of four categories of intense convective-stratiform echo types. Results show that only 2.7% of observed echoes were classified as intense convective-stratiform, yet they produced 36.6% of observed lightning flashes and 27.4% of estimated rain totals. Significant spatial correlations were also found between total rainfall and intense convective-stratiform rain (coefficient r = 0.56). Linear relationships between lightning and echo rain rates are shown to depend heavily on the convective category. As a result, a simple linear regression cannot be made for all intense convective echoes. However, lightning can be used to retrieve a lower-bound approximation with respect to convective rain rates. Results suggest that if properly implemented, the addition of lightning data may help to improve or constrain satellite derived convective intensity and rainfall estimations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aconvection 3ahydrology 3alightning 3aradar 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asatellites 3aRepublic of the Congo 0aCongo 0aLightning 0aDeep convection 0aDiurnal cycle 0aTRMM1 aZhou, Liming1 aRaghavendra, Ajay1 aCai, Yichen0 tAtmospheric research.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 273 p.106164-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.1061643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245016100159520176700320592002802087650002502115650001602140650001602156650001502172650001502187650001202202650001502214650001002229650001502239650002002254650002702274650001302301650001102314650001402325650002302339650002202362650001602384650001902400650002502419650001102444653002302455653002602478653001302504653002202517653002402539653002202563700001602585700001802601700001702619700001402636773011602650856008202766852000902848655001202857IND60698650820221119004553.0210114e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069865082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scp.2020.1002752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Duo10aAquatic plant-derived biochars produced in different pyrolytic conditions: Spectroscopic studies and adsorption behavior of diclofenac sodium in water media  aThe ubiquitous prevalence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in water has aroused enormous public concerns. The development of promising materials for eliminating such contaminants in the water environment has attracted extensive attention in the scientific community. In this study, three (350 °C, 450 °C, and 600 °C, respectively) pyrolytic conditions were developed to prepare biochars (BCs), which were mainly prepared from the wastes of the overgrown plants (i.e., vallisneria natans, potamogeton malaianus, phragmites australis, potampgeton crispus, and river sediment additional). BCs were thoroughly characterised by various important properties (i.e., porosity and superficial functional group) and applied to remove diclofenac sodium (DS) drug from water media. Results indicated that the BCs adsorption capacity were remarkably improved when pyrolytic temperature was 450 °C and the adsorption equilibrium could be reached after 4 h (with BCs of 0.12 g/L and DS concentration of 12 mg/L). Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated a fit of Pseudo-second order (R² = 0.992-0.996) and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm (R² = 0.981-0.989) was suitable. The thermodynamic parameters derived from the fitting procedure point out the adsorption processes were all spontaneous and endothermic. The overall adsorption mechanism was regarded as pore filling, π-π interaction, van der Waals force, and π-electron attraction. This study stress out the main DS adsorption behavior using the above-mentioned materials was chemisorption predominated, but the adsorption capacity differs with different material properties. The prepared BCs can serve as potential carbonaceous porous adsorbents for removing DS from water media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aPotamogeton 3aVallisneria 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3adiclofenac 3adrugs 3aendothermy 3agreen chemistry 3apersonal care products 3aporosity 3arivers 3asediments 3asorption isotherms 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3avan der Waals forces 3awastes 0aLow cost adsorbent 0aSpectroscopic studies 0aBiochars 0aDiclofenac sodium 0aAdsorption behavior 0aIsotherm kinetics1 aLi, Zhaoxin1 aWang, Peijing1 aBai, Wenrong1 aWang, Hao0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2020 Sept., v. 17 p.100275-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2020.1002753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01959naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100006400193245007200257300001600329506007600345506003100421520033500452592002800787596008300815596008400898506003700982650002801019650001701047650001101064650001301075650001501088653002101103653003501124653002301159653002401182653002101206653003401227700005601261773011301317856008601430852000901516655001201525IND60659336720221207080519.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065933672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2019.08.0022chorus7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2019.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolla, Kutubuddin A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9897-790610aPredicting CRISPR/Cas9-Induced Mutations for Precise Genome Editing  ap. 136-141.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSpCas9 creates blunt end cuts in the genome and generates random and unpredictable mutations through error-prone repair systems.

Do time and space interact synergistically to enhance forest plant species accumulation in hedgerows (i.e. the species–time–area relationship)? Does the distribution profile of forest herbs along hedgerows differ between specialist and generalist species? LOCATION: Agricultural landscapes in northern France. METHODS: We assembled a chronosequence of 99 dated (1725–2008) hedgerows, which were surveyed for forest plant species and a number of local‐proximal descriptors. A subset of 29 hedgerows were further sampled for species occurrence data in 5‐m segments. We used generalized linear models to test the interaction between time (hedgerow age) and space on species richness. Space was characterized by both habitat size (hedgerow length, width and height) and spatial connectedness: i.e. whether a hedgerow is attached to a woodland and how much woodland habitat is available in the surroundings. We used generalized linear mixed‐effects models to test whether the probability of occurrence of forest herbs along hedgerows differ between specialists and generalists. RESULTS: Hedgerow age and length interacted synergistically to increase forest plant species richness. Hedgerows attached to woodlands hosted systematically more species. Taller and wider hedgerows with a lower intensity of adjacent land uses hosted more forest plant species. Increasing the spatial connectedness of hedgerows had a positive effect on the probability of occurrence of dispersal‐limited forest specialists in the understorey, which was not the case for generalists. CONCLUSION: As predicted by the species–time–area relationship, ancient and long hedgerows attached to woodlands host more species and are more effective corridors. Creating new hedgerows to connect isolated woodlands can be a suitable strategy to restore functional connectivity, but it will be effective only in the longer term. The conservation of the most ancient hedgerows within intensively managed agricultural landscapes, especially those attached to ancient woodlands, should therefore be a priority.  aPublisher supplied data  cPEGASE (Percolation et Graphes Aléatoires pour les Systèmes Ecologiques) funded by the Conseil régional des Hauts‐de‐France  aProject n°12‐MBGD‐DIVA‐4‐CVS‐029cMinistère de l’Écologie, Programme DIVA3 (FORHAIE) 3achronosequences 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aprobability 3aspecies richness 3aunderstory 3awoodlands 3aFrance1 aDecocq, Guillaume1 aSpicher, Fabien1 aGallet‐Moron, Emilie1 aBuridant, Jérôme,1 aClosset‐Kopp, Déborah0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2021 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.e12845-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.128453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245012000170520170800290592002801998650001202026650001202038650001202050650001002062650001202072650001802084650002002102650001602122650002102138650002202159650001802181650002302199650001702222650001302239650001002252650001402262650001102276700002402287700002902311700002002340700002402360700003302384773012102417856007802538852000902616655001202625IND60792673720221118054537.0220908e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079267372DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111726612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeixeira, Francisca S.10aSuitability of Solvent-Assisted Extraction for Recovery of Lipophilic Phytochemicals in Sugarcane Straw and Bagasse  aSugarcane is primarily harvested to meet up to 80% of global sugar demand. Recently, lipids recovered from their biomass (straw and bagasse) have attracted much attention due to their possible utilisation in biofuel production but also by the presence of health-promoting compounds as phytosterols (i.e., improvement of cardiovascular function) or 1-octacosanol (i.e., anti-obesity). Although this fraction is commonly obtained through solid–liquid isolation, there is scarce information about how different solvents affect the composition of the extracts. This research work aimed to study whether, in sugarcane straw and bagasse samples, Soxtec extraction with widely used dichloromethane (DCM) would be suitable to recover most of the lipid classes when compared to other available solvents such as food grade ethanol (EtOH) or solvents without regulation restrictions for food and drug applications (i.e., acetone and ethyl acetate). The obtained results allow concluding that sugarcane waxes from straw and bagasse are complex lipid mixtures of polar and non-polar compounds. According to the extraction yield, the best results were obtained with ethanol (5.12 ± 0.30% and 1.97 ± 0.31%) for both straw and bagasse, respectively. The extractant greatly influenced the lipid composition of the obtained product. Thus, DCM enriched the isolates in glycerolipids (mono-, di- and triglycerides), free fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty aldehydes, phytosterols and hydrocarbons. On the other hand, EtOH resulted in polar isolates rich in glycolipids.

However, debris‐covered glaciers are losing mass at similar rates to clean‐ice glaciers in High Mountain Asia. This rapid mass loss is attributed to the combined effects of; (a) low or reversed mass balance gradients across debris‐covered glacier tongues, (b) differential ablation processes that locally enhance ablation within the debris‐covered section of the glacier, for example, at ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds, and (c) a decrease in ice flux from the accumulation area in response to climatic warming. Adding meter‐scale spatial variations in supraglacial debris thickness to an ice‐flow model of Khumbu Glacier, Nepal, increased mass loss by 47% relative to simulations assuming a continuous debris layer over a 31‐year period (1984–2015 CE) but overestimated the reduction in ice flux. Therefore, we investigated if simulating the effects of dynamic detachment of the upper active glacier from the debris‐covered tongue would give a better representation of glacier behavior, as suggested by observations of change in glacier dynamics and structure indicating that this process occurred during the last 100 years. Observed glacier change was reproduced more reliably in simulations of the active, rather than entire, glacier extent, indicating that Khumbu Glacier has passed a dynamic tipping point by dynamically detaching from the heavily debris‐covered tongue that contains 20% of the former ice volume.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC)  aNE/P00265XcUniversities of Leeds and Sheffield  aNE/P002021cAberystwyth University  cAberDoc PhD studentship  aNE/L002450/1cNERC ACCE DTP studentship 3ageophysics 3aglaciers 3aice 3alongevity 3amodels 3aresearch 3atongue 3aNepal1 aEgholm, David L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4045-240X1 aQuincey, Duncan J.1 aHubbard, Bryn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3565-38751 aKing, Owen1 aMiles, Evan S.1 aMiles, Katie E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2793-97661 aHornsey, Josephine0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Sept., v. 126, no. 9 p.e2020JF005761-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JF0057613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245012000129300001600249520126600265592002801531650001901559650001001578650001101588650001401599650001901613650001301632650001501645650001301660650002501673650001001698650001101708650001101719650001601730650001201746651001701758653001101775653001901786653001101805653001801816653002001834653001101854653001601865700001701881700001401898700001901912700002001931773014001951852000902091655001202100IND60594581020221117165539.0180520e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059458102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalit, Rakhi10aSeed Production in Festuca Hallii is Regulated by Adaptation to Long-Term Temperature and Precipitation Patterns☆  ap. 238-243.  aPlains rough fescue (Festuca hallii [Vasey] Piper) is an important, native forage grass species in Western Canada. Despite the high demand of seeds of this species, supply remains extremely limited mainly due to erratic seed production in native prairies. The underlining physiological and environmental principles remain largely unknown. Using historical weather records and long-term field observations, this study assessed the effects of summer, autumn, and spring temperatures and moisture conditions on seed production of Festuca hallii at two research stations in Saskatchewan, Canada. Our results showed that colder to normal temperatures and wet to normal moisture in summer and autumn favored flowering in the following year. Moreover, warmer to normal temperatures in the spring of the seed-producing year also promoted flowering while freezing events in spring negatively affected the reproductive success. Thus, irrigation in late summer and autumnmay be a valid strategy for stimulation of seed production in Festuca hallii. These findings can be useful to seed producers for commercial forage seed production. Moreover, conservationists could use this information to predict the likelihood that a particular year would be good for seed production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca hallii 3aPiper 3aautumn 3aflowering 3aforage grasses 3afreezing 3airrigation 3aprairies 3areproductive success 3aseeds 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aweather 3aSaskatchewan 0aautumn 0aFestuca hallii 0aforage 0aprecipitation 0aseed production 0aspring 0atemperature1 aBai, Yuguang1 aRomo, Jim1 aCoulman, Bruce1 aWarren, Richard0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2017 Mar., v. 70, no. 2 p.238-243dthe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1551-50287nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03657naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013400158500001900292500002000311520197800331592002802309596005902337596005902396596005902455596005902514596005702573650003002630650001002660650001202670650001502682650001802697650002902715700001602744700001402760700001802774700005402792700001702846700001902863700001702882700005902899700001802958773012902976856007303105852000903178655001203187IND60729538820221118182643.0210228e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072953882DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.129542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiayang14aThe response of productivity and its sensitivity to changes in precipitation: A meta‐analysis of field manipulation experiments  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQUESTIONS: Changes in precipitation can influence grassland productivity and its sensitivity to precipitation variation, but general patterns remain elusive. METHODS: Using data from 59 studies of experimental precipitation manipulations in grasslands, we tested the effect of increases and decreases in precipitation on above‐ground net primary productivity (ANPP), below‐ground net primary productivity (BNPP), forb and grass productivity, and their sensitivity to changes in precipitation. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that: (a) ANPP sensitivity to increases in precipitation was 87.3% greater than to decreases in precipitation, whereas there was no difference in the sensitivity of BNPP to increases and decreases in precipitation; (b) the sensitivity of grasses was 315.5% higher to decreases in precipitation than to increases in precipitation, but there was no difference in the sensitivity of forbs to increases and decreases in precipitation; (c) the sensitivity of ANPP to increases and decreases in precipitation was 620.8% and 91.7% higher than that of BNPP, respectively; (d) the sensitivity of grasses to precipitation decreases was 157% higher than that of forbs, but there was no difference in the sensitivity of grasses and forbs to increases in precipitation; and (e) the sensitivity of ANPP to increases in precipitation and BNPP to both increases and decreases in precipitation reduced with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP), and the reduced magnitude in BNPP sensitivity was higher to precipitation increases than to precipitation decreases. In contrast, neither grass nor forb sensitivity varied with changes in MAP. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that grassland productivity and its sensitivity to changes in precipitation not only depend on the magnitude of precipitation but also on the direction of precipitation change. These findings are important for the management of grasslands under future precipitation change scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data  a31570429cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31300363cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31600380cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31800399cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a316004cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ameta-analysis 3anet primary productivity1 aLi, Junyong1 aXiao, Rui1 aZhang, Jiajia1 aWang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4533-16151 aMiao, Renhui1 aSong, Hongquan1 aLiu, Yinzhan1 aYang, Zhongling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6346-15821 aLiu, Mengzhou0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2021 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.e12954-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.129543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009500165520149400260592002801754650001201782650001701794650001601811650002401827650001401851650002001865650001001885650001501895650001401910650002401924650002401948650002401972650000901996653000802005653000802013653000902021653000802030653000902038653000902047653000802056653000702064653000702071653000802078653000902086653000802095653000802103653000702111653000902118653000802127653000902135653000702144653000702151653000902158653000802167653002902175653002002204653002102224653001102245653003402256700001702290700001502307700001902322700001502341700001402356700001502370700001602385773008802401856008302489852000902572655001202581IND60723419120221116204422.0211206e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072341912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2021.1454322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yifei10aGenetic variants in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes and risk of prostate cancer  aPrevious studies have found the relationship between cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes and the risk or prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa), while there is no definite evidence that genetic variants in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway gene is related to PCa risk. Consequently, we performed this study to explore the associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with PCa risk. We systematically evaluated the association of SNPs in 21 cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes with the risk of PCa using the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial database using a logistic regression model. Gene expression data of PCa from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were applied for mRNA expression analysis. The TCGA database was used to perform expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. The interaction between demographic factors and SNPs was analyzed using two-by-four tables. We found T allele of rs67415672 in HMGCS1 is a significant protective allele of PCa [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83–0.97, P = 4.16 × 10⁻³]. Moreover, rs67415672 was an eQTL for HMGCS1 (P = 2.23 × 10⁻⁶). The expression of HMGCS1 significantly decreased in PCa primary tumors than that in normal tissues. These findings indicated that the HMGCS1 rs67415672 might be possible functional susceptibility loci for PCa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abiosynthesis 3acholesterol 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3agene expression 3alungs 3aodds ratio 3aprognosis 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aquantitative traits 3aregression analysis 3arisk 0aPCa 0aSNP 0aPLCO 0aGEO 0aTCGA 0aeQTL 0aMDR 0aOR 0aCI 0aPSA 0aKEGG 0aHWE 0aMAF 0aLD 0aFPRP 0aBMI 0aPRAD 0aSI 0aAP 0aISUP 0aWHO 0aCholesterol biosynthesis 0aProstate cancer 0aGenetic variants 0aHMGCS1 0aSNP-environmental interaction1 aMeng, Yixuan1 aLi, Shuwei1 aCao, Dongliang1 aBen, Shuai1 aQin, Chao1 aHua, Lixin1 aCheng, Gong0 tGene.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 774 p.145432-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2021.1454323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245008600211300001800297520172200315592002802037650001702065650001402082650001502096650002802111650001702139650001902156650001902175650002402194650001302218650001702231650002402248650000902272650001302281650004002294650002102334650002402355650001102379650004302390650003902433650002402472700002002496700002202516700002702538700001602565700001902581700002002600773010302620856008102723990002302804852000902827655001202836IND60089944720221118004151.0141102e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008994472DNAL7 a240997942pmid7 aPMC41867982pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2013.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinghal, Sharad S.10aNovel compound 1,3-bis (3,5-dichlorophenyl) urea inhibits lung cancer progression  ap. 1664-1672.  aThe successful clinical management of lung cancer is limited by frequent loss-of-function mutations in p53 which cooperates with chronic oxidant-stress induced adaptations in mercapturic acid pathway (MAP) which in turn regulates critical intracellular signaling cascades that determine therapeutic refractoriness. Hence, we investigated the anti-cancer effects and mechanisms of action of a novel compound called 1,3-bis(3,5-dichlorophenyl) urea (COH-SR4) in lung cancer. Treatment with COH-SR4 effectively inhibited the survival and clonogenic potential along with inducing apoptosis in lung cancer cells. COH-SR4 treatment caused the inhibition of GST activity and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibited the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins CDK2, CDK4, cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin E1, and p27. The COH-SR4 activated AMPK pathway and knock-down of AMPK partially reversed the cytotoxic effects of COH-SR4 in lung cancer. COH-SR4 treatment lead to regression of established xenografts of H358 lung cancer cells without any overt toxicity. The histopathology of resected tumor sections revealed an increase in pAMPK, a decrease in the nuclear proliferative marker Ki67 and angiogenesis marker CD31. Western-blot analyses of resected tumor lysates revealed a decrease in pAkt and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 along with an increase in pAMPK, pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved PARP levels. Importantly, COH-SR4 lead to decrease in the mesenchymal marker vimentin and increase in the normal epithelial marker E-cadherin. The results from our in-vitro and in-vivo studies reveal that COH-SR4 represents a novel candidate with strong mechanistic relevance to target aggressive and drug-resistant lung tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acytotoxicity 3ahistopathology 3alung neoplasms 3amechanism of action 3amutation 3apharmacology 3aregulatory proteins 3aurea 3avimentin 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDisease Progression 2aHumans 2aLung Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aPhenylurea Compoundsxpharmacology 2aSignal Transduction1 aFigarola, James1 aSinghal, Jyotsana1 aNagaprashantha, Lokesh1 aBerz, David1 aRahbar, Samuel1 aAwasthi, Sanjay0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 86, no. 12 p.1664-1672dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.09.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245012400203500002200327520161700349592002801966650002201994650002002016650001502036650002502051650002802076650002602104650001502130650001502145650001502160650001502175650001902190650001702209650002102226651001002247653001602257653001202273653001602285653001702301653001202318653001602330700006002346700001802406700002102424773010902445856008302554852000902637655001202646IND60659337020221117054524.0190822e20190819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065933702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2019.1066532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fa-yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7893-945110aNo-till with straw return retains soil total P while reducing loss potential of soil colloidal P in rice-fallow systems  aPre-press version  aColloidal phosphorus (P) migration has been confirmed to be an important pathway for P loss in farmland. A field experiment was conducted with four treatments and three replications: conventional tillage/straw harvest (CH), conventional tillage/straw return (CR), no-till/straw harvest (NH), and no-till/straw return (NR) to clarify the effect of conservation agricultural practices on concentration of soil total P, available P, P stocks, and colloidal P during a 2-year rice-growing season in Zhejiang Province in China. The results showed that the soil total P and available P content increased significantly at the end of the two years compared with that before the experiment (P < 0.05), by 18.80–38.90 mg kg–1 and 1.12–1.55 mg kg–1 in clay soil, and by 20.70–35.70 mg kg–1 and 1.81–2.17 mg kg–1 in loam soil. While the total P accumulation in both soil types mainly occurred during the rice-growing season. The highest P stocks (293.90 and 136.80 g m-2) in the two soils were found in the NR treatment. In contrast, soil colloidal P significantly declined during the two-year rice-fallow period. The CR and NR treatments resulted in the lowest colloidal P contents (6.1 mg kg–1 and 3.6 mg kg–1) and accounted for the lowest percentage of total P (0.6% and 0.8%) in clay loam and loam soils, respectively. Straw return/harvest and no-till/till had an interactive effect on the soil colloidal P content. The combination of no-till and straw return is an effective way to reduce loss potential of soil colloidal P in a rice-fallow system but varies by soil texture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aclay loam soils 3aclay soils 3aconventional tillage 3acrop residue management 3afield experimentation 3aloam soils 3ano-tillage 3aphosphorus 3arice straw 3asoil fertility 3asoil texture 3atotal phosphorus 3aChina 0acolloidal P 0ano-till 0arice-fallow 0astraw return 0atotal P 0aavailable P1 aLiang, Xin-qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3521-97611 aLiu, Zi-Wen.,1 aTian, Guang-ming0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Aug. 19, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.1066533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011500163520092200278592002801200596003501228650002301263650001301286650002201299650001501321650002201336650001901358650001401377650001301391650001201404650001301416700002001429700001801449700002001467700006501487773011301552856007601665852000901741655001201750IND60699886420221119204103.0200623e20200610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069988642DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/36207262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlyazouri, Ayman10aUptake of Chromium by Portulaca Oleracea from Soil: Effects of Organic Content, pH, and Sulphate Concentration  aPhytoextraction is an effective and environment-friendly approach for remediation of soil polluted with toxic metals. Portulaca oleracea is a potential hyperaccumulator of Cr(VI) from polluted soil. In this study, the effect of soil organic content, pH, and sulphate concentration on phytoextraction of Cr(VI) using Portulaca oleracea was investigated. Seedlings of Portulaca oleracea were grown in soils with (i) three organic content compositions, (ii) six levels of pH, and (iii) six concentrations of sulphate salts; all were irrigated with Cr(VI) solutions at 200 ppm concentration. Chromium concentration in different tissues of plants was monitored under the variant conditions. Results indicated that the uptake of Cr(VI) by Portulaca oleracea is favoured at (i) low organic content soil (0.42%), (ii) slightly alkaline pH range (∼8), and (iii) with sulphate concentration in the range of 300–600 ppm.  aPublisher supplied data  cAmerican University of Sharjah 3aPortulaca oleracea 3achromium 3ahyperaccumulators 3airrigation 3aphytoaccumulation 3apolluted soils 3aseedlings 3asulfates 3atissues 3atoxicity1 aJewsbury, Roger1 aTayim, Hassan1 aHumphreys, Paul1 aAl-Sayah, Mohammad H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6321-05560 tApplied and environmental soil science.g2020 June 10, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:jnl4582843x1687-76757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/36207263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245015000208300001800358520181200376592002802188650002002216650001202236650001602248650001502264650001302279650002002292650001102312650001602323650001802339650002502357650001502382651001602397651000902413700007202422700006102494773016102555856008202716852000902798655001202807IND60746297020221118233900.0210730e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074629702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-020-01949-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAghelpour, Pouya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5640-865X10aHydrological drought forecasting using multi-scalar streamflow drought index, stochastic models and machine learning approaches, in northern Iran  ap. 1615-1635.  aHydrological drought is an environmental event that affects surface water resources such as surface runoff and reservoir levels and its prediction, can help the water managers to be aware of the future status of the region. This study aims to predict and evaluate hydrological drought in the southwestern margin of the Caspian Sea. For this, Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) is used as a multi-scalar hydrological drought indicator and calculated in time windows of 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12-month. In this study, time series stochastic models were used for the first time to predict SDI and compared with two black-box machine learning (ML) methods including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). The used data belongs to two rivers named Khalkaei and Pasikhan in Guilan province, and the period of 1986–2015 on a monthly scale. Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Functions (ACF and PACF) was used for selecting inputs among the series’ monthly time lags. The results showed that there are seasonal trends in SDI’s 1, 3, 6 and 9-month time windows; therefore, these time windows have better adaptability with the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. But there is no seasonal trend in the 12-month time window (SDI₁₂) series and the non-seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model was found as the best choice for this time window. Among the models, the MLs (GMDH and ANFIS) had approximately similar prediction accuracies. Comparing the models indicate that the linear stochastic models in addition to the simplicity of use were significantly more accurate than the complex non-linear ML models. The current results suggest using the stochastic models for hydrological drought forecasting, in catchment areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3adrought 3afuzzy logic 3aprediction 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3arunoff 3astream flow 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aCaspian Sea 3aIran1 aBahrami-Pichaghchi, Hadigheh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7621-88881 aVarshavian, Vahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9705-30660 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2021 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.1615-1635dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01949-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009400172300001600266520198900282592002802271650002302299650001702322650001002339650001302349650002702362650001502389650001202404650001902416650001202435650001302447650001502460650001502475650002402490650002102514650001502535650001802550650002302568650001302591651001102604653001502615653002902630653002302659653002002682653003402702653002302736700002002759700001902779700002502798773015502823856008202978852000903060655001203069IND60594581220221117165525.0190412e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059458122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2016.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinder, Virginia L.10aSpace Use of Female Greater Prairie-Chickens in Response to Fire and Grazing Interactions  ap. 165-174.  aEcological interactions between fire and grazing have shaped the evolutionary history of grassland ecosystems. Currently, grassland birds have experienced ongoing population declines, following widespread implementation of intensive rangeland management practices that reduce habitat heterogeneity. Patch-burn grazing is an alternative rangeland management strategy that promotes habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity. We conducted a 3-yr. field study in the central Flint Hills of Kansas to compare the spatial ecology of female Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) in rangelands managed with intensive rangeland management versus patch-burn grazing. This is the first study on the effects of patch-burn grazing on the space use decisions of Greater Prairie-Chickens at the home range scale. We used seasonal estimates of home range for 6-mo breeding and nonbreeding periods, as well as resource utilization functions to investigate the response of female prairie chickens to landscape metrics describing fire, grazing, and proximity to anthropogenic structures or lek sites. In our analysis of all radio-marked females, distance to lek was consistently the strongest predictor of space use during both breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Females captured at properties managed with patch-burn grazing selected areas with low stocking rates and high fire frequencies, and they avoided recently burned areas. Our study provides new evidence that patch-burn grazing can improve grassland habitat for Greater Prairie-Chickens, an umbrella species in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. Patch-burn grazing created preferred habitats for female Greater Prairie-Chickens, with a relatively frequent fire return interval, a mosaic of burned and unburned patches, and a reduced stocking rate in unburned areas avoided by grazers. Widespread implementation of patch-burn grazing could result in significant improvements in habitat quality for wildlife in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTympanuchus cupido 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3abreeding 3aecological competition 3aecosystems 3afemales 3afire frequency 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3alandscapes 3apopulation dynamics 3arange management 3arangelands 3astocking rate 3atallgrass prairies 3awildlife 3aKansas 0ahome range 0aintensive early stocking 0apatch-burn grazing 0aprescribed fire 0aresource utilization function 0aTympanuchus cupido1 aMcNew, Lance B.1 aPitman, Jim C.1 aSandercock, Brett K.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2017 Mar., v. 70, no. 2 p.165-174dElsevier Inc.aThe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2016.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013800167300001800305520064600323592002800969650001700997650003601014650001501050650002301065650002601088650002001114700002001134700001401154700001701168700002101185700001901206700001801225700002501243700005501268773012101323856008301444852000901527655001201536IND60744727120221121233811.0210716e20210706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074472712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c018662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPak, Min-sŏ,10aSynthesis of (2H)-Indazoles and Dihydrocinnolinones through Annulation of Azobenzenes with Vinylene Carbonate under Rh(III) Catalysis  ap. 5518-5522.  aThe Rh(III)-catalyzed C–H functionalization and subsequent intramolecular cyclization between azobenzenes and vinylene carbonate is described herein.

Four types of support materials, expanded clay (EC), charcoal (Ch), porous ceramic (PC), and low-density polyethylene (LDP) were tested as support for biomass attachment. APBR (working volume – 2.3 L) were operated in parallel at a hydraulic retention time of 24 h, an organic loading rate of 36.2 kg-COD m⁻³ d⁻¹, at 25 °C. Maximum volumetric hydrogen production values of 509.5, 404, 81.4 and 10.3 mL-H2 d⁻¹ L⁻¹reactor and maximum yields of 3.2, 2.6, 0.4 and 0.05 mol-H2 mol⁻¹ carbohydrates total, were observed during the monitoring of the reactors filled with LDP, EC, Ch and PC, respectively. Thus, indicating the strong influence of the support material on H2 production. LDP was the most appropriate material for hydrogen production among the materials evaluated. 16S rRNA gene by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the selection of different microbial populations. 454-pyrosequencing performed on samples from APBR filled with LDP revealed the presence of hydrogen-producing organisms (Clostridium and Pectinatus), lactic acid bacteria and non-fermentative organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aPectinatus 3abiomass 3acarbohydrates 3aceramics 3acharcoal 3aclay 3agenes 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3alactic acid bacteria 3amonitoring 3apolyethylene 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asugarcane 3avinasse 0aBio-hydrogen 0aRaw sugarcane vinasse 0aSupport materials 0aReal time PCR 0a454-Pyrosequencing1 aEtchebehere, Claudia1 aZaiat, Marcelo0 tAnaerobe.g2015 Aug., v. 34 p.94-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2015.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012500174300001600299520116400315592002801479650001301507650001701520650001101537650001901548650001301567650002401580650002101604650002301625650001101648650001401659650001301673650002201686650001201708773008901720856004801809852000901857655001201866IND50061591120221120214953.0130319e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006159112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-012-1356-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Quintero, J.

This paper examined the distribution of freshwater molluscs in 35 stream reaches of 18 small coastal basins in the south-western Iberian Peninsula. Using several multivariate techniques, I showed that mollusc distribution mainly responded to gradients in drainage area, water availability, pollution and salinity. Upstream and downstream communities were clearly differentiated, with the former dominated by freshwater species (Bithynia tentaculata, Galba truncatula, Radix balthica, Ancylus fluviatilis and Planorbarius metidjensis) and the latter by species typical of brackish waters (Peringia ulvae and Myosotella myosotis). There was a clear decrease in species richness from upper to lower reaches. The conservation of mollusc communities of these small basins requires a deeper understanding of their ecological requirements, effective control of urban discharges and an analysis of their interaction with invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyosotis 3aPlanorbarius 3abasins 3abrackish water 3adrainage 3afreshwater molluscs 3ainvasive species 3amacroinvertebrates 3amodels 3apollution 3asalinity 3aspecies diversity 3astreams0 tHydrobiologia.g2013 Feb., v. 703, no. 1 p.165-175dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1356-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245008300200500002000283520174800303592002802051596009502079596006802174650001402242650001302256650001502269650001302284650000902297650000802306650001602314650002102330650001902351650001302370650001102383650001302394650001502407650001802422651001402440700006202454700005602516700006102572700005102633700006002684700005702744700005502801773013702856856007702993852000903070655001203079IND60789586720221119185939.0220822e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078958672DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JF0062872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChudley, T.

Here, we present observations of crevasse ponding and investigate controls on their hydrological behavior at a fast‐moving, marine‐terminating sector of the GrIS. We map surface meltwater, crevasses, and surface‐parallel stress across a ∼2,700 km² region using satellite data and contemporaneous uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys. From 2017 to 2019 an average of 26% of the crevassed area exhibited ponding at locations that remained persistent between years despite rapid advection. We find that the spatial distribution of ponded crevasses does not relate to previously proposed controls on the distribution of supraglacial lakes (elevation and topography) or crevasses (von Mises stress thresholds), suggesting the operation of some other physical control(s). Ponded crevasse fields were preferentially located in regions of compressive surface‐parallel mean stress, which we interpret to result from the hydraulic isolation of these systems. This contrasts with unponded crevasse fields, which we suggest are readily able to transport meltwater into the wider supraglacial and englacial network. UAV observations show that ponded crevasses can drain episodically and rapidly, likely through hydrofracture. We therefore propose that the surface stress regime influences a spatially heterogeneous transfer of meltwater through crevasses to the bed of ice sheets, with consequences for processes, such as subglacial drainage and the heating of ice via latent heat release by refreezing meltwater.  aPublisher supplied data  a683043cEC, H2020, H2020 Priority Excellent Science, H2020 European Research Council (ERC)  aNE/L002507/1cUKRI, Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) 3aadvection 3adrainage 3ageophysics 3aglaciers 3aheat 3aice 3alatent heat 3aphysical control 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3arunoff 3asnowmelt 3atopography 3awater storage 3aGreenland1 aChristoffersen, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2643-87241 aDoyle, S.

It was assigned as one of the significant fossils in the assemblage and biozone divisions in the middle-late Ediacaran Period. Morphologically, Globusphyton is composed of several structural components, displaying that it had tissue differentiation to serve various bio-functions. Its prostrate stolon, a long ribbon bundled by unbranching filaments, crept by holdfasts on the seafloor. Its pompon-like thalli, the circular to oval thallus-tuft composed of many filamentous dichotomies, may have served for photosynthesis. The fusiform ribbon-tubers, the caked and expanded segments of the ribbon, may have served to sustain the growth of the thalli and the possible holdfasts. The zigzag-shaped stolon and pompon-like thalli of Globusphyton, in a relatively low-energy environment, crept on the surface of the muddy sediments and were suspended in the water column, respectively. When water currents occurred occasionally, all or part of its body was probably suspended in the water column to be deformed in capricious patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEdiacaran Wenghui biota 0amacroscopic alga 0apompon-like thallus 0aprostrate stolon 0aSouth China1 aWang, Yue0 tPaleontological research.g2018 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.64-74dUniBio PresswJournal:26764x1342-81447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2517/2017PR0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245010800171520142500279592002801704650002201732650002401754650001201778650001501790650001501805650001001820650001701830650001101847650001301858650000701871650001501878650001401893650001401907650001601921650002101937650001801958700002301976700002401999700001902023700002702042700002402069773012102093856007802214852000902292655001202301IND60792674320221118054527.0220908e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079267432DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111726642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasri, Noor Ezlin Ahmad10aPotential Applications of Frass Derived from Black Soldier Fly Larvae Treatment of Food Waste: A Review  aThe disposal of large amounts of food waste has caused serious environmental pollution and financial losses globally. Compared to alternative disposal methods (landfills, incineration, and anaerobic digestion), composting by black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) is a promising alternative for food waste management. Despite extensive research into larval biomass, another valuable by-product generated from BSFL composting is BSFL frass. However, limited information is available for its potential application. The applications of BSFL frass can be intensified by understanding its physicochemical characteristics, benefits, and challenges of BSFL frass derived from food waste. BSFL frass is harvested after 9–23 days of the experiment, depending on the substrate used in the composting process. The generated BSFL frass could exceed 33% of the original weight of the substrate. The physicochemical characteristics of BSFL frass are as follows: the temperature after harvest is 24 °C to 27 °C, pH is 5.6–8.0, moisture content is 30 to 72%, C/N ratio is 8:1 to 27:1, high nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) content, and low heavy metal content. This paper reviews the characteristics, benefits, and application of BSFL frass. It will also investigate the challenges of using food waste substrates to produce BSFL frass, as well as the best way to pre-treat the food waste substrate and post-treat the BSFL frass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHermetia illucens 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3afood waste 3afrass 3aheavy metals 3alarvae 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3apotassium 3atemperature 3awaste management 3awater content1 aAzman, Nur Asyiqin1 aAhmad, Irfana Kabir1 aSuja, Fatihah 1 aJalil, Nurul Ain Abdul1 aAmrul, Nur Fardilla0 tFoods.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 11, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111726643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013000163300001400293520128800307592002801595650001701623650002501640650001201665650002001677650001601697650001301713650001101726650001701737650001001754650001501764650001301779650001001792650002101802650001501823650001101838650001301849653002101862653001901883653003401902653002701936653001401963653002001977700001801997700002002015773009002035856008102125852000902206655001202215IND60544721220221118221317.0160901e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054472122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttia, M.S.10aDurable diagnosis of seminal vesicle and sexual gland diseases using the nano optical sensor thin film Sm-doxycycline complex  ap. 56-64.  aA new method in which a nano optical sensor for diagnosis of different diseases of seminal vesicle and sexual gland was prepared. The working principle of the method depends on the determination of the fructose concentration in semen of different patients by using nano optical sensor thin film Sm-doxycycline doped in sol–gel matrix. The assay is based on the quenching of the characteristic emission bands of Sm3+ present in silica doped Sm-doxycycline nanooptode thin film by different fructose concentrations in acetonitrile at λex=400nm. This method was optimized for parameters, such as, solvent effect, operational stability, shelf life and interference parameters. Good and reproducible linearity (1×10−9–5.0×10−5molL−1) with a detection limit of 9.0×10−10molL−1 and quantification limit of detection (LOQ) 2.7×10−9molL−1 were obtained. Seminal fructose determination in different patient samples after appropriate dilutions confirmed the reliability of this technique. The method was successfully applied for routine fructose monitoring in human semen samples of different cases such as; obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia, inflammation of male accessory glands, atrophy of seminal vesicle, congenital vas deferens and retrograde ejaculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatrophy 3adetection limit 3aejaculation 3afructose 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3amales 3amonitoring 3apatients 3asemen 3aseminal vesicles 3ashelf life 3asilica 3asolvents 0aSeminal fructose 0aSm-doxycycline 0aNano optical sensor thin flim 0aLuminescence intensity 0aQuenching 0aSeminal vesicle1 aYoussef, A.O.1 aEl-Sherif, R.H.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 July 04, v. 835 p.56-64dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245010100185300001600286520150200302592002801804650002801832650003001860650001701890650001001907650001101917650001101928650001301939650001301952653002801965653001601993653001702009653001502026653002702041700001502068700001502083700002402098700001502122773011702137856008202254852000902336655001202345IND60517234720221120024359.0190729e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051723472DNAL7 a223096842pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820120001692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSIMARRO, P. P.10aUpdate on field use of the available drugs for the chemotherapy of human African trypanosomiasis  ap. 842-846.  aDespite the fact that eflornithine was considered as the safer drug to treat human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and has been freely available since 2001, the difficulties in logistics and cost burden associated with this drug meant that the toxic melarsoprol remained the drug of choice. The World Health Organization responded to the situation by designing a medical kit containing all the materials needed to use eflornithine, and by implementing a training and drugs distribution programme which has allowed a transition to this much safer treatment. The introduction of the combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine (NECT) has accelerated the shift from melarsoprol to the best treatment available, due to reduced dosage and treatment time for eflornithine that has significantly lessened the cost and improved the burden of logistics encountered during treatment and distribution. The decrease in the use of more dangerous but cheaper melarsoprol has meant a rise in the per patient cost of treating HAT. Although NECT is cheaper than eflornithine monotherapy, an unexpected consequence has been a continuing rise in the per patient cost of treating HAT. The ethical decision of shifting to the best available treatment imposes a financial burden on HAT control programmes that might render long-term application unsustainable. These factors call for continuing research to provide new safer and more effective drugs that are simple to administer and cheaper when compared to current drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican trypanosomiasis 3aWorld Health Organization 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aethics 3ahumans 3apatients 3atoxicity 0aAfrican trypanosomiasis 0amelarsoprol 0aeflornithine 0anifurtimox 0atreatment combinations1 aFRANCO, J.1 aDIARRA, A.1 aPOSTIGO, J.

Other effects, however, have arisen from alterations in disturbance regimes that maintain the structure and function of these ecosystems. How have alterations of the disturbance regime altered the physiognomy of ‘‘old-growth’’ stands, and what are the implications for ecosystem conservation and restoration?Methods: In contrast to models that emphasize close interactions among the vertically complex strata, we develop a conceptual phenomenological model for the physiognomic structure of Pinus palustris stands. We relate two natural disturbances (tropical storms and fire) that affect different stages of the life cycle to different aspects of the physiognomic structure. We then compare overstorey stand structure and ground cover composition of two old-growth longleaf stands near the extremes of different composite disturbance regimes: the Wade Tract (frequent hurricanes and fire) and the Boyd Tract (infrequent hurricanes and long-term fire exclusion).Results: We predict that tropical storms and fires have different effects on stand physiognomy. Tropical storms are periodic, and sometimes intense, whereas fires are more frequent and less intense. Hurricanes directly influence the overstorey via wind-caused damage and mortality, and indirectly influence the herb layer by altering the spatial distribution of shading and litter accumulation. Fire exerts direct effects on juvenile stages and indirect effects on the herb layer via fine fuel consumption and selective mortality of potential competitors of P. palustris juveniles. These differences in effects of disturbances can result in widely different physiognomies for P. palustris stands. Finally, some global climate change scenarios have suggested that changes may occur in tropical storm and fire regimes, altering frequency and severity. Such changes may greatly affect pine stands, and ultimately entire pine savanna ecosystems.Conclusions: Our phenomenological model of disturbance regimes in Pinus palustris old-growth produces very different physiognomies for different disturbances regimes that reflect natural process and human management actions. This model can be used to derive restoration strategies for pine savannas that are linked to reinstitution of important ecological processes rather than specific physiognomic states.Nomenclature: Anon.

This review provides insight into the importance of metabolism studies during the drug development process and gives a short overview about the conventionally used methods since electrochemistry is often intended to substitute or minimize animal-based studies. The optimization of the electrochemical conditions is of great importance for a successful comparison with in vitro approaches. The type of metabolism reactions, which can be simulated by EC, has been extended with new cell types and working electrodes. Although the mechanism differs from the enzyme-catalyzed turnover, electrochemistry can be used to simulate a significant number of the respective reactions.An expanded set-up consisting of EC, a chromatographic separation and MS allows to distinguish between an electrospray ionization (ESI) in-source and an electrochemical oxidation and provides information on the polarity of the electrogenerated compounds. A main advantage of EC for metabolite generation is the possibility to isolate reactive species because of the purely instrumental approach. Especially when a preparative electrochemical cell with a larger working electrode surface is used, metabolites can be generated in sufficient quantities for their subsequent structure elucidation. Besides, the compounds can also be used for selective trapping experiments with different cell components such as small peptides, proteins or DNA bases. Current and possible future developments and applications of EC are presented and discussed as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3achromatography 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aoxidation 3apeptides 3aproteins 3atrapping 0aACN 0aADME 0aAg/AgCl/Cl 0aAPAP 0aAPPI 0aAQ 0aAQQI 0aAUX 0aBDD 0aCA 0aCYP 0aCYS 0aDHP 0aDNA 0aEC 0aEC/MS 0aESI 0aEU 0aFA 0aFT-MS 0aGC 0aGSH 0aGST 0aHLM 0aHSA 0aHV 0aLGA 0aLV 0aNAPQI 0aNAT 0aQ 0aREF 0aRLM 0aROS 0aS9 0aSHE 0aSRM 0aTCL 0aTSP 0aTP 0aUDP 0aUGT 0aWE 0aElectrochemistry 0aDrug metabolism 0aMass spectrometry 0aLiquid chromatography1 aVogel, Martin1 aKarst, Uwe0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 June 27, v. 834 p.9-21dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001900171245005800190300001600248520094200264592002801206650002701234650002601261650001101287650001601298650001001314650001001324650000701334650001101341650001101352650001201363650002601375650004501401650005101446650006701497650006001564650007801624650002801702650002401730650002501754651001801779653002401797653002801821653001501849653001301864653001101877700002801888700002001916700002201936700002001958700002201978773010602000856008702106852000902193655001202202IND50064879720221120194238.0190409e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006487972DNAL7 a234552282pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.01.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToivari, Mervi10aLow pH d-xylonate production with Pichia kudriavzevii  ap. 555-562.  ad-Xylonic acid is one of the top 30 most desirable chemicals to be derived from biomass sugars identified by the US Department of Energy, being applicable as a non-food substitute for d-gluconic acid and as a platform chemical. We engineered the non-conventional yeast Pichia kudriavzevii VTT C-79090T to express a d-xylose dehydrogenase coding gene from Caulobacter crescentus. With this single modification the recombinant P. kudriavzevii strain produced up to 171gL−1 of d-xylonate from 171gL−1d-xylose at a rate of 1.4gL−1h−1 and yield of 1.0g [g substrate consumed]−1, which was comparable with d-xylonate production by Gluconobacter oxydans or Pseudomonas sp. The productivity of the strain was also remarkable at low pH, producing 146gL−1d-xylonate at 1.2gL−1h−1 at pH 3.0. This is the best low pH production reported for d-xylonate. These results encourage further development towards industrial scale production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaulobacter crescentus 3aGluconobacter oxydans 3aPichia 3aPseudomonas 3aacids 3agenes 3apH 3asugars 3ayeasts 2aBiomass 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentrationxdrug effects 2aIntracellular Spacexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aKluyveromycesxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPichiaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSugar Acidsxmetabolism 2aXylitolxmetabolism 2aXylosexbiosynthesis 3aUnited States 0aPichia kudriavzevii 0aIssatchenkia orientalis 0ad-Xylonate 0ad-Xylose 0aLow pH1 aVehkomäki, Maija-Leena1 aNygård, Yvonne1 aPenttilä, Merja,1 aRuohonen, Laura1 aWiebe, Marilyn G.0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Apr., v. 133 p.555-562dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.01.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245012200202500002000324520179500344592002802139596005402167596005302221650001902274650002602293650001502319650001302334650000802347650001502355650001402370650001902384650001402403650001302417650001902430650002502449650001502474650001502489651001002504700001902514700006202533700005902595700002202654700001602676700002102692700002502713700002102738773013602759856007702895852000902972655001202981IND60789587120221119185946.0220822e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078958712DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JF0062562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuckel, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8973-112210aRock Glacier Characteristics Under Semiarid Climate Conditions in the Western Nyainqêntanglha Range, Tibetan Plateau  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRock glaciers are receiving increased attention as a potential source of water and indicator of climate change in periglacial landscapes. They consist of an ice‐debris mixture, which creeps downslope. Although rock glaciers are a wide‐spread feature on the Tibetan Plateau, characteristics such as its ice fraction are unknown as a superficial debris layer inhibits remote assessments. We investigate one rock glacier in the semiarid western Nyainqêntanglha range (WNR) with a multi‐method approach, which combines geophysical, geological and geomorphological field investigations with remote sensing techniques. Long‐term kinematics of the rock glacier are detected by 4‐year InSAR time series analysis. The ice content and the active layer are examined by electrical resistivity tomography, ground penetrating radar, and environmental seismology. Short‐term activity (11‐days) is captured by a seismic network. Clast analysis shows a sorting of the rock glacier's debris. The rock glacier has three zones, which are defined by the following characteristics: (a) Two predominant lithology types are preserved separately in the superficial debris patterns, (b) heterogeneous kinematics and seismic activity, and (c) distinct ice fractions. Conceptually, the studied rock glacier is discussed as an endmember of the glacier—debris‐covered glacier—rock glacier continuum. This, in turn, can be linked to its location on the semiarid lee‐side of the mountain range against the Indian summer monsoon. Geologically preconditioned and glacially overprinted, the studied rock glacier is suggested to be a recurring example for similar rock glaciers in the WNR. This study highlights how geology, topography and climate influence rock glacier characteristics and development.  aPublisher supplied data  aGRK 2309/1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)  a317513741cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) 3aclimate change 3aelectrical resistance 3ageophysics 3aglaciers 3aice 3akinematics 3alithology 3amonsoon season 3amountains 3aresearch 3asemiarid zones 3atime series analysis 3atomography 3atopography 3aChina1 aReinosch, Eike1 aVoigtländer, Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7881-43681 aDietze, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6063-17261 aBücker, Matthias1 aKrebs, Nora1 aSchroeckh, Ruben1 aMäusbacher, Roland,1 aHördt, Andreas,0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Jan., v. 127, no. 1 p.e2021JF006256-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF0062563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245011200165520101400277592002801291650002801319650002301347650001301370650003901383650002401422650002001446700002401466700002301490700001901513700002501532700001901557700002201576700002301598700001901621700002701640700002101667700002401688773012101712856007801833852000901911655001201920IND60792674620221118054501.0220908e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079267462DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111726672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangiorgio, Sara 10aPreparation, Characterization and In Vitro Stability of a Novel ACE-Inhibitory Peptide from Soybean Protein  aA soy protein isolate was hydrolyzed with Alcalase®, Flavourzyme® and their combination, and the resulting hydrolysates (A, F and A + F) were ultrafiltered and analyzed through SDS-PAGE. Fractions with MW < 1 kDa were investigated for their ACE-inhibitory activity, and the most active one (A < 1 kDa) was purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC, affording three further subfractions. NMR analysis and Edman degradation of the most active subfraction (A1) enabled the identification of four putative sequences (ALKPDNR, VVPD, NDRP and NDTP), which were prepared by solid-phase synthesis. The comparison of their ACE-inhibitory activities suggested that the novel peptide NDRP might be the main agent responsible for A1 fraction ACE inhibition (ACE inhibition = 87.75 ± 0.61%; IC₅₀ = 148.28 ± 9.83 μg mL⁻¹). NDRP acts as a non-competitive inhibitor and is stable towards gastrointestinal simulated digestion.

Infections could be acquired in any month, but prevalence, and probability of infection, peaked in the summer. There were significant differences in the pattern of infections between the two species. Both hosts were primarily infected as juveniles, but the probability of infection was highest for A. flavicollis, which, evidence suggests, experienced longer-lasting infections with a wider range of Bartonella genotypes. There was no evidence of increased host mortality associated with Bartonella, although the infection did affect the probability of recapture. Animals could become re-infected, generally by different Bartonella genotypes. Several longer lasting, poorly resolved infections of A. flavicollis involved more than 1 genotype, and may have resulted from sequential infections. Of 22 Bartonella gltA genotypes collected, only 2 (both B. grahamii) were shared between mice and voles; all others were specific either to A. flavicollis or to M. glareolus, and had their nearest relatives infecting Microtus species in neighbouring fields. This heterogeneity in the patterns of Bartonella infections in wild rodents emphasizes the need to consider variation between both, host species and Bartonella genotypes in ecological and epidemiological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApodemus flavicollis 3aBartonella 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3aMicrotus 3aboreal forests 3aepidemiological studies 3agenotype 3ahosts 3ajuveniles 3amice 3amortality 3aprobability 3asummer 3avoles 3aPoland 0aBartonella 0aApodemus 0aMyodes 0arodents 0arodent epidemiology 0aparasite communities1 aHARRIS, P.

This study aimed to analyze comprehensively the capacity of SFV vector to express rabies lyssavirus glycoprotein (RVGP) in mammalian cells. The assessed parameters were transfection strategy, multiplicity of infection (MOI), harvest time and mammalian cell host. Two transfection approaches, electroporation and lipofection were evaluated to obtain the recombinant SFV, and the electroporation was found to be the most effective. Viral quantification by RT-qPCR was performed to elucidate the relation between the amount of recombinant virus utilized in the infection process and the production levels of the heterologous protein. Four different multiplicities of infection (MOIs = 1; 10; 15; 50) were evaluated using five mammalian cell lines: BHK-21, HuH-7, Vero, L929, and HEK-293T. Protein expression was assessed at two harvest times after infection (24 and 48 h). The recombinant protein generated was characterized by western blot, dot blot, and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), while its concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Similar expression patterns were observed in cell lines BHK-21, HEK-293T, L929, and Vero, with higher RVGP production in the first 24 h. The BHK-21 cells showed yields of up to 4.3 μg per 10⁶ cells when lower MOIs (1 and 10) were used. The HEK-293 T cells also showed similar production (4.3 μg per 10⁶ cells) with MOI of 1, while the L929 and Vero cell lines showed lower expression rates of 2.82 and 1.26 μg per 10⁶ cells, respectively. These cell lines showed lower expression levels at 48 h after infection compared to 24 h. Controversially, in the case of the HuH-7 cell line, RVGP production was higher at 48 h after infection (4.0 μg per 10⁶ cells) and using MOIs of 15 and 50. This work may contribute to optimize the RVGP production using SFV system in mammalian cells. This study can also substantiate for example, the development of approaches that use of SFV for applications for other protein expressions and suggests values for relevant parameters and cell lines of this biotechnique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRabies lyssavirus 3aSemliki Forest virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aWestern blotting 3acell lines 3aelectroporation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglycoproteins 3aharvest date 3amammals 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arecombinant proteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atransfection 3aviruses 0aSFV 0aRabies 0aGlycoprotein1 aFernández Núñez, Eutimio Gustavo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2800-392X1 aAstray, Renato Mancini1 aPuglia, Ana Lia Pradella1 aPereira, Carlos Augusto1 aJorge, Soraia Attie Calil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9380-10230 tJournal of biotechnology.g2019 Oct. 10, v. 304 p.63-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2019.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014900170500001900319520204100338592002802379650002402407650001502431650001202446650001002458650001702468650001102485650001402496650001902510650001402529650001402543650001502557651001802572653002502590653001302615653004302628653001302671700001902684700002002703700002002723700002202743700001902765700002002784700001902804700002102823773010702844856008502951852000903036655001203045IND60698557820221119084743.0200809e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069855782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1149712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkther, Shumona10aBehavior of eukaryotic symbionts in large benthic foraminifers Calcarina gaudichaudii and Baculogypsina sphaerulata under exposure to wastewater  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLarge benthic foraminifers (LBFs) are significant contributors to coral island formation in the Pacific Ocean. In recent years, the population of LBFs has decreased because of the increase in anthropogenic influences, such as wastewater (WW) discharge. To implement efficient mitigation measures, pollution tolerance in LBFs should be understood. However, the effects of WW on LBFs and their symbionts have not yet been demonstrated. This study examined the changes in the photosynthetic efficiency (Y[II]) of Calcarina gaudichaudii and Baculogypsina sphaerulata in response to WW by using a pulse-amplitude-modulation fluorometer. These LBFs were exposed to WW with different dilution levels for 22 days. The Y(II) values of the LBFs were found to deteriorate within 1–2 days. However, the Y(II) values both deteriorated and were enhanced in the experiments, thus indicating that WW contains both harmful and beneficial components. Baculogypsina sphaerulata showed an earlier response and greater sensitivity to WW and a higher epibiont infestation than C. gaudichaudii. This result can be attributed to the differences in the physiological and morphological responses of distinct LBFs. A sequencing analysis of 18S rDNA confirmed that the dominant eukaryotic symbionts in the two LBFs studied were Ochrophyta and Labyrinthulomycetes. These eukaryotic symbionts were released and attached as epibionts onto LBFs that were exposed to WW, thus leading to an increase in inactive LBFs. The Shannon–Weaver and Simpson diversity indices revealed that eukaryotic symbiont communities decreased in biodiversity after exposure to WW because of the abundance of algal symbionts. On the basis of these results, we conclude that WW, even with 10,000 × dilution, causes a decrease in active LBF populations owing to the release of eukaryotic symbionts, the decrease in biodiversity, and the infestation of epibionts even though Y(II) is temporarily enhanced. These responses are more significant in B. sphaerulata than in C. gaudichaudii.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLabyrinthulomycetes 3aOchrophyta 3aRetaria 3aalgae 3abiodiversity 3acorals 3aepibionts 3aphotosynthesis 3apollution 3asymbionts 3awastewater 3aPacific Ocean 0aCalcifying organisms 0aEpibiont 0aPulse-amplitude-modulation fluorometer 0a18S rDNA1 aSuzuki, Jumpei1 aPokhrel, Preeti1 aOkada, Teruhisa1 aImamura, Masahiro1 aEnomoto, Tadao1 aKitano, Takashi1 aKuwahara, Yuji1 aFujita, Masafumi0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Oct., v. 265 p.114971-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1149713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245012400213300002000337500001900357520147300376592002801849650002201877650001301899650002101912650001301933650001101946650001301957650001201970650001401982700006401996700002202060700006302082700001902145700005802164700006002222700005902282700006102341700001902402773012202421856008402543852000902627655001202636IND60718338120221120232600.0201124e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071833812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c012892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarnacka, Magdalena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9444-311410aCorrelation between Locally Ordered (Hydrogen-Bonded) Nanodomains and Puzzling Dynamics of Polymethysiloxane Derivative  ap. 10225-10233.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe examined the behavior of poly(mercaptopropyl)methylsiloxane (PMMS), characterized by a polymer chain backbone of alternate silicon and oxygen atoms substituted by a polar pendant group able to form hydrogen bonds (−SH moiety), by means of infrared (FTIR) and dielectric (BDS) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and rheology. We observed that the examined PMMS forms relatively efficient hydrogen bonds leading to the association of chains in the form of ordered lamellar-like hydrogen-bonded nanodomains. Moreover, the recorded mechanical and dielectric spectra revealed the presence of two relaxation processes. A direct comparison of collected data and relaxation times extracted from two experimental techniques, BDS and rheology, indicates that they monitor different types of the mobility of PMMS macromolecules. Our mechanical measurements revealed the presence of Rouse modes connected to the chain dynamics (slow process) and segmental relaxation (a faster process), whereas in the dielectric loss spectra we observed two relaxation processes related most likely to either the association–dissociation phenomenon within lamellar-like self-assemblies or the sub-Rouse mode (α′-slower process) and segmental (α-faster process) dynamics. Data presented herein allow a better understanding of the peculiar dynamical properties of polysiloxanes and associating polymers having strongly polar pendant moieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3amoieties 3aoxygen 3arheology 3asilicon 3asiloxanes1 aJurkiewicz, Karolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4289-78271 aHachuła, Barbara1 aWojnarowska, Zaneta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7790-29991 aWrzalik, Roman1 aBielas, Rafał1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5129-063X1 aTalik, Agnieszka1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7940-69671 aMaksym, Paulina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8506-71021 aKamiński, Kamil,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5871-02031 aPaluch, Marian0 tMacromolecules.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 53, no. 22 p.10225-10233dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c012893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245013900175300001400314520186300328592002802191650002602219650001502245650001202260650001102272650001502283650001902298650001002317650001902327650002102346650001602367650001302383650001502396650001302411650001402424650001902438650002302457650002202480650002202502653002602524653001302550653001502563653002502578653001602603653001802619653002202637700002402659700002202683700002102705773008602726856008602812852000902898655001202907IND60604122620221118105303.0180716e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060412262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2015.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeaney, Carolyn A.10aOptimal spore germination in Clostridium botulinum ATCC 3502 requires the presence of functional copies of SleB and YpeB, but not CwlJ  ap. 86-93.  aGermination, the process by which dormant endospores return to vegetative growth, is a critical process in the life cycle of the notorious pathogen Clostridium botulinum. Crucial is the degradation by hydrolytic enzymes of an inner peptidoglycan spore layer termed the cortex. Two mechanistically different systems of cortex lysis exist in spores of Clostridium species. C. botulinum ATCC 3502 harbours the Bacillus-like system of SleB, CwlJ and YpeB cortex lytic enzymes (CLEs). Through the construction of insertional gene knockout mutants in the sleB, cwlJ and ypeB genes of C. botulinum ATCC 3502 and the production of spores of each mutant strain, the effect on germination was assessed. This study demonstrates a reduced germination efficiency in spores carrying mutations in either sleB or ypeB with an approximate 2-fold reduction in heat resistant colony forming units (CFU/OD600) when plated on rich media. This reduction could be restored to wild-type levels by removing the spore coat and plating on media supplemented with lysozyme. It was observed that cwlJ spores displayed a similar germination efficiency as wild-type spores (P > 0.05). An optimal germinant commixture was identified to include a combination of l-alanine with sodium bicarbonate as it resulted in a 32% drop in OD600, while the additional incorporation of l-lactate resulted in a 57% decrease. Studies of the germination efficiency of spores prepared from all three CLE mutants was performed by monitoring the associated decrease in optical density but a germination defect was not observed in any of the CLE mutant strains. This was likely due to the lack of specificity of this particular assay. Taken together, these data indicate that functional copies of SleB and YpeB, but not CwlJ are required for the optimal germination of the spores of C. botulinum ATCC 3502.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium botulinum 3aabsorbance 3aalanine 3acortex 3aendospores 3agene targeting 3agenes 3aheat tolerance 3aknockout mutants 3alactic acid 3alysozyme 3amonitoring 3amutation 3apathogens 3apeptidoglycans 3asodium bicarbonate 3aspore germination 3avegetative growth 0aClostridium botulinum 0aClosTron 0aEndospores 0aCortex lytic enzymes 0aGermination 0aPeptidoglycan 0aCortex hydrolysis1 aCartman, Stephen T.1 aMcClure, Peter J.1 aMinton, Nigel P.0 tAnaerobe.g2015 Aug., v. 34 p.86-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2015.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010100160300001400261520138400275592002801659650001501687650002501702650001601727650001201743650001201755650001501767650000901782650001901791650001301810650001301823650001801836650000701854650001801861650001001879650002301889650001701912650001601929650001701945650000901962650001001971653001001981653000801991653000701999653000702006653000802013653000802021653000902029653000802038653002302046653002902069653002302098653001702121700001502138700001102153700001502164700001302179773009002192856008102282852000902363655001202372IND60544721720221118221315.0160901e20140811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054472172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Li10aRapid colorimetric sensing of tetracycline antibiotics with in situ growth of gold nanoparticles  ap. 83-90.  aA colorimetric assay utilizing the formation of gold nanoparticles was developed to detect tetracycline antibiotics in fluidic samples. Tetracycline antibiotics showed the capability of directly reducing aurate salts into atomic gold which form gold nanoparticles spontaneously under proper conditions. The resulted gold nanoparticles showed characteristic plasmon absorbance at 526nm, which can be visualized by naked eyes or with a spectrophotometer. UV–vis absorbance of the resulted gold nanoparticles is correlated directly with the concentrations of tetracycline antibiotics in the solution, allowing for quantitative colorimetric detection of tetracycline antibiotics. Reaction conditions, such as pH, temperature, reaction time, and ionic strength were optimized. Sensitivity of the colorimetric assay can be enhanced by the addition of gold nanoparticle seeds, a LOD as low as 20ngmL−1 can be achieved with the help of seed particles. The colorimetric assay showed minimum interference from ethanol, methanol, urea, glucose, and other antibiotics such as sulfonamides, amino glycosides etc. Validity of the method was also evaluated on urine samples spiked with tetracycline antibiotics. The method provides a broad spectrum detection method for rapid and sensitive detection of reductive substances such as tetracycline antibiotics in liquid and biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aanalytical chemistry 3acolorimetry 3aethanol 3aglucose 3aglycosides 3agold 3aionic strength 3amethanol 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apH 3arapid methods 3asalts 3aspectrophotometers 3asulfonamides 3atemperature 3atetracycline 3aurea 3aurine 0aAuNPs 0aTCs 0aTC 0aDC 0aOTC 0aCTC 0aCTAC 0aLOQ 0aGold nanoparticles 0aTetracycline antibiotics 0aColorimetric assay 0aUrine sample1 aChen, Jing1 aLi, Na1 aHe, Pingli1 aLi, Zhen0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Aug. 11, v. 839 p.83-90dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008000169300001600249520072200265592002800987650001201015650001501027650001001042650001601052650002401068650002501092650001001117650001301127650001901140650001901159650001501178650001801193650001401211653002101225653001501246700001901261700001901280700001701299700001701316700001901333700001801352700001701370700002101387700002001408700001801428700001901446773008801465856008601553852000901639655001201648IND60604122820221118105321.0180716e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060412282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2015.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Jae-Hoon10aBacteremic meningitis caused by Parvimonas micra in an immunocompetent host  ap. 161-163.  aA 61-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B and dyslipidemia visited the emergency department with a fever and severe headache.

Studies performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells indicate that vigilin localises to the cytoplasm, binds ribosomes, associates to RER and regulates mRNA translation. On the other hand, we and others reported a contribution to heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing (PEV) and chromosome segregation in S. cerevisiae, Drosophila and human cells. Whether this contribution is direct remains, however, unclear. Here, we report that Drosophila vigilin, DDP1, vastly localises to the cytoplasm, being largely excluded from the nucleus. We also show that DDP1 preferentially associates to RER and co-purifies with several ribosomal proteins, suggesting a contribution to mRNA translation. In light of these results, the contribution of DDP1 to PEV was re-examined. Here, we show that a newly generated null ddp1Δ mutation is only a weak suppressor of PEV, which is in contrast with our own previous results showing dominant suppression in the presence of a strong hypomorphic ddp1¹⁵.¹ mutation. Similar results were obtained in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where vigilin (Vgl1) also associates to RER, having no significant contribution to PEV at centromeres, telomeres and the mating-type locus. Altogether, these results indicate that cytoplasmic localisation and association to RER, but not contribution to heterochromatin organisation, are evolutionarily conserved features of vigilin, favouring a model by which vigilin acts in the cytoplasm, regulating RNA metabolism, and affects nuclear functions only indirectly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3acentromeres 3achromosome segregation 3agene silencing 3aheterochromatin 3ahumans 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amutation 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 3arough endoplasmic reticulum 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atelomeres 3atranslation (genetics)1 aMarsellach, Francesc-Xavier1 aHuertas, Dori1 aAzorín, Fernando0 tBBA - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms.g2011 Jan., v. 1809, no. 1 p.46-55dElsevier B.V.x1874-93997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagrm.2010.10.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245016000164520108300324592002801407650001901435650001801454650001601472650001501488650000901503650001601512650001701528650001401545650001301559650001301572650001501585650001001600650001201610650002301622650001401645650002301659650002501682650003101707700002701738700002901765700002101794700002201815700002401837700002601861700002101887700002301908700003001931700002801961700002201989700003102011773012002042856007802162852000902240655001202249IND60792675020221118054542.0220908e20220824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079267502DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111725542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuto, Antonella 10aFruitomics: The Importance of Combining Sensory and Chemical Analyses in Assessing Cold Storage Responses of Six Peach (Prunus persica L.

Quality changes are assessed through the content of nutritionally relevant compounds, aroma, physical characters and/or sensorially. Here, six peach and nectarine cultivars were sampled at commercial harvest and after 7 days of 1 °C storage. A trained panel was used to evaluate sensorial characters, while carotenoids, phenolics, vitamin C, total sugars, and qualitative traits including firmness, titrable acidity and soluble solid content were integrated with volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis previously reported. The different analyses reveal interesting patterns of correlation, and the six cultivars responded differently to cold storage. Sensory parameters were correlated with 64 VOCs and seven intrinsic characters. Acidity, firmness, and 10 VOCs were strongly negatively correlated with harmony and sweetness, but positively correlated with bitterness, astringency, and crunchiness. In contrast, Brix, b-carotene, and six VOCs were positively correlated with harmony and sweetness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus persica 3aascorbic acid 3aastringency 3abitterness 3abrix 3acarotenoids 3acold storage 3acultivars 3afirmness 3ahardness 3anectarines 3aodors 3apeaches 3aphenolic compounds 3asweetness 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3avolatile organic compounds1 aChristofides, Sarah R.1 aSirangelo, Tiziana Maria1 aBartella, Lucia 1 aMüller, Carsten,1 aDi Donna, Leonardo 1 aMuzzalupo, Innocenzo 1 aBruno, Leonardo 1 aFerrante, Antonio 1 aChiappetta, Adriana A.

Acid Black 1. Of them, Oscillatoria curvicepsBDU92191 was able to grow up to a tested concentration of 500mGL⁻¹. The organism degraded 84% of the dye at 100mGL⁻¹ in 8days in a medium free of combined nitrogen. The dye degrading ability is attributed to the activities of the enzymes: laccase, polyphenol oxidase and azoreductase. The absence of the doublet amine peak in addition to the overall reduction of absorption in the IR spectra confirmed the mineralisation of the tested azo dye. The nitrogen assimilating enzyme studies along with nitrogenase assay strongly suggested the ability of the non-heterocystous, filamentous marine cyanobacterium, O. curvicepsBDU92191 to use C.I. Acid Black 1 as a nitrogen source in an oligotrophic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3amineralization 3alaccase 3aOscillatoria 3aazo dyes 3acatechol oxidase 3aabsorption 3anitrogen 3aamines 3aenzyme activity 2aAmido Black 2aBiodegradation, Environmentalxdrug effects 2aCatechol Oxidasexmetabolism 2aColoring Agentsxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Agar Gel 2aLaccasexmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aOscillatoriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 0aCyanobacterium1 aUma, Lakshmanan1 aAhamed, Abdul Khaleel1 aSubramanian, Gopalakrishnan1 aPrabaharan, Dharmar0 tBioresource technology.g2011 July, v. 102, no. 14 p.7218-7223dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.02.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245010000199500002000299520112800319592002801447596008801475596003601563650001501599650002601614650001301640650001101653650001201664650001401676651001001690651001701700700006001717700002201777700005801799700005801857773013601915856007702051852000902128655001202137IND60789587620221119191833.0220822e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078958762DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JF0063272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Yuezhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4324-736710aSpatial and Temporal Variations of Incision Rate of the Middle Yellow River and Its Tributaries  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe present a model to reconstruct spatiotemporal variation of uplift along the Jinshan Gorge of the Yellow River of Northern China based on quantitative analysis of the river channel profiles. We focus on the tributaries along the gorge that drain from the Loess Plateau on the Ordos crustal block. Base level fall on a tributary is genetically related to its trunk channel incision through the incision rate of the confluence point. We leverage this relationship to reconstruct a scaled incision history at each confluence point from an inversion analysis of tributary networks governed by the stream power law. In this way, we create an artificial geomorphic marker, that we refer to as a “pseudo‐terrace.” These metrics provide information on the incision history of the Yellow River. Our result shows a recent acceleration of river incision along the southern Jinshan Gorge, including spatial variations indicative of tectonic activity. The northern gorge exhibits more uniform and steady incision rates. This pattern can be attributed to on‐going lithospheric mantle upwelling beneath the southern Ordos Block.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019QZKK0704cThe Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program  cChina Sponsorship Council (CSC) 3ageophysics 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearch 3arivers 3astreams 3atectonics 3aChina 3aYellow River1 aWillett, Sean D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8408-05671 aPicotti, Vincenzo1 aXiong, Jianguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6018-97711 aZhang, Huiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3042-43010 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Jan., v. 127, no. 1 p.e2021JF006327-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF0063273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03658naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245008900202500002000291520184600311592002802157596005302185596005302238596005302291596005302344596005302397650001602450650001302466650001502479650001602494650002502510650001502535650001102550650001802561650001302579650001402592650001702606650001502623650002002638650002202658650001802680650001602698650001502714700006202729700006602791700006102857773013602918856007703054852000903131655001203140IND60789587720221119191715.0220822e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078958772DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JF0062392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLitwin, David G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8097-402910aGroundwater Affects the Geomorphic and Hydrologic Properties of Coevolved Landscapes  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe hydrologic dynamics and geomorphic evolution of watersheds are intimately coupled—runoff generation and water storage are controlled by topography and properties of the surface and subsurface, while also affecting the evolution of those properties over geologic time. However, the large disparity between their timescales has made it difficult to examine interdependent controls on emergent hydrogeomorphic properties, such as hillslope length, drainage density, and extent of surface saturation. In this study, we develop a new model coupling hydrology and landscape evolution to explore how runoff generation affects long‐term catchment evolution, and analyze numerical results using a nondimensional scaling framework. We focus on hydrologic processes dominating in humid climates where storm runoff primarily arises from shallow subsurface flow and from precipitation on saturated areas. The model solves hydraulic groundwater equations to predict the water‐table elevation given prescribed, constant groundwater recharge. Water in excess of the subsurface capacity for transport becomes overland flow, which generates shear stress on the surface and may detach and transport sediment. This affects the landscape form that in turn affects runoff generation. We show that (a) four dimensionless parameters describe the possible steady state landscapes that coevolve under steady recharge; (b) hillslope length increases with increasing transmissivity relative to the recharge rate; (c) three topographic metrics—steepness index, Laplacian curvature, and topographic index—together provide a basis for interpreting landscapes that have coevolved with runoff generated via shallow subsurface flow. Finally we discuss the possibilities and limitations for quantitative comparisons between the model results and real landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data  aEAR‐2012264cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aEAR‐1654194cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aEAR‐1725774cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aEAR‐1831623cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aACI‐1450409cNational Science Foundation (NSF) 3acoevolution 3adrainage 3ageophysics 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3aresearch 3asediments 3ashear stress 3astormwater 3asubsurface flow 3atopographic slope 3awater storage 3awater table 3awatersheds1 aTucker, Gregory E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0364-58001 aBarnhart, Katherine R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5682-455X1 aHarman, Ciaran J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3185-002X0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Jan., v. 127, no. 1 p.e2021JF006239-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF0062393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245010700167300001600274520173700290592002802027650002102055650001002076650001102086650001602097650001102113650001702124650001302141650001702154650001202171650000902183650001902192650001102211650001402222650001902236650001702255650001102272650001202283700002602295700002102321700002502342700002202367700003202389773010502421856007302526852000902599655001202608IND60125980720221121121029.0150428e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012598072DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.122872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVatsa‐Portugal, Parul10aInflorescences vs leaves: a distinct modulation of carbon metabolism process during Botrytis infection  ap. 162-177.  aPlant growth and survival depends critically on photo assimilates. Pathogen infection leads to changes in carbohydrate metabolism of plants. In this study, we monitored changes in the carbohydrate metabolism in the grapevine inflorescence and leaves using Botrytis cinerea and Botrytis pseudo cinerea. Fluctuations in gas exchange were correlated with variations in chlorophyll a fluorescence. During infection, the inflorescences showed an increase in net photosynthesis (Pn) with a stomatal limitation. In leaves, photosynthesis decreased, with a non‐stomatal limitation. A decrease in the effective photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield (ΦPSII) was accompanied by an increase in photochemical quenching (qP) and non‐photochemical quenching (qN). The enhancement of qP and ΦPSII could explain the observed increase in Pn. In leaves, the significant decline in ΦPSII and qP, and increase in qN suggest that energy was mostly oriented toward heat dissipation instead of CO₂fixation. The accumulation of glucose and sucrose in inflorescences and glucose and fructose in the leaves during infection indicate that the plant's carbon metabolism is differently regulated in these two organs. While a strong accumulation of starch was observed at 24 and 48 hours post‐inoculation (hpi) with both species of Botrytis in the inflorescences, a significant decrease with B. cinerea at 24 hpi and a significant increase with B. pseudo cinerea at 48 hpi were observed in the leaves. On the basis of these results, it can be said that during pathogen attack, the metabolism of grapevine inflorescence and leaf is modified suggesting distinct mechanisms modifying gas exchange, PSII activity and sugar contents in these two organs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aVitis 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3afructose 3agas exchange 3aglucose 3aheat 3ainflorescences 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aphotosystem II 3aplant growth 3astarch 3asucrose1 aWalker, Anne‐Sophie1 aJacquens, Lucile1 aClément, Christophe1 aBarka, Essaid Ait1 aVaillant‐Gaveau, Nathalie0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2015 May, v. 154, no. 1 p.162-177dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.122873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01614naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010900160300001600269520075000285592002801035653001501063653001201078653001001090653001801100653002401118773011101142856007401253852000901327655001201336IND60596116820221120081447.0180625e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059611682DNAL7 a10.2517/2017PR0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTazawa, Jun-Ichi10aLate Devonian Brachiopods from Choanji, South Kitakami Belt, Japan, and Their Stratigraphic Significance  ap. 129-144.  aLate Devonian brachiopods from Choanji, South Kitakami Belt, northeastern Japan, are re-examined to determine their age. Two brachiopod assemblages are recognized in the Choanji area. The assemblage from locality CHJ2 in the middle part of the Choanji Formation consists of one species, Desquamatia (Seratrypa) sp., which indicates a Frasnian age. The assemblage from locality CHJ1 in the upper part of the Choanji Formation consists of 13 species in 10 genera, including a new species, Parallelora minatoi sp. nov., and is of late Famennian age. Thus, the Choanji Formation is correlated with the Upper Devonian (Frasnian–upper Famennian), although until quite recently it was considered to be the lowest Carboniferous (Tournaisian) in Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 0abrachiopod 0aChoanji 0aJapan 0aLate Devonian 0aSouth Kitakami Belt0 tPaleontological research.g2018 Apr., v. 22, no. 2 p.129-144dUniBio PresswJournal:26764x1342-81447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2517/2017PR0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245012800166520147000294520013701764592002801901650002101929650001301950650002201963650001101985650001801996650002002014650002102034650002302055650002602078650001002104650002302114650001902137650001802156650001402174650002202188651001402210653000902224653001902233653000802252653002402260653002902284653001402313700002002327700001902347700002102366700001802387700001702405700002002422700002302442700001802465773012502483856007702608852000902685655001202694IND60699887420221119203939.0200623e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069988742DNAL7 a10.1093/femsec/fiv1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanukollu, Saranya10aDistinct compositions of free-living, particle-associated and benthic communities of the Roseobacter group in the North Sea  aThe Roseobacter group is one of the predominant lineages in the marine environment. While most investigations focus on pelagic roseobacters, the distribution and metabolic potential of benthic representatives is less understood. In this study, the diversity of the Roseobacter group was characterized in sediment and water samples along the German/Scandinavian North Sea coast by 16S rRNA gene analysis and cultivation-based methods. Molecular analysis indicated an increasing diversity between communities of the Roseobacter group from the sea surface to the seafloor and revealed distinct compositions of free-living and attached fractions. Culture media containing dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl sulfonium propionate (DMSP) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stimulated growth of roseobacters showing highest most probable numbers (MPN) in DMSO-containing dilutions of surface sediments (2.1 × 10⁷ roseobacters cm⁻³). Twenty roseobacters (12 from sediments) were isolated from DMSP- and DMS-containing cultures. Sequences of the isolates represented 0.04% of all Bacteria and 4.7% of all roseobacters in the pyrosequencing dataset from sediments. Growth experiments with the isolate Shimia sp. SK013 indicated that benthic roseobacters are able to switch between aerobic and anaerobic utilization of organic sulfur compounds. This response to changing redox conditions might be an adaptation to specific environmental conditions on particles and in sediments.  aRoseobacters show distinctive compositions and are able to switch from aerobic to anaerobic utilization of organic sulfur compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodobacteraceae 3abacteria 3abenthic organisms 3acoasts 3aculture media 3adata collection 3adimethyl sulfide 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3amarine environment 3apropionic acid 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asequence analysis 3aNorth Sea 0aDGGE 0apyrosequencing 0aMPN 0aenrichment cultures 0aorganic sulfur compounds 0aShimia sp1 aWemheuer, Bernd1 aHerber, Janina1 aBillerbeck, Sara1 aLucas, Judith1 aDaniel, Rolf1 aSimon, Meinhard1 aCypionka, Heribert1 aEngelen, Bert0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 92, no. 1 p.fiv145-dOxford University PresswJournal:1989x1574-69417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiv1453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245009100198500002000289520183300309592002802142596002102170596002802191650001102219650001902230650001402249650001502263650001802278650001802296650001102314650001302325650001402338650002302352650001402375700006102389700005602450700006002506773013602566856007702702852000902779655001202788IND60789587820221119191709.0220822e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078958782DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JF0061522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmilady, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9435-050010aModeling the Morphodynamic Response of Estuarine Intertidal Shoals to Sea‐Level Rise  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntertidal shoals are key features of estuarine environments worldwide. Climate change poses questions regarding the sustainability of intertidal areas under sea‐level rise (SLR). Our work investigates the SLR impact on the long‐term morphological evolution of unvegetated intertidal sandy shoals in a constrained channel‐shoal system. Utilizing a process‐based model (Delft3D), we schematize a short tidal system in a rectangular (2.5 × 20 km) basin with a high‐resolution grid. An initial, mildly sloping, bathymetry is subjected to constant semidiurnal tidal forcing, sediment supply, and small wind‐generated waves modeled by SWAN. A positive morphodynamic feedback between hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphology causes the emergence of large‐scale channel‐shoal patterns. Over centuries, tide‐residual sediment transport gradually decreases leading to a state of low morphological activity balanced by tides, waves, and sediment supply. Tidal currents are the main driver of the SLR morphodynamic adaptation. Wave action leads to wider and lower shoals but does not fundamentally change the long‐term morphological evolution. SLR causes increased flood dominance which triggers sediment import into the system. Shoals accrete in response to SLR with a lag that increases as SLR accelerates, eventually causing intertidal shoals to drown. Seaward shoals near the open boundary sediment source have higher accretion rates compared to landward shoals. Similarly, on a shoal‐scale, the highest accretion rates occur at the shoal edges bounding the sediment suppling channels. A larger sediment supply enhances the SLR adaptation. Waves help distribute sediment supplied from channels across shoals. Adding mud fractions leads to faster, more uniform, accretion and muddier shoals under SLR.  aPublisher supplied data  cSURF Cooperative  cDeltares Research Funds 3abasins 3aclimate change 3aestuaries 3ageophysics 3ahydrodynamics 3alittoral zone 3amodels 3aresearch 3asea level 3asediment transport 3asediments1 avan der Wegen, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5227-26791 aRoelvink, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5367-00031 avan der Spek, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7131-43630 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Jan., v. 127, no. 1 p.e2021JF006152-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27941x2169-90037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF0061523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245017300207300001600380520184400396592002802240596007002268596007002338596007002408650001402478650001002492650001302502650002102515650001602536650001502552650002202567650002702589650001302616650002302629650001302652650001302665650001102678650002202689650002202711650001702733700002802750700003102778773012902809856008202938852000903020655001203029IND60698117620221120034949.0200609e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069811762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-020-01779-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapelli, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9965-224110aSong variation in the Caatinga suboscine Silvery-cheeked Antshrike (Sakesphorus cristatus) suggests latitude and São Francisco River as drivers of geographic variation  ap. 873-884.  aHistorical processes may result in patterns of differentiation among extant populations, which may lead to diversification and speciation. This is often expressed, and measured, as genetic and behavioral variation among populations. Suboscine birds acquire songs by innate mechanisms and are typically poorly studied relative to oscine birds, which may learn songs and thus develop unique dialects among populations. Behavioral features, including song, are extensively used to describe the structure and geographical variation in bird populations. In turn, this knowledge may shed light onto patterns of species diversification across ecoregions, which is particularly relevant in endemic species. Here we investigate for the first time song structure and variation in the Silvery-cheeked Antshrike, an endemic bird of a poorly studied South American dry forest, the Caatinga. We evaluate hypotheses for song diversification, correlating vocal acoustic parameters with geographic patterns and environmental variables. We measured temporal and spectral variables in the song of Sakesphorus cristatus across 14 localities spanning almost the entire range of the species’ distribution. The song presents a clear geographic pattern, and vocal variation was congruent with a barrier by the São Francisco River superimposed to a latitudinal clinal variation that was uncorrelated to climate variables. We argue that these regional differences may have a genetic basis since S. cristatus is a suboscine antbird that should not show song learning (social adaptation) and, apparently, does not have the song correlated to habitat features (acoustic adaptation). More detailed studies are required to test further hypotheses about the drivers of this potential genetic variation underlying the geographical variation in this suboscine bird song.  aPublisher supplied data  aRED0045/2014cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia  aJCB0026/2016cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia  aBOL0175/2016cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia 3aacoustics 3abirds 3acaatinga 3aclimatic factors 3adry forests 3aecoregions 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3alatitude 3alearning 3arivers 3asocial adjustment 3aspecies diversity 3avocalization1 aBatalha-Filho, Henrique1 aJapyassú, Hilton Ferreira0 tJournal of ornithology.g2020 July, v. 161, no. 3 p.873-884dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-020-01779-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04031naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009100168300001600259520253500275592002802810650001302838650000902851650001002860650002002870650002502890650001602915650001502931650002602946650002002972650001602992650001603008650001003024650000903034650002103043650001003064650003003074650001703104650001203121650002303133650001703156653002003173653001603193653002203209653002903231700001503260700002503275773010803300856008403408852000903492655001203501IND60525423420221118063744.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052542342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2015.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDabach, Sharon14aThe influence of water uptake on matric head variability in a drip-irrigated root zone  ap. 216-224.  aIrrigation is a service provided to agricultural crops in order to improve their yields. This is also a rare situation where the location of the costumers (roots) is not known and the heterogeneity in the water delivery system (soil) effects the water distribution. This non-uniformity of soil-plant conditions in the agricultural field complicates decision-making parameters regarding irrigation management (where to place sensors, how many sensors are needed, when and how much to irrigate). Many aspects of this non-uniformity have been studied in the past decades, including soil hydraulic properties, tillage history, irrigation method, sensor location, measured volume, and more. One aspect that has been relatively neglected is how plant roots affect variability. In this work, we focus on the effect that growing roots have on the variability of tensiometer measurements.Corn seeds were sown in a pre-designed experimental plot that consisted of three very distinct soils (sand, sandy loam, clay) to create high variation in investigated conditions. Subsurface drip irrigation was installed in the plot, and the drippers of the center line were wrapped with geotextile to create a geotextile-drip interface (GDI), i.e., a volume which has preferred conditions for root growth. Tensiometers were installed in the GDI (GDI treatment) and 10cm away from the drip lines (S10 treatment); the matric head was monitored throughout the season.The weekly averaged coefficient of variation (CV) of the GDI treatment decreased as the corn plants grew, for each soil type and the entire plot. As time passed and the corn plants grew, CV peaks, due to irrigation, and the duration of high CV decreased because of the increasing influence of root water uptake on fluxes in the measured volume. After harvest, the CV returned to initial values. S10 tensiometers showed higher CV values than the GDI tensiometers during the last week of growth. After harvest, the CV of the S10 tensiometer measurements decreased, contrary to the trend in the GDI tensiometers. The results point to the major influence of roots on matric head variability, first, by decreasing variability with time and second, through the effect of tensiometer location since the GDI tensiometers were located in volumes with high root density. This influence has major consequences regarding the methodology of tensiometer measurements to represent an agricultural field, and might provide means for global guidelines for tensiometer placement and irrigation management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aclay 3acrops 3adecision making 3aemitters (equipment) 3ageotextiles 3aguidelines 3airrigation management 3amicroirrigation 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asand 3asandy loam soils 3aseeds 3asoil hydraulic properties 3atensiometers 3atillage 3awater distribution 3awater uptake 0aDrip irrigation 0aTensiometer 0aRoot water uptake 0aCoefficient of variation1 aShani, Uri1 aLazarovitch, Naftali0 tSoil & tillage research.g2016 Jan., v. 155 p.216-224dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2015.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245015700211500001900368520190200387592002802289650001102317650001302328650002002341650002002361650001702381650001802398650001502416650001602431650002602447650001702473653001102490653002002501653001002521653001402531653000902545653001002554653000802564653000802572653000802580700002502588700003802613700001902651700002202670700002602692773012602718856008502844852000902929655001202938IND60736725120221122141624.0210615e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073672512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2021.1102662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Sandra D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8807-555414aThe effect of lower airway inflammation on inflammatory cytokine gene expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and whole blood in racing Thoroughbreds  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImmunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of mild to moderate equine asthma (MEA) are not completely understood. There are limited data on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood inflammatory cytokine profiles in racehorses with MEA, and the effect of racing on inflammatory cytokines is unknown.We hypothesized that inflammatory cytokine gene expression in BALF and resting blood would be higher in racehorses with lower airway inflammation compared to healthy controls, and that gene expression in blood collected immediately post-race would be increased compared to resting blood in racehorses with lower airway inflammation.38 racing Thoroughbreds (samples: 30 resting blood, 22 post-race BALF, 41 post-race blood).Prospective observational study. Inflammatory cytokine gene expression was determined in resting blood, post-race BALF and post-race blood from racehorses with lower airway inflammation and controls.Lower airway inflammation was diagnosed in 79 % of racehorses (23 % neutrophilic, 67 % mastocytic, and 10 % mixed). There was no difference in gene expression in BALF or resting blood between racehorses with lower airway inflammation and controls. IL-8 gene expression was higher in post-race blood compared to resting peripheral blood, regardless of disease (p = 0052). BALF neutrophil proportions increased with increasing IL-1β gene expression in all sample types (p = 0.0025). BALF mast cell proportions increased with increasing TNF-α gene expression in post-race blood (p = 0.015).Lower airway inflammation was common in a population of racehorses without respiratory signs or exercise intolerance. Exercise alone increased peripheral blood IL-8 gene expression. Inflammatory cytokine gene expression was not increased in BALF or resting blood in horses with subclinical lower airway inflammation, precluding its diagnostic utility in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3aexercise 3agene expression 3aimmunopathology 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3amast cells 3aneutrophils 3aobservational studies 3apathogenesis 0aAirway 0aBronchoalveolar 0aHorse 0aRacehorse 0aBALF 0aB-GUS 0aMEA 0aSEA 0aWBC1 aIvester, Kathleen M.1 aStewart, C.

The experimental results revealed that more than 70% of the coloured impurity was removed in final products by macroporous resin DM-130 after 24h contact. Temperature had significant influence on adsorption. The adsorption process and the thermodynamic data indicated that the process was possibly exothermic and spontaneous. The optimum ratio of resin mass/oligosaccharides solution was approximately 0.13g/ml. The adsorption isotherm agreed with Freundlich model, indicating that the adsorption process was monolayer and heterogeneous. Adsorption kinetics fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model.

It explores the behavior of such systems under the action of one or two effectors. More specifically and for the sake of proof of principle, it makes use of DCLs involving dynamic organic ligands and analyzes their single and double adaptive response under the action of one and two metal cation effectors. Thus, interconversions within [2×3] DCLs of six constituents (hydrazone, acylhydrazone, and imine ligands) give access to the generation of [2×3] CDNs of 3D trigonal prismatic type consisting of three [2×2] sub-networks and presenting specific responses to the application of Cu⁺ and Zn²⁺ metal cation effectors, in particular double agonistic amplification. More complex [3×3] CDNs based on nine ligand constituents of imine, hydrazone, and acylhydrazone types were also designed and subjected to the application of one or two effectors, e.g., Cu⁺ and Fe²⁺ metal cations, revealing novel types of adaptive behavior: (i) agonistic amplification between a single constituent and a full [2×2] sub-network, and (ii) agonistic amplification along a single diagonal connecting three constituents. Of special interest is also the dependence of the response of the system to hierarchical sequence of effector application, whereby initial interaction with Cu⁺ ions results in the destruction of the network, whereas the sequence Fe²⁺ followed by Cu⁺ yields a clean three-constituent DCL. Finally and strikingly, the present results also demonstrate that the increase in complexity of the system by introduction of an additional entity leads to a simpler output through dynamic competition between components.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3airon 3aligands 3azinc1 aLehn, J.-M.q(Jean-Marie),0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 139, no. 6 p.2474-2483dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b130723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245009900159300002000258520135200278592002801630650001701658650002101675650001901696650000901715650001201724650001401736650000701750650001301757650001401770650001101784650001101795650002001806653002401826653001601850653001801866653000901884653000901893653001601902653001901918700001901937700002001956700001801976700001801994700001702012700002602029773013002055856007802185852000902263655001202272IND60550883720221119163600.0161011e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055088372DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b065232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSen, Sujat10aIn Situ Measurement of Voltage-Induced Stress in Conducting Polymers with Redox-Active Dopants  ap. 24168-24176.  aMinimization of stress-induced mechanical rupture and delamination of conducting polymer (CP) films is desirable to prevent failure of devices based on these materials. Thus, precise in situ measurement of voltage-induced stress within these films should provide insight into the cause of these failure mechanisms. The evolution of stress in films of polypyrrole (pPy), doped with indigo carmine (IC), was measured in different electrochemical environments using the multibeam optical stress sensor (MOSS) technique. The stress in these films gradually increases to a constant value during voltage cycling, revealing an initial break-in period for CP films. The nature of the ions involved in charge compensation of pPy[IC] during voltage cycling was determined from electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) data. The magnitude of the voltage-induced stress within pPy[IC] at neutral pH correlated with the radius of the hydrated mobile ion in the order Li⁺ > Na⁺ > K⁺. At acidic pH, the IC dopant in pPy[IC] undergoes reversible oxidation and reduction within the range of potentials investigated, providing a secondary contribution to the observed voltage-induced stress. We report on the novel stress response of these polymers due to the presence of pH-dependent redox-active dopants and how it can affect material performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adelamination 3aelectrochemistry 3aindigo carmine 3aions 3alithium 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolymers 3apotassium 3aquartz 3asodium 3astress response 0aconducting polymers 0afilm stress 0aion transport 0aMOSS 0aEQCM 0apolypyrrole 0aindigo carmine1 aKim, Sung Yeol1 aPalmore, Lia R.1 aJin, Shenghua1 aJadhav, Nitin1 aChason, Eric1 aPalmore, G.

The present work analyzes data from 22 bottom trawls, carried out in parallel by two commercial trawlers between 70 and 90 m depth on maërl beds off eastern Menorca (Balearic Islands). One vessel used an experimental trawl gear (EXP) equipped with a lighter and smaller groundrope in the mouth of the net, leaving a gap without net between the main groundrope and the secondary one. The other vessel used a trawl gear traditionally used by the fleet operating in the area (TRA), without that modification. Catches, discards and commercial yields between both gears were compared. Discarded biomass of non-commercial benthic species with EXP was reduced by half when compared to TRA, particularly for rhodoliths (54%) and ascidians (51%). The reduction of discarded rhodoliths is especially relevant in the Balearic Islands where sensitive habitats, such as maërl beds, are an important part of the benthic communities. The modification of the net, at the same time, does not imply a reduction of yields of commercial captures and can easily be implemented in any bottom trawl net. It is concluded that this could be an appropriate and plausible technical measure to improve the ecological efficiency and the sustainability of the Mediterranean bottom trawl fishery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscidiacea 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3acontinental shelf 3afisheries 3amouth 3aresearch 3atrawl nets 0aBottom trawl impact 0aSelectivity 0aDiscards 0aRhodoliths 0aWestern Mediterranean1 aOrdines, Francesc1 aMassutí, Enric0 tFisheries research.g2021 Sept., v. 241 p.105985-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1059853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010500173300001800278520109900296592002801395650001701423650001501440650001501455650002201470650001401492650002501506650001401531650001101545700002301556700002601579700002001605700001601625700002101641700002501662773010401687856008201791852000901873655001201882IND60091498020221116215947.0141103e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009149802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaslett, Nicholas D.10aCharacterisation of yeast microbial fuel cell with the yeast Arxula adeninivorans as the biocatalyst  ap. 3742-3747.  aYeast microbial fuel cells have received little attention to date. Yeast should be ideal MFC catalyst because they are robust, easily handled, mostly non-pathogenic organisms with high catabolic rates and in some cases a broad substrate spectrum. Here we show that the non-conventional yeast Arxula adeninvorans transfers electrons to an electrode through the secretion of a reduced molecule that is not detectable when washed cells are first resuspended but which accumulates rapidly in the extracellular environment. It is a single molecule that accumulates to a significant concentration. The occurrence of mediatorless electron transfer was first established in a conventional microbial fuel cell and that phenomenon was further investigated by a number of techniques. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) on a yeast pellet shows a single peak at 450mV, a scan rate study showed that the peak was due to a solution species. CVs of the supernatant confirmed a solution species. It appears that, given its other attributes, A. adeninivorans is a good candidate for further investigation as a MFC catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3abiosensors 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3amicrobial fuel cells 3asecretion 3ayeasts1 aRawson, Frankie J.1 aBarriëre, Frèdèric1 aKunze, Gotthard1 aPasco, Neil1 aGooneratne, Ravi1 aBaronian, Keith H.R.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 May 15, v. 26, no. 9 p.3742-3747dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245015500207300001800362520117300380592002801553650001501581650001301596650001001609650001301619650002401632650001201656650003701668650001301705650003201718650001701750650000901767650001501776700001501791700001801806700001501824700005401839700001401893700001301907700001601920700005301936773012801989856008402117852000902201655001202210IND60637188720221119105745.0190416e20190328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063718872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b054192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Jingbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6179-886710aControllable Transformation of Aligned ZnO Nanorods to ZIF-8 as Solid-Phase Microextraction Coatings with Tunable Porosity, Polarity, and Conductivity  ap. 5091-5097.  aWhile a growing number of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coatings have been developed, a generalized protocol is still needed to tailor-make SPME coatings with desirable properties for efficient extraction of diverse analytes from sample matrixes. In this work, we developed a versatile approach to prepare SPME coatings with tunable properties by controllable in situ transformation of well-aligned ZNRs into zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) via reaction with 2-methylimidazole (2-MI). During this process, ZNRs supplied Zn²⁺ and served as a “hard template” for the in situ growth of well-aligned ZIF-8 with enhanced surface area for adsorption. Because ZNRs and ZIF-8 exhibit markedly different properties, we obtained a series of ZNRs/ZIF-8 hybrid composites, whose morphology, porosity, polarity, and charge transfer resistance can be fine-tuned by simply controlling the concentration of 2-MI. Preparing ZNRs/ZIF-8 SPME coatings with desired properties enabled effective extraction of a wide range of polar and nonpolar compounds including aliphatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, phenols, anilines, and ionic drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoatings 3adrugs 3ananorods 3anon-polar compounds 3aphenols 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aporosity 3asolid phase microextraction 3asurface area 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aLi, Yulong1 aZheng, Xiaofu1 aLi, Zizhou1 aZeng, Teng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0374-95491 aDuan, Wei1 aLi, Qing1 aShang, Xiao1 aDong, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4817-62890 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Mar. 28, v. 91, no. 8 p.5091-5097dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b054193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007200168300001800240520126100258592002801519650001501547650001601562650002101578650002101599650002001620650001101640650002401651650001701675700002201692700002001714700002501734773010401759856008201863852000901945655001201954IND60091498120221116215831.0141103e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009149812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrara, Sandro10aMulti-panel drugs detection in human serum for personalized therapy  ap. 3914-3919.  aThis work focuses on P450 biosensors based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and different cytochrome isoforms: 3A4, 2B4, 2C9. The proposed biosensors exhibit enhanced sensitivities and decreased detection limits thanks to carbon nanotubes. The MWCNT structuring improves the sensitivity from 5.1 to 20.5nA/mMmm² in case of CYP2B4-mediated Benzphetamine detection, from 0.26 to 0.63nA/μMmm² in case of CYP3A4-mediated Cyclophosphamide detection, and from 0.11 to 0.25nA/μMmm² in case of CYP2C9-mediated Naproxen detection. By using MWCNT, the limit of detection was enhanced from 59 to 12μM in case of Cyclophosphamide and from to 187 to 82μM in case of Naproxen. This makes possible the drug detection in human serum within the pharmacological range. In the paper, a new mathematical model is also proposed to succeed in discriminating different drug contributions in a mixture containing both Cyclophosphamide and Dextromethorphan or combining Naproxen and Flurbiprofen. Data analysis shows variations in reduction peaks that are dependent on the drug ratio, and that are consistent with competitive kinetics of substrates. This new approach enables multiple drug detection and opens the way to possible applications in personalized therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acarbon nanotubes 3acyclophosphamide 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3amathematical models 3atherapeutics1 aCavallini, Andrea1 aErokhin, Victor1 aDe Micheli, Giovanni0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 May 15, v. 26, no. 9 p.3914-3919dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245007300169300001600242520147600258592002801734650001601762650001401778650001601792650002101808650001701829650001301846650002001859650000901879650000901888700002101897773013101918856007802049852000902127655001202136IND60792025420221120093119.0220904e20220829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079202542DNAL7 a10.17221/215/2022-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKołodziejczyk, Marek10aEffect of plant growth regulators on potato tuber yield and quality  ap. 375-381.  aThe aim of the study conducted in 2019–2021 was to determine the effect of biostimulants and growth regulators on the yield size and structure, as well as the chemical composition of edible potato tubers. The cultivar evaluated was Vineta. Asahi SL, Kelpak SL, Aminoplant, Tytanit, gibberellic acid (GA3) and Moddus 250 EC were applied in potato cultivation. The application of biostimulants Asahi SL and Tytanit increased the total and marketable tuber yield, as well as the average tuber weight. Aminoplant had a beneficial effect only on the marketable yield, while Moddus 250 EC decreased tuber yield and mean tuber weight, especially under conditions of high rainfall. Biostimulant Asahi SL caused a decrease in the number of tubers formed, while gibberellic acid stimulated tuberisation. Both preparations increased the share of deformed tubers in the total yield. The effect of biostimulants and growth regulators on the formation of the chemical composition of potato tubers was multidirectional. Tytanit increased protein content in tubers, while the remaining preparations, with the exception of the growth regulator Moddus 250 EC, decreased the amount of this component. GA3 and Moddus 250 EC decreased the content of crude fibre and, in the case of Moddus 250 EC, also the content of mineral components. The highest concentration of nitrates (V) was characteristic for potato tubers treated with Asahi SL and the lowest for those treated with Moddus 250 EC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrude fiber 3acultivars 3aenvironment 3agibberellic acid 3aplant growth 3apotatoes 3aprotein content 3arain 3asoil1 aGwóźdź, Kamil0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 68, no. 8 p.375-381dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/215/2022-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006800170300001800238520121100256592002801467650002501495650003601520650002201556650001901578653004201597653002601639653001901665653002701684700002401711773011501735856008601850852000901936655001201945IND60531599920221119033047.0180831e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053159992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalkos, George10aNational CSR and institutional conditions: An exploratory study  ap. 1150-1156.  aCorporate social responsibility (CSR) footprints in terms of relevant policies, plans and programs are evident at a global scale, but the level of national uptake and penetration differs, as countries differ considerably in terms of institutional efficiency. With this in mind, the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between CSR penetration and institutional conditions that shape and define the macroeconomic environment and development dynamics of countries. Building on Campbell's seminal propositions on institutional parameters that facilitate effective CSR management, the study's results lend partial support to his conceptual framework as it was operationalized in our assessment. Civic engagement, regulatory effectiveness and competitive conditions appear to be very significant factors influencing CSR penetration with macroeconomic conditions and industrial self-regulation to play a less significant role on national CSR penetration. These findings provide fertile ground to theorists and researchers for a deeper investigation of the impact of institutional arrangements that define the national specificity of CSR and act as moderators of responsible business behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acorporate social responsibility 3aissues and policy 3amacroeconomics 0aCorporate social responsibility (CSR) 0aNational institutions 0aNational index 0aCross-country analysis1 aSkouloudis, Antonis0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 139 p.1150-1156dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245011200174300001600286520122000302592002801522650002301550650001001573650001501583650001601598650001101614650001601625650001301641650000801654650001501662650002201677650001801699773009901717856005701816852000901873655001201882IND4477053820221122043639.0120907e197004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447705382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1970.tb02440.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHIMSHI, DANIEL13aTheeffect of nitrogen supply on some indices of plantâwater relations of beans (phaseolus vulgaris l.)  ap. 413-424.  aThe effect of nitrogen supply on some indices of plantâwater relations was studied on potted bean plants. When soil moisture was relatively high, the leaves of Nâdeficient plants transpired less than those of Nâsupplied plants, the transpiration rate being closely associated with the chlorophyll content of the leaves of various ages. In detached leaves which were saturated by floating over distilled water, stomatal width was markedly wider in Nâsupplied than in Nâdeficient plants. Throughout the available moisture range, the water saturation deficit was higher in Nâsupplied leaves. In the dry range of soil moisture, chlorotic leaves transpired more than normal green leaves; Nâdeficient plants failed to exhibit a sharp rise in the content of soluble metabolites in the sap, when approaching the wilting range. The content of âcell wall materialsâ was higher in Nâdeficient plants. The relationships between these indices is discussed; it is tentatively concluded that nitrogen deficiency impairs the ability of the plants to adjust their water status to changes in soil moisture by regulation of stomatal transpiration and of sapâsolute concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3acell walls 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3asap 3asoil water 3astomatal movement 3atranspiration0 tnew phytologist.g1970 Apr., v. 69, no. 2 p.413-424dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1970.tb02440.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015700167300001400324520154400338592002801882650001401910650001601924650002201940650001201962650001501974650001101989650001102000650000902011650002502020650001302045650001702058650001402075650001902089650001802108653001302126653001702139653001402156653003002170653002402200700001902224773010902243856008502352852000902437655001202446IND60527055820221121042724.0190411e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052705582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2016.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeter, Brian10aEstimates of residual fibre supply and the impacts of new bioenergy capacity from a forest sector transportation model of the Canadian Prairie Provinces  ap. 62-72.  aIncreasing interest in making use of forest sector processing residuals for renewable energy production has led to the need for careful analyses of fibre supply, and the ways in which existing forest sector firms could be affected by new sources of fibre demand. In this paper we present a forest sector transportation model of the three Canadian Prairie Provinces, and use the model to estimate residual fibre production, utilization and surpluses, as well as some potential forest sector impacts from bioenergy capacity additions. Under our base-case assumptions and using 2010 product prices, we estimate that 6.9 million cubic meters (round-wood equivalent) of processing residuals would be traded over the course of a year, with sawmills being the most significant source and pulp and paper mills being the most significant user. Approximately 33% of residuals would be used to produce bioenergy-related products (wood pellets, electricity sold to the grid, or internal electricity and power at pulp mills). Results show that some surpluses of processing residuals may be present in the existing supply chain, though the availability of these residuals is sensitive to lumber prices. At the same time, new bioenergy capacity itself may trigger higher sawmill output, making additional fibre available for both new and existing users. Roadside harvesting residuals are not an economically viable source of fibre under our base-case assumptions; however, their viability is sensitive to roadside processing costs and electricity prices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aforests 3aharvesting 3amodels 3aprices 3apulp 3apulp and paper mills 3asawmills 3asupply chain 3asurpluses 3atransportation 3awood products 0aForestry 0aWood biomass 0aBioenergy 0aSupply chain optimization 0aForest sector model1 aNiquidet, Kurt0 tForest policy and economics.g2016 Aug., v. 69 p.62-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2016.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014800166300001600314520211600330592002802446650001902474650001502493650002802508650002302536650003102559650002102590650000902611650002002620650000902640650002002649650001502669650001202684650002502696650001702721650001102738650001002749700001502759700001602774700001402790773010102804856008502905852000902990655001202999IND60478768320221119204219.0160114e20151102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047876832DNAL7 a10.1080/00071668.2015.10963232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedghi, M.10aOptimisation of broiler chicken responses from 0 to 7 d of age to dietary leucine, isoleucine and valine using Taguchi and mathematical methods  ap. 696-707.  aThree experiments were conducted to evaluate the applicability of the Taguchi method (TM) and optimisation algorithms to optimise the branch chain amino acids (BCAA) requirements in 0 to 7 d broiler chicks. In the first experiment, the standardised digestible (SID) amino acids and apparent metabolisable energy (AME) values of maize, wheat and soya bean meal were evaluated. In the second experiment, three factors including leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile) and valine (Val), each at 4 levels, were selected, and an orthogonal array layout of L16 (4 ³) using TM was performed. After data collection, optimisation of average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were obtained using TM. The multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and random search algorithm (RSA) were also applied to predict the optimal combination of BCAA for broiler performance. In the third experiment, a growth study was conducted to evaluate the applicability of obtained optimum BCAA requirements data by TM, MOGA and RSA, and results were compared with those of birds fed with a diet formulated according to Ross 308 recommendations. In the second experiment, the TM resulted in 13.45 g/kg SID Leu, 8.5 g/kg SID Ile and 10.45 g/kg SID Val as optimum level for maximum ADG (21.57 g/bird/d) and minimum FCR (1.11 g feed/g gain) in 0- to 7-d-old broiler chickens. MOGA predicted the following combinations: SID Leu = 14.8, SID Ile = 9.1 and SID Val = 10.3 for maximum ADG (22.05) and minimum FCR (1.11). The optimisation using RSA predicted Leu = 16.0, Ile = 9.5 and Val = 10.2 for maximum ADG (22.67), and Leu = 15.5, Ile = 9.0 and Val = 10.4 to achieve minimum FCR (1.08). The validation experiment confirmed that TM, MOGA and RSA yielded optimum determination of dietary amino acid requirements and improved ADG and FCR as compared to Aviagen recommendations. However, based on the live animal validation trial, MOGA and RSA overpredicted the optimum requirement as compared to TM. In general, the results of these studies showed that the TM may be used to optimise nutrient requirements for poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaguchi method 3aalgorithms 3aamino acid requirements 3aaverage daily gain 3abranched chain amino acids 3abroiler chickens 3acorn 3adata collection 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3ametabolizable energy 3asoybean meal 3avaline 3awheat1 aGolian, A.1 aKolahan, F.1 aAfsar, A.0 tBritish poultry science.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 56, no. 6 p.696-707dTaylor & Francisx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2015.10963233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03676naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002200184245011900206300001800325506007600343520169000419592002802109506003702137650002102174650001802195650002102213650001102234650002202245650001102267650002502278650002902303650002602332650001802358650003302376650003702409650004102446650003602487650001102523650002402534650003902558650002802597650003002625650003602655650003802691700001802729700002002747700002502767700002102792700002202813700002202835773017402857856004603031852000903077655001203086IND4481203320221207092125.0120502e20120424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448120332DNAL7 a224932452pmid7 aPMC33400512pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.11187101092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLodeiro, Maria F.10aTranscription from the second heavy-strand promoter of human mtDNA is repressed by transcription factor A in vitro  ap. 6513-6518.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCell-based studies support the existence of two promoters on the heavy strand of mtDNA: heavy-strand promoter 1 (HSP1) and HSP2. However, transcription from HSP2 has been reported only once in a cell-free system, and never when recombinant proteins have been used. Here, we document transcription from HSP2 using an in vitro system of defined composition. An oligonucleotide template representing positions 596–685 of mtDNA was sufficient to observe transcription by the human mtRNA polymerase (POLRMT) that was absolutely dependent on mitochondrial transcription factor B2 (TFB2M). POLRMT/TFB2M-dependent transcription was inhibited by concentrations of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) stoichiometric with the transcription template, a condition that activates transcription from the light-strand promoter (LSP) in vitro. Domains of TFAM required for LSP activation were also required for HSP2 repression, whereas other mtDNA binding proteins failed to alter transcriptional output. Binding sites for TFAM were located on both sides of the start site of transcription from HSP2, suggesting that TFAM binding interferes with POLRMT and/or TFB2M binding. Consistent with a competitive binding model for TFAM repression of HSP2, the impact of TFAM concentration on HSP2 transcription was diminished by elevating the POLRMT and TFB2M concentrations. In the context of our previous studies of LSP and HSP1, it is now clear that three promoters exist in human mtDNA. Each promoter has a unique requirement for and/or response to the level of TFAM present, thus implying far greater complexity in the regulation of mammalian mitochondrial transcription than recognized to date.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding proteins 3abinding sites 3acell free system 3ahumans 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3arecombinant proteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism1 aUchida, Akira1 aBestwick, Megan1 aMoustafa, Ibrahim M.1 aArnold, Jamie J.1 aShadel, Gerald S.1 aCameron, Craig E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Apr. 24, v. 109, no. 17 p.6513-6518dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1118710109  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245008400158300001600242500002000258520058300278592002800861650002300889650002700912650001900939650002300958650001600981650001200997773014301009856007101152852000901223655001201232IND60680347120221119140750.0200105e198808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068034712DNAL7 a10.2307/12415102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoran, Howard E.10aSpecification Tests for the Partial Adjustment and Adaptive Expectations Models  ap. 713-723.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe partial adjustment and adaptive expectations hypotheses give rise to simple dynamic models with a long history in empirical research.

Protection of the chicken male reproductive organs from pathogens is therefore an essential aspect of reproductive physiology. Recently Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been identified as one of the key components of innate immunity in vertebrate species and have been reported to be expressed in the reproductive organs in various female species, including the chicken. However, mechanisms of antimicrobial protection of male reproductive organs mediated by TLRs are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to determine the expression profile of the entire family of the ten chicken TLR genes in the chicken testis, to investigate whether sexual maturation affects their testicular mRNA abundance and to determine the changes in their expression levels in response to Salmonella enteritidis (SE) infection. RNA was extracted from the testis of healthy pre-pubertal, sexually mature and aged birds, and from sexually mature SE infected birds. RT-PCR analysis revealed that all TLRs, apart from TLR1-1 (TLR6), were expressed in the chicken testis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the testicular mRNA abundance of certain TLRs was developmentally regulated with respect to sexual maturation, while SE infection resulted in a significant induction of TLR2-1, 4, 5, 15 and 21 in the testis of sexually mature birds compared, to healthy birds of the same age. These findings provide strong evidence to suggest a key role of TLRs in the innate immune responses of chicken testis against Salmonella colonization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atestes 3amessenger RNA 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aphysiology 3aroosters 3amicroorganisms 3agenes 3aimmune response 3areceptors 3apoultry industry 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aTheodoridis, A.1 aAvdi, M.1 aMichailidis, G.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2011 Oct., v. 128, no. 1-4 p.93-99dElsevier B.V.x0378-43207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2011.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002500174245008900199300001800288520147400306592002801780650001401808650001101822650001701833650000901850650001201859650000901871650002301880650001001903650002301913650003001936650001101966650001401977650001501991650001202006650002902018650001102047650002702058650002102085650000902106650004202115650001602157650004302173651001402216651003902230653001102269653003002280653002602310653002302336653002002359700002602379700002402405700002402429773007802453856008902531852000902620655001202629IND60112244720221121161152.0160901e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011224472DNAL7 a240016712pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStapanian, Martin A.10aSexual difference in PCB congener distributions of burbot (Lota lota) from Lake Erie  ap. 1615-1623.  aConcentrations of 86 congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined for 25 adult female and 25 adult male burbot (Lota lota) from Lake Erie. Significant differences in mean proportions of total PCB concentration between males and females ages 14–17 were found for 26 congeners. Males generally had higher mean proportions of hexachloro congeners, whereas females had higher mean proportions of more highly chlorinated congeners. In contrast, only four congeners exhibited differences between males and females ages 6–13 in mean proportions of total PCB. Therefore, the sexual difference in PCB congener distribution widened for older burbot. Males ages 14–17 also had higher proportions of certain hexachloro congeners than the other three demographic groups (males ages 6–13, females ages 6–13, and females ages 14–17) we examined. The reverse was true for more highly chlorinated congeners. The results supported a previous hypothesis that older male burbot spent a substantial amount of time feeding in the vicinity of mouths of rivers with sediment contaminated with PCBs. However, additional studies are needed to clarify and corroborate this apparent “hot spot” effect, such as seasonal movements, spatial distributions, and diet of burbot; and PCB congener distributions of various species of prey fishes captured at various locations throughout the eastern basin of Lake Erie and at different locations in the contaminated rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLota lota 3aadults 3achlorination 3adiet 3afemales 3afish 3agender differences 3amales 3amigratory behavior 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arivers 3asediments 3awatersheds 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFemale 2aGadiformesxmetabolism 2aLakesxchemistry 2aMale 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxmetabolism 2aSex Factors 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 3aLake Erie 0aGreat Lakes Region (North America) 0aBurbot 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls 0aCongener distribution 0aSexual differences 0aAge differences1 aMadenjian, Charles P.1 aRediske, Richard R.1 aO’Keefe, James P.0 tChemosphere.g2013 Nov., v. 93 p.1615-1623dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245011100195300001600306520118900322592002801511650001801539650001901557650001801576650000801594650002101602650001901623650001901642650001901661650002401680650001301704650001101717650001001728650001301738650001601751650002601767650001801793650001101811650006501822650006601887650001701953650003001970650002102000650004002021650004102061650004102102650002702143650001602170650003602186650002802222650003002250650001402280650002802294650002902322650003402351650002702385650003602412650001702448700002202465700002902487700002502516700002602541700002902567773014302596852000902739856008202748655001202830IND4426221920221119093722.0200312e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442622192DNAL7 a195513782pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-009-2071-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardinali-Rezende, Juliana10aMolecular identification and dynamics of microbial communities in reactor treating organic household waste  ap. 777-789.  aThe prokaryotic diversity associated with organic household waste (OHW), leachate (start-up inoculum), and mesophilic anaerobic digestion processes in the degradation of OHW for 44 and 90 days was investigated using a culture-independent approach.

Bacterial clones were affiliated with 13 phyla, of which Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were represented in all libraries, whereas Actinobacteria, Thermotogae, Lentisphaerae, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Synergistetes, Spirochaetes, Deferribacteres, and Deinococcus-Thermus were exclusively identified in a single library. Within the Archaea domain, the Euryarchaeota phylum was the only one represented. Corresponding sequences were associated with the following orders of hydrogenotrophic methanogens: Methanomicrobiales (Methanoculleus genus) and Methanobacteriales (Methanosphaera and Methanobacterium genera). One archaeal clone was not affiliated with any order and may represent a novel taxon.

The biosorption characteristics of dicloxacillin were investigated in terms of equilibrium, kinetics and thermodynamics. Optimum biosorption conditions were determined from pH, initial dicloxacillin concentration, biomass dosage, contact time, and temperature. The maximum adsorption capacity was 86.93 % (pH 6.0, 0.1 g/L biomass, dicloxacillin concentration 20 mg/L, contact time 24 h, temperature 283.15 K). The thermodynamic parameters (298.15 K), free energy change, enthalpy change and entropy change were -3475.79 J/mol, −25.36 kJ/mol, and −73.40 J/mol/K, respectively. The best interpretation for the experimental data was given by the Langmuir isotherm with correlation coefficient of 0.965. The results were found to tie in well with pseudo-second-order kinetics. Considering the cost-effectiveness, Indian almond leaf biomass is considered to be suitable to remove dicloxacillin from pharmaceutical waste water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aTerminalia catappa 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3abiosorption 3abiotechnology 3acost effectiveness 3adicloxacillin 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aleaves 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastewater 3aThailand 0aIsotherms 0aPseudo-second-order kinetics1 aRamakul, Prakorn1 aPhatanasri, Suphot1 aPancharoen, Ura0 tBiotechnology reports.g2020 Sept., v. 27 p.e00488-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23403x2215-017X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2020.e004883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013100167500001900298520107800317592002801395650001401423650001601437650001801453650001501471650001301486650001601499653001901515653002101534653002501555653002101580653004301601700002201644700002501666700001701691773010301708856008301811852000901894655001201903IND60698648120221123030737.0201024e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069864812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.btre.2020.e004872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Jaspreet10aValorisation of crude glycerol to value-added products: Perspectives of process technology, economics and environmental issues  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe enormous production of glycerol, a waste stream from biodiesel industries, as a low-value product has been causing a threat to both the environment and the economy. Therefore, it needs to be transformed effectively and efficiently into valued products for contributing positively towards the biodiesel economy. It can either be converted directly into competent chemicals or can be used as a feedstock/precursor for deriving valuable derivatives. In this review article, a technical evaluation has been stirred up, various factors and technologies used for producing value-added products from crude glycerol, Environmental and economic aspects of different conversion routes, cost factors and challenges of integration of the different routes for biorefinery have been reviewed and elaborated. There are tremendous environmental benefits in the conversion of crude glycerol via the biochemical route, the product and residue become eco-friendly. However, chemical conversions are faster processes, and economically viable if environmental aspects are partially ignored.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3abiorefining 3abiotechnology 3afeedstocks 3aglycerol 3avalue added 0aCrude glycerol 0aConversion route 0aValue-added products 0aEconomic aspects 0aEnvironmental benefits and limitations1 aSarma, Anil Kumar1 aJha, Mithilesh Kumar1 aGera, Poonam0 tBiotechnology reports.g2020 Sept., v. 27 p.e00487-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23403x2215-017X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2020.e004873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245010800179520111400287592002801401650002301429650001601452650001901468650001701487650001401504650001201518650001801530650002101548650001401569650002401583650001501607650001301622650001201635653002501647653002801672653001501700653002201715653001201737653002501749700001901774700002001793700002001813700002201833700002301855700002101878700001901899773010001918856008702018852000902105655001202114IND60722118820221123010306.0220606e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072211882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1289502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeb-Choudhury, Santanu14aThe effects of blanching on composition and modification of proteins in navy beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)  aBlanching is an important process in the preparation of navy beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) for canning. We here explore the effect of blanching which can profoundly affect protein composition and introduce protein-primary-level modifications. Amino acid analysis showed significantly decreased protein abundance (58.5%) in blanched beans compared to raw beans. Proteomic analyses revealed a decrease in high molecular weight isoforms of the major storage globulin proteins phaseolin (mean fold-change −3.7) and legumin (mean fold-change −2.5) and concomitant increase in their low molecular weight isoforms (mean fold-change 6.4 and 8.3, respectively). Blanched beans also had decreased abundance of lipoxygenase (mean fold-change −13.1), an enzyme responsible for product spoilage during storage. Increased lysinoalanine (up to 47%) and highly modified protein fragments were found in the processing waters, indicating heat- induced modifications. Correlating these molecular level changes thus provides a basis for evaluating how processing parameters can be modified to increase protein food quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aamino acids 3afood chemistry 3afood quality 3aglobulins 3alegumin 3alipoxygenases 3amolecular weight 3aphaseolin 3aprotein composition 3aproteomics 3aspoilage 3astorage 0aPhaseolus vulgaris L 0aHydrothermal processing 0aProteomics 0aMass-spectrometry 0a2D-DIGE 0aProtein modification1 aCooney, Janine1 aBrewster, Diane1 aClerens, Stefan1 aKnowles, Scott O.1 aFarouk, Mustafa M.1 aGrosvenor, Anita1 aDyer, Jolon M.0 tFood chemistry.g2021 June 01, v. 346 p.128950-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1289503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245011500158300001800273520083300291592002801124650002401152650001401176650002301190650002001213650001301233650001601246650002001262650002701282700001701309700002101326700001701347700002301364700001901387700001501406700002301421700001801444773013101462856007801593852000901671655001201680IND60563340020221117021136.0170215e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056334002DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b002532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Shota10aHybrid Catalysis Enabling Room-Temperature Hydrogen Gas Release from N-Heterocycles and Tetrahydronaphthalenes  ap. 2204-2207.  aHybrid catalyst systems to achieve acceptorless dehydrogenation of N-heterocycles and tetrahydronaphthalenesmodel substrates for liquid organic hydrogen carrierswere developed.

The combined use of two or three different catalyst types was essential for the catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3ahydrogen 3airradiation 3aredox reactions 3atetrahydronaphthalenes1 aSaga, Yutaka1 aKojima, Masahiro1 aFuse, Hiromu1 aMatsunaga, Shigeki1 aFukatsu, Arisa1 aKondo, Mio1 aMasaoka, Shigeyuki1 aKanai, Motomu0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 139, no. 6 p.2204-2207dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b002533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04261naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245011500181300001800296520274700314592002803061650002703089650001503116650001503131650001503146650001603161650001703177650001303194650002203207650002403229650001703253650001203270650002603282650001903308650002803327650001503355650002003370650001503390700001803405700001903423700006703442700006103509773012803570856008403698852000903782655001203791IND60637189320190516000000.0190416e20190305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063718932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b056892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCedillo-Alcantar, Diana F.10aAutomated Droplet-Based Microfluidic Platform for Multiplexed Analysis of Biochemical Markers in Small Volumes  ap. 5133-5141.  aThe ability to detect multiple analytes in a small sample volume has significance for numerous areas of research, including organs-on-chip, small animal experiments, and neonatology. The objective of this study was to develop an automated microfluidics platform for multiplexed detection of analytes in microliter sample volumes. This platform employed computer-controlled microvalves to create laminar co-flows of sample and assay reagent solutions. It also contained valve-regulated cross-junction for discretizing sample/reagent mixtures into water-in-oil droplets. Microfluidic automation allowed us to control parameters related to frequency of droplet generation and the number of droplets of the same composition, as well as the size of droplets. Each droplet represented an individual enzymatic assay carried out in a sub-nanoliter (0.8 nL) volume reactor. An enzymatic reaction involving target analyte and assay reagents produced colorimetric or fluorescent signals in droplets. Importantly, intensity of optical signal was proportional to the concentration of analyte in question. This microfluidic bioanalysis platform was used in conjunction with commercial “mix–detect” assays for glucose, total bile acids, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). After characterizing these assays individually, we demonstrated sensitive multiplexed detection of three analytes from as little as 3 μL. In fact, this volume was sufficient to generate multiple repeat droplets for each of the three biochemical assays as well as positive control droplets, confirming the quality of assay reagents and negative control droplets to help with background subtraction. One potential application for this microfluidic bioanalysis platform involves sampling cell-conditioned media in organ-on-chip devices. To highlight this application, hepatocyte spheroids were established in microfluidic devices, injured on-chip by exposure to lipotoxic agent (palmitate), and then connected to the bioanalysis module for daily monitoring of changes in cytotoxicity (LDH), energy metabolism (glucose), and liver function (total bile acids). Microfluidic in-droplet assays revealed increased levels of LDH as well as reduction in bile acid synthesis—results that were consistent with hepatic injury. Importantly, these experiments highlighted the fact that in-droplet assays were sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in functional output of a relatively small (∼100) number of hepatocyte spheroids cultured in a microfluidic device. Moving forward, we foresee increasing the multiplexing capability of this technology and applying this platform to other biological/medical scenarios where detection of multiple analytes from a small sample volume is desired.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal experimentation 3aautomation 3abile acids 3abiomarkers 3acolorimetry 3acytotoxicity 3adroplets 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzymatic reactions 3afluorescence 3aglucose 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aliver function 3amicrofluidic technology 3amonitoring 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3apalmitates1 aHan, Yong Duk1 aChoi, Jonghoon1 aGarcia-Cordero, Jose L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3868-74051 aRevzin, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8737-32500 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Mar. 05, v. 91, no. 8 p.5133-5141dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b056893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245013000163300001800293520108300311592002801394650001001422650001301432650001301445650001101458650001301469650001501482700002101497700002501518700002301543700001901566773013101585856007801716852000901794655001201803IND60563340120221117020600.0170215e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056334012DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b003352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitts, Cody Ross10aMultiple Enone-Directed Reactivity Modes Lead to the Selective Photochemical Fluorination of Polycyclic Terpenoid Derivatives  ap. 2208-2211.  aIn the realm of aliphatic fluorination, the problem of reactivity has been very successfully addressed in recent years. In contrast, the associated problem of selectivity, that is, directing fluorination to specific sites in complex molecules, remains a great, fundamental challenge. In this report, we show that the enone functional group, upon photoexcitation, provides a solution. Based solely on orientation of the oxygen atom, site-selective photochemical fluorination is achieved on steroids and bioactive polycycles with up to 65 different sp³ CH bonds. We have also found that γ-, β-, homoallylic, and allylic fluorination are all possible and predictable through the theoretical modes reported herein. Lastly, we present a preliminary mechanistic hypothesis characterized by intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer, radical fluorination, and ultimate restoration of the enone. In all, these results provide a leap forward in the design of selective fluorination of complex substrates that should be relevant to drug discovery, where fluorine plays a prominent role.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3afluorine 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3asteroids 3aterpenoids1 aBume, Desta Doro1 aHarry, Stefan Andrew1 aSiegler, Maxime A.1 aLectka, Thomas0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 139, no. 6 p.2208-2211dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b003353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245012700163300001600290520104500306592002801351650002301379650001201402650001701414650001501431650001501446650001501461650002101476650000701497650002001504650001601524650002201540653001901562653001801581653002301599653002001622653003901642700001601681700001301697700002001710700001501730700002001745700001701765773010601782856008701888852000901975655001201984IND60531600720221122030832.0190409e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053160072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yi10aFirst evidence of bioflocculant from Shinella albus with flocculation activity on harvesting of Chlorella vulgaris biomass  ap. 807-815.  aBioflocculant from Shinella albus xn-1 could be used to harvest energy-producing microalga Chlorella vulgaris biomass for the first time.

The pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is one of the organisms that produces GH18 chitinases. Notably, B. xylophilus has a higher number of GH18 chitinases compared with the obligate plant-parasitic nematodes Meloidogyne incognita and Meloidogyne hapla. In this study, seven GH18 chitinases were identified and cloned from B. xylophilus based on genomic analyses. The deduced amino acid sequences of all these genes contained an N-terminal signal peptide and a GH18 catalytic domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the origin of B. xylophilus GH18 chitinases was independent of those from fungi and bacteria. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis indicated that GH18 chitinase genes had discrete expression patterns, representing almost all the life stages of B. xylophilus. In situ hybridisation showed that the mRNA of GH18 chitinase genes of B. xylophilus were detected mainly in the spermatheca, esophageal gland cells, seminal vesicle and eggs. RNA interference (RNAi) results revealed different roles of GH18 chitinase genes in B. xylophilus. Bx-chi-1, Bx-chi-2 and Bx-chi-7 were associated with reproduction, fungal cell-wall degradation and egg hatching, respectively. Bx-chi-5 and Bx-chi-6 may be involved in sperm metabolism. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that GH18 chitinases have multiple functions in the life cycle of B. xylophilus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aMeloidogyne hapla 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aRNA interference 3aactive sites 3abacteria 3achitin 3achitinase 3aeggs 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3agenes 3aglycosides 3ahatching 3ain situ hybridization 3aingestion 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3aphylogeny 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aprokaryotic cells 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aseminal vesicles 3asignal peptide 3aspermatheca 3aspermatozoa 3atranscription (genetics) 0aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 0aGlycoside hydrolase family 18 0aIn situ hybridisation 0aDevelopmental expression pattern 0aGene silencing1 aWang, Xuan1 aGuan, Tinglong1 aPeng, Deliang1 aLi, Hongmei0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2016 Nov., v. 46, no. 12 p.819-828dElsevier LtdaAustralian Society for ParasitologywJournal:jnl1441x0020-75197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003400117024003700151040001800188100002800206245008200234300001800316520139300334592002801727596005501755596004701810596002401857650001701881650001401898650002301912650002001935650001201955650001301967650002401980650001302004650001102017650001402028650002202042700002702064700002402091700002402115773011002139856011402249856008002363961000902443852000902452655001202461IND60733802620221119235639.0220901e20200605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073380262DNAL7 a10113/73380262hdl7 a10.1021/acscatal.0c008112doi7 a10.1021/acscatal.0c008112chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdulrazzaq, Hussein T.10aReaction Kinetics Analysis of Ethanol Dehydrogenation Catalyzed by MgO–SiO2  ap. 6318-6331.  aThe Mg-catalyzed dehydrogenation of ethanol to yield acetaldehyde is an important step in the Lebedev reaction. In this work, we prepared a model MgO–SiO(2) catalyst by impregnation of MgO onto an SBA-15 support and used this material to study the reaction kinetics of ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde. The rates of acetaldehyde and ethylene production were measured for ethanol partial pressures ranging from 0.92 to 5.25 kPa. Both rates are fractional order at 723 K, decreasing to nearly zero-order at 648 K. Consistent with the literature for MgO–SiO(2) Lebedev catalysts, both basic sites and Lewis acidic sites were observed on this catalyst. The rates of both acetaldehyde and ethylene were inhibited by pyridine but not by 2,6-ditertbutylpyridine, suggesting that both reactions involve not only basic but also Lewis acidic sites. To elucidate the origin of this cooperativity, a microkinetic model was constructed using a recently published mechanism for the Lebedev reaction catalyzed by MgO. The model was fit to our data using four fitting parameters. The fitting suggests that adsorbed ethanol and hydrogen atoms have a weaker bond with mixed-oxide MgO–SiO(2) catalysts than with bulk MgO catalysts, which we attribute experimentally to an increase in the number of moderate-strength Mg(2+)–O(2–) site pairs formed at the expense of strongly basic MgO sites.  aPublisher supplied data  cHigher Committee for Education Development in Iraq  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cUniversity of Maine 3aacetaldehyde 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3aethanol 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3apyridines 3areaction kinetics1 aChokanlu, Amir Rahmani1 aFrederick, Brian G.1 aSchwartz, Thomas J.0 tACS Catalysis.g2020 June 05, v. 10, no. 11 p.6318-6331dAmerican Chemical Society (ACS)x2155-54357nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/73380263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.0c008113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01437naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245010500165300001800270520048700288592002800775650001100803650001200814650001300826650001300839650002300852700002300875700001900898773013100917856007801048852000901126655001201135IND60563340220221117020207.0170215e20170215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056334022DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b006512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavenor, Nathan

Natural processes, such as forest fires, can emit dioxins, but compared to industrial processes, usually very low quantities are emitted. However after a case of food contamination occurred in the United States of America in 1996 caused by kaolinitic clay a discussion on the provenience started. Besides the relatively high concentration also an unusual PCDD/F distribution pattern was found in these ball clay samples. This specific pattern related to none of the known anthropogenic sources for these contaminants and, in relation to a supposed natural formation, later it was named “natural formation pattern”. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) can transform biomass within hours into a brown coal-like product which resembles naturally occurring coal formation. HTC can also transform an already present PCDD/F contamination in a way to obtain a “natural formation pattern” characterized by an unusual high ratio between 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD and 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD and the absence of almost all chlorinated dibenzofurans. By varying the experimental conditions of the HTC process applied to sewage sludge samples contaminated with PCDD/Fs from anthropogenic sources, beside the “natural formation pattern” at a temperatures of 255°C, a remarkable increase of the toxicity based on WHO–TEQ was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3achlorination 3aclay 3acoal 3adibenzofuran 3afood contamination 3aforest fires 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3apollution 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3asewage sludge 3atemperature 3atoxicity 2aAluminum Silicatesxchemistry 2aBenzofuransxchemistry 2aCarbonxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aPolychlorinated Dibenzodioxinsxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 3aUnited States 0aDioxins 0aNatural formation pattern 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aTEF 0aTEQ1 aBasso, Albino0 tChemosphere.g2013 Nov., v. 93 p.1464-1470dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012600171520093400297592002801231650000901259650002501268650001301293650000901306650002601315650002701341650001401368650001901382650000901401650001001410650002501420650002101445653003101466653001501497653000801512653001301520653001401533700001701547700002201564700001801586700001801604700002101622700001901643700002101662700001901683773010001702856008701802852000901889655001201898IND60722119120221122220705.0220606e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072211912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1289582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ying-Cai14aThe enrichment of eggs with docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid through supplementation of the laying hen diet  aThe enrichment and transformation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) enriched phospholipids for eggs deserve attention. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the comparative effects of DHA and EPA enriched phospholipids and triacylglycerols on egg fortification by determining the fatty acid composition of egg yolk after intervention with fish oil (15 g/kg) and krill oil (15 and 30 g/kg) for three consecutive weeks. The results indicated that laying hens could incorporate over 300 mg DHA and EPA into one egg. Greater retention efficiency of DHA and EPA in eggs was observed in fish oil supplementation compared with krill oil at equivalent dietary levels. DHA and EPA were prone to locate at the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine. Consequently, fish oil possessed high DHA content and conversion rate, and krill oil could raise the proportion of DHA-containing phospholipids in eggs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afish oils 3afood chemistry 3ahens 3akrill 3aphosphatidylcholines 3atriacylglycerols 0aNutritionally enhanced egg 0aEnrichment 0aDHA 0aFish oil 0aKrill oil1 aShi, Hao-Hao1 aWang, Cheng-Cheng1 aYang, Jin-Yue1 aXue, Chang-Hu1 aJiang, Xiao-Ming1 aChen, Gui-Dong1 aZhang, Tian-Tian1 aWang, Youming,0 tFood chemistry.g2021 June 01, v. 346 p.128958-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1289583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03839naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012000173300001600293520173300309592002802042650002702070650002502097650001302122650001702135650001802152650002302170650002802193650001402221650001002235650002302245650002302268650002102291650001502312650000902327650001202336650002202348651001202370653002502382653001802407653001402425653001402439653003102453653002802484653001802512653003302530700001802563700002502581700002202606700002102628700002302649700002302672700003102695700001802726700001802744700002202762700002102784700001502805700001802820700002202838700001902860773016802879856008503047852000903132655001203141IND60556428120221119134120.0190312e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055642812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2016.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiagne, Christophe10aParasites and invasions: changes in gastrointestinal helminth assemblages in invasive and native rodents in Senegal  ap. 857-869.  aUnderstanding why some exotic species become widespread and abundant in their colonised range is a fundamental issue that still needs to be addressed. Among many hypotheses, newly established host populations may benefit from a parasite loss (“enemy release” hypothesis) through impoverishment of their original parasite communities or reduced infection levels. Moreover, the fitness of competing native hosts may be negatively affected by the acquisition of exotic taxa from invaders (“parasite spillover”) and/or by an increased transmission risk of native parasites due to their amplification by invaders (“parasite spillback”). We focused on gastrointestinal helminth communities to determine whether these predictions could explain the ongoing invasion success of the commensal house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), as well as the associated decrease in native Mastomys spp., in Senegal. For both invasive species, our results were consistent with the predictions of the enemy release hypothesis. A decrease in overall gastrointestinal helminth prevalence and infracommunity species richness was observed along the invasion gradients as well as lower specific prevalence/abundance (Aspiculuris tetraptera in Mus musculus domesticus, Hymenolepis diminuta in Rattus rattus) on the invasion fronts. Conversely, we did not find strong evidence of GIH spillover or spillback in invasion fronts, where native and invasive rodents co-occurred. Further experimental research is needed to determine whether and how the loss of gastrointestinal helminths and reduced infection levels along invasion routes may result in any advantageous effects on invader fitness and competitive advantage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspiculuris tetraptera 3aHymenolepis diminuta 3aMastomys 3aMus musculus 3aRattus rattus 3acolonizing ability 3agastrointestinal system 3ahelminths 3ahosts 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aprediction 3arisk 3arodents 3aspecies diversity 3aSenegal 0aBiological invasions 0aEnemy release 0aSpillback 0aSpillover 0aGastrointestinal helminths 0aMus musculus domesticus 0aRattus rattus 0aParasite community structure1 aRibas, Alexis1 aCharbonnel, Nathalie1 aDalecky, Ambroise1 aTatard, Caroline1 aGauthier, Philippe1 aHaukisalmi, Voitto1 aFossati-Gaschignard, Odile1 aBâ, Khalilou1 aKane, Mamadou1 aNiang, Youssoupha1 aDiallo, Mamoudou1 aSow, Aliou1 aPiry, Sylvain1 aSembène, Mbacké1 aBrouat, Carine0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2016 Dec., v. 46, no. 13-14 p.857-869dElsevier LtdaAustralian Society for ParasitologywJournal:jnl1441x0020-75197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2016.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245014100170300002000311520113800331592002801469650002301497650002201520650001801542650002501560650001301585650000901598650001301607650001901620650002201639650003001661650003701691653003201728653002101760653003101781653000801812653000901820653001301829700002001842700001901862773013001881856007802011852000902089655001202098IND60550884820221119163750.0161011e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055088482DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b072182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijayaraghavan, Priya10aSynthesis of Multibranched Gold Nanoechinus Using a Gemini Cationic Surfactant and Its Application for Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering  ap. 23909-23919.  aHigh-yield multibranched Au nanoechinus possessing lengthy and dense branched nanorods on the surface were synthesized using a seed-mediated surfactant-directed approach in the presence of gemini cationic surfactant N,N,N′N′-tetramethyl-N,N′-ditetradecylethane-1,2-diaminium bromide (C₁₄C₂C₁₄Br₂), HAuCl₄, AgNO₃, and ascorbic acid. C₁₄C₂C₁₄Br₂ surfactant provides a versatile template in designing the unique morphology of Au nanoechinus with the assistance of AgNO₃. UV–vis spectroscopic analysis proves that Au nanoechinus possess a unique intense broad localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak, which extends from 400 to 1700 nm in the NIR region making a highly potential platform for biomedical applications. Systematic time-dependent TEM, UV–vis–NIR, and XRD analysis were performed to monitor the morphological evolution of multibranched Au nanoechinus. It was found that the surface of branched nanorods of Au NE preferentially grew along (111) crystal planes. Furthermore, as-synthesized Au nanoechinus shows excellent SERS enhancement ability for dopamine inside HeLa cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aascorbic acid 3acationic surfactants 3adopamine 3agold 3ananorods 3asilver nitrate 3aspectral analysis 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atransmission electron microscopy 0amultibranched nanoparticles 0agold nanoechinus 0agemini cationic surfactant 0aNIR 0aSERS 0adopamine1 aLiu, Cheng-Hong1 aHwang, Kuo Chu0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Sept. 14, v. 8, no. 36 p.23909-23919dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b072183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012100169300001800290520158900308592002801897650001501925650001301940650002801953650001001981650001601991700002002007700001602027700002302043700006102066773012802127856008402255852000902339655001202348IND60637189620190516000000.0190416e20190404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063718962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b057542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoazami, Ehsan10aIntegration of World-to-Chip Interfaces with Digital Microfluidics for Bacterial Transformation and Enzymatic Assays  ap. 5159-5168.  aDigital microfluidics (DMF) represents an alternative to the conventional microfluidic paradigm of transporting fluids in enclosed channels. One of the major benefits of DMF is that fluid motion and control is achieved without external pumps. The automation component of DMF have pushed the barriers of this “lab-on-chip” technology. However, integration with external components (i.e., “world-to-chip”) interfaces have been a challenge. Two common “world-to-chip” challenges are (1) delivering biological samples to DMF devices and (2) accurately controlling temperatures on device. To address these challenges, this work describes two “world-to-chip” interface features that have been integrated on a DMF platform: a reagent delivery system and a thermal control apparatus. This platform enables a variety of biological or chemical experiments to be conducted on-chip while reducing manual intervention. Specifically, our platform increases reagent volumes available to device reservoirs volume by at least 50-fold eliminating the need to manually refill reservoirs while improving droplet dispensing reproducibility. In addition, we have integrated a closed-loop temperature control system that offers precise temperature control on-chip. To validate our “world-to-chip” interface, we have automated bacterial transformation and enzymatic assay protocols, showing that such a system enhances DMF performance. Overall, we propose that this system will improve biological experimentation which requires fluidic and temperature control integrated on DMF platforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3adroplets 3amicrofluidic technology 3apumps 3atemperature1 aPerry, James M.1 aSoffer, Guy1 aHusser, Mathieu C.1 aShih, Steve C.

Despite the paramount importance of HSG, it is still based on an assumption made in 1955. We assessed HSG using 249 rainfall simulation experiments carried out in two sets of experiments examining seedbed conditions. One set analyzed the variation within a small (60 ha) catchment while the other examined 32 benchmark soils selected to cover the full range of arable soils on sloping land in temperate humid areas. The assumption made in 1955 that sandy and stony soils have a low HSG (A), while clayey soils of low permeability have a high HSG (D), cannot be supported. Instead, HSG appeared to be governed by surface sealing because CN increased with increasing silt content in the bulk soil and decreasing soil organic matter content in the fine earth fraction. An equation for calculating CN and, in turn, a HSG from these two parameters is provided. This equation also avoids classification-induced errors. The relation holds true for a wide range of rain properties (e.g., rain amount between 0.2 mm and 103 mm; event intensities between 2 mm h⁻¹ and 80 mm h⁻¹), slope gradients (2 %–24 %) and various soil properties (e. g., stone contents up to 40 %, clay contents up to 61 %, sand contents up to 87 %). The CN and, in turn, HSG remained constant throughout the events from the start of runoff until the end of the event, which was up to 49 h later in 32 cases. Autocorrelation within the catchment was strong and the full variation was found within 600 m. Even small catchments are, hence, heterogeneous and their runoff cannot be assigned to a single HSG or a single CN. Rejecting the assumption developed in 1955, which had not been verified since then, has important implications for hydrological modelling but also for the development, implementation and assessment of water conserving land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aclay 3aequations 3aland use 3apermeability 3arain 3arainfall simulation 3aresearch 3arunoff 3asand 3aseedbeds 3asilt fraction 3asoil organic matter 3atillage 3awatersheds 0aCN, curve number 0aHSG 0aRMSE 0aSD 0aSOM 0aλ 0aRunoff modelling 0aCurve number 0aCatchment 0aFallow 0aGeostatistics1 aGu, Qiao-Lin0 tSoil & tillage research.g2021 Aug., v. 212 p.105034-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.1050343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014500165300001800310520117400328592002801502650001501530650002101545650001301566650001601579650002001595650002801615650002101643650001501664650002201679650002001701650001201721650002001733650002201753650002401775650002301799700001501822700001601837773010401853856008201957852000902039655001202048IND60091499320221116215612.0141103e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009149932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Guanglei10aGlucose biosensor based on covalent immobilization of enzyme in sol–gel composite film combined with Prussian blue/carbon nanotubes hybrid  ap. 3973-3976.  aA novel electrochemical glucose biosensor was developed based on in situ covalent immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOx) by one-pot chitosan (CS)-incorporated sol–gel process in the presence of Prussian blue deposited multi-walled carbon nanotubes hybrids (PB/MWNTs) using 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane (ICPTES) as both a sol–gel precursor and a covalent coupling agent for GOx and CS. The electrode modified with the PB/MWNTs-GOx-CS-ICPTES sol–gel composite film showed good electrical conductivity and effective low-potential electron transfer mediation toward H₂O₂ reduction attributed to the incorporation of PB/MWNTs. The biosensor exhibited a linear response to glucose in the concentration range from 2.5×10⁻⁵ to 1.3×10⁻³M with a correlation coefficient of 0.9998, a detection limit of 7.5×10⁻⁶M, a low response time (10s), good sensitivity and high anti-interference ability. Compared with the control biosensor based on the traditional tetraethoxysilane derived sol–gel composite film, the biosensor showed a similarly small apparent Michaelis–Menten constant of 3.67mM but much higher electrochemical and biosensing stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3achitosan 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aenzyme kinetics 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmobilized enzymes 3asol-gel processing1 aYue, Xiuli1 aDai, Zhifei0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 May 15, v. 26, no. 9 p.3973-3976dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012600172500001900298520214900317592002802466650002002494650001902514650001802533650001102551650001102562650001702573650001902590650001502609650001002624653003102634653001902665653001702684653002502701653003202726653002102758700001802779700002902797700001902826700001602845773010802861856008802969852000903057655001203066IND60722119320221120105519.0210201e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072211932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.1038432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mingyang12aA numerical study on the influence of curvature ratio and vegetation density on a partially vegetated U-bend channel flow  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAquatic vegetation dramatically shifts the main flow, secondary flow and turbulent structures in a meandering channel. In this study, hydrodynamics in a bending channel with a vegetation patch (VP) has been numerically studied under the variation of curvature ratios (CRs=0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0) and the vegetation density i.e. Solid Volume Fractions (SVF=1.13%, 4.86%). Both effects on vegetation shear flow, helical flow, bed shear stress and bulk drag coefficients are studied in twelve cases by using Ansys Fluent package. Unsteady Reynolds Averaging Navier-Stokes (URANS) framework coupled with the Reynolds Stress turbulence Model (RSM) and Volume Of Fluid (VOF) approach is successfully applied to predict the entire flow field including multi-circulation cells as well as the free surface. The conclusions are summarized as three points. Firstly, an increase of CR moves the main circulation cell and thalweg's location towards the outer bank, while decreasing the drag coefficients in streamwise and spanwise. However, the CR weakly affects the normalised shear flow velocity profiles and dominant eddy frequencies downstream of the VP. Secondly, the trend of the dominant shedding frequency to fall with the increase of SVF that has been known only for SVF<3.4% is extended up to 10.4%. Furthermore, an opposite trend is found between the frequency and SVF for 10.4%<SVF<20%. Thirdly, a newly proposed patch dimensionless frequency number, StpSVFN, links Stₚ and SVF, where N is the number of stems in the patch. This number stays almost constant for each case series regardless of the variation of SVF (for SVF<10.4%). We also conclude that StpSVFN is strongly determined by the patch shape factor, mildly influenced by the patch Reynolds number, but it excludes the influence of the SVF and N. The insights from the present study unveil the complicated eco-hydro-morphic interactions among the bio-mass density, turbulent flow and channel meanders’ variation. It provides a better understanding of natural bending river systems’ development and fundamentals for the recovery of urban channel ecosystems by vegetated re-meandering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aaquatic plants 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3arivers 3ashear stress 3aturbulent flow 3avegetation 3awater 0aVegetation patch (VP) flow 0aU-bend channel 0aHelical flow 0aCurvature ratio (CR) 0aSolid volume fraction (SVF) 0aDrag coefficient1 aAvital, Eldad1 aKorakianitis, Theodosios1 aWilliams, John1 aAi, Kaiming0 tAdvances in water resources.g2021 Feb., v. 148 p.103843-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.1038433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245006500187300001400252520111700266592002801383650002501411650001901436650001901455650001001474650002101484650001301505650003701518650001301555650003601568650003401604650004901638650007601687650002301763650007001786650003201856700001301888700001601901700002301917773008601940856008602026852000902112655001202121IND4465760120221122062635.0141110e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446576012DNAL7 a221040992pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xiao-Ying10aEnhanced anoxic bioremediation of PAHs-contaminated sediment  ap. 51-58.  aIn this study, the biodegradation of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in marine sediment was investigated under three different anoxic conditions, i.e. sulfate-only, nitrate-only and mixed nitrate/sulfate as electron acceptors. All two-, three- and four-ring PAHs showed significant biodegradation with the removal efficiencies ranging from 42% to 77%, while five- and six-ring PAHs showed little degradation. The results illustrated that two- to three-ring PAHs could be degraded at a rate of 4.01×10⁻²–6.42×10⁻²d⁻¹ under nitrate-reducing condition, faster than that of under sulfate-reducing condition. Biodegradation of two- and three-ring PAHs followed first-order model well with the rate constants of 1.62×10⁻²–6.42×10⁻²d⁻¹. The biodegradation of four ring PAHs followed the zero-order kinetic model with the rate constants of 1.26×10⁻²–2.22×10⁻²mg/kg/d. Molecular analysis indicated that nahAc gene increased by two orders of magnitude during the biodegradation and served as a good indicator of PAHs-degrading bacterial population and biodegradation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3agenes 3amarine sediments 3anitrates 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asulfates 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aLi, Bing1 aZhang, Tong1 aFang, Herbert H.P.0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Jan., v. 104 p.51-58dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
