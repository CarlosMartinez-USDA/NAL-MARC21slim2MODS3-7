Smith) inflorescence essential oil  aNatural preservatives derived from plant sources have been actively studied as an alternative to synthetic materials. Various extraction methods had been done to utilize the torch ginger plant for food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC−CO₂) extraction is a sustainable green technology to extract high-purity oil with high aromatic compound content. This study aims to optimize the SC−CO₂ extraction conditions on high yield and strong antioxidant activity of torch ginger (Etlingera elatior) inflorescence essential oil (TGIEO). Response surface methodology in combination with central composite design was employed and two independent variables, pressure (83.6–366.4 bar) and temperature (34.7–57.3 °C) were analysed to optimize the response variables. Pressure was observed as the most significant parameter affecting the yield and antioxidant activity. The optimized SC−CO₂ extraction conditions were pressure 286.4 bar and temperature 57.3 °C. The experimental values of response variables at these SC−CO₂ extraction conditions match well with the predicted values which confirm the model validity. The TGIEO showed high diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radical scavenging activity. Antimicrobial activity screening for TGIEO was done via disc diffusion assay and showed inhibition zone (11.5 ± 0.71 to 22.0 ± 2.83 mm) against six pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio species and Escherichia coli). Listeria monocytogenes was observed as the most sensitive microorganism with minimal inhibitory concentration (0.16 mg/mL) and minimal bactericidal concentration (0.63 mg/mL) respectively. Compounds 1-dodecanol and lauryl acetate were identified as major constituent in TGIEO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aEtlingera elatior 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Typhi 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVibrio 3aacetates 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aaromatic compounds 3abiopreservatives 3acarbon dioxide 3adietary supplements 3aessential oils 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodel validation 3aoils 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascreening 3asulfonic acids 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3asustainable technology 3asynthetic products 3atemperature 3avirulent strains 0aEtlingera elatior 0aSupercritical CO2 extraction 0aResponse surface methodology 0aAntioxidant 0aBioactive compound 0aAntimicrobial1 aMuhialdin, Belal J1 aZainal Abedin, Nur Hanani1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1800-27441 aMohammed, Nameer Khairullah1 aAbadl, Muna Mahmood Taleb1 aMohd Roby, Bizura Hasida1 aMeor Hussin, Anis Shobirin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9702-88560 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 154 p.112581-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1125813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245016200174520109300336592002801429650002401457650001101481650001901492650001801511650001901529650002901548650003201577650001101609650002801620653002601648653001501674653003401689653002001723653002501743700001601768700002401784700002101808700002001829773010701849856008701956852000902043655001202052IND60783494320221116165250.0220926e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078349432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, Giovanni10aEnvironmental assessment of a two-stage high pressure anaerobic digestion process and biological upgrading as alternative processes for biomethane production  aBiomethane plays a key role in achieving decarbonization and sustainable development goals. According to the objectives that arise, choosing the most suitable production system allows optimization of production, thereby reducing CO₂ emissions. In this study, three biomethane production scenario life cycle assessments were compared to determine which would maintain the lowest CO₂ emissions. Conventional anaerobic digestion and an innovative process called two-stage high pressure anaerobic digestion were considered. These methods were combined with two upgrading processes: water scrubbing and biological upgrading. Cattle manure and sugar beets were used as substrates for the process. Emissions were 805.6 gCO₂eq/m³CH₄ for the traditional biogas production process combined with water scrubbing and 450.3 gCO₂eq/m³CH₄ for the two-stage anaerobic digestion process combined with biological upgrading. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated that these values would be reduced by 29.5 % and 48.0 % if electrical energy were produced using only renewable energy sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acattle manure 3aelectric power 3aenvironmental assessment 3agas production (biological) 3asugars 3asustainable development 0aLife cycle assessment 0aBiomethane 0aTwo-stage anaerobic digestion 0aWater scrubbing 0aBiological upgrading1 aHoll, Elena1 aSteinbrenner, Jörg1 aPezzuolo, Andrea1 aLemmer, Andreas0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Sept., v. 360 p.127612-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018100170300001400351520131800365592002801683650002601711650001101737650000901748650001601757650001101773650001101784650001001795650002301805650001001828650002401838650001701862650000801879653002201887653003801909653002301947653001801970700002601988773013002014856008502144852000902229655001202238IND60537058420221120030446.0160807e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053705842DNAL7 a10.1080/00379271.2016.11875772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aName, Janejira14aThe relationship between the amount of insect-repelling phenolic compounds in pennywort tea and the number of infesting cigarette beetles in the tea bag during one-year storage  ap. 71-76.  aSummary Cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (F.), is a common food-product pest widely found in homes. This paper investigated the relationship between the number of infesting cigarette beetles and the phenolic content of pennywort tea made from young and mature leaves during one-year storage. It was found that cigarette beetles started to appear in tea bags after six months of storage. More adults were found than larvae and pupae. In addition, the number of cigarette beetles infesting pennywort tea made from mature leaves was higher than when it was made from young leaves. The amount of phenolic compounds in pennywort tea was analyzed by Folin–Ciocalteau assay. The results of a regression analysis indicated that the number of adult cigarette beetles correlated negatively with the amount of phenolic compounds in pennywort tea made from young leaves – when the total phenolic content decreased, the number of infesting cigarette beetles increased (r ² = 0.80). The number of larvae and pupae showed a weak negative correlation with the amount of phenolic compounds (r ² = 0.40 and r ² = 0.56, respectively). Similar correlations were found in pennywort tea made from mature leaves, but the number of infesting beetles was higher due to the lower phenolic content of the mature leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasioderma serricorne 3aadults 3abags 3acorrelation 3alarvae 3aleaves 3apests 3aphenolic compounds 3apupae 3aregression analysis 3astorage time 3atea 0acigarette beetles 0aLasioderma serricorne (Fabricius) 0aphenolic compounds 0apennywort tea1 aBumroongsook, Suvarin0 tAnnales de la Société entomologique de France (N.S.).g2016 Mar. 3, v. 52, no. 2 p.71-76dTaylor & Francisx2168-63517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00379271.2016.11875773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01975naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010400170520082500274592002801099650001301127650001201140650002301152650002301175650001401198650001201212650001701224650001301241653001301254653001101267653002501278653003501303653001901338700001801357700002101375773010201396856008201498852000901580655001201589IND60683456220221116170005.0200221e20200313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068345622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2020.1310002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaranfil, Abdullah10aSynthesis of novel tetrols from syn-bisepoxide: Preparation of halogenated bicyclo[4.2.0] inositols  aThe synthesis of halogenated bicyclo[4.2.0] inositols (and/or tetrols) are described. The photooxygenation of trans-7,8-dibromobicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene obtained using cyclooctatetraene as the starting molecule afforded the bicyclic endoperoxide. To obtain the halogenated bicyclo[4.2.0] inositols, the required key intermediate endoperoxide was rearranged quantitatively to the corresponding bisepoxide under thermal conditions. Ring-opening reaction of the bisepoxide with H⁺/Ac₂O resulted in a mixture of tetraacetates as well as the formation of a cyclic sulfate. Eventually, the desired halogenated bicyclo[4.2.0] inositols (and/or tetrols) were obtained in high yield by ammonolysis of the acetate groups by NH₃.

Here, we report a study on FRET between CuInS₂/ZnS QDs and dark quencher dye molecules (IRDye QC-1). Oleate-capped QDs with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 55 ± 4% are transferred into water by using two types of multifunctional polymer ligands combining imidazole groups and specific moieties with amine or methoxy groups as the terminal sites. The resulting water-dispersible QDs show PLQYs as high as 44 ± 4% and exhibit long-term colloidal stability (at least 10 months at 4 °C in the dark) with a hydrodynamic diameter of less than 20 nm. A side-by-side comparison experiment was performed using the amine or methoxy-functionalized QDs for coupling to dark quencher dye molecules. The amine-functionalized QDs bind to the dye molecules via covalent bonds, while methoxy-functionalized ones bind only weakly and nonspecifically. The progressive quenching of the QD emission and shortening of its photoluminescence decay time upon increasing the number of conjugated dye molecules demonstrate that the QD acts as the energy donor and the dark quencher dye as the energy acceptor in a donor–acceptor FRET pair. The FRET dynamics of the QD–dye conjugates are simulated using two different models based on the possible origin of the multiexponential PL decay of the QDs (i.e., variations in nonradiative or radiative decay rates). The model based on the radiative decay rates provides a better fit of our experimental data and estimates a donor–acceptor distance (6.5 nm) that matches well the hydrodynamic radius of the amine-functionalized QDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3adyes 3aenergy transfer 3ahydrodynamics 3aimidazole 3aligands 3amodels 3amoieties 3aphotoluminescence 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 3azinc sulfide1 aWang, Wentao1 aDu, Liang1 aRabouw, Freddy T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4775-08591 aJ. van den Heuvel, Dave1 aGerritsen, Hans C.1 aMattoussi, Hedi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6511-93231 ade Mello Donega, Celso1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4403-36270 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 18, v. 124, no. 2 p.1717-1731dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b105363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012300154300002000277520131600297592002801613650002201641650001501663650001501678650002201693650002901715650001101744650000901755650003701764650001101801650001301812650003401825650003301859650001701892650002101909650002201930650001901952653001501971653001101986653002401997653002902021653001702050700001902067700001802086700002002104700001802124773012902142856007302271852000902344655001202353IND60527520520221117095024.0160715e20131023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052752052DNAL7 a10.1021/am402836b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Dahu10aNickel Oxide Grafted Andic Soil for Efficient Cesium Removal from Aqueous Solution: Adsorption Behavior and Mechanisms  ap. 10151-10158.  aAn andic soil, akadama clay, was modified with nickel oxide and tested for its potential application in the removal of cesium from aqueous solution. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed the nickel oxide was successfully grafted into akadama clay. N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherms indicated the surface area decreased remarkably after modification while the portion of mesopores increased greatly. Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) showed the modified akadama clay had better thermostability than the pristine akadama clay. Decreases in cation exchange capacity (CEC) and ζ-potential were also detected after the modification. Adsorption kinetic and isotherm studies indicated the adsorption of Cs⁺ on the modified akadama clay was a monolayer adsorption process. Adsorption capacity was greatly enhanced for the modified akadama clay probably due to the increase in negative surface charge caused by the modification. The adsorption of Cs⁺ on the modified akadama clay was dominated by an electrostatic adsorption process. Results of this work are of great significance for the application of akadama clay as a promising adsorbent material for cesium removal from aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acation exchange capacity 3acesium 3aclay 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3anickel 3anitrogen 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3athermal analysis 3athermal stability 3azeta potential 0aandic soil 0acesium 0aadsorption isotherm 0aelectrostatic adsorption 0aion exchange1 aLei, Zhongfang1 aYang, Yingnan1 aFeng, Chuanping1 aZhang, Zhenya0 tACS applied materials .g2013 Oct. 23, v. 5, no. 20 p.10151-10158dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am402836b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016300170300001800333520187000351592002802221596005702249650002602306650002102332650001102353650001702364650001602381650001402397650001202411650001202423650002302435650001802458650000902476650001802485650001502503650001102518700002802529700002602557700002402583700002002607700002202627700001902649700002202668700001802690700001802708700002102726700001702747700002002764700006602784773013702850856008202987852000903069655001203078IND60687193620221117235021.0200327e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068719362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-019-01963-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHovland, Ida Heir10aEffects of low doses of fish and milk proteins on glucose regulation and markers of insulin sensitivity in overweight adults: a randomised, double blind study  ap. 1013-1029.  aPURPOSE: To examine whether supplementation with low doses of fish or milk proteins would affect glucose regulation and circulating lipid concentrations in overweight healthy adults. METHODS: Ninety-three overweight adults were assigned to receive 2.5 g protein/day from herring (HER), salmon (SAL), cod (COD) or milk (CAS, a casein–whey mixture as positive control) as tablets for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Seventy-seven participants were included in the analyses. HER and SAL did not affect glucose and insulin concentrations. COD significantly reduced within-group changes in 90 and 120 min postprandial glucose concentrations but changes were not different from HER and SAL groups. CAS supplementation significantly reduced the area under the curve for glucose concentrations (− 7%), especially when compared to SAL group, and reduced postprandial insulin c-peptide concentration (− 23%). Reductions in acetoacetate (− 24%) and β-hydroxybutyrate (− 29%) serum concentrations in HER group were more prominent compared to SAL and COD groups, with no differences between fish protein groups for α-hydroxybutyrate. Serum concentrations of α-hydroxybutyrate (− 23%), acetoacetate (− 39%) and β-hydroxybutyrate (− 40%) were significantly reduced within CAS group, and the decreases were significantly more pronounced when compared to SAL group. Serum lipid concentrations were not altered in any of the intervention groups. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that 2.5 g/day of proteins from fish or milk may be sufficient to improve glucose regulation in overweight adults. The effects were most pronounced after supplementation with proteins from cod, herring and milk, whereas salmon protein did not affect any of the measurements related to glucose regulation.

Oxidative-degradation behavior of common components of formulated finishes has been evaluated independently and in mixtures with other components (formulated finish). Using chemical and physical analyses, the changes in the molecular weights and products of degradation were investigated. Thermal degradation of formulated finishes prepared in this research was compared with two ready-to-use formulated finishes from industry.

In this investigation, both initially saturated slurry specimens and unsaturated compacted specimens were prepared and subjected to three W–D cycles. The temporal–spatial evolution of soil profile mechanical behavior during each drying path was characterized by penetration test using a micro-penetrometer. The results show that the employed micro-penetrometer provides a simple, quick and reliable tool to evaluate soil profile mechanical behavior. As initially saturated soil is subjected to drying, the overall profile penetration resistance changes slightly before a critical water content is reached. After that, it increases quickly with decreasing water content. The drying induced improvement of soil mechanical behavior exhibits evident delayed effect in profile. The effect of W–D cycles on soil profile mechanical behavior depends on soil initial state. For initially saturated slurry specimens, the overall profile penetration resistance generally decreases with increasing W–D cycles, and the reduction between the 1st and 2nd drying paths is much higher than that between the 2nd and 3rd drying paths. While for initial unsaturated compacted specimens, the overall profile penetration resistance during the 1st drying path is lowest, and reaches the maximum value during the 2nd drying path. It is also found that, whatever the initial state, profile structure defects are created after the specimens are subjected to the 3rd W–D cycle. During the 3rd drying path, the penetration resistance shows evident fluctuation in profile, and this phenomenon is more pronounced at relatively low water content condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrying 3aresistance to penetration 3aslurries 3asoil formation 3asoil profiles 3awater content 3awet-dry cycles 0aWetting–drying cycle 0aProfile mechanical behavior 0aPenetration test 0aPenetration resistance 0aSuction 0aMicrostructure1 aWang, De-Yin1 aShi, Bin1 aLi, Jian0 tCatena.g2016 Apr., v. 139 p.105-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245008600174300001400260520136200274592002801636650001801664650001101682650001701693650001901710650001201729650001001741650001801751650001401769651001401783651001601797653001601813653001801829653001701847653001401864653001701878700002401895700002401919773012901943856008402072852000902156655001202165IND60566285020221121232111.0190318e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056628502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2017.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChertoprud, Elena S.10aHarpacticoida (Copepoda) of the Caspian Sea: Faunistics, ecology and biogeography  ap. 63-70.  aBased on original material collected in the Caspian Sea, the harpacticoid fauna and its taxocene structure were described. The complied list of the Caspian harpacticoids includes 28 species of 16 genera and 10 families. Three species are new to science. Endemics make up 21% of the total species number, while cosmopolitans compose 36%. Four types of taxocenes in the soft littoral sediments of the Caspian Sea were described. High inter-annual variability in the structure of the harpacticoid taxocenes was observed in the Caspian littoral zone in February–March. This may be caused by strong climatic variations in the maritime area, with sporadic alternation of warm and cold winters.A comparative analysis of the faunas of the Caspian, Aral, Azov, Black and Mediterranean Seas was performed. The faunas clearly diverge into two groups: the Mediterranean and the Sarmatian, which indicates the relationships among the faunas of the fragments of the common relict Sarmatian Sea Basin. The harpacticoid fauna also differs considerably within the Sarmatian cluster. The faunas of the Azov, Caspian and Aral Seas are mainly represented by brackish-water species, while marine species dominate in the Black Sea. However, these faunas share numerous brackish species that likely formed earlier the major part of the harpacticoid fauna of the Sarmatian Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHarpacticoida 3abasins 3abiogeography 3abrackish water 3aecology 3afauna 3alittoral zone 3asediments 3aBlack Sea 3aCaspian Sea 0aCaspian Sea 0aHarpacticoida 0aBiodiversity 0aTaxocenes 0aBiogeography1 aSokolova, Agniya M.1 aGarlitska, Lesya A.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2018 May, v. 502 p.63-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2017.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010700165300001800272520138800290592002801678650000801706650002601714650001201740650000901752650001901761650001301780650001201793650001701805650001701822650003301839650002401872650001401896650001601910650001901926650001101945653000801956653002801964653001701992653002002009653002202029700002102051700001902072773012202091856008002213852000902293655001202302IND60616783920221120222312.0181020e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061678392DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175103762632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoungmin Jun, 10aEffect of heat and moisture transfer properties on microclimate and subjective thermal comfort of caps  ap. 2195-2203.  aThe purpose of this research is to explore the effect of textile properties on the microclimate inside the cap and subjective wearing sensations in various environmental conditions, with/without radiation or air current. Heat and moisture transfer properties of cap fabrics were measured and their relationships with the microclimate inside caps and with the subjective wearing sensations in three different environmental conditions were analyzed. Principal component analysis and regression analysis were employed for the relationship of microclimatic temperature and thermal comfort. The most important fabric properties affecting the cap microclimate in a hot environment was found to be those related to liquid moisture transport and emission. Properties related to vapor transport and air permeability did not affect the microclimate much in a hot environment without radiation or air current. However, in the radiation environment, fabric with high thermal resistance generated a microclimate with low temperature and humidity, thereby giving good thermal comfort. In the environment with air current, air permeability and its related properties were the most critical fabric properties influencing the microclimate and subjective thermal comfort. According to the regression models obtained, thermal discomfort sensation starts at around 33°C, and becomes very high at 35°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenvironmental factors 3afabrics 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3ahumidity 3aliquids 3amicroclimate 3apermeability 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3asensation 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3avapors 0aCap 0aenvironmental condition 0amicroclimate 0athermal comfort 0awearing sensation1 aChung Hee Park, 1 aTae Jin Kang, 0 tTextile research journal.g2010 Dec., v. 80, no. 20 p.2195-2203dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175103762633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009400177300001600271520105500287592002801342650002101370650001801391650002101409650001901430650001501449650001901464650003401483650003801517700002201555700002401577700002201601700002901623700002101652700001901673700002201692773009201714856008501806990002301891852000901914655001201923IND60098216620221118045406.0141104e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009821662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Laurentiis, Angela14aThe catalytic class IA PI3K isoforms play divergent roles in breast cancer cell migration  ap. 529-541.  aTransforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) plays an important role in breast cancer metastasis. Here phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling was found to play an essential role in the enhanced migration capability of fibroblastoid cells (FibRas) derived from normal mammary epithelial cells (EpH4) by transduction of oncogenic Ras (EpRas) and TGFβ1. While expression of the PI3K isoform p110δ was down-regulated in FibRas cells, there was an increase in the expression of p110α and p110β in the fibroblastoid cells. The PI3K isoform p110β was found to specifically contribute to cell migration in FibRas cells, while p110α contributed to the response in EpH4, EpRas and FibRas cells. Akt, a downstream targets of PI3K signalling, had an inhibitory role in the migration of transformed breast cancer cells, while Rac, Cdc42 and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) were necessary for the response. Together our data reveal a novel specific function of the PI3K isoform p110β in the migration of cells transformed by oncogenic H-Ras and TGF-β1.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acell movement 3aepithelial cells 3amammary glands 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3atransforming growth factor beta 11 aPardo, Olivier E.1 aPalamidessi, Andrea1 aJackson, Shaun P.1 aSchoenwaelder, Simone M.1 aReichmann, Ernst1 aScita, Giorgio1 aArcaro, Alexandre0 tCellular signalling.g2011 Mar., v. 23, no. 3 p.529-541dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.10.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009700157300001600254520107400270592002801344650001401372650002301386650003801409650003301447650002101480650001901501650001201520650001401532650002301546700003601569773009401605856007401699852000901773655001201782IND60132970020221119093828.0150513e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013297002DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.275072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkada, Seiji10aSynthesis of bio‐based poly(N‐phenylitaconimide) by atom transfer radical polymerization  ap. 822-827.  aPoly(N‐phenylitaconimide) (polyPhII) was prepared using initiators for continuous activator regeneration atom transfer radical polymerization of PhII using FeBr₃complexes as catalysts. Conversion reached 69% in 24 h, yielding polyPhII with a number average molecular weight Mₙ = 11,900 and a molecular weight distribution Mw/Mₙ = 1.52. Copolymerizations of PhII with styrene at various molar ratios were performed providing a range of polyPhII‐copolySt polymers. When the copolymerization was carried out with higher [St]₀ > [PhII]₀ratio, a one‐pot synthesis of poly(St‐alt‐PhII)‐b‐polySt was achieved. The thermal properties of the obtained copolymers were studied by differential scanning calorimetry. PolyPhII prepared by ATRP showed high glass transition temperature (Tg) of 216 °C and the poly(St‐alt‐PhII)‐b‐polySt exhibited two Tgs, at 162 and 104 °C, corresponding to a poly(St‐alt‐PhII) and polySt segments, respectively. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most common bariatric procedure that is performed in obese women for weight loss and metabolic improvement. However, some studies suggest that this procedure negatively affects offspring. Herein, using Western diet (WD)-obese female rats, we investigated the effects of maternal RYGB on postnatal body development, glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and action in their adult male F1 offspring. METHODS: Female Wistar rats consumed a Western diet (WD) for 18 weeks, before being submitted to RYGB (WD-RYGB) or SHAM (WD-SHAM) operations. After 5 weeks, WD-RYGB and WD-SHAM females were mated with control male breeders, and the F1 offspring were identified as: WD-RYGB-F1 and WD-SHAM-F1. RESULTS: The male F1 offspring of WD-RYGB dams exhibited decreased BW, but enhanced total nasoanal length gain. At 120 days of age, WD-RYGB-F1 rats displayed normal fasting glycemia and glucose tolerance but demonstrated reduced insulinemia and higher glucose disappearance after insulin stimulus. In addition, these rodents presented insulin resistance in the gastrocnemius muscle and retroperitoneal fat, as judged by lower Akt phosphorylation after insulin administration, but an increase in this protein in the liver. Finally, the islets from WD-RYGB-F1 rats secreted less insulin in response to glucose and displayed increased β-cell area and mass. CONCLUSIONS: RYGB in WD dams negatively affected their F1 offspring, leading to catch-up growth, insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and white fat, and β-cell dysfunction. Therefore, our data are the first to demonstrate that the RYGB in female rats may aggravate the metabolic imprinting induced by maternal WD consumption, in their male F1 descendants. However, since we only used male F1 rats, further studies are necessary to demonstrate if such effect may also occur in female F1 offspring from dams that underwent RYGB operation.  aPublisher supplied data  a155/2013cFundação Araucária  a447190/2014-8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a817693/2015cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a2015/12611-0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aWestern diets 3aadults 3abariatric surgery 3ablood glucose 3acompensatory growth 3afasting 3afemales 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3alaboratory animals 3aliver 3amales 3amuscles 3aobesity 3aphosphorylation 3aprogeny 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3aweight loss 3awhite adipose tissue 3awomen1 aBertasso, Iala Milene1 aRibeiro, Rosane Aparecida1 aAlegre-Maller, Ana Claudia Paiva1 aLubaczeuski, Camila1 aBoschero, Antonio Carlos1 aAraújo, Allan Cezar Faria1 aBalbo, Sandra Lucinei1 aBonfleur, Maria Lúcia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5526-74210 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2020 Apr., v. 59, no. 3 p.1067-1079dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-019-01968-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245012600208300001800334520095800352592002801310650002201338650001501360650002001375650001101395650001401406650002301420650001301443650001901456650001201475650001701487650001501504650003701519700006101556700002001617700001801637700006201655700002001717700002301737700002301760700002001783700006501803773013501868856008002003852000902083655001202092IND60681731120200331000000.0200117e20191227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068173112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b105562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Antonio J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3776-708010aSimultaneous Optical and Electrical Characterization of GaN Nanowire Arrays by Means of Vis-IR Spectroscopic Ellipsometry  ap. 1535-1543.  aWe report an original and straightforward method for both optical and electrical characterization of vertical GaN nanowire arrays epitaxially grown on silicon through visible-infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry methods. For the initial purpose of adding new inputs to the ellipsometry model, focused ion-beam tomography experiments were conducted to extract porosity/depth profiles of these systems. To reproduce the optical free-carrier behavior in the infrared, the ellipsometric data acquired were fitted to an anisotropic Bruggeman model including Tauc-Lorentz and Drude oscillators, which enabled the determination of carrier density and in-grain mobility. The nice agreement of these results with those obtained by combining Hall effect measurements, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy studies supported the validity of the proposed method, opening new horizons in the characterization of nanowire-based semiconducting layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanisotropy 3adata collection 3amodels 3ananowires 3aphysical chemistry 3aporosity 3asemiconductors 3asilicon 3aspectroscopy 3atomography 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLacroix, Bertrand1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7916-63771 aBlanco, Eduardo1 aHurand, Simon1 aGómez, Víctor J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2364-88141 aPaumier, Fabien1 aGirardeau, Thierry1 aHuffaker, Diana L.1 aGarcía, Rafael1 aMorales, Francisco M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8341-24780 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 27, v. 124, no. 2 p.1535-1543dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b105563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245018000167300001600347520169900363592002802062650001102090650001102101650002202112650001902134650001602153650002102169650002202190650001302212650002202225650001902247650001802266650001702284651001302301653001802314653002102332653002002353653001602373653001302389653002002402700001902422700001802441700002002459700005802479700002102537773010502558856008602663852000902749655001202758IND60566285220221121232247.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056628522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInam, Azhar10aCoupling of a distributed stakeholder-built system dynamics socio-economic model with SAHYSMOD for sustainable soil salinity management. Part 2: Model coupling and application  ap. 278-299.  aMany simulation models focus on simulating a single physical process and do not constitute balanced representations of the physical, social and economic components of a system. The present study addresses this challenge by integrating a physical (P) model (SAHYSMOD) with a group (stakeholder) built system dynamics model (GBSDM) through a component modeling approach based on widely applied tools such as MS Excel, Python and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The coupled model (P-GBSDM) was applied to test soil salinity management scenarios (proposed by stakeholders) for the Haveli region of the Rechna Doab Basin in Pakistan. Scenarios such as water banking, vertical drainage, canal lining, and irrigation water reallocation were simulated with the integrated model. Spatiotemporal maps and economic and environmental trade-off criteria were used to examine the effectiveness of the selected management scenarios. After 20years of simulation, canal lining reduced soil salinity by 22% but caused an initial reduction of 18% in farm income, which requires an initial investment from the government. The government-sponsored Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) is a short-term policy that resulted in a 37% increase in water availability with a 12% increase in farmer income. However, it showed detrimental effects on soil salinity in the long term, with a 21% increase in soil salinity due to secondary salinization. The new P-GBSDM was shown to be an effective platform for engaging stakeholders and simulating their proposed management policies while taking into account socioeconomic considerations. This was not possible using the physically based SAHYSMOD model alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPython 3abasins 3acomputer software 3adynamic models 3afarm income 3airrigation water 3aissues and policy 3asalinity 3asimulation models 3asocioeconomics 3asoil salinity 3astakeholders 3aPakistan 0aSoil salinity 0aIntegrated model 0aSocio-economics 0aRechna Doab 0aSAHYSMOD 0aSystem dynamics1 aAdamowski, Jan1 aPrasher, Shiv1 aHalbe, Johannes1 aMalard, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6636-69351 aAlbano, Raffaele0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Aug., v. 551 p.278-299dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015400175300001500329520126100344592002801605650000801633650002001641650001301661650001601674650001701690650001401707650001101721650001801732650001701750650001901767650001401786650001901800650002201819653001701841653001701858653001501875653002401890653000801914653000801922700002301930700002401953700001701977700002501994700002102019700005702040773007502097856008402172852000902256655001202265IND60529777720221122011248.0161020e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052977772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2016.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGołuński, Grzegorz10aPentoxifylline as a modulator of anticancer drug doxorubicin. Part II: Reduction of doxorubicin DNA binding and alleviation of its biological effects  ap. 95-102.  aAnticancer drug doxorubicin is commonly used in cancer treatment. However, drug's severe side effects make toxicity reduction important matter. Another biologically active aromatic compound, pentoxifylline, can sequester aromatic compounds in stacking complexes reducing their bioactivity. This work deals with the problem of alleviating doxorubicin side effects by pentoxifylline. We employed a wide spectrum of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cellular assays. In addition, we used the doxorubicin-pentoxifylline mixed association constant to quantitatively assess pentoxifylline influence on the doxorubicin mutagenic activity. Obtained results indicate strong protective effects of pentoxifylline towards doxorubicin, observed on bacteria and human keratinocytes with no such effects observed on the cancer cells. It may be hypothesized that, considering much shorter half-life of pentoxifylline than doxorubicin, simultaneous administration of doxorubicin and pentoxifylline will lead to gradual release of doxorubicin from complexes with pentoxifylline to reach desired therapeutic concentration. Proposed results shed light on the possible doxorubicin chemotherapy modification and its side effects reduction without the loss of its therapeutic potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadverse effects 3abacteria 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3akeratinocytes 3amutagenicity 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apentoxifylline 3aprotective effect 0aCytotoxicity 0aMutagenicity 0aCell cycle 0aConfocal microscopy 0aDOX 0aPTX1 aBorowik, Agnieszka1 aDerewońko, Natalia1 aKawiak, Anna1 aRychłowski, Michał1 aWoziwodzka, Anna1 aPiosik, Jacek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5671-19150 tBiochimie.g2016 Apr., v. 123 p.95-102dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2016.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012200165300001800287520087200305592002801177650001801205650001801223650001501241650001401256650001001270650002001280650005301300650001201353650002101365650001901386650001801405650001801423650001801441650000901459650001401468650001401482650001601496650002201512650003301534650002501567653001501592653001201607653002001619653002401639653000901663653001601672700001501688700001801703700001901721700001601740700001501756700001901771700001201790700001501802700001401817700005301831773009901884856008601983852000902069655001202078IND60633811120221119134350.0200210e20190417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063381112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yuhua10aVirus-like particle vaccines for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 with enhanced thermostability expressed in insect cells  ap. 2340-2347.  aPoliovirus (PV) is a pathogen that causes poliomyelitis, which may lead to paralysis and fatality. Inactivated PV vaccines (IPVs) and live-attenuated oral PV vaccines (OPVs) are currently used to defend against PV worldwide. Vaccines must be developed in a PV-free environment given the biosafety issues associated with OPV and IPV production and to eradicate PV globally. In this study, PV1, PV2, and PV3 virus-like particles with enhanced thermostability (PV-sVLPs) were produced in large quantities by using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS). Mice immunized with PV-sVLPs generated antibodies with strong PV-neutralizing response. In addition, splenocytes collected from immunized mice expressed high levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, GM-CSF, IL-5, and IL-10 upon PV-sVLPs stimulation. These data suggest that PV-sVLPs can serve as vaccines against PV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaculoviridae 3aEnterovirus C 3aantibodies 3abiosafety 3adeath 3agenetic vectors 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3ainsects 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-5 3alive vaccines 3amice 3aparalysis 3apathogens 3asplenocytes 3athermal stability 3avirus-like particle vaccines 3avirus-like particles 0aPoliovirus 0aVaccine 0aThermostability 0aVirus-like particle 0aBEVS 0aInsect cell1 aMa, Shuzhi1 aHuang, Yangbo1 aChen, Fengying1 aChen, Liyun1 aDing, Dong1 aZheng, Yanping1 aLi, Hua1 aXiao, Jing1 aFeng, Jin1 aPeng, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5260-71280 tVaccine.g2019 Apr. 17, v. 37, no. 17 p.2340-2347dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245008000163300001800243520093600261592002801197650001201225650001101237650001301248650002501261650001101286650000901297650001701306650002201323650002301345650001401368650003701382700005701419700005601476700005701532773013501589856008001724852000901804655001201813IND60681731220221119021210.0200117e20191221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068173122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b105612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Huafeng10aDeep Blue Emission of All-Bromide-Based Cesium Lead Perovskite Nanocrystals  ap. 1617-1622.  aAll-inorganic perovskites have attracted intensive research attention. By adjusting halogen X (X = Cl, Br, and I), perovskite ABX₃ can be used in blue, green, and red light sources. However, it is very hard to avoid halogen exchange when different halide perovskite nanocrystals are used together for optoelectronic devices. We synthesized all-bromide-based cesium lead perovskite nanocrystals with deep blue emission at 405 (±1) nm. The photoluminescence quantum yield can be up to 22 (±3)%. The transmission electron microscopy results confirm the single-crystalline structure of the perovskite Cs₄PbBr₆ nanocrystals. The large Stokes shift of deep blue emission mainly results from the charge-transfer state. These all-bromide-based deep blue emission perovskite nanocrystals avoid the halogen exchange. Our results show that the all-bromide perovskite nanocrystals have great potential for a blue light-emitting source.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3acesium 3achlorine 3aelectronic equipment 3aiodine 3alead 3ananocrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3ared light 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Xiaoli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1492-20681 aSun, Xiaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2840-18801 aZhang, Xinhai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2913-17440 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 21, v. 124, no. 2 p.1617-1622dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b105613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001500161245008100176300001600257500000900273520079700282592002801079650001401107650001901121650002101140650001501161650002401176650000901200700001301209700001801222773014901240856009601389852000901485655001201494IND60668731620221116155821.0191125e198109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066873162DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500050036x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalpaz, H.10aOn the Estimation of N-Mineralization Parameters from Incubation Experiments  ap. 993-996.  aepub  aAccurate prediction of nitrogen mineralization in soils requires reliable parameters which are determined in incubation experiments. The estimated values of the potentially mineralizable organic nitrogen (Nₒ) and the mineralization rate constant (k) also depend on the mathematical analysis of the incubation results. Analysis of data by other researchers (Stanford and Smith, 1972) by a nonlinear regression procedure gave estimates of Nₒ and k which differed from those obtained by a linear regression technique. Theoretical considerations show that the difference between the two techniques results mainly from the specified behavior of the error term in the mineralization rate equation. The nonlinear regression procedure is shown to be preferable to the linear regression technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amineralization 3aorganic nitrogen 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoil1 aFine, P.1 aBar-Yosef, B.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1981 Sept., v. 45, no. 5 p.993-996dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500050036x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245012900160300001800289520102200307592002801329650001301357650002101370650000901391650001301400650002801413650001501441650002101456650001701477650003201494650001001526650000901536650001401545650002401559650002101583650001201604650001301616653002501629653001701654653001301671653000901684653001301693700001801706700001401724700001901738700001701757700005601774773014801830856008001978852000902058655001202067IND60604230520221122035753.0180716e20180222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060423052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b046152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xue10aHalloysite Nanotubes-Induced Al Accumulation and Fibrotic Response in Lung of Mice after 30-Day Repeated Oral Administration  ap. 2925-2933.  aNatural halloysite (Al₂Si₂O₅(OH)₄·nH₂O) nanotubes (HNT) are clay materials with hollow tubular structure and are widely applied in many fields. Many in vitro studies indicate that HNTs exhibit a high level of biocompatibility; however, the in vivo toxicity of HNTs remains unclear. In this study, the biodistribution and pulmonary toxicity of the purified HNTs in mice were investigated after intragastric administration for 30 days. HNTs have high stability in biological conditions. Oral administration of HNTs caused significant Al accumulation predominantly in the lung with relative slight effects on Si biodistribution. Oral administration of HNTs stimulated the growth of the mice at low dose (5 mg/kg BW) with no pulmonary toxicity but inhibited the mouse growth and resulted in oxidative stress and inflammation in lung at high dose (50 mg/kg BW). In addition, oral HNTs at high dose could be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and deposited in lung and could also induce pulmonary fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abiocompatibility 3aclay 3afibrosis 3agastrointestinal system 3ahalloysite 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3aintragastric administration 3alungs 3amice 3ananotubes 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3asilicon 3atoxicity 0ahalloysite nanotubes 0ananotoxicity 0aaluminum 0alung 0afibrosis1 aGong, Jiachun1 aRong, Rui1 aGui, Zongxiang1 aHu, Tingting1 aXu, Xiaolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9997-44830 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Feb. 22, v. 66, no. 11 p.2925-2933dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b046153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010300166300001600269520179500285592002802080650001502108650002402123650002202147650001002169650001302179650001502192650002802207650001402235650002702249650001702276650002202293650002402315700002902339700002302368773010802391856008102499852000902580655001202589IND60520116420221121004053.0160513e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052011642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-016-9430-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohl, Emily K.10aInterspecific differences in milkweeds alter predator density and the strength of trophic cascades  ap. 249-261.  aTrophic cascades occur when predators benefit plants by consuming herbivores, but the overall strength of a trophic cascade depends upon the way species interactions propagate through a system. For example, plant resistance to, or tolerance of, herbivores reduces the potential magnitude of a trophic cascade. At the same time, plants can also affect predator foraging or consumption in ways that either increase or decrease the strength of trophic cascades. In this study, we investigated the effects of plant variation on cascade strength by manipulating predator access to aphid populations on two species of milkweed: the slower-growing, putatively more-defended Asclepias syriaca and the faster-growing, putatively less-defended Asclepias incarnata. Predatory insects increased plant growth and survival for both species, but the strength of these trophic cascades was greater on A. incarnata, which supported more aphid growth early in the season than did A. syriaca. More predators were observed per aphid on A. incarnata, and cage treatments generated significant patterns consistent with predator aggregation on A. incarnata, but not A. syriaca. Although predators strongly affected aphids, this effect did not differ consistently between milkweed species. Plant tolerance to herbivory may therefore be the primary driver of the difference in trophic cascade strength observed. Importantly, we observed that the timing of predator exclusion affected plant growth and survival differently, indicating that measures of “cascade strength” may change with phenology and plant physiological responses. Together, our results suggest a mechanism by which differences in resource allocation patterns could explain differences in growth, phenology, and cascade strength between species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aAsclepias incarnata 3aAsclepias syriaca 3acages 3aforaging 3aherbivores 3ainterspecific variation 3aphenology 3aphysiological response 3aplant growth 3apredatory insects 3aresource allocation1 aSanta-Martinez, Emmanuel1 aHeimpel, George E.0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2016 June, v. 10, no. 3 p.249-261dSpringer Netherlandsx1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-016-9430-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008200170300001400252520208900266592002802355650002002383650001402403650001502417650001902432650001302451650002602464650003002490650001602520650001202536650001502548650001902563650001402582650001202596650002002608650000902628650002602637650001902663650003002682653001002712653002302722653001102745653001402756653001802770653001402788700001802802700002302820773007302843856008402916852000903000655001203009IND60529777920221122011030.0170208e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052977792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2016.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Debasis10aTripping on TRIB3 at the junction of health, metabolic dysfunction and cancer  ap. 34-52.  aMetabolic diseases like obesity, atherosclerosis and diabetes are frequently associated with increased risk of aggressive cancers. Although metabolic dysfunctions in normal cells are manifested due to defective signaling networks that control cellular homeostasis, malignant cells utilize these signaling networks for their increased survival, growth and metastasis. Despite decades of research, a common mechanistic link between these chronic pathologies is still not well delineated. Evidences show that the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathways are often dysregulated in both metabolic diseases and cancer. The UPR also triggers coordinated signaling with both PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Autophagy pathways in order to promote stress-adaptive mechanisms. Whereas, uncontrolled UPR and the resultant ERS escalates cells towards metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately cell death. In this review, we will discuss findings that implicate a crucial role for the multifunctional ERS-induced protein, TRIB3. The ‘pseudokinase’ function of TRIB3 facilitates the inactivation of multiple transcription factors and signaling proteins. The MEK1 binding domain of TRIB3 enables it to deactivate multiple MAP-kinases. In addition, the COP1 motif of TRIB3 assists ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of numerous TRIB3 associated proteins. The most well studied action of TRIB3 has been on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, where TRIB3-mediated inhibition of AKT phosphorylation decreases insulin signaling and cell survival. Conversely, cancer cells can either upregulate the AKT survival pathway by suppressing TRIB3 expression or alter TRIB3 localization to degrade differentiation inducing nuclear transcription factors such as C/EBPα and PPARγ. The gain-of-function Q84R polymorphism in TRIB3 is associated with increased risk of diabetes and atherosclerosis. TRIB3 acts as a crucial ‘stress adjusting switch’ that links homeostasis, metabolic disease and cancer; and is being actively investigated as a disease biomarker and therapeutic target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3aautophagy 3abiomarkers 3acell viability 3adiabetes 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3again-of-function mutation 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3aphosphorylation 3arisk 3atranscription factors 3aubiquitination 3aunfolded protein response 0aTRIB3 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aCancer 0aER-stress 0aPI3K/AKT/mTOR 0aAutophagy1 aMathur, Aditi1 aChandra, Partha K.0 tBiochimie.g2016 May, v. 124 p.34-52dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2016.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245010100212300001800313506007600331520213100407592002802538506003702566650001502603650002202618650001602640650001302656650002002669650002102689650000802710650001602718650001302734653000802747653000802755653002002763653001602783700002302799700001802822700002302840700002902863700001602892700003102908700002202939700006102961773009903022856008603121852000903207655001203216IND60633811320221207083453.0200210e20190424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063381132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.03.0342doi7 aPMC68630432pmcid7 a309404852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, Ligia A.10aOral and systemic HPV antibody kinetics post-vaccination among HIV-positive and HIV-negative men  ap. 2502-2510.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuration and functional aspects of the oral and systemic antibody responses following HPV vaccination in HIV-negative (HIV⁻) and HIV-positive (HIV⁺) men are not well characterized. Oral and systemic HPV-16 and HPV-18-specific antibody levels were evaluated over 18-months of follow-up, in HIV⁺ and HIV⁻ men. Sera and oral gargles from 147 HIV⁻ men, ages 27–45 and 75 HIV⁺ men, ages 22–61, who received 3-doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine were tested for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies at Day 1, Month 7 (1 month post-dose 3), and Month 18 (12 months post-dose 3) and HPV avidity (Day 1, and Month 7) using L1-VLP ELISA.All individuals seroconverted, regardless of HIV-status, following 3-doses of vaccine for HPV-16 and HPV-18. Serum HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody geometric mean levels were >2-fold lower in HIV⁺ compared to HIV⁻ men at Month 7 (HPV-16: 808.5 versus 2119.8 EU/mL, and HPV-18: 285.8 versus 611.6 EU/mL, p < 0.001) but not significantly different at Month 18 (HPV-16: 281.8 versus 359.7 EU/mL, p = 0.145, and HPV-18: 120.2 versus 93.4 EU/mL, p = 0.372). Post-vaccination, only oral HPV-16 antibody levels at Month 7 were significantly different between HIV⁺ and HIV⁻ men (127.7 versus 177.1 EU/mg of IgG, p = 0.008). Among baseline HPV-seronegative men, circulating levels of HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies were up to >3 fold lower in HIV⁺ men, at Months 7 and 18. In contrast, levels of HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies after vaccination were not inferior in baseline HPV-seropositive, HIV⁺ men. HPV-16 and HPV-18 avidity was lower among HIV⁺ compared to HIV⁻ men at Month 7 (HPV-16: 1.95 M versus 2.12 M, p = 0.027; HPV-18: 1.50 M versus 1.72 M, p < 0.001).Although differences in peak antibody levels were observed between HIV⁺ and HIV⁻ men following 3 doses of vaccine, plateau antibody levels were overall comparable, and avidity was relatively high for both groups. These data indicate that the vaccine induced antibody affinity maturation in both HIV⁺ and HIV⁻ men and will likely result in long-term protective immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3aantibody affinity 3ablood serum 3ageometry 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amen 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aHPV 0aHIV 0aOral antibodies 0aHPV vaccine1 aWilkin, Timothy J.1 aKemp, Troy J.1 aAbrahamsen, Martha1 aIsaacs-Soriano, Kimberly1 aPan, Yuanji1 aWebster-Cyriaque, Jennifer1 aPalefsky, Joel M.1 aGiuliano, Anna R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5440-88590 tVaccine.g2019 Apr. 24, v. 37, no. 18 p.2502-2510dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245014000169300002000309520122800329592002801557650001501585650002201600650001401622650001601636650001201652650001701664650001801681650001101699650002901710650003201739650001301771650002101784650002901805650001401834650003801848650001801886650001901904653002401923653001801947653003001965653003801995653001502033700006302048700002402111700002102135700006102156773015002217856008002367852000902447655001202456IND60604230620180918000000.0180716e20171227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060423062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b046242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNain-Perez, Amalyn10aTailoring Natural Abenquines To Inhibit the Photosynthetic Electron Transport through Interaction with the D1 Protein in Photosystem II  ap. 11304-11311.  aAbenquines are natural N-acetylaminobenzoquinones bearing amino acid residues, which act as weak inhibitors of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Aiming to exploit the abenquine scaffold as a model for the synthesis of new herbicides targeting photosynthesis, 14 new analogues were prepared by replacing the amino acid residue with benzylamines and the acetyl with different acyl groups. The synthesis was accomplished in three steps with a 68–95% overall yield from readily available 2,5-dimethoxyaniline, acyl chlorides, and benzyl amines. Key steps include (i) acylation of the aniline, (ii) oxidation, and (iii) oxidative addition of the benzylamino moiety. The compounds were assayed for their activity as Hill inhibitors, under basal, uncoupled, or phosphorylating conditions, or excluding photosystem I. Four analogues showed high effectiveness (IC₅₀ = 0.1–0.4 μM), comparable with the commercial herbicide diuron (IC₅₀ = 0.3 μM). The data suggest that this class of compounds interfere at the reducing side of photosystem II, having protein D1 as the most probable target. Molecular docking studies with the plastoquinone binding site of Spinacia oleracea further strengthened this proposal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aD1 protein 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aacylation 3aamino acids 3aaniline 3abenzylamines 3abinding sites 3adiuron 3aelectron transport chain 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amoieties 3amolecular models 3aorganochlorine compounds 3aoxidation 3aphotosynthetic electron transport 3aphotosystem I 3aphotosystem II 0aabenquine analogues 0aaminoquinones 0aphotosynthesis inhibitors 0aphotosynthetic electron transport 0aherbicides1 aBarbosa, Luiz C.

In this study, a total of 62 GST family genes were identified in Pyrus bretschneideri genome, which were distributed across the 14 chromosomes and 8 scaffolds with an uneven distribution. They could be categorized into eight classes based on phylogenetic analysis, and WGD/segmental duplication mainly drove their expansion. The expression of PbrGSTs in ‘Yali’ pear fruit was tissue-specific. In accompany with superficial scald development was the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and loss of ascorbic acid (AsA) in the pericarp of ‘Yali’ pear. Of 47 PbrGSTs detected in the pericarp, the transcription of 25 members were enhanced upon the development of superficial scald, while three in dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) class were downregulated in association with lower DHAR activity. In combination with the results of the impact of 1-MCP and MHO fumigation on the expression profile of PbrGSTs, PbrDHAR1, PbrDHAR2 and PbrDHAR4 were selected as the candidate gene involved in superficial scald development.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aPyrus bretschneideri 3aascorbic acid 3achromosomes 3afumigation 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione transferase 3apears 3apericarp 3aphylogeny 3ascald diseases1 aQian, Ming1 aWang, Runze1 aWang, Li1 aZhang, Shaoling0 tPlant growth regulation.g2018 Nov., v. 86, no. 2 p.211-222dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34166x0167-69037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-018-0422-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100003100169245008900200300001600289520151200305592002801817650002701845650001201872650001301884650001401897650001301911650001301924650001401937650002301951650002101974650002001995650001102015650001302026650002602039650002302065650001302088650002602101650001502127650003302142650003502175650002702210650004402237650004402281650004202325650003802367650003302405650005902438650002402497650001502521700002502536700002902561773010502590856008402695852000902779655001202788IND60113897420221120092432.0141112e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011389742DNAL7 a231275232pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelén Fernández, María,10aDEVDase activity is induced in potato leaves during Phytophthora infestans infection  ap. 197-203.  aProgrammed cell death (PCD) occurs in plants, animals and several branches of unicellular eukaryotes as a part of developmental and/or defense processes. Caspase proteases are universal mediators of animal apoptosis, a type of PCD. In plants, there are not animal caspase homologs; therefore, the characterization of caspase-like activities is of considerable importance to our understanding of PCD in plants. Here we report for the first time the involvement of caspase-3-like activity in the resistance mechanism of potato to Phytophthora infestans infection. We showed that disease development in infected potato leaves is dependent of caspase-3-like activity. Unlike plant DEVDases previously reported, this DEVDase activity was sensitive to the serine protease inhibitor PMSF. As reported for other subtilisin- like proteases with caspase activity, potato DEVDase activity was mainly localized in the apoplast. We demonstrated that in total protein extract DEVDase activity accounts for a 60% of serine proteases; however, this percentage increases to 100% in the apoplast. Additionally, this caspase-3-like activity is constitutively expressed in the apoplast of potato leaves. Total DEVDase activity is induced only in potato cultivars with high field resistance to P. infestans. These results show that potato caspase-3-like protease could constitute a tool in the potato defense mechanisms resulting in partial resistance, although further assays would be necessary in order to elucidate its role.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aanimals 3aapoplast 3aapoptosis 3abranches 3acaspases 3acultivars 3adefense mechanisms 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3aleaves 3apotatoes 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aserine proteinases 2aBreeding 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCell Death 2aDisease Resistancexgenetics 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPhytophthora infestans 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtease Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aSerine Proteasesxmetabolism 2aSolanum tuberosumxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSubtilisin1 aDaleo, Gustavo Raúl1 aGuevara, María Gabriela0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Dec., v. 61 p.197-203dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011400157300002000271520102600291592002801317650001301345650001201358650001201370650002001382653002101402653001701423653001101440653001201451700001401463700001901477700001501496700001401511773012601525856007501651852000901726655001201735IND60527521320221117095419.0160715e20131023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052752132DNAL7 a10.1021/am40296792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hongxia10aRobust, Superamphiphobic Fabric with Multiple Self-Healing Ability against Both Physical and Chemical Damages  ap. 10221-10226.  aSuperamphiphobic coatings with excellent repellency to low surface tension liquids and multiple self-healing abilities are very useful for practical applications, but remain challenging to realize. Previous papers on self-healing superamphiphobic coatings have demonstrated limited liquid repellency with single self-healing ability against either physical or chemical damage. Herein, we describe a superamphiphobic fabric that has remarkable multi-self-healing ability against both physical and chemical damages. The superamphiphobicity was prepared by a two-step surface coating technique. Fabric after coating treatment showed exceptional liquid-repellency to low surface tension liquids including ethanol. The fabric coating was also durable to withstand 200 cycles of laundries and 5000 cycles of Martindale abrasion without apparently changing the superamphiphobicity. This highly robust, superamphiphobic fabric may find applications for the development of “smart” functional textiles for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3aethanol 3afabrics 3asurface tension 0asuperamphiphobic 0aself-healing 0afabric 0acoating1 aZhou, Hua1 aGestos, Adrian1 aFang, Jian1 aLin, Tong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Oct. 23, v. 5, no. 20 p.10221-10226dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40296793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011200159300001400271500001900285520131900304592002801623650002101651650001301672650001601685650002101701650001301722650001301735650001701748650001601765650003301781650001501814651001001829653002201839653001401861653002301875653001701898700001701915700001801932700001601950700001601966700001701982700001801999700001502017773017602032856007802208852000902286655001202295IND60728280020221118225558.0210219e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072828002DNAL7 a10.21273/JASHS04956-202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenwen10aKaryotypic Characteristics and Genetic Relationships of Apricot Accessions from Different Ecological Groups  ap. 68-76.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study aims to reveal the karyotypic characteristics and genetic relationships of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) accessions from different ecological groups. Fourteen, 9, and 30 accessions from the Central Asian ecological group, North China ecological group, and Dzhungar-Ili ecological group, respectively, were analyzed according to the conventional pressing plate method. The results showed that all the apricot accessions from the different ecological groups were diploid (2n = 2x = 16). The total haploid length of the chromosome set of the selected accessions ranged from 8.11 to 12.75 μm, which was a small chromosome, and no satellite chromosomes were detected. All accessions had different numbers of median-centromere chromosomes or sub-median-centromere chromosomes. The karyotypes of the selected accessions were classified as 1A or 2A. Principal component analysis revealed that the long-arm/short-arm ratio (0.968) and the karyotype symmetry index (−0.979) were the most valuable parameters, and cluster analysis revealed that the accessions from the Central Asian ecological group and Dzhungar-Ili ecological group clustered together. In terms of karyotypic characteristics, the accessions from the Dzhungar-Ili ecological group and Central Asian ecological group were closely related.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aapricots 3achromosomes 3acluster analysis 3adiploidy 3ahaploidy 3ahorticulture 3akaryotyping 3aprincipal component analysis 3asatellites 3aChina 0achromosome number 0adiversity 0akaryotype analysis 0aP. armeniaca1 aLiu, Liqiang1 aZhou, Weiquan1 aWang, Yanan1 aDing, Xiang1 aFan, Guoquan1 aZhang, Shikui1 aLiao, Kang0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2021 Jan., v. 146, no. 1 p.68-76dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl27747x2327-97887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS04956-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245016000163300001600323520121100339592002801550650002101578650001901599650001401618650002301632650002301655650001301678650001301691650002101704650002101725650001301746650001201759650001601771650000901787700002001796700002301816700001901839700002101858773009401879856007401973852000902047655001202056IND60132970620221119093739.0150513e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013297062DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.274972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying‐Ying10aEfficient solvent‐free alternating copolymerization of CO2 with 1, 2‐epoxydodecane and terpolymerization with styrene oxide via heterogeneous catalysis  ap. 737-744.  aThe alternating copolymerization of CO₂with the terminated epoxides anchoring long alkyl groups is rarely reported because of their low reactivity and polycarbonate selectivity. This work describes a well‐controlled solvent‐free copolymerization of CO₂with 1, 2‐epoxydodecane (EDD) with a long electron‐donating alkyl group via the catalysis of Zn‐Co(III) double metal cyanide complex catalyst. The productivity of the catalyst was up to 2406 g polymer/g Zn, that is, EDD conversion was 99.2%. The alternating degree of CO₂‐EDD copolymers were more than 99% and had high number‐average molecular weights (Mₙs) of >100 kg mol⁻¹, while only 1.0 wt % 4‐decyl‐1,3‐dioxolan‐2‐one (DC) were detected. Moreover, by introducing styrene oxide (SO) with electron‐withdrawing phenyl group into EDD‐CO₂copolymerization system, a new random terpolymer with either electron‐withdrawing or electron‐donating side groups was produced with single glass transition temperatures (Tgs) in a wide range from 3 to 56 °C, which might be potentially used as biodegradable elastomers or plastics. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Currently, this process is performed by visual inspection, suffering from subjective gathers that limit reliability. To automate this process, we propose the use of image processing techniques, specifically of local binary pattern (LBP) statistics. Such statistics are tolerant against illumination changes, can be easily implemented, and perform well when combined with a symmetrized adaptation of the Kullback—Leibler divergence. As a main innovation, we extend the existing rotationally invariant LBPs by including ‘mirror’ and ‘complement’ invariants. We show an accurately improved and more reliable estimation of the degree of wear in worn carpets. The evaluation is performed on four digital reference scales, each containing eight pairs of images comparing transitional degrees of wear to the original appearance. Additionally, the texture changes due to distortions of the pile yarn tufts are enhanced by choosing a suitable scale factor per reference. We validate the findings using six physical reference scales, each containing four pairs of images. In both references, linear correlations of over 0.89 are demonstrated between the degrees of wear and extracted features from the images. These findings justify the use of the proposed LBP extensions in a first approach towards an automated low-cost inspection system for carpet wear at low computation cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3afabrics 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3astatistics 3atextile fibers 3atexture 3ayarns 0aCarpet wear 0aimage processing 0alocal binary pattern 0atexture inspection1 aVansteenkiste, Ewout1 aRooms, Filip1 aDe Meulemeester, Simon1 aKeyser, Robin1 aPhilips, Wilfried0 tTextile research journal.g2010 Dec., v. 80, no. 20 p.2132-2143dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175103801103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245009100208300001600299520156700315592002801882650001301910650001301923650001601936650001501952650001301967650002201980650000902002650001102011650000702022650001502029650002002044650001302064650001502077653002302092653002102115653002102136653003202157700001802189700001902207700001402226700002002240773008702260856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60526156520221123022155.0190403e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052615652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2016.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntoniadis, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8820-493410aEffect of soils with varying degree of weathering and pH values on phosphorus sorption  ap. 214-219.  aVarious soil properties are known to influence P retention, but it is not clear which of them are predominant when soils of different degree of weathering are compared, and which when newly developed soils differ mainly in activity (pH). We chose 23 typical Mediterranean low organic matter-content soils: 13 of them differed in weathering (4 Alfisols, 4 Entisols, and 5 Inceptisols), and 10 were newly developed Entisols, of which 5 were acidic and 5 alkaline. We conducted batch P sorption tests at C0=0–100mgL−1, measured important soil physico-chemical properties, and correlated them with sorption indices. Alfisols were significantly higher in total “free” Al and Fe, as well as in well-crystalline oxides, and this led to higher P sorption by Alfisols. Correlation analyses in the activity-divided soils revealed that amorphous oxides, although significantly higher in the acidic soils compared to the calcaric, did not have any influence in P sorption, neither did any other oxides species, while CaCO3, along with pH, were the important factors to enhanced P retention. Contrary to that, in the taxonomy-divided soils, neither pH nor CaCO3 played any significant role in P sorption, which was rather influenced by oxides (mainly the amorphous, but to a lesser degree by the crystalline species as well). We conclude that oxides are the key soil property influencing P sorption among soils of different weathering (even if these soils also differ in pH and CaCO3), while within the same taxonomic order, CaCO3 and pH becomes the important factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aEntisols 3aInceptisols 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3acalcium carbonate 3airon 3aoxides 3apH 3aphosphorus 3asoil properties 3asorption 3aweathering 0aCrystalline oxides 0aAmorphous oxides 0aSorption maximum 0aPhosphorus saturation index1 aKoliniati, R.1 aEfstratiou, E.1 aGolia, E.1 aPetropoulos, S.0 tCatena.g2016 Apr., v. 139 p.214-219dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018000166300001200346520097200358592002801330650001301358650001701371650002101388650001101409650001501420650001501435650002401450650002301474650002501497650001601522700001801538700001701556773011401573856008101687852000901768655001201777IND60520117320221121033005.0171213e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052011732DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5650-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yongcheol10aDevelopment of a novel method to monitor the temporal change in the location of the freshwater–saltwater interface and time series models for the prediction of the interface  ap. 882.  aThe monitoring and prediction of temporal change in the location of the freshwater–saltwater interface including the groundwater level (GWL) is the essential information for effective management of coastal aquifer, especially for managing the saltwater intrusion. A simple and novel method for monitoring temporal change in the location of the freshwater–saltwater interface was developed and evaluated by applying to a coastal aquifer in Jeju Island, resulted in obtaining time series data of the freshwater–saltwater interface level (FSL) successfully. And applicability of artificial neural network-based time series models to prediction of the GWL and the FSL is evaluated using the observed data from the site. The prediction result shows that the input configuration including autoregressive components enhances the model performance and the recursive prediction models can be useful for the long-term prediction of the GWL and the FSL in this case study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3asaltwater intrusion 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3awater table1 aYoon, Heesung1 aKim, Gee-Pyo0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 May, v. 75, no. 10 p.882-882dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5650-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002500136245011100161300001600272500001500288520165500303592002801958650001201986650001501998650001102013650001802024650001102042650002202053650002302075650001302098650002702111650001402138651001502152653001602167653001002183700001702193700001902210773010302229856003902332852000902371655001202380IND4475410220221122000912.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447541022DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.12182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogers‐Bennett, L.10aStatus and habitat associations of the threatened northern abalone: importance of kelp and coralline algae  ap. 573-581.  a2019-12-06  aNorthern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana kamtschatkana) is a federally listed species of concern. The status of northern abalone and the characteristics of the habitats they associate with were determined showing that northern abalone have declined dramatically in Washington State with present day abundances <10% of those found in 1979. Northern abalone inhabited kelp beds (Nereocystis luetkeana), more than red sea urchin beds (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) (X2 = 16, d.f. = 1, P < 0.01) or habitats with both kelp and sea urchins (X2 = 13.2, d.f. = 1, P < 0.01). Sites with Nereocystis kelp canopy had twice the percentage cover of encrusting coralline algae compared with sea urchin sites. No juvenile abalone (<75 mm) were found in any of the habitat types raising concerns about recruitment failure. Abalone co‐occurred with other molluscs including limpets and scallops. Kelp holdfast microhabitats had significantly higher species richness (t = 2.2, d.f. = 6, P < 0.05), twice the effective number of species and 5x more individuals than sea urchin spine microhabitats. In laboratory choice experiments, juvenile abalone (20 mm) preferred coralline rocks to kelp holdfasts or sea urchin spine canopy. The small snail, Amphissa spp. (5–15 mm) was more abundant inside kelp holdfasts than under sea urchins or in rock cobble, suggesting this may be an important microhabitat. It is recommended that kelp beds with abundant coralline substrate be used for restoration including stocking juveniles and adult aggregations as this biogenic habitat may enhance northern abalone restoration actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabalone 3amacroalgae 3acanopy 3amicrohabitats 3asnails 3aspecies diversity 3aStrongylocentrotus 3ascallops 3aHaliotis kamtschatkana 3ajuveniles 0aWashington 0arecruitment 0aAlgae1 aAllen, B.

An Aridic Calciustolls with high urease activity was subjected to a variety of initial soil moisture contents, rainfall patterns, wind speeds, air-humidity, and urea application methods. Losses of broadcast urea-N in the greenhouse at 42-d harvest, presumably due to NH₃ volatilization, were reduced from 40% with a first rain of 1 cm (7 d after fertilizer application) to 13% with a first rain of 4 cm. Nitrogen losses were increased by 8% when initial soil moisture was increased from 21% (≅ permanent wilting point or PWP) to 31%. Wind tunnel experiments verified that nitrogen can be conserved either by heavy initial rain events (showing no NH₃ volatilization with application of 2.5 cm rain immediately after urea application) or by banding of urea at a depth of 2.5 cm. Losses were maximized by maintaining adequate moisture in the topsoil for urea hydrolysis without inducing leaching, either by humidifying the air between 80 and 95% or by applications of 8 mm rain every 3 d.

Oyster density at six control sites located in nearby National Parks unaffected by boating and stormwater discharges were compared to 17 study sites widely distributed within Sydney estuary. No oyster populations were evident in Sydney estuary in 1989; however, by 1994 oysters had colonised areas of the lower and central estuary and by 2002 densities were statistically similar to control sites. The timing of estuary-wide increases in oyster abundance suggests that the partial banning of tributyltin in 1989 for vessels under 25 m long may have played a major role in the increase of S. glomerata in this estuary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccostrea glomerata 3aboating 3aestuaries 3anational parks 3aoysters 3astormwater 3asurveys 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEstuaries 2aOstreidaexgrowth & development 2aPopulation Density 2aWater Pollutionxlegislation & jurisprudencexprevention & control. 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0aNew South Wales1 aScammell, M.

Phormidium foveolarum and Nostoc muscorum under copper (2 and 5μM) toxicity after 24 and 72h of experiments. Cu at 2 and 5μM and UV-BH irradiation decreased growth in both the organisms and the effect was more pronounced in N. muscorum. Superoxide radical (SOR) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) productions were significantly enhanced by Cu and UV-BH which was accompanied by accelerated lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde; MDA) and protein oxidation (reactive carbonyl groups; RCG). The components of AsA–GSH cycle, i.e. ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascobate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) activities as well as total ascorbate and glutathione contents and their reduced/oxidized ratios were decreased considerably by Cu and UV-BH. Further, combined treatments of Cu and UV-BH exacerbated damaging effects in both the cyanobacteria. Unlike UV-BH, UV-BL irradiation rather than damaging cyanobacteria caused alleviation in Cu-induced toxicity by down-regulating the levels of SOR, H₂O₂, MDA and RCG due to enhanced activity of APX, GR, MDHAR and DHAR, and contents of ascorbate and glutathione. Results revealed that UV-B radiation at low fluence rate (UV-BL) stimulated protective responses in both the organisms under Cu toxicity while UV-BH irradiation caused damage alone as well as together with Cu, and the components of AsA–GSH cycle play significant role in these responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc muscorum 3aPhormidium foveolarum 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acopper 3aglutathione 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airradiation 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3asuperoxide anion 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aCyanobacteriaxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aDown-Regulation 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidationxradiation effects 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aNostocxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidative Stressxradiation effects 2aProtein Carbonylationxradiation effects 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aSrivastava, Prabhat Kumar1 aPrasad, Sheo Mohan0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Dec., v. 61 p.61-70dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245007700165300001600242500001900258520139300277592002801670650001301698650001501711650001101726650001201737650001301749650001501762650001501777650002601792650002001818650001301838650001501851650001301866650001901879650001701898650001501915650002601930651001801956653002801974653001202002653001902014700002202033700001902055700002402074700002102098700001602119700002102135700002002156700001902176700002102195700002102216700002202237773010202259856007102361852000902432655001202441IND60728280820221118225805.0210219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072828082DNAL7 a10.1071/SR200232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Langenhove, Leandro10aSoil nutrient variation along a shallow catena in Paracou, French Guiana  ap. 130-145.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTropical forests are generally considered to stand upon nutrient-poor soils, but soil nutrient concentrations and availabilities can vary greatly at local scale due to topographic effects on erosion and water drainage. In this study we physically and chemically characterised the soils of 12 study plots situated along a catena with a shallow slope in a tropical rainforest in French Guiana both during the wet and the dry season to evaluate seasonal differences. Soils along the catena were all Acrisols, but differed strongly in their water drainage flux. Over time, this differential drainage has led to differences in soil texture and mineral composition, affecting the adsorption of various nutrients, most importantly phosphorus. The more clayey soils situated on the slope of the catena had higher total concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and several micronutrients, while extractable nutrient concentrations were highest in the sandiest soils situated at the bottom of the catena. We found that carbon, nitrogen and extractable nutrients all varied seasonally, especially in the surface soil layer. These results are interesting because they show that, even at the local scale, small differences in topography can lead to large heterogeneity in nutrient concentrations, which can have large impacts on plant and microbial community organisation at the landscape level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrisols 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acatenas 3adrainage 3adry season 3alandscapes 3amicrobial communities 3amineral content 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aresearch 3asoil nutrients 3asoil texture 3atopography 3atropical rain forests 3aFrench Guiana 0alowland tropical forest 0aParacou 0awater drainage1 aVerryckt, Lore T.1 aStahl, Clement1 aCourtois, Elodie A.1 aUrbina, Ifigenia1 aGrau, Oriol1 aAsensio, Dolores1 aPeguero, Guille1 aMargalef, Olga1 aFreycon, Vincent1 aPeñuelas, Josep1 aJanssens, Ivan A.0 tSoil research.g2021, v. 59, no. 2 p.130-145dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl44751x1838-675X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR200233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245012300170300001500293520104200308592002801350650001801378650001101396650003201407650001601439650001701455651001001472653001601482653003101498653003601529653002401565653002001589700001601609700001801625700002001643773009301663856008901756852000901845655001201854IND60633812320221119134221.0190830e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063381232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Qingye10aPublic private partnership in brownfield remediation projects in China: Identification and structure analysis of risks  ap. 87-104.  aA novel systematic procedure is designed for analyzing risks within a public private partnership (PPP) approach for addressing brownfield remediation problems in China. More specifically in this research, original risk factors are first obtained from the existing literature. To reflect the unique situation in China, a Delphi Method is utilized to appropriately revise the definitions of the risks, merge similar risks and add new risks overlooked in the literature. Then, an interpretative structural model (ISM) is used to design a hierarchical structural graph for reflecting the interrelationships of these risks. Additionally, based on the “impact matrix cross-reference multiplication applied to a classification” (MICMAC) analysis, the risks are sorted into four clusters depending on their driver and dependence powers to show the relationship level of risks. Lastly, nine key risks are determined considering both the findings of ISM and MICMAC analysis, and several implications are put forward for the Chinese government.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphi method 3amodels 3apublic-private partnerships 3aremediation 3arisk factors 3aChina 0aBrownfields 0aPublic private partnership 0aInterpretative structural model 0aRisk identification 0aDecision making1 aZhu, Yuming1 aKe, Ginger Y.1 aHipel, Keith W.0 tLand use policy.g2019 May, v. 84 p.87-104dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.01.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245010400183300001400287520137300301592002801674650003001702650002301732650000801755650001401763650001801777650001101795650001801806650001501824650001201839650001301851650001501864650001601879650002101895650004001916650001301956650002701969650001801996650007502014650006802089650002002157650002002177650003102197650001302228650003602241650004102277700001902318700002002337700002202357773010302379856008402482852000902566655001202575IND60113898220221122002232.0141112e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011389822DNAL7 a230855842pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Shuo10aNeutral lipid accumulation at elevated temperature in conditional mutants of two microalgae species  ap. 71-79.  aTriacylglycerols, an energy storage compound in microalgae, are known to be accumulated after nitrogen starvation of microalgae cells. Microalgae could be of importance for future biodiesel production due to their fast growth rate and high oil content. In collections of temperature sensitive mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella vulgaris, nine out of fourty-one mutants in C. reinhardtii and eleven out of fifty-three mutants in C. vulgaris contained increased amounts of neutral lipids, predominantly as triacylglycerols. Upon temperature induced cell-cycle arrest, these mutants showed enlarged cellular volume compared with the wild type. The C. reinhardtii mutants were analyzed further and one type of mutants displayed a shift in lipid composition from polar membrane lipids to neutral lipids after a temperature up-shift, while the second type of mutants accumulated more total lipid per cell, predominantly as neutral lipids as compared with the wild type. Three C. reinhardtii mutants were analyzed further and found to be arrested after DNA synthesis but prior to cell division in the cell cycle. These mutants will be useful in order to further understand neutral lipid accumulation in microalgae and suggest possibilities for biodiesel production by specific induction of lipid accumulation in miroalgal cultures by cell-cycle inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aDNA 3abiodiesel 3acell division 3aenergy 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3amutants 3anitrogen 3astarvation 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aBiofuels 2aCell Cycle Checkpoints 2aCell Division 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aChlorella vulgarisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aHot Temperature 2aLipid Metabolismxgenetics 2aMutation 2aStress, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aTriglyceridesxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aBrandt, Anders1 aEgsgaard, Helge1 aGjermansen, Claes0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Dec., v. 61 p.71-79dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013900164300001400303520164600317592002801963650003501991650001402026650001102040650002402051650001302075650001702088650000902105650002402114653004302138653003402181653004202215653001502257653002102272700001602293700001702309700001502326773010302341856008602444852000902530655001202539IND60566286320221121224726.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056628632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.03.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ming10aEstimation of representative elementary volume for DNAPL saturation and DNAPL-water interfacial areas in 2D heterogeneous porous media  ap. 12-26.  aRepresentative elementary volume (REV) is important to determine properties of porous media and those involved in migration of contaminants especially dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in subsurface environment. In this study, an experiment of long-term migration of the commonly used DNAPL, perchloroethylene (PCE), is performed in a two dimensional (2D) sandbox where several system variables including porosity, PCE saturation (Soil) and PCE-water interfacial area (AOW) are accurately quantified by light transmission techniques over the entire PCE migration process. Moreover, the REVs for these system variables are estimated by a criterion of relative gradient error (εgi) and results indicate that the frequency of minimum porosity-REV size closely follows a Gaussian distribution in the range of 2.0mm and 8.0mm. As experiment proceeds in PCE infiltration process, the frequency and cumulative frequency of both minimum Soil-REV and minimum AOW-REV sizes change their shapes from the irregular and random to the regular and smooth. When experiment comes into redistribution process, the cumulative frequency of minimum Soil-REV size reveals a linear positive correlation, while frequency of minimum AOW-REV size tends to a Gaussian distribution in the range of 2.0mm–7.0mm and appears a peak value in 13.0mm–14.0mm. Undoubtedly, this study will facilitate the quantification of REVs for materials and fluid properties in a rapid, handy and economical manner, which helps enhance our understanding of porous media and DNAPL properties at micro scale, as well as the accuracy of DNAPL contamination modeling at field-scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3adense nonaqueous phase liquids 3ahydrology 3amodels 3anormal distribution 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asoil 3atetrachloroethylene 0aRepresentative elementary volume (REV) 0aLight transmission techniques 0aDense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) 0aSaturation 0aInterfacial area1 aCheng, Zhou1 aWu, Jianfeng1 aWu, Jichun0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 June, v. 549 p.12-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.03.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013000163300001600293520126700309592002801576650002301604650001001627650001401637650001101651650001301662650001301675650001201688650001001700650000901710650001501719650001901734650001701753650001501770651001401785700001701799700002601816700001901842700002301861773009101884856004801975852000902023655001202032IND50059906720221116140625.0121102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005990672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-012-0247-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkin, Karen10aLinking bird species traits to vegetation characteristics in a future urban development zone: implications for urban planning  ap. 961-977.  aIdentifying the relationships between species traits and patch-scale vegetation characteristics in areas designated for urban development can improve our understanding of how animal communities may change with urbanization. We explored the implications of this premise to the urban planning process in a mixed-use landscape in Canberra (Australia), prior to its development into new suburbs. We used RLQ analysis to relate bird foraging, nesting and body size traits to patch-scale vegetation characteristics. Relationships between species traits and vegetation characteristics within the development zone suggest that species that forage and nest on the ground and in the understory strata, and smaller-bodied species will be most negatively affected by urbanization. Identifying the relationships between species traits and vegetation characteristics may be used by urban planners to (i) identify potentially critical habitat and species at risk from development, (ii) inform the choice of impact mitigation measures, and/or (iii) distinguish between high and low mitigation measures. Analyses conducted early in the planning process can then be used to allocate proposed land uses in an ecologically sensitive way, and to plan appropriate mitigation measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal communities 3abirds 3abody size 3aforage 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3anesting 3anests 3arisk 3aunderstory 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3avegetation 3aAustralia1 aKnight, Emma1 aLindenmayer, David B.1 aFischer, Joern1 aManning, Adrian D.0 tUrban ecosystems.g2012 Dec., v. 15, no. 4 p.961-977dSpringer-Verlagx1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-012-0247-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009800172300001400270520128500284592002801569650000801597650001401605650002001619650000901639650001001648650001701658650002201675650001101697650001901708650002201727650001601749650001201765651002801777651001201805653001801817653001401835653003001849653000901879653003401888700001901922700002501941700001901966773014101985856008502126852000902211655001202220IND60591534620221116224211.0190415e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059153462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2018.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollerbach, Laura10aDetection dogs allow for systematic non-invasive collection of DNA samples from Eurasian lynx  ap. 42-46.  aAs Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) show signs of population recovery in parts of Central Europe, sound monitoring strategies are required to study population expansion, connectivity and genetic diversity. While non-invasive DNA sampling strategies could serve this task, genetic samples of lynx are generally hard to locate. To test the suitability of dog-based sampling we searched scat samples of lynx in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, with two trained detection dog teams. In 44 grid cells of 2 × 2 km, dog teams covered 440 km of predetermined forest road and hiking trail transects during the four week survey. A total of 169 collected samples resulted in 52 genetically confirmed lynx detections, of which 26 were assigned to 11 individuals. Using a single-season site occupancy model we found a detection probability of 0.13/km (SD = 0.02), with 10 km of dog search per grid cell required to get a 70 % probability to detect lynx presence. Our results show that detection dogs are an appropriate tool for systematic genetic lynx monitoring. We argue that detection dog-assisted genetic monitoring may supplement monitoring strategies based on conventional camera trapping, especially when aiming to monitor genetic diversity and population connectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aLynx lynx 3acamera trapping 3adogs 3afeces 3aforest roads 3agenetic variation 3amodels 3anational parks 3apopulation growth 3aprobability 3asurveys 3aCentral European region 3aGermany 0aDetection dog 0aLynx lynx 0aNon-invasive DNA sampling 0aScat 0aBavarian Forest National Park1 aHeurich, Marco1 aReiners, Tobias Erik1 aNowak, Carsten0 tMammalian biology =.g2018 May, v. 90 p.42-46dElsevier GmbHaDeutsche Gesellschaft für SäugetierkundewJournal:12403x1616-50477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2018.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245016200208520160200370592002801972650002902000650001502029650001202044650000902056650001502065650001002080650001302090650000902103650001302112650001802125650001602143650001002159650001602169650001602185653002902201653002402230653001902254700003302273700002902306700002902335700006002364700006802424700002102492700003102513700006102544700002402605773011802629856008302747852000902830655001202839IND60750585020221122105115.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075058502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2021.1018832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, Patrícia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9974-703710aEffects of infestations of the storage mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Acaridae) on the presence of fungal species and mycotoxin production in stored products  aThe storage mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) (Acari: Acaridae) is one of the most important pests of stored foods (cheese, corn, oats, wheat, soy etc.), and is found in heavy infestations. Mites can infest food that are stored under unsatisfactory sanitary conditions, which may also provide conditions for fungi growth, which indicates mite-fungus association. However, little is known about the influence of T. putrescentiae on mycotoxins production under different stored products over time. The main objective of the present study was to identify the fungal species present in oats, corn, and wheat flour associated with T. putrescentiae infestations, and evaluate mycotoxin production before and after six months storage with these infestations. Wheat, corn and oat grain samples were compared, and each crop was stored in six containers infested by T. putrescentiae. Three remaining containers were stored under the same temperature and humidity conditions without introducing the mites, which worked as control. We obtained 55 fungi isolates, and the majority were identified with 99% or 100% of identity and ≥97% of coverage with type strains of each fungal species. Mycotoxin concentrations analyzed from corn flour stored for six months decreased with and without T. putrescentiae (p < 0.05). Regarding mycotoxin concentration with T. putrescentiae, aflatoxin increased in oats (p < 0.05) while zearalenone decreased in wheat (p < 0.05). Our findings proved that T. putrescentiae could significantly induce mycotoxin production in stored products evaluated for six months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTyrophagus putrescentiae 3aaflatoxins 3acheeses 3acorn 3acorn flour 3afungi 3ahumidity 3aoats 3aresearch 3astorage mites 3atemperature 3awheat 3awheat flour 3azearalenone 0aFusarium verticillioides 0aFusarium gutifforme 0aDeoxynivalenol1 aLiberato da Silva, Guilherme1 aEsswein, Isadora Zanatta1 aDallazen, Maria Cristina1 aHeidrich, Daiane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1010-52151 aPagani, Danielle Machado1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0584-12581 aHoehne, Lucélia1 aScroferneker, Maria Lúcia1 aValente, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5374-09911 aFerla, Noeli Juarez0 tJournal of stored products research.g2021 Dec., v. 94 p.101883-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2021.1018833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010800177300001800285520188500303592002802188650001502216650002602231650001102257650001502268650001302283650001002296650001702306650001202323650001402335650001302349650001402362650001402376650001302390650001202403651001602415653003302431653002902464653003502493653003302528653003702561653001402598653002602612700002902638700002102667700001402688700002502702700002502727700002302752700002002775700003002795773009902825856008602924852000903010655001203019IND60570258420221116220407.0190319e20170724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057025842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVestjens, Stefan M.T.10aChanges in pathogens and pneumococcal serotypes causing community-acquired pneumonia in The Netherlands  ap. 4112-4118.  aIn 2006 a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the immunisation programme for infants in The Netherlands and replaced by PCV10 in 2011. Limited data exist about the impact of PCV on the aetiology of CAP as a whole. The aim of the present study is to describe the overall changes in microbial aetiology, pneumococcal burden (including non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia) and its serotypes in adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) after the introduction of these PCVs.Hospitalised adult CAP patients who participated in three consecutive trials were studied (2004–2006 (n=201), 2007–2009 (n=304) and 2012–2016 (n=300) and considered as pre-PCV7, PCV7 and PCV10 period). Extensive conventional microbiological testing was applied for all patients. In addition, patients with a serotype-specific pneumococcal antibody response were diagnosed with pneumococcal CAP. Changes in proportions of causative pathogens and distributions of pneumococcal serotypes were calculated.The proportion of pneumococcal CAP decreased from 37% (n=74/201) to 26% (n=77/300) comparing the pre-PCV7 period with the PCV10 period (p=0.01). For other pathogens, including Legionella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, and respiratory viruses, no sustained shifts were observed in their relative contribution to the aetiology of CAP. Within the pneumococcal CAP patients, we observed a decrease in PCV7 and an increase in non-PCV10 serotype disease. PCV10-extra type disease did not decrease significantly comparing the PCV10 period with the pre-PCV7 and PCV7 period, respectively. Notably, PCV7 type disease decreased both in bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic patients.Our findings confirm that PCV introduction in infants impact the microbial aetiology of adult CAP and suggest herd effects in adults with CAP after introduction of PCVs in children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella 3aMycoplasma pneumoniae 3aadults 3aantibodies 3achildren 3aherds 3aimmunization 3ainfants 3apathogens 3apatients 3apneumonia 3aserotypes 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aNetherlands 0aCommunity-acquired pneumonia 0aStreptococcus pneumoniae 0aPneumococcal conjugate vaccine 0aBacteraemic pneumococcal CAP 0aNon-bacteraemic pneumococcal CAP 0aSerotypes 0aMultiplex immunoassay1 aWagenvoort, Gertjan H.J.1 aGrutters, Jan C.1 aMeek, Bob1 aAldenkamp, Arnoud F.1 aVlaminckx, Bart J.M.1 aBos, Willem Jan W.1 aRijkers, Ger T.1 avan de Garde, Ewoudt M.W.0 tVaccine.g2017 July 24, v. 35, no. 33 p.4112-4118dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014300164300001600307520145300323592002801776596005101804650002201855650001701877650001101894650001401905650000901919650002001928650001301948650001601961650002501977650002102002651001002023700001902033700001802052700001702070700005402087773013702141856008302278852000902361655001202370IND60726125320221119045903.0220220e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072612532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-020-00684-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Tong10aSpatiotemporal distribution, risk assessment and source appointment of metal(loid)s in water and sediments of Danjiangkou Reservoir, China  ap. 139-152.  aDanjiangkou Reservoir is the biggest artificial reservoir in China. But spatiotemporal distribution and risks of metal(loid)s in it were still unclear after the operation of Middle Route of South-to-North Water Diversion Project. In this study, distribution pattern of fifteen metal(loid)s in the Danjiangkou Reservoir was investigated. It was shown that metal(loid)s concentrations in the water were much lower than the drinking water quality standards in China, while Sb, Co, Cd and Cr were identified as the major pollutants in the sediments. Environment–metal(loid)s correlation analysis revealed total organic carbon, sulfate, temperature, dissolved oxygen and total phosphorus markedly controlled metal(loid)s distribution in the water, while organic carbon, total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen shaped their distribution in the sediments. Results of risk assessment further revealed that the sediments of Danjiangkou Reservoir were minor to moderate polluted, and Sb, Cd exhibited the highest potential ecological risk. Additionally, source identification showed agricultural activities (25.3%), industrial and mining activities (17.5%) and natural processes (57.2%) were the dominant sources of metal(loid)s burden in the sediments. Overall, the results are of significance to understanding the ecological risk and pollution sources in the Danjiangkou Reservoir, which is essential for the effective management of metal(loid)s pollution.  aPublisher supplied data  a51539001cNational Science Foundation of China 3aammonium nitrogen 3ageochemistry 3aoxygen 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asulfates 3atemperature 3atotal organic carbon 3atotal phosphorus 3aChina1 aDang, Chenyuan1 aZhong, Sining1 aSun, Weiling1 aChen, Qian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9037-22080 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2021 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.139-152dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870049x0269-40427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-020-00684-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03872naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245012000167300001600287520221000303592002802513650002702541650001502568650001502583650002302598650002302621650001202644650002102656650001702677650001702694650001202711650001002723650001602733650001502749650001802764650001702782650002802799650002102827650001702848650001402865650001702879650001202896650001802908650001002926651001102936653002702947653002102974653003202995653001203027700003003039700002203069773011703091856007703208852000903285655001203294IND60519991620221119093009.0160512e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051999162DNAL7 a10.1515/ffp-2015-00212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSierpińska, Alicja10aBeauveria brongniartii Sacc. (Petch) against Melolontha spp. white grubs in forest nurseries with different soil pH  ap. 210-217.  aIn 2011, the General Directorate of State Forests in Poland managed 669 forest nurseries on the total area of 2411 ha that produced forest tree seedlings bare root systems, hence vulnerable to Melolontha spp. white grubs. Up to date, no chemical or biological plant protection product for control of cockchafer grubs in forests has been registered in Poland. The study was carried out with the aim to evaluate the efficacy of a biocontrol product Bovecol with BP strain of Beauveria brongniartii on sterilized wheat grain in control of Melolontha spp. white grubs in forest nurseries, established on acidic soils (with pH analogous to that of forest soils) as well as on those alkaline. The active substance of Bovecol was 10⁸ fungal conidia per 1g of the product. Study plots were established in 3 bareroot nurseries, situated in the areas with different soil reaction values and abundant populations of Melolontha spp. white grubs (assessed before Bovecol treatments). The product was applied against L₁ larvae (rates in the Czerniawka and Bałtów nurseries: 120 kg/ha and 240 kg/ha) and against L₂ larvae (the Iłki nursery: 240 kg/ha). Grub population numbers were assessed 2, 3 and 4 months after the treatments. Application of Bovecol against L₁ into the soil with neutral reaction (pH 6.8) caused the reduction of white grub numbers in 2 months, down to the threshold recommended by the Instruction of the protection of forests (mandatory guidelines for the protection of Poland’s State Forests), i.e. less than 1 grub/sampling pit. Bovecol treatment against L₁ cockchafer larvae into acidic soil (pH 4.8) had no statistically significant effect on the reduction of grub population numbers, even 4 months after product application. Bovecol treatment against L₂ larvae applied into the soil with medium pH value (5.3) gave poorer results when compared to the soil with pH 6.8, but considerably better – when compared to the soil with pH 4.8. The selection of a fungal strain with insecticidal properties against soil insect pests should include the evaluation of strain requirements with regard to soil pH range – optimal for germination, development and growth of a given strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria brongniartii 3aMelolontha 3aacid soils 3aactive ingredients 3abiological control 3aconidia 3aforest nurseries 3aforest soils 3aforest trees 3aforests 3afungi 3agermination 3aguidelines 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticidal properties 3aplant protection 3aroot systems 3aseedlings 3asoil insects 3asoil pH 3astate forests 3awheat 3aPoland 0aBeauveria brongniartii 0aforest nurseries 0aMelolontha spp. white grubs 0asoil pH1 aPopowska-Nowak, Elżbieta1 aBednarek, Andrzej0 tFolia forestalia Polonica.g2016 Mar. 7, v. 57, no. 4 p.210-217dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:14917x2199-59077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ffp-2015-00213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012300163300001600286500000900302520166000311592002801971650002401999650002502023650001102048650001602059650001702075650001002092650002402102650004302126650002502169650001702194650002102211650001902232650001602251650002202267650001802289650001102307650001102318650001902329651001002348700001602358700001502374700001502389700001302404700001702417700001602434700001502450700001702465700001202482700001802494700001302512773013302525856008002658852000902738655001202747IND60663475420221122124707.0191122e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066347542DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2015.02312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhen X.10aDo Naturally Variegated Leaves have a High Photosynthetic Cost? The Case of Actinidia kolomikta (Rupr. & Maxim.) Maxim  ap. 407-414.  aepub  aThe photosynthetic performance of variegated leaves can be very important in the cultivation and management of variegated plants. Actinidia kolomikta (Rupr. & Maxim.) Maxim. leaves have striking color variation. To clarify the variegated leaf type and photosynthetic cost, we measured leaf structure and ultrastructure, spectral properties, chlorophyll fluorescence and net photosynthetic rate (Pn). The study was conducted in Jilin during spring, summer, and fall in 2013. Leaf anatomy and ultrastructure were observed with light and electron microscopy. Leaf reflectance and pigment content were measured with a Unispec spectrometer and high performance liquid chromatography. Photosynthetic characterization was performed with a photosynthesis system and plant efficiency analyzer. In the palisade tissue of variegated areas, intercellular spaces were found, and cells contained fewer and abnormally developed chloroplasts. Normal chloroplasts were distributed mostly in spongy tissue. The reflectance of the adaxial surface was higher in variegated leaves than in green leaves. The Pn of variegated leaves was 80 to 94% of green leaves, the maximum photosystem II efficiency of the adaxial and abaxial surfaces in variegated leaves was similar to green leaves, and the quantum use efficiency of the abaxial surface was higher than the adaxial surface in variegated leaves. These results show that the photosynthetic performance of variegated leaves was retained well. Thus, variegated leaves are not a limiting factor for cultivation and application in A. kolomikta, and do not need to be removed as parasitic leaves during cultivation and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinidia kolomikta 3aabnormal development 3aautumn 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3acolor 3aelectron microscopy 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aintercellular spaces 3aleaf anatomy 3aleaf reflectance 3aphotosystem II 3areflectance 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3aspring 3asummer 3aultrastructure 3aChina1 aYang, Yi M.1 aXu, Pei L.1 aYu, Yun F.1 aChen, Li1 aLiu, Ying X.1 aLi, Xiao Y.1 aZhao, Ying1 aQin, Hong Y.1 aAi, Jun1 aWang, Chun W.1 aSun, Dan0 tAgronomy journal.g2016 Jan., v. 108, no. 1 p.407-414dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2015.02313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013800165520099800303592002801301650001401329650001501343650001601358650001001374650002601384650002001410650001301430650001701443650002101460650001401481650001301495650001201508650001001520650001401530653001201544653002401556653001501580653002301595700001201618700001901630700001801649700001801667700001801685700001901703700001801722700001901740700001501759773009101774856008601865852000901951655001201960IND60683453120221116165936.0200228e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068345312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1207952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Chao12aA selective and sensitive fluorescent probe for bilirubin in human serum based on europium(III) post-functionalized Zr(IV)-Based MOFs  aIn the present study, a kind of Eu(III) post-functionalized Zr(IV)-based metal-organic framework (UiO-66(COOH)₂, Zr-MOF: Eu³⁺) was synthesized and utilized as an independently luminescent probe for sensing bilirubin (BR) in human serum, a biomarker of jaundice hepatitis.

An improved deep learning model for wind speed forecasting, abbreviated as MODWT-RF-IGWO-LSTM, is presented in this paper. Firstly, the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) is applied to denoise the original wind speed series. Secondly, the random forest (RF) algorithm is used for feature selection. Thirdly, the improved grey wolf optimization algorithm (IGWO) is applied to optimize the parameters of the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Finally, the denoised wind speed data is entered into the well-trained LSTM model to obtain the final wind speed forecasting result. The performance of the proposed model is assessed by actual wind speed data for three different months of the year. The experimental results show that the proposed deep learning model for wind speed forecasting has good predictive ability. And the proposed model performs better than other benchmark models in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aneural networks 3awavelet 3awind power 3awind speed 0aWind speed forecasting 0aDeep learning 0aMaximum overlap discrete wavelet transform 0aRandom forest 0aImproved grey wolf optimization 0aLong short-term memory1 aPeng, Tian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1811-23131 aZhang, Chu1 aSun, Wei1 aHua, Lei1 aJi, Chunlei1 aMuhammad Shahzad, Nazir1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9877-95900 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 196 p.1115-1126dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245010600164300001600270520178900286592002802075653001402103653002402117653001502141653001502156653001602171653002502187653002502212700002102237700002602258700002002284773011902304856007802423852000902501655001202510IND60130736220221121225136.0151127s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013073622DNAL7 a10.3159/08-RA-041R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCay, Timothy S.10aDemography and distribution of the invasive Rhamnus cathartica in habitats of a fragmented landscape1  ap. 110-121.  aForest fragmentation and abandonment of lands managed for agriculture are widespread processes in eastern North America that might promote the expansion of exotic pests. We studied populations of Rhamnus cathartica L. (European buckthorn), an invasive alien plant in North America, in maple-beech forests, abandoned agricultural fields, and unmanaged conifer plantations in central New York State. Surveys and neighborhood functions were used to examine demography and spatial distribution. Populations of R. cathartica in maple-beech forests were sparse (112 ha⁻⁻¹), dominated by seedlings and saplings, and strongly aggregated in space. Populations of R. cathartica in plantations, by contrast, were dense (7,717 ha⁻⁻¹), not strongly concentrated at the low end of the diameter distribution, and less strongly aggregated than those in other habitats. Old fields included a high density of R. cathartica plants (5,912 ha⁻⁻¹), which were predominantly seedlings and strongly aggregated. Seedling density was positively related to availability of light at our forested plots, and plants were clustered near walking trails at three of four maple-beech plots. At all old field and two of four plantations, seedlings were spatially associated with fruiting R. cathartica, suggesting that they served as recruitment foci. Further, seedlings also were associated with non-fruiting adult R. cathartica at 2 of 3 old-field and 2 of 4 plantation plots. Unmanaged conifer plantations with numerous canopy openings may permit colonization and population growth of R. cathartica. Management for closed-canopy forest and the elimination of plants, particularly fruiting conspecifics, serving as recruitment foci are potentially successful approaches toward control of R. cathartica.  aPublisher supplied data 0abuckthorn 0aconifer plantations 0ademography 0aold fields 0arecruitment 0aRhamnus cathartica L 0aspatial distribution1 aMcCay, Deanna H.1 aCaragiulo, Anthony V.1 aMandel, Toby L.0 tjournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2009, v. 136, no. 1 p.110-121dTorrey Botanical Societyx1095-56747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3159%2F08-RA-041R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012900156300002000285500001900305520103900324592002801363650002101391650001401412650002101426650001301447650002401460650001801484700001801502700001601520700001801536700001801554700001901572700001801591773014301609856007401752852000901826655001201835IND60715859620221118212525.0201104e20201103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071585962DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta03782f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Dongjin12aA facile and scalable approach to develop electrochemical unzipping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes to graphene nanoribbons  ap. 22045-22053.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnzipping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is a promising strategy for scalable preparation of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). However, current chemical unzipping methods rely on the reactions of MWCNTs with strong oxidants or alkali metals at elevated temperatures, presenting environmental and safety issues. Although several green approaches have been proposed to unzip MWCNTs, most of them are unscalable or incapable of selective unzipping. In this study, we designed a facile electrochemical approach for the scalable preparation of GNRs. The application of constant current to MWCNTs in concentrated sulfuric acid using our designed electrochemical cell allows the preparation of GNRs via intercalation-driven unzipping. This method can control the O/C ratio from 0.16 to 0.24 as well as the GNR unzipping level from partial to full unzipping. Moreover, our proposed method can be scaled up to a rate of 100 g h⁻¹ m⁻². The as-prepared GNRs are demonstrated as a catalyst support for the hydrogen evolution reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3ahydrogen production 3asulfuric acid1 aChoi, Juhyung1 aYan, Bingyi1 aHwang, Taejin1 aJin, Xuanzhen1 aKim, Jong-min,1 aPiao, Yuanzhe0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Nov. 3, v. 8, no. 42 p.22045-22053dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta03782f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008100172300001600253520083200269592002801101650001301129650002901142650002001171650001501191653003401206653002001240653001501260653002401275700002901299700003401328700002401362773009801386856008501484852000901569655001201578IND60592481520221118040453.0201125e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059248152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzzouzi, Djelloul10aExperimental study of a designed solar parabolic trough with large rim angle  ap. 495-500.  aIn this paper, the design process steps of a conventional solar parabolic trough with large rim angle are presented.

However, since most of the pre-Jurassic oceanic crust has been subducted, very few remains of Triassic atoll-like platforms are preserved in the Circum-Pacific region. Therefore, it is crucial to precisely document these Triassic carbonate occurrences to better understand the global evolution of climates and ecosystems during the Early Mesozoic in the huge Panthalassa Ocean. In the Sambosan Accretionary Complex (Southwest Japan), several Upper Triassic shallow water limestone blocks are especially well exposed at Mount Sambosan in Shikoku Island. Microfacies analyses associated with biostratigraphic data (reef assemblages, foraminifer associations and conodonts) allow us to reconstruct the geological history of these seamount fragments from the first settlement of reef biota in the Ladinian-Early Carnian to platform growth during the Late Carnian to Rhaetian. Finally, the demise of the carbonate platform occurred during the Latest Triassic to Early Jurassic, followed by platform collapse and accretion to the East Asia margin in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. Furthermore, cathodoluminescence microscopy reveals that the Sambosan limestone experienced several diagenetic episodes including early cementation, dissolution and dolomitization. At the global scale, the comprehensive sedimentary record at Mount Sambosan shows that evolution of shallow water ecosystems in the Panthalassa Ocean is consistent with biotic and environmental changes documented in coeval carbonate platforms from the Tethys Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aEarly Jurassic epoch 3aRetaria 3aTriassic period 3acarbonates 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aevolution 3alimestone 3amicroscopy 3aseamounts 3asubsidence 3aJapan 0aTriassic 0aPanthalassa 0aSeamount 0aCarbonate platform 0aMicrofacies 0aBiostratigraphy1 aPeyrotty, Giovan1 aChablais, Jérôme1 aOnoue, Tetsuji1 aYamashita, Daisuke1 aMartini, Rossana0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2020 Sept., v. 192 p.103250-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.1032503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010500170300001800275520140300293592002801696650002401724650002201748650002401770650001901794650001801813650002101831650001901852650001001871650002401881650002401905650002701929650002201956650001901978650001301997650002502010650004102035650001702076653002202093653003102115653002102146653001702167653001802184700001802202700002102220700001902241773010802260856008502368852000902453655001202462IND60537055520221120033859.0160807e20160823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053705552DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2016.11435012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcikgoz, Esvet10aEffect of plant growth-promoting Bacillus sp. on color and clipping yield of three turfgrass species  ap. 1404-1411.  aA two-year irrigated field study was conducted to determine the effects of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR; Bacillus subtilis OSU-142 and Bacillus megaterium M3) as biofertilizer, and in combination with a chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer, on turf color and clipping yield, and interaction of biofertilizer and chemical N fertilizers in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea L. Schreb.), and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.). The three turf species were tested separately in split-plot design experiments with three replications. Three fertilizer sources (ammonium nitrate only, ammonium nitrate + B. megaterium M3, and ammonium nitrate + B. subtilis OSU-142) were the main plots. N applications with monthly applications of 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 g N/m ² were the subplots. Color ratings and clipping yields increased with increasing chemical N fertilizers in all species. Both Bacillus sp. significantly increased color ratings and clipping yields in perennial ryegrass and tall fescue. However, there were no significant differences among the three fertilizer sources in color and clipping yield of Kentucky bluegrass. The experiments showed that there is a small but significant benefit from applying biofertilizers for turf color, and that N fertilization may be reduced in some turf species when biofertilization are made for this purpose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus megaterium 3aBacillus subtilis 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aLolium perenne 3aPoa pratensis 3aammonium nitrate 3abiofertilizers 3acolor 3aexperimental design 3afertilizer analysis 3afertilizer application 3airrigated farming 3alawns and turf 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aturf grasses 0aLolium perenne L. 0aFestuca arundinacea Schreb 0aPoa pratensis L. 0aturf quality 0abiofertilizer1 aBilgili, Ugur1 aSahin, Fikrettin1 aGuillard, Karl0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2016 Aug. 23, v. 39, no. 10 p.1404-1411dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2016.11435013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014200172300002000314520108000334592002801414596005901442650002101501650001901522650002101541650002001562650001501582650001401597650000901611650001301620650001801633651001001651700002001661700002401681700002001705700002101725700002501746700001701771700001601788700002301804700002201827773015501849856008302004852000902087655001202096IND60708476320221121121347.0211222e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09754-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacosa, Hernando P.10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and putative PAH-degrading bacteria in Galveston Bay, TX (USA), following Hurricane Harvey (2017)  ap. 34987-34999.  aHurricane Harvey was the wettest hurricane in US history bringing record rainfall and widespread flooding in Houston, TX. The resulting storm- and floodwaters largely emptied into the Galveston Bay. Surface water was collected from 10 stations during five cruises to investigate the concentrations and sources of 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and relative abundances of PAH-degrading bacteria. Highest PAH levels (102–167 ng/L) were detected during the first sampling event, decreasing to 36–69 ng/L within a week. Four sites had elevated concentrations of carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene that exceeded the Texas Standard for Surface Water threshold. The highest relative abundances of known PAH-degrading bacteria Burkholderiaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Sphingomonadales were detected during the first and second sampling events. PAH origins were about 60% pyrogenic, 2% petrogenic, and the remainder of mixed sources. This study improves our understanding on the fate, source, and distributions of PAHs in Galveston Bay after an extreme flooding event.  aPublisher supplied data  aADDOMEX ConsortiumcGulf of Mexico Research Initiative 3aBurkholderiaceae 3aComamonadaceae 3aSphingomonadales 3acarcinogenicity 3ahurricanes 3apollution 3arain 3aresearch 3asurface water 3aTexas1 aSteichen, Jamie1 aKamalanathan, Manoj1 aWindham, Rachel1 aLubguban, Arnold1 aLabonté, Jessica M.1 aKaiser, Karl1 aHala, David1 aSantschi, Peter H.1 aQuigg, Antonietta0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 Oct., v. 27, no. 28 p.34987-34999dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09754-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245010800199300001800307500001900325520119400344592002801538650001301566650001101579650001401590650001301604650001101617650001401628650002201642653002401664653002701688653002901715653003201744653001801776700001801794700001401812700001501826700001501841700001601856700001701872700001401889700001501903700005301918700001901971773013901990856007802129852000902207655001202216IND60728778520221118024137.0210224e20210209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072877852DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c205432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Lijing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3571-148110a9,10-Anthraquinone/K₂CuFe(CN)₆: A Highly Compatible Aqueous Aluminum-Ion Full-Battery Configuration  ap. 8353-8360.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTemporally intermittent and spatially dispersed renewable energy sources strongly call for large-scale energy storage devices. Aqueous aluminum-ion batteries show great potential for application due to their safety and low cost. Thus far, however, the ideal full-battery configuration is beyond the scope due to shortcomings with regards to suitable anode and cathode materials. Herein, we report a pioneering aqueous aluminum-ion battery system consisting of a Prussian white cathode, 1 M Al₂(SO₄)₃ aqueous electrolyte, and an organic 9,10-anthraquinone anode. The oxidation capability of the Prussian white cathode during the first charging allows for the fabrication of the full battery without pre-inserting aluminum ions, thus making the rocking-chair-type battery feasible. Importantly, the open-framework structure of the Prussian white and distinct enolization charge storage mechanism of 9,10-anthraquinone ensure fast reaction kinetics. The full battery exhibits cycling stability with a capacity retention of 89.1% over 100 cycles at 500 mA g–¹, finishing a cycle in about 10 min. This work provides a pathway for developing rechargeable aqueous aluminum-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aenergy 3aoxidation 3areaction kinetics 0aaqueous electrolyte 0aaluminum-ion batteries 0aPrussian white analogues 0aorganic electrode materials 0arocking chair1 aZeng, Xiaomin1 aZhao, Shu1 aJiang, Wei1 aLi, Zeheng1 aGao, Xuehui1 aLiu, Tiefeng1 aJi, Zekai1 aMa, Tingli1 aLing, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6727-95851 aLiang, Chengdu0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 09, v. 13, no. 7 p.8353-8360dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c205433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014400166520159800310592002801908650001501936650001301951650001401964650001601978650001901994650002902013650002002042650002802062650002202090650001702112650001802129650001702147650001502164650002202179650002802201650003002229653003002259653002102289653002502310653002802335700002002363700001702383700002002400700001902420773009102439856008602530852000902616655001202625IND60683453420221116170101.0200228e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068345342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1207982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing10aSynergistic amplification effect for electrochemiluminescence immunoassay based on dual coreactants coupling with resonance energy transfer  aSensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) bioanalysis could be achieved by exploring the amplification principle or strategy. This work described the first proof-of-concept study for coupling dual coreactants (K₂S₂O₈ and H₂O₂) with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) enhancement as an effective signal amplification strategy for ECL immunosensor. Specifically, AgNPs as an excellent conductor and nanocarriers were employed as the antibody (Ab₂) immobilization film on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the subsequent sandwich-type immunoreaction between the target protein and antibody (Ab₁)-g-C₃N₄ resulted in the ECL generation. On the one hand, due to the perfect overlap between the plasmon absorption spectrum of AgNPs and the ECL emission spectrum of g-C₃N₄, a plasmon-enhanced ECL phenomenon was proved in g–C₃N₄–AgNPs system result from high efficient energy transfer. On the other hand, it was validated that the ECL signal of the constructed biosensor was greatly strengthened by K₂S₂O₈ and H₂O₂ as dual coreactants, which was ca. 3.5 and 7 times stronger than that of K₂S₂O₈ or H₂O₂ as an individual coreactant, respectively. Consequently, this synergistic amplified ECL immunosensor performed well with great stability and repeatability for squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) detection in the range from 0.001 to 1000 ng mL⁻¹. Considering the favorable analytical feedback in actual serum samples assay, this proposed method indicates a great potential for bioassay application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abioassays 3ablood serum 3acarbon nitride 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aenergy transfer 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ananocarriers 3ananosilver 3aspectral analysis 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aResonance energy transfer 0aDual coreactants 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aGraphite carbon nitride1 aWang, Hongxiang1 aCao, Weining1 aZhang, Qianqian1 aZhong, Wenying0 tTalanta.g2020 May 15, v. 212 p.120798-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1207983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245009900209300001600308520096200324592002801286650002201314650001201336650001901348650002101367650001701388653002701405653001101432653002601443653002201469700005801491700005501549700006001604773009701664856008501761852000901846655001201855IND60783491720221116164937.0220906e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078349172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoduch, Andrzej1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5884-435910aTechnical and economic assessment of a 1 MWp floating photovoltaic system in Polish conditions  ap. 983-994.  aThe Polish coal-based power system faces the necessity of a pressing transition. Partially, the challenge may be addressed by floating photovoltaics. Since there is no analysis covering the implementation of this technology in Polish conditions, in this paper the design process of a 1 MWp floating photovoltaic system and its technical and economic assessment were performed. To find the best solution different floating assemblies were considered. Floating systems were compared with the reference ground mounted system and, based on simulations conducted in PVsyst, economic study with sensitivity analysis was carried out. The results revealed that even in case of the best performing floating system the extra yield cannot compensate the higher CAPEX. Currently, in Polish market conditions, this technology is not as profitable as the ground-mounted systems and higher product maturity stage need to be achieved for it to be considered as competitive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic analysis 3amarkets 3amaturity stage 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aFloating photovoltaics 0aPVsyst 0aDesign and simulation 0aEconomic analysis1 aMik, Krzysztof1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9510-30661 aCastro, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3108-88801 aZawadzki, Paweł1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4262-47700 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 196 p.983-994dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245014500164300001600309520154800325592002801873650002201901650002101923650001501944650001801959650001201977650002301989650001202012650001102024650001602035650001002051650001702061650001402078651001902092700002902111700003502140700003302175773008002208856004802288852000902336655001202345IND4479798720221119152953.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447979872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-011-0564-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozas, Vicente10aContrasting effects of wildfire and climate on radial growth of Pinus canariensis on windward and leeward slopes on Tenerife, Canary Islands  ap. 895-905.  aLittle is known concerning the effects of wildfires on tree radial growth and their climatic response under contrasting regimes of fog water inputs on oceanic islands. On Tenerife, Canary Islands, windward slopes are humid with high-fog frequency due to influence of wet trade winds, while climate on leeward slopes is more arid. We used tree-ring records of Pinus canariensis Sweet ex Spreng. to quantify the effects of a fire of known date on radial growth and determine the main limiting climatic factors for growth. Radial growth patterns and their responsiveness to fire severity and climatic variation differed between windward and leeward slopes. Surface fire did not significantly impact growth, while crown fire caused short-term growth reduction, and even cessation, more pronounced on the windward slope. Growth rates, tree-ring common signal, and climate sensitivity were smaller on the windward slope, with cold winters, and summer water stress limiting growth. On the leeward slope, climate explained a greater amount of growth variation mainly due to negative effects of high OctoberâDecember sea-level pressures causing dry winter conditions. Contrasting growth dynamics on both slopes may result from diverging physiological effects of water inputs and reduced radiation caused by fog drip. Our findings suggest that dating growth suppressions and absent rings are useful to date past high-severity crown fires in P. canariensis forests, in addition to ordinary fire scars dating indicative of low-severity surface fires.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus canariensis 3aclimatic factors 3afire scars 3afire severity 3aforests 3agrowth retardation 3aislands 3asummer 3atrade winds 3atrees 3awater stress 3awildfires 3aCanary Islands1 aPÃ©rez-de-Lis, Gonzalo1 aGarcÃ­a-GonzÃ¡lez, Ignacio1 aArÃ©valo, JosÃ© RamÃ³n0 tTrees.g2011 Oct., v. 25, no. 5 p.895-905dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-011-0564-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245006100170300001600231500000900247520165400256592002801910650002001938650001401958650002601972650001201998650001802010650001202028650001302040650002202053650001502075650000902090650001702099650002102116650001502137650001002152650002102162650001402183651001702197700002402214700002002238773012202258856007902380852000902459655001202468IND60663475920221122062250.0191226e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066347592DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2002.85102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyei-Boahen, Stephen10aEvaluation of Rhizobial Inoculation Methods for Chickpea  ap. 851-859.  aepub  aRhizobia inoculated onto legume seeds are often exposed to adverse environmental conditions, which can affect survival and subsequent effectiveness. Hence, soil-applied granular inoculants have received much attention recently. We examined the efficacy of various inoculation methods at four sites in Saskatchewan, Canada, in 1997 and 1998 using desi- and kabuli-type chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Seed inoculation treatments (liquid or peat-based powder) were compared with soil inoculation (granular inoculant) either placed in the seed furrow or side-banded (i.e., 2.5 cm to the side) at depths of either 2.5 or 8 cm below the seed. Nodule formation in the seed inoculation treatments was restricted to the crown region of the root system, whereas soil inoculation enhanced nodulation on the lateral roots. In 1997, granular inoculant placed below the seed increased kabuli seed yield by 36 and 14% over the liquid and peat-based inoculants, respectively, whereas desi seed yield increased 17 and 5%, respectively. Seed yield responses were inconsistent in 1998. Seed protein concentration, percentage N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa), and amount of N₂ fixed were typically lower for the liquid inoculant than for the peat and granular inoculants, which did not differ. The dry weight of lateral-root nodules was highly correlated with yield parameters, suggesting that the lateral-root nodules contributed significantly to N₂ fixation and yield. Although the peat and granular inoculants were equally effective in establishing successful symbiosis, placing granular inoculant 2.5 to 8.0 cm below the seed may improve yield and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3achickpeas 3aenvironmental factors 3afurrows 3alateral roots 3aliquids 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3apeat 3aroot systems 3aseed inoculation 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3asoil inoculation 3asymbiosis 3aSaskatchewan1 aSlinkard, Alfred E.1 aWalley, Fran L.0 tAgronomy journal.g2002 July, v. 94, no. 4 p.851-859dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2002.85103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245009300165300001600258520094500274592002801219650002001247650001701267650001201284650002201296650001801318650001201336650002001348650001501368650002501383650000901408650001601417650001401433653002701447653001601474653001301490653001701503653002401520700002001544773009401564856007801658852000901736655001201745IND60519992320221119091032.0160512e20160229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051999232DNAL7 a10.1515/forj-2015-00302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModlinger, Roman10aQuantification of time delay between damages caused by windstorms and by Ips typographus  ap. 221-231.  aDamages by wind and by European spruce bark beetle (I. typographus L.) were compared on the basis of the reports about the occurrence of harmful forest agents for the period 1964−1991 across former regional state forest directorates. In the given period, the quantity of salvage logging (70 million m³) was more than five times that of sanitation felling (13 million m³). Damage intensity increased over the decades. Using a cross-correlation function between the time series, an increase in the abundance of I. typographus due to windfall was demonstrated with a delay of 1–3 years. Wind damage was also shown to arise as a result of disturbed stand stability after sanitation felling with a stochastic delay of 1−5 years. Thus, disturbance of static stability of forest stands may be considered as one of the main harmful consequences of bark beetle outbreaks for the near future. Consequences for forest management are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIps typographus 3abark beetles 3afelling 3aforest management 3aforest stands 3aforests 3asalvage logging 3asanitation 3atime series analysis 3awind 3awind damage 3awindthrow 0aforest pest management 0adisturbance 0awindfall 0abark beetles 0apopulation dynamics1 aNovotný, Petr,0 tLesnicky casopis.g2016 Feb. 29, v. 61, no. 4 p.221-231dDe Gruyter Openx0323-10467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/forj-2015-00303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245006000167300001600227500001500243520120400258592002801462650001001490650001001500650000901510650001801519650001001537650002101547651001901568653002001587653001501607653002001622653002701642700001901669700002301688773009401711856007801805852000901883655001201892IND60519992420221119091144.0160512e20160229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051999242DNAL7 a10.1515/forj-2015-00312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovak, Jiri Tibor,10aThinning in artificially regenerated young beech stands  ap. 232-239.  a2019-12-06  aAlthough beech stands are usually regenerated naturally, an area of up to 5,000 ha year⁻¹ is artificially regenerated by beech in the Czech Republic annually. Unfortunately, these stands often showed insufficient stand density and, consequently, lower quality of stems. Therefore, thinning methods developed for naturally regenerated beech stands are applicable with difficulties. The paper evaluates the data from two thinning experiments established in young artificially regenerated beech stands located in different growing conditions. In both experiments, thinning resulted in the lower amount of salvage cut in following years. Positive effect of thinning on periodic stand basal area increment and on periodic diameter increment of dominant trees was found in the beech stand located at middle elevations. On the other hand, thinning effects in mountain conditions were negligible. Thinning focusing on future stand quality cannot be commonly applied in artificially regenerated beech stands because of their worse initial quality and lower density. However, these stands show good growth and response to thinning, hence their management can be focused on maximising beech wood production.  aPublisher supplied data 3astems 3aFagus 3awood 3astand density 3atrees 3astand basal area 3aCzech Republic 0adiameter growth 0abasal area 0aFagus sylvatica 0aquantity of production1 aDušek, David,1 aSlodičák, Marian0 tLesnicky casopis.g2016 Feb. 29, v. 61, no. 4 p.232-239dDe Gruyter Openx0323-10467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/forj-2015-00313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100006000185245018200245506007600427506003100503520145300534592002801987596007102015596004502086506003702131650001702168650003702185650002102222650002902243650002902272650001602301650001802317650001602335650001002351650001102361653001602372653001002388653001302398653001602411653002502427700002202452700002002474700001802494700002602512773012502538856008202663852000902745655001202754IND60750585720221207085545.0220222e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075058572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1124402chorus7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1124402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Alvaro,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5632-308510aAntilisterial activity of freeze-dried bacteriocin-containing powders produced by lactic acid bacteria against Listeria innocua NRRL B-33016 on cantaloupe (Cucumis melo) surface  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aBacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria may reduce pathogenic loads on cantaloupe surfaces. The efficacy of these bacteriocins on reducing the pathogenic loads of Listeria was evaluated. Non-pathogenic bacteria, Listeria innocua NRRL B-33016 was used as a surrogate for L. monocytogenes. Two bacteriocins, (1) nisin and (2) pediocin, were produced from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 and Pediococcus acidilactici RS2, respectively. L. innocua NRRL B-33016 was inoculated on the cantaloupes surface at a concentration of 4.69 ± 0.37 log CFU/cm², and then the melons were stored for 16 days at 4 °C. The antimicrobial activity on L. innocua of the powders was 3.34 × 10⁷ and 1.01 × 10⁸ international units (IU)/g, respectively. Application of nisin freeze-dried bacteriocin-containing powder (NBP), pediocin freeze-dried bacteriocin-containing powder (PBP), or the combination of pediocin-nisin freeze-dried bacteriocin-containing powder (PNBP) significantly reduced L. innocua on the cantaloupes by approximately 1.29, 1.09, and 1.68 log CFU/cm², respectively. Compared to the controls, bacteriocin applications significantly reduced APC, yeast, and mold counts regardless of bacteriocin type. This study demonstrated that bacteriocins could reduce Listeria, aerobic bacteria, yeast, and mold counts on the cantaloupes surface; and that PNBP was more effective in reducing Listeria than NBP or PBP alone.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Marketing Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005826  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucumis melo 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aListeria innocua 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3aantibacterial properties 3acantaloupes 3afreeze drying 3alactic acid 3anisin 3ayeasts 0aBacteriocin 0aNisin 0aPediocin 0aCantaloupes 0aRefrigerated storage1 aBonilla, Franklin1 aVillasmil, Elio1 aReyes, Vondel1 aSathivel, Subramaniam0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 154 p.112440-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1124403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245014700176300002000323520107800343592002801421650001201449650001501461650002201476650001401498650001101512650001301523650002001536651001201556700002501568700002201593773015501615856008301770852000901853655001201862IND60708476720221121121357.0211222e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09850-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolinos-Senante, María10aEstimating technical efficiency and allocative distortions of water companies: evidence from the English and Welsh water and sewerage industry  ap. 35174-35183.  aRegulated water industries need to improve their technical efficiency and allocate their resources efficiently. This is the case of the water industry in England and Wales which was privatized in 1989, and the method of price cap regulation was implemented. This study uses an input distance function system approach to estimate the technical efficiency and distortions in the choice of input mixes for the English and Welsh water and sewerage companies (WaSCs) over the years 1991–2016. The results indicated that an average WaSC was 75.3% technically efficient which means that inputs could be reduced by 24.7% keeping the level of output constant. On average, the input mix was considered to be allocated inefficiently as there was an over-utilization of capital and other inputs relative to employment. Moreover, the low degree of substitutability among inputs implied that reducing allocative inefficiency could be costly. The findings of our study is of interest to policy makers who want to implement effective policies to improve efficiency in the water industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aemployment 3aissues and policy 3apollution 3aprices 3aresearch 3awater utilities 3aEngland1 aMaziotis, Alexandros1 aVillegas, Andrés0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 Oct., v. 27, no. 28 p.35174-35183dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09850-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167300001600288520134000304592002801644650001101672650001101683650001601694651001701710653003201727653002201759653002501781653002701806653003201833653003801865700001901903700001601922700001501938700001801953700001101971773009701982856008502079852000902164655001202173IND60783492120221116164945.0220906e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078349212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Kaixuan10aCascade hydropower stations short-term operation for load distribution considering water level synchronous variation  ap. 683-693.  aThe load distribution of cascade hydropower stations is associated with the safe operation of the hydropower stations and power grids. The conventional load distribution of cascade hydropower stations does not consider the synchronous operation of the water level. The inconsistent water level variation process of cascade hydropower stations is not conducive to the safe operation of hydropower stations and power grids. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of equal reservoir full storage rate (ERFSR) to guide the load distribution of cascade hydropower stations. In addition, hydropower is used for new energy consumption considering the advantages of the rapid start-stop in hydropower units. The load distribution model of cascade hydropower stations is established, and three cases are set to verify the universality of the proposed model in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. The results show that (1) The concept of ERFSR can effectively guide load distribution and realize water level synchronization of cascade hydropower stations. (2) The output process of each hydropower station can be basically consistent with the load process to achieve synchronous peak shaving. (3) New energy consumption has little effect on the daily water consumption of downstream cascade hydropower stations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3amodels 3awater power 3aYellow River 0aReservoir full storage rate 0aLoad distribution 0aShort-term operation 0aNew energy consumption 0aCascade hydropower stations 0aUpper reaches of the Yellow River1 aChang, Jianxia1 aWang, Yimin1 aGuo, Aijun1 aHuang, Mengdi1 aXu, Bo0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 196 p.683-693dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.07.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008900162520165100251592002801902650001701930650001901947650001601966650001301982650001801995650002002013650001802033650002902051650001602080653001302096653003002109653001402139653001802153700002002171700001802191700001502209773012202224856008102346852000902427655001202436IND60750585820221122105155.0211206e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075058582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1124422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcet, I.10aEgg yolk granules and phosvitin. Recent advances in food technology and applications  aEgg yolk is consumed all around the world because of its nutritional and functional properties. It can easily be separated by centrifugation into two fractions, the egg yolk granules and plasma fractions. In comparison with the plasma fraction, the granular fraction has a low content of lipids and cholesterol and a high content of proteins; on the other hand, the lipid-rich plasma fraction has gelling and emulsifying properties similar to those of whole egg yolk. Therefore, taking into consideration their different composition and functional properties, it would be advantageous to increase the value of whole egg yolk by making different use of each of its fractions. In this sense, while the egg yolk plasma could, to some extent, be used as a substitute for whole egg yolk, the range of applications for the granules is more reduced at present and further research into this fraction is required to increase the interest of the food industry in the egg yolk fractionation process. The egg yolk granular fraction is mainly composed of globular proteins, namely lipovitellins or high-density lipoproteins, linked to phosvitin by phosphocalcium bridges. Phosvitin is the most phosphorylated protein found in nature, and shows remarkable metal chelating, antioxidant, emulsifying and antimicrobial properties and, owing to these capacities, it has also the potential to be isolated and incorporated by the food industry as a functional ingredient. Thus, the aim of the present review is to show the most recent advances in the food-related applications developed by the research community for egg yolk granules and their isolated components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acentrifugation 3acholesterol 3aegg yolk 3afood industry 3afood technology 3afractionation 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aingredients 0aGranules 0aHigh-density lipoproteins 0aPhosvitin 0aLipovitellins1 aSáez-Orviz, S.1 aRendueles, M.1 aDíaz, M.,0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Jan., v. 153 p.112442-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1124423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008200161300002000243520162900263592002801892596005901920596008601979596006502065650001902130650002002149650002002169650001402189650001702203650001102220650001402231650001302245651001002258700001502268700005302283773015502336856008302491852000902574655001202583IND60708476920221121121359.0211222e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070847692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09724-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Lili10aConfucian values, trust, and family farm adoption of green control techniques  ap. 35099-35111.  aEncouraging farmers to adopt green control techniques (GCTs) helps to reduce and control the use of chemical pesticides. However, there is a lack of attention regarding the promotion of culture as an informal institution. As an important part of Chinese culture, Confucian values affect the behavior and decision-making of Chinese people imperceptibly, and these values are more visceral for farmers. We apply a mediation model with categorical variables to a dataset of 443 family farms in Shandong and Henan provinces to systematically investigate the relationships among Confucian values, trust, and the family farm adoption of green control techniques. We use the conditional mixed process and two-stage least square estimation methods for instrumental variables to address potential endogeneity problems. Our findings show that Confucian values have significant positive effects on trust and the family farm adoption of GCTs. Trust has a positive effect on the family farm adoption of GCTs and a mediating effect on the relationship between Confucian values and the family farm adoption of GCTs. Therefore, Confucian values should be emphasized for creative transformation and innovative development. To strengthen the spread of Confucian culture and improve education about it, traditional folk and cultural activities should be established, Confucian self-study by family farms should be encouraged, favorable external conditions should be created, the Confucian values of family farms should be guided and cultivated, and the trust level of family farms should be enhanced to improve the efficient extension of GCTs.  aPublisher supplied data  a71803096cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a18YJA790024cHumanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China  aZR2018MG009cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province 3aChinese people 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aeducation 3afamily farms 3amodels 3apollution 3aresearch 3aChina1 aChen, Chen1 aGao, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5874-32750 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2020 Oct., v. 27, no. 28 p.35099-35111dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09724-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04407naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245015400183520265800337592002802995650001903023650002003042650001403062650001203076650001403088650003503102650001803137650003003155650002303185650002103208650002003229650001903249650004603268650001603314650001603330650004303346650002703389650002003416650001903436650001803455650001403473650001503487650002003502651001003522653001503532653001803547653004803565653002803613653002603641773009103667856008603758852000903844655001203853IND60683453920221116170120.0200228e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068345392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1208032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomínguez-Álvarez, Javier10aCapillary electrophoresis coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry for the determination of organic and inorganic arsenic compounds in water samples  aSome compounds of arsenic are extremely toxic to the human body even at low levels. Long-term exposure from drinking contaminated water causes adverse health effects. This has led the European Union and other global organizations to reduce the maximum residue limit for the total arsenic up to 10 μg L⁻¹ in water for human consumption. The toxicity of arsenic depends on the oxidation state, chemical structure and solubility in the biological environment. Main analytical procedures report on the determination of arsenic species in water samples which have been developed based on atomic spectroscopy –speciation performed in the sample treatment step– and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In such cases, speciation is performed by coupling to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As far as we know, the determination of arsenic species in water samples at low concentration levels by capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has not been described up to now. In this research CE-ESI(−)-MS is proposed for the identification and simultaneous quantification of organic and inorganic arsenic species in water samples for human consumption. The target compounds were dimethylarsinate (DMA), mono-methylarsonate (MMA), arsenite (i-As(III)) and arsenate (i-As(V)). Optimization of the composition and nature of both the electrophoretic separation medium –using hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) as an additive– and the sheath liquid was performed and aimed at achieving the best sensitivity and separation efficiency for the CE-ESI(−)-MS coupling. Two simple sample treatments were proposed: one based on dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction (DLLME) intended for a rapid determination of the total content of inorganic arsenic in the water sample; and the second based on partial evaporation of the water sample to detect each of the four main arsenic species. For the second, limits of detection between 0.02 and 0.04 μg L⁻¹ were found, which are similar results as the ones achieved with methods based on HPLC-ICP-MS.The DLLME + CE-ESI(−)-MS method was applied to the determination of total inorganic arsenic in eleven water samples in the province of Salamanca (Spain). Five of the analyzed samples had values close to, or superior to the maximum residue limit for the total of arsenic in water intended for human consumption (10 μg L⁻¹). The validated method CE-ESI(−)-MS for arsenic speciation was applied with success to the analysis of the weakly mineralized water sample (dry residue < 50 mg L⁻¹) of both groundwater and bottled water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aadverse effects 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abottled water 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achemical structure 3achronic exposure 3adetection limit 3adrinking water 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aevaporation 3agroundwater 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amaximum residue limits 3amicroextraction 3amineralization 3aoral exposure 3aoxidation 3asolubility 3awater pollution 3aSpain 0aSpeciation 0aWater samples 0aCapillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry 0aElectrospray ionization 0aHexafluoro-2-propanol0 tTalanta.g2020 May 15, v. 212 p.120803-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1208033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014400168300001400312520128500326592002801611650001901639650002901658650002501687650001401712650001801726653002501744653002001769653002201789653002601811653002301837700001501860700001501875773009501890856008501985852000902070655001202079IND60592482120221118040403.0190321e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059248212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.01.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xianzeng10aResultant vibration signal model based fault diagnosis of a single stage planetary gear train with an incipient tooth crack on the sun gear  ap. 65-79.  aPlanetary gear trains equipped in wind turbine often run under slow speed and non-stationary load condition. The incipient gear faults in a wind turbine gearbox can hardly be detected yet might cause tremendous loss. In order to detect the incipient faults, a resultant vibration signal model is proposed to characterize the faulty features of a single stage planetary gear train working under non-stationary load conditions. For this purpose, an analytical dynamic model is developed. By introducing the crack-induced mesh stiffness and varying load into the dynamic model, the vibration responses of the system are predicted. Based on this, a resultant vibration signal model is developed in the form of weighted summation of mesh vibration signals. With the resultant model, the vibration signals of an example system are simulated and analyzed. The simulation results indicate that varying load and tooth crack make the system's vibration signals become extremely complicated in both time and frequency domains. The incipient tooth crack induced impulse vibration signals are too weak to be identified in the time domain but can be detected from the order spectrum. The simulation results from the resultant signal model are verified by the test rig experimental measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic models 3arenewable energy sources 3atransmission systems 3avibration 3awind turbines 0aPlanetary gear train 0aFault diagnosis 0aVarying wind load 0aIncipient tooth crack 0aVibration analysis1 aYang, Yuhu1 aZhang, Jun0 tRenewable energy.g2018 July, v. 122 p.65-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.01.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245018000157300002000337500001900357520204200376592002802418650003002446650001502476650002102491650001302512650001902525650001202544650001602556650001102572650003102583650002902614650001402643700001602657700001802673700001802691700002002709773014302729856007402872852000902946655001202955IND60715860120221122045624.0201104e20201103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071586012DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta05905f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Liuxuan10aProbing structure-designed Cu–Pd nanospheres and their Pt-monolayer-shell derivatives as high-performance electrocatalysts for alkaline and acidic oxygen reduction reactions  ap. 22389-22400.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a critical role in various renewable energy technologies, however, the unsatisfactory ORR electrocatalytic performance of commonly used commercial electrocatalysts under alkaline and acidic conditions greatly limits the wide practical applications of these technologies. Accordingly, in this study, (1) a facile heat treatment (HT) is exploited to anneal carbon-supported highly uniform and small-sized Cu₁Pd₁ nanospheres (NSs) with composition-graded (CG) structures (CᴳCu₁Pd₁ NSs/C-HT); (2) through complete Cu underpotential deposition and Pt²⁺ galvanic replacement, the above-annealed CᴳCu₁Pd₁ NSs are further coated with Pt monolayer (ML) shells (MSs) (CᴳCu₁Pd₁@PtML NSs/C-HT). Detailed physicochemical characterization, electrochemical analyses and density functional theory calculations reveal that, benefiting from the CG structural, size-morphology and annealing effects of the NSs, as well as the Cu-induced geometric and ligand effects, compared to CᴳCu₁Pd₁ NSs/C, commercial Pd/C and Pt/C, CᴳCu₁Pd₁ NSs/C-HT exhibits not only ultrahigh alkaline ORR electrocatalytic activity, showing respective 1.1/1.2-, 4.7/13.7- and 5.2/6.8-fold enhancements in area-/noble-metal-mass-specific activity (ASA/NM-MSA), but also a satisfactory alkaline electrochemical durability. Besides, owing to the Pt-MS structural effect and the synergistic effect on the Pt MS imparted by the CᴳCu₁Pd₁ core, CᴳCu₁Pd₁@PtML NSs/C-HT presents remarkable acidic ORR electrocatalytic activity, NM utilization and acidic electrochemical durability compared to commercial Pt/C, exhibiting respective 3.4-, 3.4- and 13.3-fold enhancements in ASA, NM-MSA and Pt-MSA. This study has not only successfully developed two types of high-performance ORR electrocatalyst, but also comprehensively investigated the origins of their significantly enhanced ORR electrocatalytic performance for the rational design and preparation of highly active and durable ORR electrocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3ageometry 3aheat treatment 3aligands 3ananospheres 3aoxygen 3aphysicochemical properties 3arenewable energy sources 3asynergism1 aFu, Cehuang1 aShen, Shuiyun1 aZhu, Fengjuan1 aZhang, Junliang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Nov. 3, v. 8, no. 42 p.22389-22400dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta05905f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013700161300001600298520136300314592002801677650001001705650002201715650001901737650001201756650001501768650001401783650002501797650002401822650001001846651001301856653002301869653002001892653001501912653002401927773009401951856007802045852000902123655001202132IND60519992720221119091059.0160512e20160229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051999272DNAL7 a10.1515/forj-2015-00342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarna, Milan10aProductivity and functioning of the beech ecosystem: Ecological Experimental Station – Kremnické vrchy Mts.

The Ecological Experimental Station (EES) in the Kremnické vrchy Mountains (Western Carpathians, Slovakia, 1986) was founded for similar purposes. The aim of the research at EES was to evaluate the productivity, carrying capacity and functioning of the beech ecosystem. In February 1989, five plots were established. Four plots were subjected to a regeneration cutting of different intensities (clear-cut, strip shelterwood cut: light, medium and heavy). The fifth plot was left without any management treatments as a control. The second cutting was performed in 2004 followed by the final cutting five years later. Currently, the research is carried out on the EES control plot in the stand comprising 115–120 years old beech trees. In the other stands the research is focused on the development of naturally regenerated beech ecosystems established after different cutting interventions. The future of the EES is in addressing some global issues, particularly the impact of climate change on primary production, as well as on its other consequences for the functioning of the affected ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3acarrying capacity 3aclimate change 3acutting 3aecosystems 3amountains 3aprimary productivity 3ashelterwood systems 3atrees 3aSlovakia 0aLong-term research 0abeech ecosystem 0atree layer 0aWestern Carpathians0 tLesnicky casopis.g2016 Feb. 29, v. 61, no. 4 p.252-261dDe Gruyter Openx0323-10467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/forj-2015-00343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245007600164300001400240520135500254592002801609653001101637653001101648653001001659653001901669700002301688773011701711856007801828852000901906655001201915IND60130737220221120034210.0151127s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013073722DNAL7 a10.3159/08-RA-090R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenfeldt, Sonia14aThe structure of the stigma and the style of Oxalis spp. (Oxalidaceae)1  ap. 33-45.  aThe anatomy of the stigma and style of three species of Oxalis (O. articulata, O. hispidula, and O. paludosa), belonging to different sections (Articulatae, Ionoxalis, and Corniculatae) was studied using light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. The stigma morphology of each of the different flower morphs of the three species (longistylous, medistylous, and brevistylous flowers) was compared in this work. The stigma is dry and has multicellular and multiseriate papillae. The morphology of the papillae does not differ between flower morphs. According to the Ca²⁺⁺ concentration in pre-anthesis, anthesis, and post-anthesis, we hypothesize that the stigmas of the different morphs are equally receptive. Oxalis style is solid type. The cytoplasm of the transmitting tissue cells is dense with few vacuoles and abundant organelles. The transmitting tissue cells have large amounts of intercellular substance, mainly at the corners. This substance has moderate electron density in the species O. articulata and O. hispidula and shows some laxer areas in O. paludosa. The transmitting cell wall of the two first species has wall ingrowths like fingers with low electron density that protrude into the cytoplasm. The ultrastructural characteristics of the transmitting cells allow to characterize three of the sections of the genus.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOxalis 0astigma 0astyle 0aultrastructure1 aGalati, Beatriz G.0 tjournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2009, v. 136, no. 1 p.33-45dTorrey Botanical Societyx1095-56747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3159%2F08-RA-090R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245008400168300001800252520144700270592002801717650001401745650001901759650002201778650001301800650001101813650001701824650001801841650001901859650001601878650002101894650002601915700002701941700002001968700002501988700001802013773014102031856007402172852000902246655001202255IND60670909620221121013756.0191002e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067090962DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta05926c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Mendonça, Vagner R.10aHeterostructure formation from hydrothermal annealing of preformed nanocrystals  ap. 2216-2225.  aOne of the primary challenges in obtaining heterostructures is control of the morphology and surface features of the components that are suitable for a specific application. In this sense, the use of preformed nanoparticles as building blocks is interesting. However, to create heterojunctions between preformed nanoparticles, a further calcination step is usually needed that can result in changes in nanoparticle morphology and surface chemistry. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to explore collision-induced heteroaggregation and oriented attachment under hydrothermal conditions to obtain heterostructures from preformed nanoparticles without further thermal treatment or addition of capping agents. We use anatase TiO₂ and rutile SnO₂ nanoparticles as a model system. A kinetic model based on a diffusion-controlled reaction is adapted to describe the process. For tracking charge migration across the interface and, consequently, heterojunction formation, we employ an indirect method based on the detection of hydroxyl radicals formed over a semiconductor during UV radiation. The rate of hydroxyl radical formation is directly proportional to the photogenerated charge lifetime, which, in turn, depends on the number of heterojunctions formed. The insights presented here suggest the possibility of obtaining the benefits of heterostructures by using nanoparticles with controlled morphology and surface characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aheat treatment 3ahydroxyl radicals 3akinetics 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3asemiconductors 3atin dioxide 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation1 aDalmaschio, Cleocir J.1 aLeite, Edson R.1 aNiederberger, Markus1 aRibeiro, Caue0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Jan. 20, v. 3, no. 5 p.2216-2225dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta05926c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006200173300001400235520094700249592002801196650001401224650001101238650002001249650001101269650001601280650001201296650002601308650000901334650001601343651001101359653001101370653002001381653001401401653001101415653001301426700001801439700001601457700002101473700002001494700001801514773009501532856008501627852000901712655001201721IND60592482220221118040423.0190321e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059248222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2018.01.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrávníček, Petr10aQuantitative analyses of biogas plant accidents in Europe  ap. 89-97.  aRapid grow of biogas stations numbers across the Europe could be seen in recent past. This is also associated with an increase in the absolute number of operational accidents. In the opinion of experts who deal with safety engineering in the field of bioenergy installations, the number of accidents on biogas stations is growing faster than energy production from these stations. The aim of this paper is to open a discussion about interpretation and uncertainty of quantitative accidents assessment. For this purpose, 208 accidents of biogas stations were collected across Europe from 2006 to 2016. These data were statistically analysed.An integral part of the work is also the calculation of event frequencies for selected scenarios, which in the future can facilitate the decision making of risk experts in similar installations. The work also addresses issues related to the reduction of the risk level in the biogas station operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3abiogas 3adecision making 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aexperts 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk 3auncertainty 3aEurope 0aBiogas 0aBiogas stations 0aAccidents 0aEurope 0aAnalysis1 aKotek, Luboš1 aJunga, Petr1 aVítěz, Tomáš1 aDrápela, Karel1 aChovanec, Jan0 tRenewable energy.g2018 July, v. 122 p.89-97dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2018.01.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011900154300001600273520192900289592002802218650001902246650001202265650002102277650001602298650001402314650002202328650001102350650001202361650001102373650002302384650001302407650001102420650002502431650001002456650001402466650001602480700001502496700001402511700001702525700002202542773015102564856004102715852000902756655001202765IND50072335920221119162022.0140127e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007233592DNAL7 a10.1111/ajgw.120492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRisco, D.10aEarly defoliation in a temperate warm and semi‐arid Tempranillo vineyard: vine performance and grape composition  ap. 111-122.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Early defoliation (ED) can reduce vine yield and improve fruit composition in vigorous vineyards. The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of this technique for the Vitis vinifera (L.) cultivar Tempranillo under the temperate warm and semi‐arid climatic conditions of south‐eastern Spain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four treatments were applied over three seasons to drip‐irrigated vines, planted with rows orientated north–south and shoots vertically positioned. Non‐defoliated vines (control) were compared with vines defoliated either just before anthesis (phenological stage H, treatment ED) or at fruitset [phenological stage J, treatment late defoliation (LD)]. In the fourth treatment, only the leaves facing east were removed at phenological stage H (treatment east ED). In the fourth experimental season, all treatments were managed similarly. Defoliation did not reduce fruitset but reduced berry mass, particularly in the ED and the LD treatments. Defoliation, however, had a cumulative negative effect on vine bud fertility. Even in the fourth experimental season, the yield of the ED treatment was 18% lower than that of the control. Both the ED and particularly the LD treatments increased berry total soluble solids (TSS) and phenolic concentration. The effect of leaf removal on berry TSS and phenolic concentration was not significant in the east ED treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Defoliation at fruitset was the most effective treatment for increasing berry phenolics and TSS while maintaining must acidity. Growers should take into account, however, the important yield penalty because of defoliation, particularly in the mid‐term. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Early defoliation of Tempranillo grapes growing in semi‐arid and temperate climates needs to be applied with caution and probably limited to specific seasons while consecutive defoliations should be avoided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aacidity 3aclimatic factors 3adefoliation 3aflowering 3afruit composition 3agrapes 3agrowers 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 3aplanting 3ashoots 3atotal soluble solids 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture1 aPérez, D.1 aYeves, A.1 aCastel, J.R.1 aIntrigliolo, D.S.0 tAustralian journal of grape and wine research.g2014 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.111-122dAustralian Society of Viticulture and Oenologyx1322-71307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajgw.12049  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245007600168300001800244500001900262520133900281592002801620650004401648650001501692650002101707650001701728650001201745650002101757650001601778653002701794653002201821653002501843700005901868700002301927700005801950773013902008856007802147852000902225655001202234IND60728779120221118024234.0210224e20210211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072877912DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c206912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarthi, Rajashekhar10aOn the Structure and Lithium Adsorption Mechanism of Layered H₂TiO₃  ap. 8361-8369.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLayered H₂TiO₃ has been studied as an ionic sieve material for the selective concentration of lithium from solutions. The accepted mechanism of lithium adsorption on H₂TiO₃ ion sieves is that it occurs via Li⁺–H⁺ ion exchange with no chemical bond breakage. However, in this work, we demonstrate that lithium adsorption on H₂TiO₃ occurs via O–H bond breakage and the formation of O–Li bonds, contrary to previously proposed mechanisms. Thermogravimetric analysis results show that the weight loss due to dehydroxylation decreases from 2.96 wt % to 0.8 wt % after lithium adsorption, indicating that surface hydroxyl groups break during lithium adsorption. Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies indicate that H₂TiO₃ contains isolated OH groups and hydrogen-bonded OH groups. Among these two hydroxyl groups, isolated OH groups present in the HTi₂ layers are more actively involved in lithium adsorption than hydrogen-bonded OH groups. As a result, the actual adsorption capacity is limited by the number of isolated OH groups, whereas hydrogen-bonded OH groups involved are for stabilizing the layered structure. We also show that H₂TiO₃ contains a high concentration of stacking faults and structural disorders which play a crucial role in controlling lithium adsorption properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3ahydrogen bonding 3aion exchange 3alithium 3athermogravimetry 3aweight loss 0alithium titanium oxide 0asurface hydroxyls 0aadsorption mechanism1 aAsgar, Hassnain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8427-51881 aGadikota, Greeshma1 aSmith, York R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0732-28490 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 11, v. 13, no. 7 p.8361-8369dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c206913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015800163300001600321520201700337592002802354596003302382596005902415596007902474650002002553650002202573650002002595650001202615650001702627650001702644650001402661650000902675650001602684650001302700650001802713650001202731651001002743700002002753700005602773700001402829700001102843700001402854700001702868700001502885773013702900856008303037852000903120655001203129IND60726126720221119045910.0220220e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072612672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-020-00711-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Litao10aDistribution characteristics and main influencing factors of selenium in surface soil of natural selenium-rich area: a case study in Langao County, China  ap. 333-346.  aIn order to study the distribution of selenium in surface soil and its main influencing factor, we collected 360 surface soil samples and four groups of soil profiles with 210 corresponding parent rock samples in Langao County, Shaanxi Province (a typical high-selenium area of Daba Mountain). Samples were analyzed for trace elements by using ICP-MS, ICP-OES and HG-AFS. The results show the following. (1) selenium content in surface soils of Langao County varies greatly (0.03–16.96 mg/kg). The mean selenium content in surface soils of Langao County is 0.99 mg/kg, higher than the global (0.4 mg/kg) and China (0.29 mg/kg) soil average, and 3.4 times the mean of soil selenium in China. (2) Selenium content of bedrock in Langao County also varies greatly (0.01–56.22 mg/kg), with an average selenium content of 2.02 mg/kg, which is 40 times higher than the upper crust (0.05 mg/kg). (3) Selenium content in the strata of the Late Precambrian–Early Paleozoic and its variation is an important factor affecting the spatial variation of soil selenium content. The black rock series (carbonaceous slate and silicon-bearing carbonaceous slate) of the Upper Ediacaran–Cambrian on the north side has the highest mean selenium content (> 7.92 mg/kg), and the selenium content of the surface soil in the distribution area can reach up to 16.96 mg/kg. The Middle Cambrian, Upper Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian (limestone and marl) in the south has the lowest mean selenium content (< 2 mg/kg), and the selenium content of surface soil in the distribution area is lower than 0.8 mg/kg mostly. (4) Soil samples at different depths in the same soil profile have similar composition of rare earth elements (REE), and bedrock and corresponding topsoil has similar composition of REE. This study indicates the selenium content in the topsoil varies greatly, even in high-selenium area. And the difference of selenium distribution is closely related to the original selenium content of the bedrock.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018FXZX02-16c2018FXZX02-16  a41472322cChinese National Natural Sciences Foundation  aAA17202026cthe Key Program of Special Science and Technology Plan Guangxi 3aCambrian period 3aOrdovician period 3aSilurian period 3abedrock 3acase studies 3ageochemistry 3alimestone 3amarl 3aparent rock 3aselenium 3asoil profiles 3atopsoil 3aChina1 aZhang, Jiandong1 aZhang, Shixi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6649-622X1 aMa, Sumin1 aLi, Bo1 aLong, Jie1 aFan, Jingsen1 aLuo, Kunli0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2021 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.333-346dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870049x0269-40427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-020-00711-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245009400165300001800259500001900277520140700296592002801703650002101731650001701752650001401769650001301783650002401796650001301820650001801833650001101851650001701862650001201879653001001891653001801901653001901919653002101938653002301959700002201982700005902004700005502063773013902118856007802257852000902335655001202344IND60728779220221118024249.0210224e20210208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072877922DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c207982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, Sierra J.10aMitigating Bubble Traffic in Gas-Evolving Electrodes via Spinodally Derived Architectures  ap. 8528-8537.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPorous electrodes are widely used in the industry because of their high surface area to volume ratio. However, the stochastic morphology of most commercially available porous electrodes results in poor electrical connections in the solid phase and inefficient mass transport through the pore phase. This can be especially detrimental for gas-evolving processes such as water electrolysis for hydrogen and oxygen generation. Bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) offer templates from which to create porous electrodes with robust solid-state interconnectivity and a uniform pore structure that facilitate improved electron and mass transport. In this study, gas release rates and electrochemical experiments are utilized to study the effects of powder- and bijel-derived microstructures on hydrogen generation by water electrolysis. The bijel-derived electrodes are shown to expel product gas faster and require up to 25% less overpotential to drive water electrolysis over the range of current densities tested (−5 to −40 mA/cm²) than their powder-derived analogs. Our findings suggest that the uniform and bicontinuous domains of bijel-derived porous electrodes can mitigate the limited current distribution and deleterious bubble effect found in stochastic electrodes, in turn improving the overall performance of electrolytic processes requiring transport of gaseous species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3aemulsions 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aindustry 3amass transfer 3aoxygen 3asurface area 3atraffic 0abijel 0agas evolution 0abubble traffic 0aporous electrode 0aspinodal structure1 aMcDevitt, Kyle M.1 aMumm, Daniel R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1385-55961 aMohraz, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5178-91660 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 08, v. 13, no. 7 p.8528-8537dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c207983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017100158300002000329520094400349592002801293650002101321650001401342650002401356650001401380650002901394650003201423650001501455650001401470650003701484700001901521700001701540700001801557700001701575700001501592773012501607856007401732852000901806655001201815IND60641992320221118224142.0190506e20170919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064199232DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04788f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Huazhou10aDiscriminatory analysis based molecular docking study for in silico identification of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) derivatives as B-Rafⱽ⁶⁰⁰ᴱ inhibitors  ap. 44820-44826.  aVirtual screening and biological testing were utilized to identify novel B-Rafⱽ⁶⁰⁰ᴱ inhibitors.

Results: A total of 26 original studies were found. Almost all the studies detected a circadian rhythm for the HRV parameters analysed. HRV increased during the night in particular and a nighttime peak during the second half of the night was identified. Conclusions: HRV follows a circadian rhythm. But until today, there isn′t any possibility to make quantitative statements about changes over the course of the day for planning short-term measurements. More qualitative studies must be carried in order to close this knowledge gaps.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircadian rhythm 3adatabases 3ahealth promotion 3aheart rate 3aplanning 3asystematic review 0aHeart rate variability 0acircadian 0asympathetic nervous system 0aparasympathetic nervous system 0aautonomic nervous system 0astress1 aSammito, Wiebke1 aBöckelmann, Irina0 tBiological rhythm research.g2016 Sept. 2, v. 47, no. 5 p.717-730dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2016.11838873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245006500152300002000217520077200237592002801009650002201037650001401059650001601073650003201089650002201121650001001143700002101153700001901174700002001193700001601213700001701229700001501246700001801261773012401279856007401403852000901477655001201486IND60641992620221118224157.0190506e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064199262DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04794k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wei10aNew prenylated coumarins from the stems of Toddalia asiatica  ap. 31061-31068.  aEight new prenylated coumarins (1a/1b, 2a/2b, and 3–6) including two pairs of enantiomers (1a/1b and 2a/2b), a new phenolic acid derivative, methyl (E)-3,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxobut-2-enoate (7), and 33 known compounds (8–40) were isolated from the stems of Toddalia asiatica.

The sleep of our volunteers was particularly restricted on weekdays. Moreover, later chronotype was associated with the need for compensation on weekends. Regarding the production of time, produced durations were consistently over-produced and there was an evident increase in the mean coefficient of variation (CV) from the wake-up morning to afternoon sessions, followed by a sharp decrease in the evening sessions. Importantly, CV was mainly determined by the interaction between MSFdiff, sleep duration on weekdays and age. In conclusion, our results indicate that when university students are under the effects of social jet lag and reduced sleep duration during weekdays, their performance in interval timing tasks may be compromised.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological rhythms 3acollege students 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3asleep deprivation 3avolunteers 0aInterval timing 0atime production 0asleep deprivation 0asocial jet lag 0achronotype 0acognitive performance1 aMenna Barreto, Luiz Silveira,0 tBiological rhythm research.g2016 Sept. 2, v. 47, no. 5 p.731-742dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2016.11916693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04005naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003000155245008700185500001900272520236200291592002802653650001802681650000902699650001002708650001702718650001602735650001402751650002002765650001602785650001102801650001102812650001402823650001502837650001102852650002402863650001402887650001002901650001502911650001202926651001502938653004702953653001903000653002103019653003203040653001803072653004003090700002203130700002003152700002403172700002403196773012003220856009003340852000903430655001203439IND60697921620221121190603.0200614e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069792162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2020.1111992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonis-González, Irwin R.10aColor vision system to assess English walnut (Juglans Regia) kernel pellicle color  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnglish walnut (Juglans regia) kernel pellicle color is an important component of consumer quality, as a breeding phenotype attribute, and a key factor affecting marketing price. It is part of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) grading criteria and it is assessed by trained Dried Fruit and Tree Nuts Association (DFA) of California inspectors, who visually segregate kernels into four DFA color categories: 1 (‘Extra light’), 2 (‘Light’), 3 (‘Light Amber’), and 4 (‘Amber’). The establishment of an objective and fast Color Visual System (CVS) will remove human variability and bias, adding consistency and can speed-up the color evaluation process. Therefore, a portable CVS was designed, built and its performance was evaluated using three datasets of kernels, with a diverse range of pellicle colors: 2,000 from a UC Davis seedling population, 1,238 from ‘Chandler’, and 857 from ‘Howard’ cultivars. Kernel pellicle color was measured using the DFA (1 to 4) visual scoring system, a colorimeter and the CVS. Relationships between these methods were analyzed using correlation, density plots, and stepwise logistic regression methodology was further applied to create a set of CVS kernel pellicle color prediction models, which can classify kernels into the DFA color categories. The CVS could segregate all 4095 kernel samples into the DFA color categories with an accuracy equal to 68.9 %. The use of independent prediction models per dataset significantly improved prediction: the ‘Chandler’ model was most accurate (88.8 %), followed by the seedling (80.4 %) and ‘Howard’ (75.1 %) models. Therefore, it is recommended that a cultivar-specific model be used to improve grading prediction accuracy. Model accuracy performance was further improved when the number of color categories was reduced to two categories by combining 1 (‘Extra Light’) and 2 (‘Light’) (Category 1), and 3 (‘Light Amber’) 4 (‘Amber’) (Category 2). Overall, the CVS used with a dataset-specific model described overall kernel pellicle color much better than a single colorimeter reading, making CVS a promising tool to assess kernel pellicle color. The CVS can be used as an objective and consistent method during commercial walnut kernel pellicle color grading and/or high-throughput phenotype breeding evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuglans regia 3aUSDA 3acolor 3acolor vision 3acolorimetry 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adried fruit 3ahumans 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aprices 3aregression analysis 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atechnology 3awalnuts 3aCalifornia 0aKernel visual color categories segregation 0aPellicle color 0aCIE color values 0aHigh-throughput phenotyping 0aDensity plots 0aStepwise logistic regression models1 aBergman, Shira M.1 aSideli, Gina M.1 aSlaughter, David C.1 aCrisosto, Carlos H.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2020 Sept., v. 167 p.111199-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2020.1111993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04054naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100001800186245017600204300001100380506007600391520206700467592002802534506003702562650002402599650002802623650001802651650001402669650002302683650002302706650001502729650002202744650001802766650002402784650000902808650001502817650001002832650001302842650001102855650002002866650001102886650002002897650000902917650004602926650001602972650001902988650001503007650002203022650001703044650002403061651001003085700001603095700002103111700002003132700001703152773015903169856007903328852000903407655001203416IND50063939220221207084750.0160319e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006393922DNAL7 aPMC35991042pmcid7 a234523722pmid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-10-302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Junghoon10aObjectively measured light-intensity lifestyle activity and sedentary time are independently associated with metabolic syndrome: a cross-sectional study of Japanese adults  ap. 30.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Reducing sedentary time and increasing lifestyle activities, including light-intensity activity, may be an option to help prevent metabolic syndrome (MetS). The purpose of the present study was to examine whether objectively measured light-intensity lifestyle activity and sedentary time is associated with MetS, independent of moderate–vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). METHODS: The participants in this cross-sectional study were 483 middle-aged Japanese adults, aged 30–64 years. The participants were divided into those with or without MetS according to the Japanese criteria for MetS. A triaxial accelerometer was used to measure light-intensity lifestyle activity [1.6–2.9 metabolic equivalents (METs)] and sedentary time (≤1.5 METs). Logistic regression was used to predict MetS from the levels of light-intensity lifestyle activity and sedentary time with age, sex, smoking, calorie intake, accelerometer wear time, and MVPA as covariates. RESULTS: The odds ratios (OR) for MetS in the highest and middle tertiles of light-intensity lifestyle activity were 0.44 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24 to 0.81] and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.29 to 0.89) relative to the lowest tertile, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, calorie intake, accelerometer wear time and MVPA (Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.012). Sedentary time was also associated with the risk of MetS (Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.018). Among participants in the highest tertile of sedentary time, the risk of MetS was 2.27-times greater than that in the lowest tertile (95% CI: 1.25 to 4.11). The risk of MetS was not significantly increased in subjects in the middle tertile of sedentary time. CONCLUSIONS: We found that light-intensity lifestyle activity and sedentary time were significantly associated with the risk of MetS, independent of MVPA. The results of our study suggest that public health messages and guidelines should be refined to include increases in light-intensity lifestyle activity and/or decreases in sedentary time, alongside promoting MVPA, to prevent MetS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy intake 3alifestyle 3ametabolic syndrome 3amiddle-aged adults 3aodds ratio 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3arisk 2aActigraphy 2aAdult 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexprevention & control. 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotor Activity 2aOdds Ratio 2aPhysical Exertion 2aRisk Factors 2aSedentary Behavior. 0aJapan1 aTanabe, Kai1 aYokoyama, Noriko1 aZempo, Hirofumi1 aKuno, Shinya0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.30-30dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-10-303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245009000165300001600255520122400271592002801495650001201523650001201535650001601547650001801563650001401581650002101595650001101616650000901627650001701636650002101653650001301674651002201687700001601709700002201725773013301747856007601880852000901956655001201965IND60445634520221117003106.0151029e19300101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044563452DNAL7 a10.5735/086.049.05042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSterzyńska, Maria10aEffect of Hydrologic Disturbance Regimes on Protura Variability in a River Floodplain  ap. 309-320.  aProtura, an almost neglected taxon in ecological studies of soil microarthropods, were examined at highly vulnerable sites of fluvial forest stands of the Transcarpathian Lowland. To compare the effects of different hydrologic disturbance regimes on Protura assemblages, we examined part of a river floodplain subjected to periodical inundation, and a non-inundated part with limited fluvial activity, behind the river embankment. Ten sites were selected for sampling, with four sites dominated by oak and one dominated by poplar in each part. The type of hydrologic disturbance regime in the river floodplain shaped Protura assemblages and influenced their variability. Highest abundance and species richness were correlated with the non-inundated part of the floodplain under oak stands, although Protura also tolerated soil conditions of exposure to regular inundation.

These versatile multiplex molecular-analogue structural clusters containing photonic band gap, fluorescent, and magnetic information can open a new promising access to a variety of robust hierarchical microstructural particle materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3acrystal structure 3afluorescence 3amaterials science 3aphotonics1 aYang, Shengyang1 aWang, Cai-Feng1 aChen, Su0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 138, no. 2 p.566-573dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b100393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006900144245014100213300001800354500001900372520128300391592002801674650002101702650001501723650001701738650001601755650001301771650001101784653002901795653004301824653000901867653000801876653005401884653001601938700005601954700006502010700001702075700001902092700006202111700005702173700005602230773013902286856007802425852000902503655001202512IND60728776620221118024140.0210224e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072877662DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c196662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanade, Chaitanya Kaluram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4146-584310aLow-Temperature and Large-Scale Production of a Transition Metal Sulfide Vertical Heterostructure and Its Application for Photodetectors  ap. 8710-8717.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe conventional synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures is low yielding and lack the heterojunction interface quality. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques have achieved high-quality heterostructure interfaces but require a high synthesis temperature (>600 °C) and have a low yield of heterostructures. Therefore, the large scale and high interface quality of TMDC heterojunctions using low-temperature synthesis methods are in demand. Here, high-quality, wafer-scale MoS₂ and WS₂ heterostructures with 2D interfaces were prepared by a one-step sulfurization of the molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) precursors via plasma-enhanced CVD at a relatively low temperature (150 °C). The 4 inch wafer-scale synthesis of the MoS₂–WS₂ heterostructures was validated using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Further, the photocurrent generation and photoswitching phenomenon of the so-obtained MoS₂–WS₂ heterostructures were studied. The photodevice prepared by the MoS₂–WS₂ heterostructures at 150 °C showed a photoresponsivity of 83.75 mA/W. The excellent photoresponse and faster photoswitching highlight the advantage of MoS₂–WS₂ heterostructures toward advanced photodetectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric current 3amolybdenum 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3atungsten 3avapors 0avertical heterostructure 0atransition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) 0aMoS2 0aWS2 0aplasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) 0aphotosensor1 aSeok, Hyunho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3189-59301 aKanade, Vinit Kaluram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3603-70031 aAydin, Kubra1 aKim, Hyeong -U1 aMitta, Sekhar Babu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8011-52911 aYoo, Won Jong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3767-79691 aKim, Taesung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6280-76680 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 13, no. 7 p.8710-8717dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c196663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100002200194245012800216300001600344506007600360520098700436592002801423506003701451650001201488650001301500650001101513650001401524650001301538650000901551650002001560650000901580650001401589650001101603650001901614650001401633650002001647650000901667651001601676651001801692653001601710653001101726653001201737653001301749653001401762653001401776700002001790773011601810856008801926852000902014655001202023IND60540227920221207083702.0190318e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054022792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.08.0072doi7 aPMC48542792pmcid7 a263372292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Nekesha10aSpatial and vertical distribution of metals in sediment cores from Río Espíritu Santo estuary, Puerto Rico, United States  ap. 445-452.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe concentration and distribution of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were investigated in three sediment cores representing 100–150years of accumulation in upriver, midriver, and estuarine environments in Río Espíritu Santo (RES), Puerto Rico. Grain-size distribution, organic matter and carbonate content were determined to assess their influence on metal concentrations. Minimum biotoxicity levels of Ni and Cu were exceeded in the upriver and midriver sites, while the minimum biotoxicity level of Cu was exceeded in the estuarine location. Pb concentration decreased by ~35% in the upper portion of the midriver and estuarine cores compared to downcore concentrations as a consequence of leaded gasoline regulation. Enrichment Factors and Geoaccumulation Indices were calculated for each metal revealing high levels of Cu in all three cores, likely from an igneous source.

A fast microwave assisted method was used to synthesise the CNPs resulting in good yields and an abundance of functional groups (carboxyl, hydroxyl groups etc.) which served as anchor sites for modification and adsorption. The pristine glucose-derived carbon nanoparticles (GCNPs) and functionalized CNPs (EDA–GCNPs) were characterised using TEM, BET, XRD, FTIR, surface charge and elemental analysis. Batch adsorption experiments were used to study the effect of factors such as pH, adsorbent dosage and the initial concentration of the metal ion of interest. From the adsorption studies, kinetics and sorption equilibrium were also studied, implying that both carbon nanoparticles could effectively remove cadmium through chemisorption (the data fitting a pseudo-second-order model), with maximum sorption capacities of 10.314 and 18.708 mg g⁻¹ for GCNPs and EDA–GCNPs, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3acarbon nanoparticles 3aethylenediamines 3amicrowave treatment 3amodels 3amoieties 3apH 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aArotiba, Omotayo A.0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 07, v. 7, no. 54 p.34226-34235dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04709f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013100173300001600304520144000320592002801760650001001788650002601798650002501824650001301849650001101862650001801873650001601891650002401907651001201931651002301943651001201966651001501978651001201993651001102005653001802016653001602034653001702050653002502067700003102092700002602123700002402149700002302173773007802196856008102274852000902355655001202364IND50072330820221119162108.0160511e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007233082DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-013-0312-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakovljević, Ksenija10aLeaf anatomy of Carex humilis does not correlate with orographic, geological and bioclimatic habitat conditions in C&SE Europe  ap. 332-340.  aThis paper presents the results of a multivariate morphometric study of leaf anatomical characters in different, geographically very distant populations of taxon Carex humilis from Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro and Albania with the aim to reveal the trends of population differentiation. Analyses were performed on the cross-section of 173 leaves collected from 12 populations. In order to establish the overall morphological variation and relationships between individuals from all populations, principal component analyses (PCA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) have been done. The UPGMA clustering analyses based on leaf anatomical characters and habitat climatic characteristics were carried out to explore whether the observed anatomical differences are a result of adaptive responses. Regression analysis (linear regression) was performed to identify the level of correlation between leaf anatomical characters and basic orographic, geological, and bioclimatic habitat characteristics. Quite unexpectedly, most of observed groups are formed of geographically very distant populations which are living in extremely different climatic and geological conditions, indicating that general anatomical differentiation in Carex humilis in C&SE Europe cannot be explained by the environmental impacts, and basically do not represent an adaptive response to different climatic or geological condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3alinear models 3amorphometry 3aregression analysis 3aAlbania 3aBosnia-Herzegovina 3aHungary 3aMontenegro 3aRomania 3aSerbia 0aCarex humilis 0aC&SE Europe 0aleaf anatomy 0astatistical analysis1 aŠinžar-Sekulić, Jasmina1 aVukojičić, Snežana1 aKuzmanović, Nevena1 aLakušić, Dmitar,0 tBiologia.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 69, no. 3 p.332-340dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0312-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009700177300001800274520116900292592002801461650002201489650001601511650002501527650001601552650001401568650001301582650001601595650002301611650001401634650001301648650001601661650001901677650001101696650002001707650001001727653001801737653001701755653002001772653001101792653002201803700002301825700001901848700002601867700001901893700001901912700001901931773010701950856008502057852000902142655001202151IND60537053720221120033917.0160807e20160728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053705372DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2015.10899022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahzād, Muḥammad,10aGrowth-related changes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes grown under salinity stress  ap. 1257-1265.  aThe sensitivity of crop genotypes determines the level of growth reduction by salinity.

V.10aSinglet Fission in a Covalently Linked Cofacial Alkynyltetracene Dimer  ap. 617-627.  aSinglet fission is a process in which a singlet exciton converts into two triplet excitons. To investigate this phenomenon, we synthesized two covalently linked 5-ethynyl-tetracene (ET) dimers with differing degrees of intertetracene overlap: BET-X, with large, cofacial overlap of tetracene π-orbitals, and BET-B, with twisted arrangement between tetracenes exhibits less overlap between the tetracene π-orbitals. The two compounds were crystallographically characterized and studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy in solution, in PMMA and neat thin films. The results show that singlet fission occurs within 1 ps in an amorphous thin film of BET-B with high efficiency (triplet yield: 154%). In solution and the PMMA matrix the S₁ of BET-B relaxes to a correlated triplet pair ¹(T₁T₁) on a time scale of 2 ps, which decays to the ground state without forming separated triplets, suggesting that triplet energy transfer from ¹(T₁T₁) to a nearby chromophore is essential for producing free triplets. In support of this hypothesis, selective excitation of BET-B doped into a thin film of diphenyltetracene (DPT) leads to formation of the ¹(T₁T₁) state of BET-B, followed by generation of both DPT and BET-B triplets. For the structurally cofacial BET-X, an intermediate forms in <180 fs and returns to the ground state more rapidly than BET-B. First-principles calculations predict a 2 orders of magnitude faster rate of singlet fission to the ¹(T₁T₁) state in BET-B relative to that of crystalline tetracene, attributing the rate increase to greater coupling between the S₁ and ¹(T₁T₁) states and favorable energetics for formation of the separated triplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy transfer 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aspectroscopy1 aDas, Saptaparna1 aNett, Zachary1 aFeng, Xintian1 aJoy, Jimmy1 aHaiges, Ralf1 aKrylov, Anna I.1 aBradforth, Stephen E.1 aThompson, Mark E.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 138, no. 2 p.617-627dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b105503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245007200166300001800238500000900256520110900265592002801374650001901402650001001421650002201431650001401453650001901467650001301486650002301499650001501522650001201537650001501549650001501564650001901579650001101598650000901609650001101618650001001629650001601639700001901655700001901674700001901693700001501712700001901727773013501746856007801881852000901959655001201968IND60663473720221120043626.0191122e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066347372DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj15.01852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLynch, Tiina M.

These assessments are traditionally performed visually, but digital imaging can provide a more accurate method of ground-cover scoring. Differences in ground cover between late-heading perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) cultivars in four trials (2 yr of sowing and two sites) were determined using both digital imaging and visual scoring. Ground-cover percentages were calculated from digital images with public-domain software on the basis of color separation of grass leaves from bare soil. For both years of sowing, highly significant interactions of cultivar and site were detected. Significant differences between cultivars were detected in three out of four trials, with diploid cultivars having greater cover than tetraploids in the older trials. Thus digital image analysis of ground cover may be a useful tool in crop improvement and provision of guidelines regarding suitability of a particular cultivar for a particular site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3acolor 3acomputer software 3acultivars 3adigital images 3adiploidy 3adisease resistance 3adurability 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aguidelines 3aimage analysis 3aleaves 3asoil 3asowing 3asward 3atetraploidy1 aBarth, Susanne1 aDix, Philip J.1 aGrogan, Dermot1 aGrant, Jim1 aGrant, Olga M.0 tAgronomy journal.g2015 Nov., v. 107, no. 6 p.2347-2352dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj15.01853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010700175300001600282520141700298592002801715650002201743650002701765650003501792650001401827650001701841650001701858650001601875651001001891653002901901653004101930653002601971653002301997653002402020653002002044700002002064700001502084773011202099856008602211852000902297655001202306IND60592479720221118040606.0201209e20180520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059247972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.3062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadhi, Sidhartha S.10aFramework for selecting sustainable supply chain processes and industries using an integrated approach  ap. 969-984.  aThis study introduces a process view of sustainable supply chain management and identifies 17 sustainable supply chain processes (SSCPs) from literature. Further, a framework is proposed to identify the significance of various SSCPs on firm performance using the theoretical lenses of stakeholder theory and resource based view. Through a semi-structured interview of stakeholders, critical SSCPs across eight industries were identified in the Indian context. The study identifies five important SSCPs, such as sustainable design and development, strategic sourcing and efficient technology and sustainable product returns and recycling. Among the selected industries, pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical industries were identified to be the front-runners in SSCPs practice. Subsequently, these five processes and three industries were evaluated using strategic decision making approach by integrating group decision making and fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methods. To handle the uncertainties of strategic decision making, six Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods have been applied and compared to understand their relevance while evaluating the above industries, based on the above identified SSCPs. This study introduces an approach to enhance sustainability of supply chain that can be extended across industries through a process view of supply chain, in emerging economies like India.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical industry 3adesign for environment 3amulti-criteria decision making 3arecycling 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3auncertainty 3aIndia 0aSustainable supply chain 0aFuzzy multi-criteria decision making 0aGroup decision making 0aStakeholder theory 0aResource based view 0aIndian industry1 aPati, Rupesh K.1 aRajeev, A.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 May 20, v. 184 p.969-984dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.3063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012200171300001600293520129300309592002801602650001101630650002201641650001301663650002701676650001401703650004701717653001101764653002201775653000901797653000901806653001401815700002301829700001701852773007801869856008101947852000902028655001202037IND50072331020221119162004.0160511e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007233102DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-013-0314-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel Khalik, Kadry10aGenetic diversity and relationships among Egyptian Galium (Rubiaceae) and related species using ISSR and RAPD markers  ap. 300-310.  aGenetic diversity and phylogenetic analyses of 24 species, representing nine sections of the genus Galium (Rubiaceae), have been made using the Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and combined ISSR and RAPD markers. Four ISSR primers and three RAPD primers generated 250 polymorphic amplified fragments. The results of this study showed that the level of genetic variation in Galium is relatively high. RAPD markers revealed a higher level of polymorphism (158 bands) than ISSR (92 bands). Clustering of genotypes within groups was not similar when RAPD and ISSR derived dendrograms were compared. Six clades can be recognized within Galium, which mostly corroborate, but also partly contradict, traditional groupings. UPGMA-based dendrogram showed a close relationship between members of section Leiogalium with G. verum and G. humifusum (sect. Galium), and G. angustifolium (sect. Lophogalium). Principal coordinated analysis, however, showed some minor differences with UPGMA-based dendrograms. The more apomorphic groups of Galium form the section Leiogalium clade including the perennial sections Galium, Lophogalium, Jubogalium, Hylaea and Leptogalium as well as the annual section Kolgyda. The remaining taxa of Galium are monophyletic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalium 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 0aGalium 0agenetic diversity 0aISSR 0aRAPD 0aRubiaceae1 aAbd El-Twab, Magdy1 aGalal, Rasha0 tBiologia.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 69, no. 3 p.300-310dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-013-0314-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011600174300001600290520106600306592002801372650001701400650001101417650002501428650001201453650001501465650001401480650001101494650001301505650001101518650002001529650001501549650002001564650000901584653002001593653001601613653001101629653001401640653001001654653001401664700002101678773011601699856008801815852000901903655001201912IND60540228320221119142233.0190318e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054022832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOakes, Joanne M.10aWastewater nitrogen and trace metal uptake by biota on a high-energy rocky shore detected using stable isotopes  ap. 406-413.  aOn high-energy rocky shores receiving treated wastewater, impacts are difficult to distinguish against a highly variable background and are localised due to rapid dilution. We demonstrate that nitrogen stable isotope values (δ15N) of rocky shore biota are highly sensitive to wastewater inputs. For macroalgae (Ulva lactuca and Endarachne binghamiae), grazing snails (Bembicium nanum and Nerita atramentosa), and predatory snails (Morula marginalba), δ15N was enriched near a wastewater outfall and declined with distance, returning to background levels within 290m. Any of these species therefore indicates the extent of influence of wastewater, allowing identification of an appropriate scale for studies of ecosystem impacts. For M. marginalba, significant regressions between δ15N and tissue copper, manganese, and zinc concentrations indicate a possible wastewater source for these metals. This suggests that δ15N is a proxy for exposure to wastewater contaminants, and may help to attribute variations in rocky shore communities to wastewater impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUlva lactuca 3acopper 3aenvironmental impact 3agrazing 3amacroalgae 3amanganese 3amorula 3anitrogen 3asnails 3astable isotopes 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3azinc 0aStable isotopes 0aRocky shore 0aSewage 0aGastropod 0aAlgae 0aAustralia1 aEyre, Bradley D.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 100, no. 1 p.406-413dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011000172520148700282592002801769650001501797650002001812650001501832650001901847650001901866650002201885650001101907650001201918650001501930650002601945653002601971653000901997653002302006653002002029653002702049653001802076700002102094700002402115700002702139700002502166700001902191700002902210700002002239700002402259700002002283700002502303773010502328856008602433852000902519655001202528IND60750584020221122052358.0211123e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075058402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1269362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Prima, Simone10aBEST-WR: An adapted algorithm for the hydraulic characterization of hydrophilic and water-repellent soils  aWater-repellent soils usually experience water flow impedance during the early stage of a wetting process followed by progressive increase of infiltration rate. Current infiltration models are not formulated to describe this peculiar process. Similarly, simplified methods of soil hydraulic characterization (e.g., BEST) are not equipped to handle water-repellent soils. Here, we present an adaptation of the BEST method, named BEST-WR, for the hydraulic characterization of soils at any stage of water-repellency. We modified the Haverkamp explicit transient infiltration model, included in BEST for modeling infiltration data, by embedding a scaling factor describing the rate of attenuation of infiltration rate due to water repellency. The new model was validated using analytically generated data, involving soils with different texture and a dataset that included data from 60 single-ring infiltration tests. The scaling factor was used as a new index to assess soil water repellency in a Mediterranean wooded grassland, where the scattered evergreen oak trees induced more noticeable water repellency under the canopies as compared to the open spaces. The new index produced results in line with those obtained using the water drop penetration time test, which is one of the most widely test applied for quantifying soil water repellency persistence. Finally, we used BEST-WR to determine the hydraulic characteristic curves under both hydrophilic and hydrophobic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3agrasslands 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ainfiltration rate 3amodels 3atexture 3awater flow 3awater repellent soils 0aSoil water repellency 0aBEST 0aWater infiltration 0aWater retention 0aHydraulic conductivity 0aInfiltrometer1 aStewart, Ryan D.1 aAbou Najm, Majdi R.1 aRibeiro Roder, Ludmila1 aGiadrossich, Filippo1 aCampus, Sergio1 aAngulo-Jaramillo, Rafael1 aYılmaz, Deniz,1 aRoggero, Pier Paolo1 aPirastru, Mario1 aLassabatere, Laurent0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Dec., v. 603 p.126936-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1269363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016100170300001800331520160100349592002801950650002301978650003102001650001302032650002102045650001702066650002602083650001802109650001002127650002102137650001802158650001102176650001402187650001202201650001202213650002902225650001302254653002702267653003202294653001802326653002302344653001902367700002202386700001702408700001702425700002102442700001602463700002202479700002002501700001802521700002502539773009902564856008602663852000902749655001202758IND60570257620221116215826.0190319e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057025762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Sarbari10aNeem leaf glycoprotein generates superior tumor specific central memory CD8+ T cells than cyclophosphamide that averts post-surgery solid sarcoma recurrence  ap. 4421-4429.  aThe success of cancer vaccines is limited as most of them induce corrupted CD8+ T cell memory populations. We reported earlier that a natural immunomodulator, neem leaf glycoprotein (NLGP), therapeutically restricts tumor growth in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Here, our objective is to study whether memory CD8+ T cell population is generated in sarcoma hosts after therapeutic NLGP treatment and their role in prevention of post-surgery tumor recurrence, in comparison to the immunostimulatory metronomic cyclophosphamide (CTX) treatment. We found that therapeutic NLGP and CTX treatment generates central memory CD8+ T (TCM) cells with characteristic CD44+CD62LhighCCR7highIL-2high phenotypes. But these TCM cells are functionally impaired to prevent re-appearance of tumors along with compromised proliferative, IL-2 secretive and cytotoxic status. This might be due to the presence of tumor load, even a small one in the host, which serves as a persistent source of tumor antigens thereby corrupting the TCM cells so generated. Surgical removal of the persisting tumors from the host restored the functional characteristics of memory CD8+ T cells, preventing tumor recurrence after surgery till end of the experiment. Moreover, we observed that generation of superior TCM cells in NLGP treated surgically removed tumor hosts is related to the activation of Wnt signalling in memory CD8+ T cells with concomitant inhibition of GSK-3β and stabilisation of β-catenin, which ultimately activates transcription of Wnt target genes, like, eomesodermin, a signature molecule of CD8+ TCM cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3acyclophosphamide 3acytotoxicity 3afunctional properties 3aglycoproteins 3ahosts 3aimmunostimulants 3ainterleukin-2 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3asarcoma 3asurgery 3atranscription (genetics) 3avaccines 0aNeem leaf glycoprotein 0aCentral memory CD8+ T cells 0aTumor surgery 0aSarcoma recurrence 0aWnt signalling1 aSarkar, Madhurima1 aGhosh, Tithi1 aGuha, Ipsita1 aBhuniya, Avishek1 aSaha, Akata1 aDasgupta, Shayani1 aBarik, Subhasis1 aBose, Anamika1 aBaral, Rathindranath0 tVaccine.g2017 Aug. 03, v. 35, no. 34 p.4421-4429dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03702naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007900167300001800246520210100264592002802365650001002393650001502403650001302418650001002431650001802441650002002459650001202479650001202491650002002503650001502523650002502538650001602563650002602579650001302605650001102618650002302629650000702652650001202659650001702671650002102688650001402709650001002723650000902733650001002742700002802752700002302780700002302803700002402826700002302850700001802873773010802891856008102999990002303080852000903103655001203112IND60099247420221119180624.0141105e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009924742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2011.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCobert, Florian10aExperimental identification of Ca isotopic fractionations in higher plants  ap. 5467-5482.  aHydroponic experiments have been performed in order to identify the co-occurring geochemical and biological processes affecting the Ca isotopic compositions within plants. To test the influence of the Ca concentration and pH of the nutritive solution on the Ca isotopic composition of the different plant organs, four experimental conditions were chosen combining two different Ca concentrations (5 and 60ppm) and two pHs (4 and 6). The study was performed on rapid growing bean plants in order to have a complete growth cycle. Several organs (root, stem, leaf, reproductive) were sampled at two different growth stages (10days and 6weeks of culture) and prepared for Ca isotopic measurements. The results allow to identify three Ca isotopic fractionation levels. The first one takes place when Ca enters the lateral roots, during Ca adsorption on cation-exchange binding sites in the apoplasm. The second one takes place when Ca is bound to the polygalacturonic acids (pectins) of the middle lamella of the xylem cell wall. Finally, the last fractionation occurs in the reproductive organs, also caused by cation-exchange processes with pectins. However, the cell wall structures of these organs and/or number of available exchange sites seem to be different to those of the xylem wall. These three physico-chemical fractionation mechanisms allow to enrich the organs in the light ⁴⁰Ca isotope. The amplitude of the Ca isotopic fractionation within plant organs is highly dependent on the composition of the nutritive solution: low pH (4) and Ca concentrations (5ppm) have no effect on the biomass increase of the plants but induce smaller fractionation amplitudes compared to those obtained from other experimental conditions. Thus, Ca isotopic signatures of bean plants are controlled by the external nutritive medium. This study highlights the potential of Ca isotopes to be applied in plant physiology (to identify Ca uptake, circulation and storage mechanisms within plants) and in biogeochemistry (to identify Ca recycling, Ca content and pH evolutions in soil solutions through time).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aadsorption 3aapoplast 3abeans 3abinding sites 3abiogeochemistry 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3acell walls 3adevelopmental stages 3ahydroponics 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3anutrient solutions 3apH 3apectins 3aplant organs 3aplant physiology 3arecycling 3aroots 3asoil 3axylem1 aSchmitt, Anne-Desirée,1 aBourgeade, Pascale1 aLabolle, François1 aBadot, Pierre-Marie1 aChabaux, François1 aStille, Peter0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 75, no. 19 p.5467-5482dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2011.06.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245008600174300001600260520088700276592002801163650001101191650001301202650001201215700002201227700001701249773007501266856008901341852000901430655001201439IND60095897720221119152516.0141104e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009589772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalkin, Robert10aControl of unstable crack propagation through bio-inspired interface modification  ap. 122-130.  aSelective toughening can be used to improve specific interfaces in a fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) component which may otherwise act as crack initiation sites. Interfacial tougheners (such as interleaves and powder treatments) have typically been deployed in a simplistic manner. However, by discretely and judiciously introducing toughening agents, taking inspiration from nature, a step change in toughness characteristics can be demonstrated. Cracks propagating through these toughened regions give rise to interesting fracture phenomena. The work presented herein shows that by incorporating regions of variable toughness, unstable crack propagation can be avoided and graceful degradation to failure demonstrated. Using both Mode I double cantilever beam testing and finite element modelling this study shows how selective toughening can be used without unstable crack growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3apolymers 3atesting1 aTrask, Richard S.1 aBond, Ian P.0 tComposites.g2013 Mar., v. 46 p.122-130dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245005600168300001600224520091300240592002801153650002801181650002001209650001101229650003301240650001701273650001701290700001901307700002301326773007501349856008901424852000901513655001201522IND60095897820221119152503.0141104e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009589782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yi10aProfile forming of pre-pressed wood-strand preforms  ap. 131-139.  aProfile forming of wood-strand composites requires an understanding of the forming characteristics of the preforms prior to curing. The profile forming behavior of the pre-pressed preforms was studied with single-curvature V-bending and the thickness recovery of the preforms was measured. Three failure types were identified based on the primary failure mechanisms in V-bending: buckling and shear slip. As an important indicator of the forming defects (thinning and buckling), the initial failure in V-bending was predicted with a strength-based model. The effects of preform conditions on forming characteristics were examined with a response surface model. An understanding of the relationship between preform characteristics and potential defects during profile forming prior to the final curing stage will facilitate development of the underpinning science of profile forming of wood-strand composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite wood products 3acompressed wood 3amodels 3aresponse surface methodology 3ashear stress 3awood defects1 aYadama, Vikram1 aBhattacharyya, D.,0 tComposites.g2013 Mar., v. 46 p.131-139dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245010000184300001600284520142500300592002801725506003701753650001801790650001801808650001001826650001401836650002801850650001701878650001901895650001601914650001401930650002401944650002601968650001401994650002602008650002102034700001502055700001902070773012602089852000902215856008302224655001202307IND2202718420221207131339.0220904e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220271842DNAL7 a254878602pmid7 a10.1177/0261192999027004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamoto, Yuuko10aIn Vitro Alternatives and Phototoxicity Testing. I. Evaluation of In Vitro Phototoxicity Assays  ap. 639-664.  aThree in vitro phototoxicity assays — the photohaemolysis assay, the haemoglobin (Hb) photo-oxidation assay, and the 3T3 cell neutral red uptake phototoxicity (3T3 NRU PT) assay — were evaluated for use as screening methods in predicting the phototoxicity of test substances. Twenty-seven test substances, including cosmetic ingredients and drugs, were assessed in this study. The phototoxicity predicted in each assay was compared with that in guinea-pigs. In total, nine phototoxic substances used in this study could be detected by some of the in vitro phototoxicity assays. Eleven test substances regarded as non-phototoxic in vivo were predicted as non-phototoxic in the in vitro assays. Of the eight false positives revealed in some of the in vitro assays, five are believed to be photo-allergens. This suggests that in vitro phototoxicity assays might not be able to discriminate clearly between in vivo phototoxicity and in vivo photo-allergy, because the mechanisms in both processes are based on photodynamic reactions. The predictability of the three in vitro assays was comparatively good, but positive predictive values were low. The equivalence values of the photohaemolysis assay, the Hb photo-oxidation assay and the 3T3 NRU PT assay were 81%, 70% and 70%, respectively. From these results, we suggest that the three in vitro phototoxicity assays could be used as screens in predicting phototoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adose response 3aphototoxicity 3adrugs 3abioassays 3aanimal use alternatives 3aerythrocytes 3acultured cells 3aguinea pigs 3ahemolysis 3achemical substances 3aanti-infective agents 3ascreening 3aultraviolet radiation 3aapplication rate1 aRyu, Akemi1 aOhkoshi, Kenji0 tATLA.

Artisan fermented sausages are often perceived as superior to industrial variants, partially because of the specific microbiota due to spontaneous acidification, which may be considered as an artisan characteristic. Therefore, two kinds of spontaneously acidified Belgian sausages were prepared (Belgian-type salami and Boulogne sausage), but with addition of a Staphylococcus carnosus culture. The Belgian-type salami was made from pork and beef, whereas the Boulogne sausage contained pork and horse meat. In all cases, Lactobacillus sakei was the dominant LAB species present on the raw materials and during fermentation, whereas enterococci remained present in the background. Enterobacteriaceae vanished after fermentation. The CNS species diversity on the raw materials was large and differed between the pork, beef, and horse meat. Nevertheless, this species diversity was annihilated during fermentation by the added S. carnosus culture. The volatiles fraction was mainly composed of aldehydes that originated from lipid oxidation and spices-derived compounds. Aromatic compounds that are typically associated to CNS activity, such as end-products from the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids, were not present in the Belgian-type salami and only marginally present in the Boulogne sausage. In conclusion, spontaneous acidification of Belgian-type fermented sausages leads to dominance of L. sakei and is no guarantee for bacterial contribution to the aroma profile when S. carnosus is added as a starter culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aStaphylococcus carnosus 3aacidification 3aaldehydes 3aamino acid metabolism 3aaromatic compounds 3abeef 3afermentation 3ahorse meat 3alactic acid bacteria 3alipid peroxidation 3aodors 3apork 3araw materials 3asalami 3aspecies diversity 3astarter cultures 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aFermentation 2aLactobacillusxmetabolism 2aMeat Productsxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aMetagenome 2aStaphylococcusxmetabolism 2aSwine 0aBelgium1 aMyter, N.1 aDe Vuyst, L.1 aLeroy, F.0 tFood microbiology.g2012 Apr., v. 29, no. 2 p.167-177dElsevier Ltdx0740-00207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2011.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014400170520134000314592002801654650003301682650001601715650002301731650003001754650001101784650001401795650001501809650003001824650001501854653001101869653002401880653002401904653002601928653001401954700001501968700001801983700001502001773011902016856008502135852000902220655001202229IND60770093220221117161724.0220411e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077009322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2022.1301282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mingming14aThe His23 and Lys79 pair determines the high catalytic efficiency of the inorganic pyrophosphatase of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily  aHaloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily members are mainly phosphomonoesterases, while BT2127 from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron of the HAD superfamily is identified as an inorganic pyrophosphatase. In this study, to explore the roles of the Lys79 and His23 pair in the hydrolysis reaction of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPᵢ) catalyzed by BT2127, a series of models were designed. Calculations were performed by using the density functional theory (DFT) method with the dispersion energy D3-B3LYP. The His23 and Lys79 pair plays a key role in the high catalytic efficiency of BT2127 with PPi. First, the His23 and Lys79 pair prompts Asp13 to easily provide a proton to the leaving group, which remarkably reduces the energy barrier of the phospho-transfer step; then, Lys79 provides a proton to the first leaving phosphate group via His23, produces a more electrically stabilized phosphate (H₃PO₄), makes this step exothermal, and further promotes the subsequent phospho-enzyme intermediate hydrolysis. The results suggest that the Lys79-His23 pair helps BT2127 reach high catalytic efficiency by strengthening the acid catalysis. Our study provides detailed chemical insights into the evolution of the inorganic pyrophosphatase function of BT2127 from the phosphomonoesterase of the HAD superfamily and the biomimetic enzyme design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides thetaiotaomicron 3abiomimetics 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aevolution 3ahydrolysis 3ainorganic pyrophosphatase 3aphosphates 0aBT2127 0aCatalytic mechanism 0aHydrolysis reaction 0aFunctional divergence 0aEvolution1 aYang, Ling1 aDing, Wanjian1 aZhang, Hao0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2022 June, v. 1866, no. 6 p.130128-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2022.1301283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245005000182300001600232520065100248592002800899650001400927650001100941650002300952650001400975650001300989650001501002650005801017650002701075650004401102650002901146650005201175650001301227650002101240650004601261700001901307773012801326856004801454852000901502655001201511IND4474548720221118032930.0120416e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447454872DNAL7 a223920082pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-012-0577-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRattan, G.

Following three applications of Ridomil-MZ @ 0.3% and 0.6%, the average initial deposits of metalaxyl were observed to be 0.19 and 0.24 mg kg−1, respectively. The residues dissipated below the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.02 mg kg−1 after 10 days at both the dosages. The half-life values (T1/2) of metalaxyl was worked out to be 3.5 and 3.0 days, respectively at 0.3% and 0.6% concentration. Thus, a waiting period of 1 day was suggested for the safe consumption of metalaxyl treated cucumber.  aPublisher supplied data 3acucumbers 3afruits 3agas chromatography 3ametalaxyl 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 2aAlaninexanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aCucumis sativusxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aModels, Chemical 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysisxmetabolism.1 aSharma, Neeraj0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2012 May, v. 88, no. 5 p.769-771dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-012-0577-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245018300155300001800338520061100356592002800967650000800995650001401003650001101017650002301028650002301051650001301074650001301087650001101100700001801111700002001129700001501149773010601164856007501270852000901345655001201354IND60578397820221121215442.0170813e20120706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057839782DNAL7 a10.1021/ol301130u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chun10aCopper-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Cross-Dehydrogenative Coupling of Amine and α-Carbonyl Aldehyde: A Practical and Efficient Approach to α-Ketoamides with Wide Substrate Scope  ap. 3280-3283.  aA copper-catalyzed aerobic oxidative cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of amine with α-carbonyl aldehyde has been developed. Many types of amines are tolerant in this transformation leading to various α-ketoamides compounds. Wide substrate scope, CDC strategy and using air as oxidant make this transformation highly efficient and practical. Molecular oxygen acts not only as the oxidant, but also as an initiator to trigger this catalytic process. Furthermore, mechanism studies show that carbonyl group of α-carbonyl aldehyde plays a role as the directing group to facilitate this chemical process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaldehydes 3aamines 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3amoieties 3aoxidants 3aoxygen1 aZong, Xiaolin1 aZhang, Liangren1 aJiao, Ning0 tOrganic letters.g2012 July 06, v. 14, no. 13 p.3280-3283dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fol301130u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01208naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245007100170300001400241520043300255592002800688650001200716650001200728650000900740773013900749856005700888852000900945655001200954IND4479653020221118042804.0120418e197006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447965302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1970.tb00070.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, A.C.12aA note on hidden gains and losses of buffer stock schemes for wool  ap. 72-76.  aThis note is concerned with one aspect of the methodology for examining the gains and losses of a buffer stock scheme for wool.

Exercise can suppress subjective appetite ratings, subsequent energy intake, and alter appetite-regulating hormones, including ghrelin, peptide YY, and glucagon-like peptide 1(GLP-1) for a period of time post-exercise. Discrepancies in the degree of appetite suppression with exercise may be dependent on subject characteristics (e.g., body fatness, fitness level, age or sex) and exercise duration, intensity, type and mode. Following an acute bout of exercise, exercise-trained males experience appetite suppression, while data in exercise-trained women are limited and equivocal. Diet can also impact appetite, with low-energy dense diets eliciting a greater sense of fullness at a lower energy intake. To date, little research has examined the combined interaction of exercise and diet on appetite and energy intake. This review focuses on exercise-trained men and women and examines the impact of exercise on hormonal regulation of appetite, post-exercise energy intake, and subjective and objective measurements of appetite. The impact that low-energy dense diets have on appetite and energy intake are also addressed. Finally, the combined effects of high-intensity exercise and low-energy dense diets are examined. This research is in exercise-trained women who are often concerned with weight and body image issues and consume low-energy dense foods to keep energy intakes low. Unfortunately, these low-energy intakes can have negative health consequences when combined with high-levels of exercise. More research is needed examining the combined effect of diet and exercise on appetite regulation in fit, exercise-trained individuals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aappetite 3abody image 3adiet 3aenergy intake 3aexercise 3afoods 3aghrelin 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3ahormonal regulation 3amales 3amen 3apeptide YY 3apublic health 3awomen1 aHand, Taryn M.1 aManore, Melinda M.0 tNutrients.g2014 Nov. 10, v. 6, no. 11 p.4935-4960dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu61149353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009600164300001600260520056400276592002800840650002900868650001200897650002300909650001000932650001900942650000900961650002700970650001400997650002401011650001301035700001701048700001601065700001701081773010501098856004801203852000901251655001201260IND50059575620221118075324.0121102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005957562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-012-9651-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Zhiguo10aEighteen novel polymorphic microsatellites for the swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus)  ap. 825-828.  aEighteen novel polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated from the swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus, and characterized in a cultured stock of swimming crab.

Forty male rats were randomized into baseline (BL), sham (SH), orchidectomized (ORX), annatto tocotrienol-treated (AnTT) and testosterone enanthate-treated (TE) groups. The BL group was sacrificed upon receipt. All rats except the SH group underwent bilateral orchidectomy. Annatto tocotrienol at 60 mg/kg body weight was administered orally daily to the AnTT group for eight weeks. Testosterone enanthate at 7 mg/kg body weight was administered intramuscularly once weekly for eight weeks to the TE group. The rat femurs were collected for static histomorphometric analysis upon necropsy. The results indicated that the ORX group had significantly higher osteoclast surface and eroded surface, and significantly lower osteoblast surface, osteoid surface and osteoid volume compared to the SH group (p < 0.05). Annatto tocotrienol and testosterone enanthate intervention prevented all these changes (p < 0.05). The efficacy of annatto tocotrienol was on par with testosterone enanthate. In conclusion, annatto tocotrienol at 60 mg/kg can prevent the imbalance in bone remodeling caused by increased osteoclast and bone resorption, and decreased osteoblast and bone formation. This serves as a basis for the application of annatto tocotrienol in hypogonadal men as an antiosteoporotic agent.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBixa orellana 3abody weight 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3acastration 3afemur 3amales 3amen 3anecropsy 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3aosteoporosis 3arats 3atestosterone 3atocotrienols1 aAbdul-Majeed, Saif1 aFozi, Nur Farhana Mohd.1 aIma-Nirwana, Soelaiman0 tNutrients.g2014 Nov. 10, v. 6, no. 11 p.4974-4983dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu61149743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245010300179300001400282520109400296592002801390650001601418650001101434650001801445650002401463650001201487650001701499650001301516650001301529650001501542650002401557650001301581650002501594650001101619700002101630700001501651700002801666773007301694856008901767852000901856655001201865IND60095898620221119152327.0141104e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009589862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhadnis, Vaibhav A.10aDrilling in carbon/epoxy composites: Experimental investigations and finite element implementation  ap. 41-51.  aDrilling carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRPs) is typically cumbersome due to high structural stiffness of the composite and low thermal conductivity of plastics. Resin-rich areas between neighbouring plies in a laminate are prone to drilling-induced delamination that compromises structural integrity. Appropriate selection of drilling parameters is believed to mitigate damage in CFRPs. In this context, we study the effect of cutting parameters on drilling thrust force and torque during the machining process both experimentally and numerically. A unique three-dimensional (3D) finite element model of drilling in a composite laminate, accounting for complex kinematics at the drill-workpiece interface is developed. Cohesive zone elements are used to simulate interply delamination in a composite. Experimental quantification of drilling-induced damage is performed by means of X-ray micro computed tomography. The developed numerical model is shown to agree reasonably well with the experiments. The model is used to predict optimal drilling parameters in carbon/epoxy composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acomputed tomography 3acutting 3adelamination 3adrilling 3aepoxides 3akinematics 3amathematical models 3aplastics 3athermal conductivity 3atorque1 aMakhdum, Farrukh1 aRoy, Anish1 aSilberschmidt, Vadim V.0 tComposites.g2013 Apr., v. 47 p.41-51dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245006900199300001800268500001100286506007600297520144400373592002801817506003701845650001401882650002301896650001201919650001801931650002501949650001701974650001601991650001602007650001202023650001202035650001402047650001602061650001802077650001802095650002902113650001402142650002502156700003002181700002502211700002302236773013402259856007302393852000902466655001202475IND60649948820221207074159.0190709e20141110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064994882DNAL7 a10.3390/nu61149842doi7 aPMC42455762pmcid7 a253899002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarber, Teresa10aVitamin A Deficiency and Alterations in the Extracellular Matrix  ap. 4984-5017.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVitamin A or retinol which is the natural precursor of several biologically active metabolites can be considered the most multifunctional vitamin in mammals. Its deficiency is currently, along with protein malnutrition, the most serious and common nutritional disorder worldwide. It is necessary for normal embryonic development and postnatal tissue homeostasis, and exerts important effects on cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. These actions are produced mainly by regulating the expression of a variety of proteins through transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms. Extracellular matrix proteins are among those whose synthesis is known to be modulated by vitamin A. Retinoic acid, the main biologically active form of vitamin A, influences the expression of collagens, laminins, entactin, fibronectin, elastin and proteoglycans, which are the major components of the extracellular matrix. Consequently, the structure and macromolecular composition of this extracellular compartment is profoundly altered as a result of vitamin A deficiency. As cell behavior, differentiation and apoptosis, and tissue mechanics are influenced by the extracellular matrix, its modifications potentially compromise organ function and may lead to disease. This review focuses on the effects of lack of vitamin A in the extracellular matrix of several organs and discusses possible molecular mechanisms and pathologic implications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3aelastin 3aembryogenesis 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3ahomeostasis 3akwashiorkor 3alaminin 3amammals 3amechanics 3ametabolites 3aproteoglycans 3aretinoic acid 3atranscription (genetics) 3avitamin A 3avitamin A deficiency1 aEsteban-Pretel, Guillermo1 aMarín, María Pilar1 aTimoneda, Joaquín0 tNutrients.g2014 Nov. 10, v. 6, no. 11 p.4984-5017dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu61149843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245012800178300001400306520126000320592002801580596006901608650001601677650001001693650002101703650002101724650002601745650001801771650002201789650001701811650001701828650001801845650001001863650001301873650004401886700002201930700006001952773011202012856008202124852000902206655001202215IND60627585720221120100054.0190512e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062758572DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-018-1338-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrés-Iglesias, Cristina10aSugar, Hop α-Acid, and Amino Acid Contents Contribute to the Differential Profile Between Nonalcoholic and Alcoholic Beers  ap. 59-68.  aThere is an increasing trend of nonalcoholic beer intake that motivates an effort to improve its taste. This study was conducted to assess the main differences in the polar and mid-polar chemical profile between alcoholic and nonalcoholic beers. A set of differential compounds was characterized through a metabolomics approach with ultraperformance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) measurements with further data analysis by partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Anhydrohexose, a disaccharide, and myoinositol along with phenylalanine, tyramine, and some hop α-acids (desdimethyl-hexahydro/octahydro-iso-cohumulone, tetrahydro-n/ad-humulone, and iso-n/ad-humulone) were shown as the main compounds stablishing differences in the chemical profile between alcoholic and nonalcoholic beers. Further analysis by principal components (PCA) using the content of the selected compounds clearly separated the alcoholic and nonalcoholic beers as well as different brands within these two groups. Cluster analysis provided a clear view of the similarity between the diverse beer brands but with slightly different outcomes to the PCA. Results of this study are expected to help breweries to improve the nonalcoholic beer taste.  aPublisher supplied data  aVA332A12-2cConsejería de Educación, Junta de Castilla y León 3aalpha acids 3abeers 3abrewing industry 3acluster analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3aleast squares 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3amyo-inositol 3aphenylalanine 3ataste 3atyramine 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aBlanco, Carlos A.1 aMontero, Olimpio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0241-87560 tFood analytical methods.g2019 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.59-68dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-018-1338-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009800164520164900262592002801911650001801939650001701957650002101974650001001995650001502005650001102020650002402031650001402055650001402069700002202083700002802105700001802133700001802151700002102169773012002190856007902310852000902389655001202398IND60762554420221119122031.0220110e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076255442DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110101122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorcoz, Larisa 10aMycorrhizal Patterns in the Roots of Dominant Festuca rubra in a High-Natural-Value Grassland  aGrassland ecosystems occupy significant areas worldwide and represent a reservoir for biodiversity. These areas are characterized by oligotrophic conditions that stimulate mycorrhizal symbiotic partnerships to meet nutritional requirements. In this study, we selected Festuca rubra for its dominance in the studied mountain grassland, based on the fact that grasses more easily accept a symbiotic partner. Quantification of the entire symbiosis process, both the degree of colonization and the presence of a fungal structure, was performed using the root mycorrhizal pattern method. Analysis of data normality indicated colonization frequency as the best parameter for assessing the entire mycorrhizal mechanism, with five equal levels, each of 20%. Most of the root samples showed an intensity of colonization between 0 and 20% and a maximum of arbuscules of about 5%. The colonization degree had an average value of 35%, which indicated a medium permissiveness of roots for mycorrhizal partners. Based on frequency regression models, the intensity of colonization presented high fluctuations at 50% frequency, while the arbuscule development potential was set to a maximum of 5% in mycorrhized areas. Arbuscules were limited due to the unbalanced and unequal root development and their colonizing hyphal networks. The general regression model indicated that only 20% of intra-radicular hyphae have the potential to form arbuscules. The colonization patterns of dominant species in mountain grasslands represent a necessary step for improved understanding of the symbiont strategies that sustain the stability and persistence of these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca rubra 3abiodiversity 3adominant species 3afungi 3agrasslands 3ahyphae 3aregression analysis 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis1 aPăcurar, Florin 1 aPop-Moldovan, Victoria 1 aVaida, Ioana 1 aStoian, Vlad 1 aVidican, Roxana 0 tPlants.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110101123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245011200164300001800276500001500294520135800309592002801667650001901695650001501714650001101729650000901740650003201749650001201781650001701793650001001810650002201820650002401842650001901866650001301885650002701898650001701925650001601942650001301958650002001971650001501991650001602006650001902022653001502041700001802056700001802074700002002092700001502112700001602127700001902143700001602162773010102178856008502279852000902364655001202373IND4459227620221118032745.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445922762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2010.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Fuwang10aPhysiological and biochemical response of harvested plum fruit to oxalic acid during ripening or shelf-life  ap. 1299-1305.  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of oxalic acid application on plum fruit (Prunus salicina cv. ‘Damili’) ripening properties during storage or shelf-life was determined. The fruits were dipped for 3min in solutions containing 5mmol/L oxalic acid and then were packed into polyethylene bags and stored at 25°C for 12days, or at 2°C for 20days and subsequently at 25°C for 12days. Ethylene production, fruit firmness, contents of pectin and anthocyanin, specific activities of polygalacturonase (PG), pectin methylesterase (PME) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) were measured. The application of oxalic acid reduced ethylene production and delayed softening of plum fruit. The inhibition of softening was associated with decreased PG and PME activities; that is, the retardation of pectin solubilization/degradation. During storage or shelf-life, flesh reddening and anthocyanin synthesis were significantly inhibited in oxalic acid-treated plum fruit, accompanied with decreased PAL activity. Furthermore, it was found that variable:maximalchlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), an indicator of ripening, senescence or stress injury of fruit and vegetable, decreased much more slowly in oxalic-treated plum fruits than in control fruits. Thus, oxalic acid treatment can be an effective means to extend the shelf life of plum fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3asolubilization 3ashelf life 3afruits 3abags 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3apectins 3afluorescence 3aplums 3apolygalacturonase 3aethylene production 3apectinesterase 3afirmness 3aphysiological response 3apolyethylene 3aoxalic acid 3aripening 3aPrunus salicina 3avegetables 3achlorophyll 3aacid treatment 0asenescence1 aZhang, Dandan1 aZhang, Haiyan1 aJiang, Guoqiang1 aSu, Xinguo1 aQu, Hongxia1 aJiang, Yueming1 aDuan, Xuewu0 tFood research international.g2011 June, v. 44, no. 5 p.1299-1305dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2010.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100003200180245011700212300001800329500002000347506007600367520144000443592002801883506003701911650001301948650002301961650001201984650002401996650001602020650002102036650002602057650001202083650001502095650001202110650001702122650001702139650003202156650002902188650002302217650001202240650001702252650002602269650003502295650002102330700002202351700002102373700002102394700002302415700002102438773013402459856007302593852000902666655001202675IND60649949020221207074244.0190709e20141111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064994902DNAL7 a10.3390/nu61150342doi7 aPMC42455782pmcid7 a253936882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNienaber-Rousseau, Cornelie10aInteractions between C-Reactive Protein Genotypes with Markers of Nutritional Status in Relation to Inflammation  ap. 5034-5050.  aJournal Article  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInflammation, as indicated by C-reactive protein concentrations (CRP), is a risk factor for chronic diseases. Both genetic and environmental factors affect susceptibility to inflammation. As dietary interventions can influence inflammatory status, we hypothesized that dietary effects could be influenced by interactions with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CRP gene. We determined 12 CRP SNPs, as well as various nutrition status markers in 2010 black South Africans and analyzed their effect on CRP. Interactions were observed for several genotypes with obesity in determining CRP. Lipid intake modulated the pro-inflammatory effects of some SNPs, i.e., an increase in both saturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid intake in those homozygous for the polymorphic allele at rs2808630 was associated with a larger increase in CRP. Those harboring the minor alleles at rs3093058 and rs3093062 presented with significantly higher CRP in the presence of increased triglyceride or cholesterol intake. When harboring the minor allele of these SNPs, a high omega-6 to -3 ratio was, however, found to be anti-inflammatory. Carbohydrate intake also modulated CRP SNPs, as HbA1C and fasting glucose levels interacted with some SNPs to influence the CRP. This investigation highlights the impact that nutritional status can have on reducing the inherent genetic susceptibility to a heightened systemic inflammatory state.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfricans 3aC-reactive protein 3aalleles 3acarbohydrate intake 3acholesterol 3achronic diseases 3aenvironmental factors 3afasting 3afat intake 3aglucose 3ahomozygosity 3ainflammation 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3arisk factors 3asaturated fatty acids 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atriacylglycerols1 aSwanepoel, Bianca1 aDolman, Robin C.1 aPieters, Marlien1 aConradie, Karin R.1 aTowers, G.

Probiotics can benefit the central nervous system via the microbiota–gut–brain axis, which raises the possibility that probiotics are effective in managing depression. In the present study, we examined the effects of heat-killed Lactobacillus helveticus strain MCC1848 in subchronic and mild social defeat stress (sCSDS) model mice (a widely used animal model of depression). MCC1848 supplementation significantly enhanced the interaction time in the social interaction test and sucrose preference ratio in the sucrose preference test, suggesting that MCC1848 improved anxiety- or depressive-like behaviors in sCSDS mice. The gene expression profile analysis of the nucleus accumbens, which plays an important role in stress resilience, indicated that MCC1848 ameliorated sCSDS-induced gene expression alterations in signal transduction or nervous system development. These findings suggest that MCC1848 supplementation is useful as a preventive strategy for chronic-stress-induced depression.  aThis study was supported by research grants from Morinaga Milk Industry Co.,Ltd.  aPublisher supplied data  cMorinaga Milk Industry Co.,Ltd 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aanimal models 3aanxiety 3abiotechnology 3acentral nervous system 3agene expression 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aneurodevelopment 3apathogenesis 3aprobiotics 3asignal transduction 3asocial behavior 3asucrose 0adepression 0amild subchronic social defeat stress 0agut-brain axis 0anucleus accumbens1 aKobayashi, Yodai1 aMitsuyama, Eri1 aKawase, Takahiro1 aKuhara, Tetsuya1 aXiao, Jin-Zhong1 aTsukahara, Takamitsu1 aToyoda, Atsushi0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2019 July 3, v. 83, no. 7 p.1239-1247dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2019.15912633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012400174300001600298520185700314592002802171650002502199650001202224650001202236650002402248650001402272650000902286650002302295650001802318650002002336650001302356650002602369650003302395650001502428650001602443650001802459700002302477700002702500700001602527773010402543856004802647852000902695655001202704IND50062228220221118032840.0130324e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006222822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-011-0764-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTumuluru, Jaya Shankar10aChanges in Moisture, Protein, and Fat Content of Fish and Rice Flour Coextrudates during Single-Screw Extrusion Cooking  ap. 403-415.  aChanges in proximate composition of fish and rice flour coextrudates like moisture, protein, and fat content were studied with respect to extrusion process variables like barrel temperature, x ₁ (100–200 °C); screw speed, x ₂ (70–110 rpm); fish content of the feed, x ₃ (5–45%); and feed moisture content, x ₄ (20–60%). Experiments were conducted at five levels of the process variables based on rotatable experimental design. Response surface models (RSM) were developed that adequately described the changes in moisture, protein, and fat content of the extrudates based on the coefficient of determination (R ²) values of 0.95, 0.99, and 0.94. ANOVA analysis indicated that extrudate moisture content was influenced by x ₄, protein content by x ₁ and x ₃, and fat content by x ₃ and x ₄ at P < 0.001. Trends based on response surface plots indicated that the x ₁ of about 200 °C, x ₂ of about 90 rpm, x ₃ of about 25%, and x ₄ of about 20% minimized the moisture in the extrudates. Protein content was maximized at x ₁ of 100 °C, x ₂ > 80 rpm, x ₃ of about 45%, and x ₄ > 50%, and fat content was minimized at x ₁ of about 200 °C, x ₂ of about 85–95 rpm, x ₃ < 15%, and x ₄ of about >50%. Optimized process variables based on a genetic algorithm (GA) for minimum moisture and fat content and maximum protein content were x ₁ = 199.86, x ₂ = 109.86, x ₃ = 32.45, x ₄ = 20.03; x ₁ = 199.71, x ₂ = 90.09, x ₃ = 15.27, x ₄ = 58.47; and x ₁ = 102.97, x ₂ = 107.67, x ₃ = 44.56, x ₄ = 59.54. The predicted values were 17.52%, 0.57%, and 46.65%. Based on the RSM and GA analysis, extrudate moisture and protein content was influenced by x ₁, x ₃, and x ₄ and fat content by x ₂, x ₃, and x ₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abarrels 3acooking 3aexperimental design 3aextrusion 3afish 3agenetic background 3alipid content 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aproximate composition 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice flour 3atemperature 3awater content1 aSokhansanj, Shahab1 aBandyopadhyay, Sukumar1 aBawa, A.

In this study, a rapid DNA lysis liquid was formulated without any purification step from fresh and processed meat, suitable for conventional PCR amplification. Three different lysis liquid formulas were designed for selection and further optimization for direct PCR and absorbance spectra; DNA concentration and performance in PCR were used to assess the effect of each formula. The results indicated that the formula containing NaOH, EDTA, SDS, Tween 20, and Tris-HCl achieved the best results, and the optimized formula met the need of practical PCR applications. The protocol provided a rapid lysis buffer for DNA replication from any meat samples. The performance of the final formula resulted in high DNA lysis efficiencies for all the tested meat samples and the PCR amplification efficiencies were similar to isolated DNA template using a commercial kit. The whole process can be completed in 30 min. Therefore, this study provides a simple, alternative, cost-effective fast solution for meat molecular analysis based on DNA.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672394cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aDNA replication 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aabsorbance 3aanalytical methods 3acost effectiveness 3agenetic analysis 3aliquids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolysorbates 3aprocessed meat 3asodium hydroxide1 aJin, Yuting1 aZhao, Jin1 aAi, Juntao1 aLuo, Yuanyuan0 tFood analytical methods.g2019 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.100-107dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-018-1342-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245005600204300001800260520106100278592002801339650001301367650001801380650001701398650002201415650001701437650001301454650001101467650001101478650001101489650001301500700002101513700001901534700002101553700002001574700001701594700002001611700002001631700002701651773009801678856008101776990002301857852000901880655001201889IND60091321020221121025755.0141103e20111019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009132102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2011.08.0272doi7 aPMC31929572pmcid7 a220047392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPompe, Tilo10aFriction-Controlled Traction Force in Cell Adhesion  ap. 1863-1870.  aThe force balance between the extracellular microenvironment and the intracellular cytoskeleton controls the cell fate. We report a new (to our knowledge) mechanism of receptor force control in cell adhesion originating from friction between cell adhesion ligands and the supporting substrate. Adherent human endothelial cells have been studied experimentally on polymer substrates noncovalently coated with fluorescent-labeled fibronectin (FN). The cellular traction force correlated with the mobility of FN during cell-driven FN fibrillogenesis. The experimental findings have been explained within a mechanistic two-dimensional model of the load transfer at focal adhesion sites. Myosin motor activity in conjunction with sliding of FN ligands noncovalently coupled to the surface of the polymer substrates is shown to result in a controlled traction force of adherent cells. We conclude that the friction of adhesion ligands on the supporting substrate is important for mechanotransduction and cell development of adherent cells in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acell adhesion 3acytoskeleton 3aendothelial cells 3afibronectins 3afriction 3ahumans 3amodels 3amyosin 3apolymers1 aKaufmann, Martin1 aKasimir, Maria1 aJohne, Stephanie1 aGlorius, Stefan1 aRenner, Lars1 aBobeth, Manfred1 aPompe, Wolfgang1 aWerner, C.q(Carsten),0 tBiophysical journal.g2011 Oct. 19, v. 101, no. 8 p.1863-1870dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2011.08.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle00982naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003000143245012300173300001600296520002600312592002800338653002000366653002100386653001500407653001100422653001700433700002700450700002900477773008800506856007700594852000900671655001200680IND60520273320221120131815.0160519e20100816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052027332DNAL7 a10.1515/mamm.2010.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, Marcelo de Moraes,10aPotential geographic distribution of Myotis ruber (Chiroptera, Vespertilionidae), a threatened Neotropical bat species  ap. 333-338.  aNo abstract available  aPublisher supplied data 0aAtlantic Forest 0abat conservation 0aChiroptera 0aMaxent 0aMyotis ruber1 aTerribile, Levi Carina1 aCáceres, Nilton Carlos,0 tMammalia.g2010 Aug. 16, v. 74, no. 3 p.333-338dWalter de Gruyterx1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.2010.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011500170300001400285520147500299592002801774650001501802650001901817650002401836650001001860650001801870650001401888650001301902650001501915650002501930650001101955650001501966650001901981650002402000650001702024650001902041650001702060650000902077653000802086653001302094653001702107653001802124653001502142700001902157700002902176700006402205773010002269856008302369852000902452655001202461IND60563303220221120235958.0190411e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056330322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2016.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPluym, Liesbet M.10aRisk factors for development of lameness in gestating sows within the first days after moving to group housing  ap. 28-33.  aLameness in sows is an important welfare issue that is affected by housing conditions and is thought to be influenced by hierarchical fights within the first days after mixing sows in groups. A longitudinal study in 15 randomly selected herds was performed to investigate the incidence of sow lameness and possible risk factors within the first days of group housing. Each herd was visited just before and again 3–5 days after the sows were moved to group housing. The floor characteristics and dimensions of the group housing facilities were assessed. Locomotion ability, body condition, skin lesions and degree of faecal soiling were recorded for all sows. Additional information on housing and management was obtained using a questionnaire. Amongst the 810 sows included in the study, the mean lameness incidence was 13.1% (95% confidence interval 10.9–15.6%). Following binomial logistic regression analysis, sows with >10% of the body covered with faeces had an increased risk for development of lameness (odds ratio, OR = 2.33, P = 0.001). An increase in space allowance from 1.7 m2 to 3.0 m2 (OR = 0.40, P = 0.03) and of herd size from 144 to 750 sows per herd (OR = 0.71, P = 0.02) decreased the risk of development of lameness. Neither the degree of aggression, indicated by skin lesions, nor the floor characteristics influenced the development of lameness.

A low‐temperature thermochronology (AFT and AHe) data set from four deep boreholes and adjacent outcrops intersecting a branch of the shortening structures indicates distinctive differential cooling at ~35–28 Ma across the structure, where stratigraphy has been offset vertically by ~0.8–1.3 km. This result forms the first quantitative evidence for the existence of a late Eocene‐Oligocene phase of shortening in the eastern Sichuan Basin, synchronous with the early phase of eastward growth and extrusion of the Tibetan Plateau. Further, a compilation of regional Cenozoic structures reveals a Miocene retreat of deformation from the foreland basin to the hinterland areas. Such a tectonic reorganization indicates that Eocene to Miocene deformation in the eastern Tibetan Plateau is out‐of‐sequence and was probably triggered by enhanced erosion in the eastern Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016ZT06N331cGuangdong Province Introduced Innovative R&D Team  a41772211cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) 3aEocene epoch 3aMiocene epoch 3abasins 3acooling 3adata collection 3adeformation 3aextrusion 3ageophysics 3ahinterland 3aresearch 3astratigraphy 3atectonics 3athermochronology 3atopography 3aChina1 aKohn, Barry P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5064-54541 aQiu, Nansheng1 aYuan, Yusong1 aHu, Shengbiao1 aGleadow, A.

TRAF2 participates in the activation of both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways, which are crucial for cell inflammation and cell survival. To elucidate its function in teleost fish, TRAF2 homologues of yellow grouper (Epinephelus awoara) and golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) have been cloned and characterized in this study. The open reading frame (ORF) of grouper TRAF2 (EaTRAF2) consists of 1563 nucleotides encoding a 521 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 58.70 kDa. The ORF of golden pompano TRAF2 (ToTRAF2) consists of 1563 nucleotides encoding a 521 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 58.66 kDa EaTRAF2 and ToTRAF2 share 99.23% and 99.42% identity with orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) TRAF2 (EcTRAF2), respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that the expression of EaTRAF2 was increased in grouper spleen (GS) cells after Red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection; while the expression of ToTRAF2 was decreased in golden pompano brain (TOGB) cells after RGNNV infection. Both EaTRAF2 and ToTRAF2 were identified as a cytosolic protein and suggested to be associated with vesicles scattering in the cytoplasm. Both EaTRAF2 and ToTRAF2 enhanced RGNNV replication during viral infection in vitro. Further studies showed that EaTRAF2 and ToTRAF2 overexpression decreased the expression levels of interferon associated cytokines and pro-inﬂammatory factors. Taken together, these results are important for better understanding of the function of TRAF2 in fish and reveal its involvement in host response to immune challenges in RGNNV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpinephelus awoara 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aRedspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus 3aTrachinotus ovatus 3aamino acids 3abrain 3acell viability 3acytoplasm 3agrouper 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferons 3amolecular weight 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregulatory proteins 3asignal transduction 3aspleen 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factors 0aEpinephelus tauvina 0aTRAF2 0aRGNNV 0aCellular localization1 aWei, Jingguang1 aZhang, Xin1 aSun, Mengshi1 aWu, Siting1 aQin, Qiwei0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2020 July, v. 102 p.108-116dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04145naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245013500206300001200341506007600353520170500429592002802134596005902162596005302221596010802274596005002382506003702432650003002469650002102499650001402520650001002534650002002544650001602564650003102580650001002611650003202621650001502653650001802668650001302686650002102699650004302720650005202763650001702815650001902832650001702851700001702868700001802885700001502903700001602918700001602934700001702950700001502967700001302982700002002995700001803015700001603033700001603049700001503065700001603080700001803096700001403114700002203128700001803150700001803168773011003186856008203296852000903378655001203387IND60677372920221207124546.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067737292DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-019-1250-52doi7 aPMC68806012pmcid7 a317716042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xianglong10aDownregulation of microRNA-30a-5p contributes to the replication of duck enteritis virus by regulating Beclin-1-mediated autophagy  ap. 144.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) is increasingly recognized as an important element in regulating virus-host interactions. Our previous results showed that cellular miR-30a-5p was significantly downregulated after duck enteritis virus (DEV) infection cell. However, whehter or not the miR-30a-5p is involved in DEV infection has not been known. METHODS: Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression levels of miRNAs(miR-30a-5p) and Beclin-1 mRNA. The miR-30a-5p - Beclin-1 target interactions were determined by Dual luciferase reporter assay (DLRA). Western blotting was utilized to analyze Beclin-1-mediated duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells autophagy activity. DEV titers were estimated by the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID₅₀). RESULTS: The miR-30a-5p was significantly downregulated and the Beclin-1 mRNA was significantly upregulated in DEV-infected DEF cells. DLRA confirmed that miR-30a-5p directly targeted the 3′- UTR of the Beclin-1 gene. Overexpression of miR-30a-5p significantly reduced the expression level of Beclin-1protein (p < 0.05), leading to the decrease of Beclin-1-mediated autophagy activity, which ultimately suppressed DEV replication (P < 0.05). Whereas transfection of miR-30a-5p inhibitor increased Beclin-1-mediated autophagy and triggered DEV replication during the whole process of DEV infection (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that miR-30a-5p can inhibit DEV replication through reducing autophagy by targeting Beclin-1. These findings suggest a new insight into virus-host interaction during DEV infection and provide a potential new antiviral therapeutic strategy against DEV infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a31872475cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aCARS-42-17cAgriculture Research System of China  aCARS-SVDIPcSichuan Veterinary Medicine and Drug Innovation Group of China Agricultural Research System  a2017JY0014cSichuan Province Research Program0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnatid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aWestern blotting 3aautophagy 3aducks 3aembryo (animal) 3afibroblasts 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3apoultry diseases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3atissue culture 3atransfection1 aJia, Renyong1 aWang, Mingshu1 aChen, Shun1 aLiu, Mafeng1 aZhu, Dekang1 aZhao, Xinxin1 aYang, Qiao1 aWu, Ying1 aYin, Zhongqiong1 aZhang, Shaqiu1 aHuang, Juan1 aZhang, Ling1 aLiu, Yunya1 aYu, Yanling1 aPan, Leichang1 aTian, Bin1 aRehman, Mujeeb Ur1 aChen, Xiaoyue1 aCheng, Anchun0 tVirology journal.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.144-144dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1250-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03855naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245015800166300001600324520216800340592002802508650001102536650002002547650002502567650002602592650001302618650001502631650001802646650001302664650002502677650001502702650001902717650002202736650001302758650001502771650001502786650001002801650001102811650002702822653003602849653002302885653001302908653001102921653002402932700001802956700001702974700005702991700001503048700001803063773012303081856008803204852000903292655001203301IND60592263120221120200320.0201125e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059226312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.2382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Siqi10aInfluences of observation method, season, soil depth, land use and management practice on soil dissolvable organic carbon concentrations: A meta-analysis  ap. 105-114.  aQuantifications of soil dissolvable organic carbon concentrations, together with other relevant variables, are needed to understand the carbon biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil dissolvable organic carbon can generally be grouped into two incomparable categories. One is soil extractable organic carbon (EOC), which is measured by extracting with an aqueous extractant (distilled water or a salt solution). The other is soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is measured by sampling soil water using tension-free lysimeters or tension samplers. The influences of observation methods, natural factors and management practices on the measured concentrations, which ranged from 2.5−3970 (mean: 69) mg kg⁻¹ of EOC and 0.4−200 (mean: 12) mg L⁻¹ of DOC, were investigated through a meta-analysis. The observation methods (e.g., extractant, extractant-to-soil ratio and pre-treatment) had significant effects on EOC concentrations. The most significant divergence (approximately 109%) occurred especially at the extractant of potassium sulfate (K₂SO₄) solutions compared to distilled water. As EOC concentrations were significantly different (approximately 47%) between non-cultivated and cultivated soils, they were more suitable than DOC concentrations for assessing the influence of land use on soil dissolvable organic carbon levels. While season did not significantly affect EOC concentrations, DOC concentrations showed significant differences (approximately 50%) in summer and autumn compared to spring. For management practices, applications of crop residues and nitrogen fertilizers showed positive effects (approximately 23% to 91%) on soil EOC concentrations, while tillage displayed negative effects (approximately −17%), compared to no straw, no nitrogen fertilizer and no tillage. Compared to no nitrogen, applications of synthetic nitrogen also appeared to significantly enhance DOC concentrations (approximately 32%). However, further studies are needed in the future to confirm/investigate the effects of ecosystem management practices using standardized EOC measurement protocols or more DOC cases of field experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abiogeochemistry 3aecosystem management 3afield experimentation 3aland use 3alysimeters 3ameta-analysis 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ano-tillage 3aorganic carbon 3apotassium sulfate 3asamplers 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3astraw 3asummer 3aterrestrial ecosystems 0aSoil dissolvable organic carbon 0aObservation method 0aLand use 0aSeason 0aManagement practice1 aZheng, Xunhua1 aLiu, Chunyan1 aYao, Zhisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6242-24261 aZhang, Wei1 aHan, Shenghui0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 631-632 p.105-114dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.2383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245011400134300001600248520126700264592002801531650001301559650001201572650001201584650001201596650002201608650001101630650001501641650001901656650000901675650001101684650002001695650003001715650002801745650004501773650000901818653002901827653001001856653001301866653001901879700001801898700001601916700001701932700001601949700001701965700001801982773014902000852000902149655001202158IND60710050520221120032804.0200908e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071005052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanguly, Indrajit10aDGAT1 polymorphism K232A in Sahiwal (Indian Zebu) and frieswal (Holstein friesian X Sahiwal crossbred) cattle  ap. 360-363.  aThe positional candidate gene DGAT1, within QTL of BTA14, harboring a lysine to alanine substitution (K232A) is significantly associated with milk production traits.

The frequency of A allele in Frieswal and Sahiwal cattle was 0.36 and 0.04, respectively. Although all the three genotypes were observed in Frieswal cattle, however, no animal of AA genotype was found in Sahiwal cattle and only four animals were of heterozygous genotype (AK). The sequences, specific to K and A allele, were submitted to GenBank (JF345253 and JF345254). Because of very high frequency to almost fixed nature of K allele in Sahiwal and other well defined Indian cattle breeds, DGAT1 K232A polymorphism may not be a suitable candidate for selection purpose. Nonetheless, the results could be used to guide association studies between this locus and milk production traits especially in Frieswal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aSahiwal 3aalanine 3aalleles 3aallelic variation 3acattle 3acrossbreds 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3alysine 3amilk production 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative trait loci 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3azebu 0aQuantitative trait locus 0aDGAT1 0aPCR-RFLP 0aCandidate gene1 aKumar, Sushil1 aGaur, G.

In a recent study conducted by the BfR, up to 5647 µg PA/kg dried herbal material were detected in tea products marketed as food.The present study aimed at elucidating whether medicinal teas licensed or registered as medicinal products contain PAs as well.One hundred sixty-nine different commercially available medicinal teas, i.e. 19 nettle (Urtica dioica L.), 12 fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), 14 chamomile (Matricaria recutita L.), 11 melissa (Melissa officinalis L.) and 4 peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) teas as well as 109 tea mixtures were analyzed for the presence of 23 commercially available PAs.LC/MS was used for the determination of the PAsIn general, the total PA contents ranging 0–5668 µg/kg. Thirty percent of the tested single-ingredient tea products and 56.9% of the tested medicinal tea mixtures were found to contain PA concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 10 µg/kg. In 11 medicinal teas PA contents >300 µg/kg dry herb were determined thus exceeding the recommended limit for PA intake by BfR. In addition three products of the investigated tea mixtures revealed extremely high PA contents of 4227, 5137, and 5668 µg/kg. Generally, single-ingredient tea products contained much less or even no detectable amounts of PAs when compared to the tea mixtures. PAs in the range between 13 and 1080 µg/kg were also detected in five analyzed aqueous herbal infusions of the medicinal tea mixture products with the highest PA content. Two out of the five investigated herbal infusions exceeded the recommended BfR limit for PA intake.This study demonstrates clearly that also medicinal teas licensed as medicinal products may partly contain high amounts of PAs exceeding current recommendations. For that reason manufacturers are advised to carry out more rigorous quality control tests devoted to the detection of PAs. This is very important to minimize PAs in medicinal teas accounting for possible additional exposure of the consumer to PAs from other food sources (e.g. honey).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoeniculum vulgare 3aMatricaria chamomilla 3aMelissa officinalis 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3aUrtica dioica 3aadults 3abody weight 3achamomile 3afennel 3ahepatotoxicity 3amutagenicity 3apyrrolizidine alkaloids 3aquality control 3arisk assessment 3atea 0aPyrrolizidine alkaloid 0aMedicinal herbal tea 0aNettle 0aFennel 0aChamomile 0aMelissa1 aMeins, J.1 aDiemert, S.1 aZagermann-Muncke, P.1 aGoebel, R.1 aSchrenk, D.1 aSchubert-Zsilavecz, M.1 aAbdel-Tawab, M.0 tPhytomedicine.g2015 June 01, v. 22 p.648-656dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2015.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010300166300001200269500001100281520162500292592002801917650001301945650001801958650001801976650001001994650003402004650001102038650003502049650002402084650001902108650001702127650001902144650000902163650002302172700007402195700002102269700003302290773013302323856008302456852000902539655001202548IND60752032220221119060136.0220109e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075203222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-021-02932-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHameed, Nasir10aApproaches of estrous synchronization in sheep: developments during the last two decades: a review  ap. 485.  aReview  aThe objective of the current review was to summarize the protocols used for estrous synchronization in ewes during the last two decades. Progesterone (P4) is a major hormone used in most protocols. P4 in the form of a controlled internal drug releasing (CIDR) device, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP), and fluorogestone acetates (FGA) has been used for estrous synchronization. Also, gonadotropins such as equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are often administered at the end of P4-based protocols to improve fertility. Moreover, the administration of prostaglandins (PG) and ram effects have been used for estrus induction and synchronization of ewes. The findings of previous studies indicate that the outcome of administering various synthetics P4 analogues (CIDR, MAP, and FGA) in ewes is comparable in terms of estrous synchronization/induction. The supplementation of P4-based protocols with eCG, however, improves the estrus response and pregnancy rate during breeding and non-breeding season. On the other hand, PG is effective for successful estrous synchronization during the breeding season only. Often, two injections of PG are administered either 11 or 14 days apart along with P4-based protocols to lyse ovine corpus luteum (CL) when it is receptive to PG i.e., 3 days post-ovulation. Alternatively, the “ram effect” has been shown to improve the efficacy of P4-based protocols and can be used as an alternative to eCG in ewes. The current review describes the methods of synchronization and their outcomes during breeding and a non-breeding season in ewes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanimal health 3acorpus luteum 3adrugs 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3aestrus 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3amedroxyprogesterone 3apregnancy rate 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3arams 3asynthetic products1 aKhan, Muhammad Irfan-ur-Rehman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2432-57531 aZubair, Muhammad1 aAndrabi, Syed Murtaza Hassan0 tTropical animal health and production.g2021 Oct., v. 53, no. 5 p.485-485dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02932-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245008000159300001600239520135300255592002801608650001701636650001301653650000901666650002301675650000901698650001201707650001201719650001401731650001501745650001901760650001301779650001101792650001001803650001301813651001001826651001301836651000901849651001101858651001001869653001501879653001301894653001601907653001501923653001401938700001901952700002501971773008801996856007702084852000902161655001202170IND60520274420221120152227.0160519e20101110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052027442DNAL7 a10.1515/mamm.2010.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Hans10aAssessment and mitigation of human-lion conflict in West and Central Africa  ap. 363-367.  aThe lion (Panthera leo) is most threatened in West and Central Africa; livestock encroachment and indiscriminate killing of lions are the main threats. Human-lion conflict mitigation is therefore key to persistence. Several experiments were carried out in the region to assess and mitigate human-lion conflict. In Pendjari National Park in Benin, enclosures of clay instead of the usual thorny branches reduced depredation figures by half. Around the Niger side of ‘W’ National Park, depredation was estimated at US$138 per household per year and occurred mostly while grazing; people identified improved herding as the most appropriate measure. A livestock corridor through a chain of protected areas has helped reduce conflict in Benoue National Park, Cameroon. Close monitoring and enclosure improvements reduced depredation from 9 to 0 attacks in enclosures and from 60 to 18 on the pastures of six villages around Waza National Park, Cameroon. Cases in Chad and Guinea identified yet other mitigation measures, including the use of dogs, sensitisation over rural radio and using relevant Sourats from the Koran; data on effectiveness are lacking, however. These projects illustrate a varied suite of mitigation options and demonstrate that mitigation can be effective if the method is judiciously chosen and adapted to local circumstances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera leo 3abranches 3aclay 3aconservation areas 3adogs 3agrazing 3aherding 3alivestock 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3apastures 3apeople 3aradio 3avillages 3aBenin 3aCameroon 3aChad 3aGuinea 3aNiger 0acarnivores 0acorridor 0adepredation 0aenclosures 0alivestock1 ade Iongh, Hans1 aSogbohossou, Etotepe0 tMammalia.g2010 Nov. 10, v. 74, no. 4 p.363-367dWalter de Gruyterx1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.2010.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011600170300001400286520054900300592002800849650001100877650002500888650001500913650001600928650001600944650001500960700001800975700002100993700001701014700002801031700002201059773010901081856008301190852000901273655001201282IND60524836220221120190615.0190417e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052483622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2016.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillier, Laurent10aLinking food waste prevention, energy consumption and microbial food safety: the next challenge of food policy?  ap. 30-35.  aFood safety has governed food policy for decades.

Despite the low species diversity of this group, its representatives are characterized by diversity of life cycles. Trachylina have populated various environments, from deep ocean to fresh water ecosystems. Polyps of Trachylina are either very small or absent in the life cycle, which distinguishes this group from the majority of other Hydrozoa. Trachylina are also highly diverse and have a number of features that are unusual for cnidarians. A number of representatives of this group are characterized by a small number of cells at the embryonic and larval stages. This phenomenon is well known for the representatives of phylogenetically distant taxa—Nematoda and Chordata (Tunicata). In addition, the development of Trachylina is characterized by a number of evolutionary changes that, apparently, make it possible to accelerate the formation of the definitive stage (medusa). Paradoxically, there is no one species among the representatives of this group that is studied in more or less detail. The purpose of our review is to summarize the scanty information on the Trachylina ontogeny and to demonstrate the importance of studying the ontogeny of this group for understanding the general rules of the evolution of development and life cycles of Metazoa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrozoa 3aUrochordata 3alarvae 3aontogeny 3aphylogeny1 aKraus, Yu.A.0 tRussian journal of developmental biology.g2018 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.134-145dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4237922x1062-36047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10623604180300743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012200169520202800291592002802319650002202347650002002369650001402389650002602403650002202429650002302451650001202474650001402486650001902500650001302519650003502532651001402567653001702581653001602598653001202614653001502626653002302641653001402664700002202678700001702700700002602717700002002743700001702763700001902780700002302799700001902822773012402841856008402965852000903049655001203058IND60689116020221119115348.0200614e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068911602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2020.1068402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaney, Kyle J.10aPhylogeography of montane dragons could shed light on the history of forests and diversification processes on Sumatra  aBiogeographical evidence, both, for and against the “regional endemism paradigm” hypothesis has been uncovered across the Greater Sunda Region (Sundaland) of Southeast Asia. Additionally, there are competing hypotheses regarding how Pleistocene forests may have impacted biological patterns and processes in Sumatra. Using montane agamid lizards from Sumatra, we derived and analyzed a phylogenetic dataset, genetic divergence estimates, and contemporary distributional patterns among species. We tested whether (1) Sumatra’s highland Draconinae diversification fits the regional endemism paradigm hypothesis and (2) Draconinae phylogeography provides biological evidence for Pleistocene forest extent at various points in history. Our results suggest in situ diversification was the main driver behind montane Draconinae lizard diversification in Sumatra, rejecting the “regional endemism paradigm”. Contemporary distribution of endemic species and their genetic relationships may potentially provide biologicalevidence for determining more precise elevational lower limits of montane forests during the Pleistocene epoch. Our data suggests montane forests did not retreat more than 700–750 m during glacial maxima because lower retreating forests would have become interconnected, allowing for widespread dispersal, exchange of gene flow and sympatric distributions contemporarily. To the contrary, our divergence estimates show that cloud forest dragons have been isolated for millions of years, suggesting there may have been a continuous disconnect between some areas, predating the Pleistocene. There may also be other ecological and evolutionary factors that impacted Draconinae distributions, such as competition, making this an excellent system for testing questions regarding montane biogeography. Additionally, we provide the first phylogeny for a wide range of Sundaland agamid species and identify some biogeographic pressures that may have triggered montane Draconinae diversification in Sumatra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleistocene epoch 3adata collection 3agene flow 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3aindigenous species 3alizards 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3asympatry 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aIndonesia 0aBiogeography 0aCompetition 0aEndemic 0aExtinction 0aPleistocene forest 0aSundaland1 aMaldonado, José,1 aSmart, Utpal1 aThammachoti, Panupong1 aFujita, Matthew1 aHamidy, Amir1 aKurniawan, Nia1 aHarvey, Michael B.1 aSmith, Eric N.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2020 Aug., v. 149 p.106840-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2020.1068403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011100209300001200320520122300332592002801555596003401583650000801617650001501625650002001640650001201660650002301672650000901695650002301704650001801727650001601745650001901761650001801780650001001798700006501808700006501873700006501938700006102003773014202064856008302206852000902289655001202298IND60752032420221119060118.0220225e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075203242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-021-05356-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoller, Christoph1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1854-940810aEffect of Chelant-Based Soil Washing and Post-Treatment on Pb, Cd, and Zn Bioavailability and Plant Uptake  ap. 405.  aThe remediation of Pb, Cd, and Zn contaminated soil by ex situ EDTA washing was investigated in two pot experiments. We tested the influence of (i) 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%wt zero-valent iron (ZVI) and (ii) a combination of 5%wt vermicompost, 2%wt biochar, and 1%wt ZVI on the metal availability in EDTA-washed soil using different soil extracts (Aqua regia, NH₄NO₃) and plant concentrations. We found that EDTA soil washing significantly reduced the total concentration of Pb, Cd, and Zn and significantly reduced the Cd and Zn plant uptake. Residual EDTA was detected in water extracts causing the formation of highly available Pb-EDTA complexes. While organic amendments had no significant effect on Pb behavior in washed soils, an amendment of ≥ 1%wt ZVI successfully reduced EDTA concentrations, Pb bioavailability, and plant uptake. Our results suggest that Pb-EDTA complexes adsorb to a Fe oxyhydroxide layer, quickly developing on the ZVI surface. The increase in ZVI application strongly decreases Zn concentrations in plant tissue, whereas the uptake of Cd was not reduced, but even slightly increased. Soil washing did not affect plant productivity and organic amendments improved biomass production.  aPublisher supplied data  aI 3408cAustrian Science Fund 3aair 3aaqua regia 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3abiomass production 3airon 3airon oxyhydroxides 3aplant tissues 3aremediation 3asoil pollution 3avermicomposts 3awater1 aFriesl-Hanl, Wolfgang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6977-63151 aHood-Nowotny, Rebecca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4398-32331 aPuschenreiter, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7298-41631 aWatzinger, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9082-15440 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2021 Oct., v. 232, no. 10 p.405-405dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05356-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009800173300001800271520131600289592002801605650001701633650002401650650001201674650001601686650001601702650002301718650001801741650004301759650001101802650002601813650001401839650002201853650004401875653004301919653003701962653001401999653001902013700002202032773011002054856008502164852000902249655001202258IND60558213920221123045330.0161111e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055821392DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2016.12170652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRushing, Blake R.10aEffect of dietary acids on the formation of aflatoxin B2a as a means to detoxify aflatoxin B1  ap. 1456-1467.  aAflatoxin B ₁ (AFB ₁) is a class 1 carcinogen and a common food contaminant worldwide with widely uncontrolled human exposure. The ability of organic acids to transform AFB ₁ into a known detoxified form, aflatoxin B ₂ₐ (AFB ₂ₐ), was investigated using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI/TOF/MS). The identity of the transformation product was confirmed by accurate mass measurement, chromatographic separation from other aflatoxins, H ¹-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Of the weak acids tested, citric acid was found to be the most effective for AFB ₂ₐ formation. At room temperature, 1 M citric acid was able to convert > 97% of AFB ₁ to AFB ₂ₐ over 96 h of treatment. Up to 98% transformation was achieved by boiling AFB ₁ in the presence of citric acid for 20 min. AFB ₁ hydration after ingestion was explored by spiking AFB ₁ into simulated gastric fluid containing citric acid. Under these conditions, > 71% of AFB ₁ was hydrated to AFB ₂ₐ and did not show any reversion to the parent compound after being transferred to a neutral solution. These results provide a basis for a practical and effective method for detoxification of AFB ₁ in contaminated foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3aambient temperature 3aboiling 3acarcinogens 3acitric acid 3afood contamination 3agastric juice 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aingestion 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aHigh-performance liquid chromatography 0atime of flight mass spectrometry 0aaflatoxin 0adetoxification1 aSelim, Mustafa I.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 33, no. 9 p.1456-1467dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2016.12170653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245006900209300001800278506007600296520148100372592002801853596011701881596012401998506003702122650001502159650001902174650002102193650002902214650001002243650001302253650001702266650001102283650001302294650002402307650001302331700001502344700002202359700001302381700002302394773012102417856008502538852000902623655001202632IND60624762720221207073921.0181206e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062476272DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btw5462doi7 aPMC60781692pmcid7 a275402702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jack P.12aA new correlation clustering method for cancer mutation analysis  ap. 3717-3728.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMotivation: Cancer genomes exhibit a large number of different alterations that affect many genes in a diverse manner. An improved understanding of the generative mechanisms behind the mutation rules and their influence on gene community behavior is of great importance for the study of cancer. Results: To expand our capability to analyze combinatorial patterns of cancer alterations, we developed a rigorous methodology for cancer mutation pattern discovery based on a new, constrained form of correlation clustering. Our new algorithm, named C³ (Cancer Correlation Clustering), leverages mutual exclusivity of mutations, patient coverage and driver network concentration principles. To test C³, we performed a detailed analysis on TCGA breast cancer and glioblastoma data and showed that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CoMEt method in terms of discovering mutually exclusive gene modules and identifying biologically relevant driver genes. The proposed agnostic clustering method represents a unique tool for efficient and reliable identification of mutation patterns and driver pathways in large-scale cancer genomics studies, and it may also be used for other clustering problems on biological graphs.

Its population is declining globally. First recorded in 1877 in Nepal, so far only a few studies have been conducted on sarus crane and results of these studies confirm their declining state. Based on previous studies, the author reviewed the status of sarus crane in Nepal. Studies show that it is uncommon with patchy distribution from Chitwan to Kanchanpur districts. More than 90% of its habitats lie outside the protected areas. Rupandehi and Kapilavastu are stronghold districts with more than 85% of its overall population. Regression analysis showed that the overall population of sarus crane has increased in Nepal. Hatching success is more than 50% and new breeding sites are also being reported. Nevertheless, threats such as drying of wetlands, conversion of farmlands to settlements and industries, power lines, nest vandalization still persist. Farmlands provide important foraging and breeding grounds. It inhibits and breeds very close to the human settlements. Thus, increasing awareness to local people and wetland/habitat restoration are necessary for its conservation. Detail scientific studies on its ecology and monitoring using cutting-edge technology in existing and new localities along with crane conservation action plan are required for maintaining the sarus crane population in Nepal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abiodiversity 3abreeding sites 3abreeds 3aconservation areas 3adrying 3aflagship species 3aforaging 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3ahatching 3ahuman settlements 3aindustry 3alowlands 3amonitoring 3anests 3apeople 3aregression analysis 3awetlands 3aNepal 0aconservation 0afarmlands 0aNepal 0apopulation 0asarus crane0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific biodiversity(Online).g2016 Sept. 01, v. 9, no. 3 p.259-262dElsevier B.V.aNational Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)wJournal:23211x2287-884X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2016.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245011200169500002000281520119800301592002801499650001301527650001301540650002001553650001201573650001801585650002001603650001601623700002501639700001701664773011501681856007401796852000901870655001201879IND60571624520221117223245.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057162452DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.127952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahraki, Masoud Hashemi10aUltrafiltration of Cherry Concentrate Under Ultrasound with Carbonated Feed as a New Fouling Control Method  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, the effects of ultrasound (US) with carbonated feed were studied on ultrafiltration flux enhancement and membrane hydrodynamic resistances. A cross flow ultrafiltration of cherry concentrate was performed under US at 37 and 80 kHz with carbonated feed and noncarbonated feed, within the flat‐sheet membrane module. Although, the US degassed the carbonated feed within the module, but no membrane cleaning effect was observed for the US with carbonated feed. Results showed that 37 kHz of US increases the permeation flux higher than 80 kHz, The lowest fouling resistance was obtained for gas bubbling by carbonated feed under 80 kHz, although there was no significant difference between 37 kHz and gas bubbling under 80 kHz. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The most important limitation of ultrafiltration is flux decline during processing. Flux decline caused to higher operation cost and decrease the performance of separation. Using the ultrasound (US) treatment at low frequency (37 kHz) and carbonated feed with US at high frequency (80 kHz) can improve the flux permeation significantly. This technique can be applied to ultrafiltration to postpone the fouling and flux decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3acherries 3acleaning 3acontrol methods 3afouling 3ahydrodynamics 3aultrafiltration 3aultrasonics1 aMaskooki, Abdolmajid1 aFaezian, Ali0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Apr., v. 41, no. 2dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.127953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00950naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245006900163300001600232520002600248592002800274653001700302653001200319653001500331700002400346700003300370700001800403700002200421700001900443773008800462856007700550852000900627655001200636IND60520274920221120183359.0160519e20101019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052027492DNAL7 a10.1515/mamm.2010.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrito, José C.10aData on the distribution of mammals from Mauritania, West Africa  ap. 449-455.  aNo abstract available  aPublisher supplied data 0adistribution 0amammals 0aMauritania1 aAlvares, Francisco,1 aMartínez-Freiría, Fernando1 aSierra, Pablo1 aSillero, Neftalí1 aTarroso, Pedro0 tMammalia.g2010 Oct. 19, v. 74, no. 4 p.449-455dWalter de Gruyterx1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.2010.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012700168300001800295520108800313592002801401650001601429650002601445650001201471650001201483650001201495650000901507650001201516650001801528650001501546650001301561650001101574650002001585650000901605653000701614653001801621653001501639653002501654653001401679653001801693653001101711653002001722700001501742700002001757700001801777700002101795773011001816856008501926852000902011655001202020IND60558214120221122022256.0161111e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055821412DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2016.12170672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzaki, Asako10aContents of Ag and other metals in food-contact plastics with nanosilver or Ag ion and their migration into food simulants  ap. 1490-1498.  aSix nanosilver-labelled products and five silver ion (Ag ⁺)-labelled products were investigated to measure the migration of Ag from food-contact plastics, including nanosilver into various food simulants. The products were obtained in Japanese markets in 2012. Zinc (Zn), another major antimicrobial agent, and three harmful metals, cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and arsenic (As), were also examined. Ag and Zn were detected in all six nanosilver products at concentrations of 21–200 and 8.4–140 mg kg ⁻¹, respectively. These metals were also detected in all five Ag ⁺ products at the same level as nanosilver products. Cd, Pb and As were not detected in any sample. Migrations of Ag and Zn were highest in 4% acetic acid, but also observed in water and 20% ethanol. Big differences were not observed in the migration ratio between nanosilver products and Ag ⁺ products. The ultrafiltration experiments suggested that the Ag that migrated from nanosilver products into 4% acetic acid was in its ionic form, while that into water and 20% ethanol was in its nanoparticle form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aanti-infective agents 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3aethanol 3alead 3amarkets 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aplastics 3asilver 3aultrafiltration 3azinc 0aAg 0ananoparticles 0ananosilver 0afood-contact plastic 0amigration 0afood simulant 0aICP-MS 0aultrafiltration1 aKishi, Eri1 aOoshima, Tomoko1 aHase, Atsushi1 aKawamura, Yōko,0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 33, no. 9 p.1490-1498dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2016.12170673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168300001600260520102500276592002801301650002001329650002201349650001701371650001701388650001301405650001101418650001401429650001201443700002101455700002101476700001801497773013801515856008101653852000901734655001201743IND60596623120221118125719.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059662312DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623604180300502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMursalimov, S.R.10aMigration of DNA-Containing Organelles between Tobacco Microsporocytes during Cytomixis  ap. 159-165.  aUltrastructural analysis of intercellular migration of DNA-containing organelles (nuclei, mitochondria, and plastids) in tobacco microsporogenesis during cytomixis was conducted. It was demonstrated for the first time that the migrating part of the nucleus is covered with ribosomes and can contain the accumulation of nuclear pores. The possibility of mitochondrial migration between the plant cells was proven for the first time. It was demonstrated that mitochondria extremely rarely pass into neighboring cells, and their movement occurs through one cytomictic channel. In turn, plastids can generate the accumulations around cytomictic channels and actively migrate between the cells, even through small size cytomictic channels. It was established that plastids can pass into another cell through one or several cytomictic channels, and several plastids can also simultaneously migrate through one channel. The consequences of migration of DNA-containing organelles in the cells producing the pollen are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrosporocytes 3amicrosporogenesis 3amitochondria 3anuclear pore 3aplastids 3apollen 3aribosomes 3atobacco1 aSidorchuk, Yu.V.1 aZagorskaya, A.A.1 aDeineko, E.V.0 tRussian journal of developmental biology.g2018 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.159-165dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4237922x1062-36047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10623604180300503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245011200166520149800278592002801776650001601804650001701820650002201837650001201859650001101871650002101882650000901903650002101912650001701933650002801950651001001978653003501988653002102023653002102044653003702065700001502102700001402117700001202131773011902143856008802262852000902350655001202359IND60763080120221119231458.0220509e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076308012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1061652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan,10aRecycling schemes and supporting policies modeling for photovoltaic modules considering heterogeneous risks  aPhotovoltaic (PV) power generation systems are expected to play an indispensable role in the future power supply towards the carbon-neutrality target in China. However, without appropriate practices and systems being set up for recycling, recovering, and reusing, tremendous waste materials would occupy land space and pollute environment, posing threats to human health. Effective management of End-of-Life (EoL) PV modules serves a critical part for sustainable development of solar PV power. Here, we developed a complex network model considering incomplete and imperfect information to simulate its scheme and policies for PV module recycling. Three types of recycling modes and three policy scenarios were simulated and analyzed, and sensitivity analyses of risk levels, PV manufacturing and recycling costs are conducted for the robustness test. Based on the current status of recycling technology, the policy of mandatory recycling will impose additional costs and negatively impact the PV system adoption, while the subsidy policies can partially offset such negative impacts. Subsidies targeted at either recycled capacity of PV modules or electricity generated from PV power during its life time show similar effects. In addition, the subsidy policies also bring benefits in enhancing the robustness of the whole PV market. The fluctuation caused by unsystematic risks including project relocation, uncertainties in land contracts, PV module replacement, etc., will also be smoothed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3apower generation 3arisk 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aPhotovoltailc module recycling 0aCircular economy 0aRecycling policy 0aExtended producer responsibility1 aZhang, Qi,1 aWang, Ge,1 aLu, Xi,0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 May, v. 180 p.106165-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1061653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245013400132300001600266520091300282592002801195650002201223650001801245650001101263650001901274650000901293650001701302650002301319650001701342650001801359650001101377650002001388650002601408650001701434651000901451651001701460653001801477653001501495653002301510653001601533773014901549852000901698655001201707IND60710051520221121003141.0200908e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071005152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAberoumand, Ali10aEffect of processing on proximate composition and energy values of two less known selected fish species consumed in Southern Iran  ap. 417-420.  aThe proximate composition (crude protein, lipid and ash) and energy of fish species (Euthynnus affinis and Orcynopsis unicolor) from the Persian Gulf were compared. The lipid content of fresh O. unicolor was found to be significantly higher than that in E. affinis (P < 0.05). Energy content depends on the fat content. In this regard, after 6 months of storage, canned O. unicolor fish had high fat content and thus showed high energy values (376. 58 kcal kg⁻¹), while one month canned E. affinis with lower fat content (15.2 g kg⁻¹) exhibited lower energy values (276.4 kcal kg⁻¹). Both fish species are good sources of EPA and DHA. It can be concluded that fresh water mussels; E. affinis and O. unicolor are suitable as healthy food choice.

ISTR5 for biofunneling of lignin-derived compounds  ap. 277.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Lignin is the second most abundant natural polymer on earth. Industries using lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock generate a considerable amount of lignin as a byproduct with minimal usage. For a sustainable biorefinery, the lignin must be utilized in improved ways. Lignin is recalcitrant to degradation due to the complex and heterogeneous structure. The depolymerization of lignin and its conversion into specific product stream are the major challenges associated with lignin valorization. The blend of oligomeric, dimeric and monomeric lignin-derived compounds (LDCs) generated during depolymerization can be utilized by microbes for production of bioproducts. RESULTS: In the present study, a novel bacterium Burkholderia sp. strain ISTR5 (R5), a proteobacteria belonging to class betaproteobacteria, order Burkholderiales and family Burkholderiaceae, was isolated and characterized for the degradation of LDCs. R5 strain was cultured on 12 LDCs in mineral salt medium (MSM) supplemented with individual compounds such as syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, vanillin, vanillic acid, guaiacol, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, gallic acid, benzoic acid, syringaldehyde, veratryl alcohol and catechol. R5 was able to grow and utilize all the selected LDCs. The degradation of selected LDCs was monitored by bacterial growth, total organic carbon (TOC) removal and UV–Vis absorption spectra in scan mode. TOC reduction shown in the sample contains syringic acid 80.7%, ferulic acid 84.1%, p-coumaric acid 85.9% and benzoic acid 83.2%. In UV–Vis absorption spectral scan, most of the lignin-associated peaks were found at or near 280 nm wavelength in the obtained absorption spectra. Enzyme assay for the ligninolytic enzymes was also performed, and it was observed that lignin peroxidase and laccase were predominantly expressed. Furthermore, the GC–MS analysis of LDCs was performed to identify the degradation intermediates from these compounds. The genomic analysis showed the robustness of this strain and identified various candidate genes responsible for the degradation of aromatic or lignin derivatives, detoxification mechanism, oxidative stress response and fatty acid synthesis. The presence of peroxidases (13%), laccases (4%), monooxygenases (23%), dioxygenase (44%), NADPH: quinone oxidoreductases (16%) and many other related enzymes supported the degradation of LDCs. CONCLUSION: Numerous pathway intermediates were observed during experiment. Vanillin was found during growth on syringic acid, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid. Some other intermediates like catechol, acetovanillone, syringaldehyde and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde from the recognized bacterial metabolic pathways existed during growth on the LDCs. The ortho- and meta cleavage pathway enzymes, such as the catechol-1,2-dioxygenase, protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, catechol-2,3-dioxygenase and toluene-2,3-dioxygenase, were observed in the genome. In addition to the common aromatic degradation pathways, presence of the epoxyqueuosine reductase, 1,2-epoxyphenylacetyl-CoA isomerase in the genome advocates that this strain may follow the epoxy Coenzyme A thioester pathway for degradation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aBurkholderia 3aassays 3abacteria 3abacterial growth 3abenzoic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiopolymers 3abiorefining 3abiotechnology 3abyproducts 3acatechol 3acoenzyme A 3adegradation 3adepolymerization 3aepoxides 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3aferulic acid 3agallic acid 3agenes 3agenomics 3aguaiacol 3aindustry 3aisomerases 3alaccase 3alignin 3alignin peroxidase 3alignocellulose 3aoxidative stress 3ap-coumaric acid 3aquinones 3aspectral analysis 3astreams 3astress response 3asynthesis 3asyringic acid 3athioesters 3atotal organic carbon 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avanillic acid 3avanillin 3awavelengths1 aKumar, Madan1 aSingh, Shashi Shekhar1 aThakur, Indu Shekhar0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.277-277dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-019-1606-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245007800134300001600212520100700228592002801235650002301263650001301286650000901299650000901308650002801317650002001345650000701365650001701372650000901389650001201398650001101410650002201421650001401443653002301457653002301480653001501503653002401518700001401542700002101556773014901577852000901726655001201735IND60710051620221121003117.0200908e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071005162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaravanakumar, S.10aExploring fibrous byproducts as substrates to generate fibrolytic enzymes  ap. 421-425.  aThis research was focused to identify suitable fibrous byproducts to grow Trichoderma viridae and optimize the conditions for the production of fibrolytic enzymes viz. cellulase and xylanase.

Four light treatments (supplemental alternating red and blue light with intervals of 0, 1, 2, and 4 hours, with a monochromatic light intensity of 100 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹ and a cumulative lighting time of 16 hours per day) were conducted in a greenhouse under identical ambient light conditions (90 to 120 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹ at 12:00 am) for 10 days before green- and red-leaf pak choi were harvested. The results showed that the two-leaf-color pak choi receiving alternating red and blue light exhibited more compact canopies and wider leaves than those under the control treatment, which was attributed to the shade avoidance syndrome of plants. The present study indicated that the biomass of green-leaf pak choi was much higher than that of red-leaf pak choi, but the nutritional quality of green-leaf pak choi was lower than that of red-leaf pak choi, and seemingly indicating that the regulation of metabolism for pak choi was species specific under light exposure. The trends of both biomass and the soluble sugar content were highest under the 1-hour treatment. The contents of chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll in both cultivars (green- and red-leaf pak choi) were significantly increased compared with control, without significant differences among the 1-, 2-, and 4-hour treatments, whereas chlorophyll b exhibited no significant difference in any treatment. Alternating red- and blue-light treatment significantly affected the carotenoid content, but different trends in green- and red-leaf pak choi were observed, with the highest contents being detected under the 1-hour and 4-hour treatments, respectively. With increasing time intervals, the highest soluble protein contents in two-leaf-color pak choi were observed in the 4-hour treatment, whereas nitrate contents were significantly decreased in the 4-hour treatment. Compared with 0 hours, the contents of vitamin C, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and anthocyanins in two-leaf-color pak choi were significantly increased, but no significant differences were observed in vitamin C, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids among the 1-, 2-, and 4-hour treatments, similar to what was found for the anthocyanin content of green-leaf pak choi. However, the content of anthocyanins in red-leaf pak choi gradually increased with increasing time intervals, with the highest content being found in the 4-hour treatment. Supplemental alternating red and blue light slightly increased the antioxidant capacity [1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging rate and antioxidant power], but no significant differences were observed after 1, 2, and 4 hours of treatment. Taken together, treatment with an interval of 1 hour was the most effective for increasing the biomass of pak choi in this study, but treatment with a 4-hour interval should be considered to enhance the accumulation of health-promoting compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abiomass 3ablue light 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3agreenhouses 3ahealth promotion 3alight intensity 3ametabolism 3anitrates 3anutritive value 3asugar content 0aalternating red and blue light 0agrowth 0anutritional quality 0apak choi 0aspecies specific 0ashade avoidance syndrome1 aXu, Ya-liang1 aDuan, Fa-min1 aDu, Xu1 aYang, Qi-chang1 aZheng, Yin-jian0 tHortScience.g2021 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.118-125dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:1941x2327-98347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI15180-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014100165300001300306520180500319592002802124650002502152650001002177650002002187650000902207650002002216650001002236650003602246650003502282650001502317650001502332650001002347650001402357650001602371650001702387650001402404650002402418650002302442653001302465653001702478653001702495653001502512653001602527653004202543653001302585653000902598700003302607700003402640700005402674700002702728773011702755856008302872852000902955655001202964IND60563304620221120102825.0181015e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056330462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2017.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCowan, Mairi10aEffects of pinealectomy on the neuroendocrine reproductive system and locomotor activity in male European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax  ap. 1-12.  aThe seasonally changing photoperiod controls the timing of reproduction in most fish species, however, the transduction of this photoperiodic information to the reproductive axis is still unclear. This study explored the potential role of two candidate neuropeptide systems, gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih) and kisspeptin, as mediators between the pineal organ (a principle transducer of photoperiodic information) and reproductive axis in male European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax. Two seven-day experiments of pinealectomy (Px) were performed, in March (end of reproductive season) and August (resting season). Effects of Px and season on the brain expression of gnih (sbgnih) and its receptor (sbgnihr), kisspeptins (kiss1, kiss2) and their receptors (kissr2, kissr3) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh1, gnrh2, gnrh3) and the main brain receptor (gnrhr-II-2b) genes, plasma melatonin levels and locomotor activity rhythms were examined. Results showed that Px reduced night-time plasma melatonin levels. Gene expression analyses demonstrated a sensitivity of the Gnih system to Px in March, with a reduction in sbgnih in the mid-hindbrain, a region with bilateral connections to the pineal organ. In August, kiss2 levels increased in Px animals but not in controls. Significant differences in expression were observed for diencephalic sbgnih, sbgnihr, kissr3 and tegmental gnrh2 between seasons. Recordings of locomotor activity following surgery revealed a change from light-synchronised to free-running rhythmic behavior. Altogether, the Gnih and Kiss2 sensitivity to Px and seasonal differences observed for Gnih and its receptor, Gnrh2, and the receptor for Kiss2 (Kissr3), suggested they could be mediators involved in the relay between environment and seasonal reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3abrain 3abreeding season 3afish 3agene expression 3agenes 3agonadotropin inhibitory hormone 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3akisspeptin 3alocomotion 3amales 3amelatonin 3aphotoperiod 3apinealectomy 3areceptors 3areproductive system 3aseasonal variation 0aSea bass 0aPinealectomy 0aReproduction 0aLPXRFamide 0aKisspeptins 0aGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 0aBehavior 0aFish1 aPaullada-Salmerón, José A.1 aLópez-Olmeda, José Fernando1 aSánchez Vázquez, F.

The first group of these methods includes approaches based on the use of primers with arbitrary sequence (random priming). Another group of methods to detect DNA polymorphism is based on the use of primers that consist of short repetitive sequences having anchor nucleotides at the 5'- or 3'-ends that position the annealing sites of these primers (microsatellite priming). Another approach for revealing polymorphism that does not require knowledge of the DNA sequence is based on cleavage of total DNA by a combination of restriction endonucleases (random cleavage) accompanied by PCR amplification. Considerable attention is paid to the opportunities of using these approaches to detect DNA polymorphism in the form of converting the obtained data to digital format and creation of integrative databases for all organisms, regardless of the methods used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adatabases 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anucleic acid annealing 3anucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases1 aBaymiev, An.Kh.1 aGerashchenkov, G.A.1 aChemeris, D.A.1 aZubov, V.V.1 aKuluev, A.R.1 aBaymiev, Al.Kh.1 aChemeris, A.V.0 tRussian journal of genetics.g2018 May, v. 54, no. 5 p.499-513dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4138153x1022-79547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S102279541805006X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245009000182300001200272520161500284592002801899650002801927650002301955650001701978650001101995650001702006650001502023650001502038650001902053650001602072650001202088650001402100650001502114650001902129650002102148650002202169650001402191650001202205651001302217653001702230653001202247653002402259653001502283653001302298700002402311700002202335700001802357700002202375773011902397856008802516852000902604655001202613IND60592264220221120200455.0201125e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059226422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.2842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYli-Halla, M.q(Markku),10aLow black carbon concentration in agricultural soils of central and northern Ethiopia  ap. 1-6.  aSoil carbon (C) represents the largest terrestrial carbon stock and is key for soil productivity. Major fractions of soil C consist of organic C, carbonates and black C. The turnover rate of black C is lower than that of organic C, and black C abundance decreases the vulnerablility of soil C stock to decomposition under climate change. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of soil C in different pools and impact of agricultural management on the abundance of different species. Soil C fractions were quantified in the topsoils (0–15cm) of 23 sites in the tropical highlands of Ethiopia. The sites in central Ethiopia represented paired plots of agroforestry and adjacent control plots where cereal crops were traditionally grown in clayey soils. In the sandy loam and loam soils of northern Ethiopia, the pairs represented restrained grazing with adjacent control plots with free grazing, and terracing with cereal-based cropping with adjacent control plots without terracing. Soil C contained in carbonates, organic matter and black C along with total C was determined. The total C median was 1.5% (range 0.3–3.6%). The median proportion of organic C was 85% (range 53–94%), 6% (0–41%) for carbonate C and 6% (4–21%) for black C. An increase was observed in the organic C and black C fractions attributable to agroforestry and restrained grazing. The very low concentration of the relatively stable black C fraction and the dominance of organic C in these Ethiopian soils suggest vulnerability to degradation and the necessity for cultivation practices maintaining the C stock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3aagricultural soils 3aagroforestry 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3acarbonates 3aclay soils 3aclimate change 3agrain crops 3agrazing 3ahighlands 3aloam soils 3aorganic matter 3asandy loam soils 3asoil productivity 3aterracing 3atopsoil 3aEthiopia 0aBlack carbon 0aBiochar 0aSoil organic matter 0aCarbonates 0aEthiopia1 aRimhanen, Karoliina1 aMuurinen, Johanna1 aKaseva, Janne1 aKahiluoto, Helena0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 631-632 p.1-6dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.2843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012900171520165400300592002801954650002501982650002702007650001502034650001902049653002902068653002202097653002702119653002602146653002302172653002802195700001902223773011902242856008802361852000902449655001202458IND60763080520221119231617.0220509e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076308052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1061692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Sónia10aCan structural changes lead to dematerialization? Lessons from the Portuguese socioeconomic metabolism between 1995 and 2017  aWhile material use is a vital part of human well-being and development, it is also associated with serious environmental impacts. This is cause for concern as there has been little evidence of decoupling between well-being and material use in national economies. Therefore, a detailed understanding of material use and its implications on socioeconomic metabolism (SEM) is required. This paper provides insights into the dynamics of material use and economic growth by quantifying the socioeconomic flows associated with the structural changes that affected the Portuguese economy between 1995 and 2017. We first identify different development periods based on material flow analysis and the corresponding economic structural changes. Their impacts on the socioeconomic metabolism are quantified through the analysis of monetary and physical input-output tables. Our detailed analysis has shed light on the role of each sector in material consumption across all sectors with which their activities are intertwined. We found that the Portuguese SEM went through 5 different periods in which the construction and services sectors contributed the most to the changes in the SEM. We found that, for example, despite being a high-productivity sector per se, the development of the services sector may require the support of the construction sector through the creation of infrastructures, and this affects the potential decoupling of material use and economic growth. Understanding these dynamics is key for the creation of policies and initiatives that will lead to a more sustainable economic development and constitutes the main focus of this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3amaterial flow analysis 3ametabolism 3asocial welfare 0aSocioeconomic metabolism 0aDematerialization 0aMaterial flow analysis 0aInput-output analysis 0aStructural changes 0aSustainable development1 aFerrão, Paulo0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 May, v. 180 p.106169-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1061693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04245naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100001500175245009800190300001600288520248400304592002802788650001102816650001802827650002802845650002202873650001702895650001102912650002002923650001302943650002502956650001802981650001202999650002403011650001903035650001403054650003603068650002003104650001503124650001803139650003303157650001003190650001003200650001203210650000903222650001603231651001203247653001303259653002403272653001803296700005303314700001603367700002003383700002603403773011203429856008103541852000903622655001203631IND60652483220221122075129.0190713e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065248322DNAL7 a29983132 299831322pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311180015442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamara, Y.10aAnalysing innovations among cattle smallholders to evaluate the adequacy of breeding programs  ap. 417-426.  aMany breeding programs have been implemented in developing countries, many of which have been unsuccessful. To better understand the failure of these breeding programs, it is proposed to analyze their adequacy with innovations that are actually adopted by smallholders. The proposed methodology takes account of these innovations, the reasons for their adoption and the objectives of livestock keeping. The N’Dama cattle-breeding program in Senegal was used as a case study. Surveys were carried out among 54 farmers: 27 breeders who participated in this program, 17 of whom recently resigned, and 27 breeders who have never participated. Feeding was the most frequently cited area of innovation, followed by infrastructure. Genetics, animal health and reproduction held the third rank. Milk production appeared as an important objective of breeders, although the context remains one of strong multifunctionality. Principal component analysis highlighted three categories of breeders according to the innovations they adopted: institutional, modernizing, and integrating innovators. The groups of institutional and modernizing innovators dominate, gathering each 41% of the farmers. In the first category, breeders have organized themselves in an association and use N’Dama sires, livestock aiming at an insurance objective. In the second category, artificial insemination with exotic breeds and other technical innovations (cowshed, vaccination, urea treatment of straw) are used to improve production of milk and meat. The third group is termed ‘integrating innovators,’ since their innovations aim at integrating livestock and crop production. Gathering 18% of the sampled breeders, this group presents intermediate features between the two previous groups, using animals as draught power and for manure production. These results indicate that a process of intensification is at play and that the genetic improvement through the selection of N’Dama cattle for production criteria does not meet the breeders’ demand. However, the N’Dama’s adaptive traits justify its use as part of the breeding strategy of farmers, either in pure-breeding or in crossbreeding. The study thus tends to show the interactive link between genetic improvement and other innovations. It suggests that the success of a breeding program depends on its adequate positioning within the set of innovations adopted by breeders and proposes a method to inform breeding programs accordingly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN'dama 3aanimal health 3aartificial insemination 3abreeding programs 3acase studies 3acattle 3acattle breeding 3acrossing 3adeveloping countries 3adraft animals 3afarmers 3agenetic improvement 3ainfrastructure 3ainsurance 3aintegrated agricultural systems 3ameat production 3amilk yield 3amodernization 3aprincipal component analysis 3asires 3astraw 3asurveys 3aurea 3avaccination 3aSenegal 0aN’Dama 0abreeding objectives 0acrossbreeding1 aMoula, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4438-87591 aSow, Fatou,1 aSissokho, M.

Current methods used for monitoring intra-abdominal disease progression in rodents usually involve euthanasia at various time-points for end of study, one-time individual tissue collections. Most rodent organ tumour models are developed by the introduction of tumour cells via laparotomy or via ultrasound-guided indirect visualization. Ischaemic rodent models are often generated using laparotomies. This approach requires a high number of rodents, and in some instances introduces high degrees of morbidity and mortality, thereby increasing study variability and expense. Most importantly, most laparotomies do not promote the highest level of rodent welfare. Recent improvements in laparoscopic equipment and techniques have enabled the adaptation of laparoscopy for rodent procedures. Laparoscopy, which is considered the gold standard for many human abdominal procedures, allows for serial biopsy collections from the same animal, results in decreased pain and tissue trauma as well as quicker postsurgical recovery, and preserves immune function in comparison to the same procedures performed by laparotomy. Laparoscopy improves rodent welfare, decreases interanimal variability, thereby reducing the number of required animals, allows for the replacement of larger species, decreases expense and improves data yield. This review article compares rodent laparotomy and laparoscopic surgical methods, and describes the utilization of laparoscopy for the development of cancer models and assessment of disease progression to improve data collection and animal welfare. In addition, currently available rodent laparoscopic equipment and instrumentation are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeuthanasia 3adisease models 3aanimal injuries 3apain 3aequipment 3ahumans 3adisease surveillance 3adrugs 3amorbidity 3ainstrumentation 3adata collection 3aneoplasms 3apreserves 3alaparoscopy 3ametabolic diseases 3alaparotomy 3abiopsy 3arodents 3amortality 3adisease course 0a

Migrants must make behavioral decisions that can favor either migratory speed or safety from predators, but often not both. We compare the behavior of adult and juvenile western sandpipers Calidris mauri during the course of their temporally segregated passages at a major stopover site. Here, the passage and winter arrival of an important predator, the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus begins near the end of the adult sandpiper passage (July) and increases rapidly through the juvenile passage (August). The mortality-minimizing hypothesis predicts that as the falcon front is distant but approaching, sandpipers should initially increase the fuel-loading rate (lowered vigilance and predator apprehension) to increase migration speed and so maintain their head start. As the falcon front gains proximity to and passes over the stopover site, sandpipers should become increasingly cautious. Our measurements show that adults decreased vigilance during the period prior to falcon arrival, and had lower vigilance overall than juveniles. Juveniles were more apprehensive, flying further and longer in response to disturbance by a falcon silhouette. This trend was reversed in response to a human approach. Both groups were more vigilant and more apprehensive in a study year with earlier falcon arrival. These results suggest that late (juvenile) and early (adult) migrants minimize mortality on migration in different ways, adults by increased migratory speed at the expense of caution on stopover sites, and juveniles by increased caution at the expense of speed.  aPublisher supplied data 3apredators 3aadults 3aflight 3aCalidris 3aFalco peregrinus 3amortality 3afalcons 3ajuveniles 0aFalco perigrinus1 aLank, David B.1 aYdenberg, Ronald C.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2014 May, v. 68, no. 5 p.827-838dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-014-1695-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245008100211300001800292520148200310592002801792650002301820650002401843650001401867650001701881650002301898650001601921700002101937700002201958700002001980700002402000773009702024856008102121990002302202852000902225655001202234IND60091317920221122053146.0141103e20111005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009131792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2011.08.0262doi7 aPMC31838042pmcid7 a219615872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarber, Annika F.10aMolecular Mapping of General Anesthetic Sites in a Voltage-Gated Ion Channel  ap. 1613-1622.  aSeveral voltage-gated ion channels are modulated by clinically relevant doses of general anesthetics. However, the structural basis of this modulation is not well understood. Previous work suggested that n-alcohols and inhaled anesthetics stabilize the closed state of the Shaw2 voltage-gated (Kv) channel (K-Shaw2) by directly interacting with a discrete channel site. We hypothesize that the inhibition of K-Shaw2 channels by general anesthetics is governed by interactions between binding and effector sites involving components of the channel's activation gate. To investigate this hypothesis, we applied Ala/Val scanning mutagenesis to the S4-S5 linker and the post-PVP S6 segment, and conducted electrophysiological analysis to evaluate the energetic impact of the mutations on the inhibition of the K-Shaw2 channel by 1-butanol and halothane. These analyses identified residues that determine an apparent binding cooperativity and residue pairs that act in concert to modulate gating upon anesthetic binding. In some instances, due to their critical location, key residues also influence channel gating. Complementing these results, molecular dynamics simulations and in silico docking experiments helped us visualize possible anesthetic sites and interactions. We conclude that the inhibition of K-Shaw2 by general anesthetics results from allosteric interactions between distinct but contiguous binding and effector sites involving inter- and intrasubunit interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosome mapping 3ageneral anesthetics 3ahalothane 3aion channels 3amolecular dynamics 3amutagenesis1 aLiang, Qiansheng1 aAmaral, Cristiano1 aTreptow, Werner1 aCovarrubias, Manuel0 tBiophysical journal.g2011 Oct. 5, v. 101, no. 7 p.1613-1622dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2011.08.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01443naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245015700156300001800313520039700331592002800728650001600756650001300772650002300785650002200808700002100830700001200851700001700863700002300880700002400903773010600927856007501033852000901108655001201117IND60578395720221122063824.0170813e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057839572DNAL7 a10.1021/ol301268j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Chenjie10aDesign, Preparation, X-ray Crystal Structure, and Reactivity of o-Alkoxyphenyliodonium Bis(methoxycarbonyl)methanide, a Highly Soluble Carbene Precursor  ap. 3170-3173.  aThe preparation, X-ray structure, and reactivity of new, highly soluble, and reactive iodonium ylides derived from malonate methyl ester and bearing an ortho substituent on the phenyl ring are reported.

ATCC31749. The genes occurred in two, nonoverlapping, genomic fragments that complemented different sets of curdlan(crd)-deficient transposon-insertion mutations. These were detected as colonies that failed to stain with aniline blue, a (1→3)-β-glucan specific dye. One fragment carried a biosynthetic gene cluster (locus I) containing the putative curdlan synthase gene, crdS, and at least two other crd genes. The second fragment may contain only a single crd gene (locus II). Determination of the DNA sequence adjacent to several locus I mutations revealed homology to known sequences only in the cases of crdS mutations. Complete sequencing of the 1623 bp crdS gene revealed highest similarities between the predicted CrdS protein (540 amino acids) and glycosyl transferases with repetitive action patterns. These include bacterial cellulose synthases (and their homologs), which form (1→4)-β-glucans. No similarity was detected with putative (1→3)-β-glucan synthases from yeasts and filamentous fungi. Whatever the determinants of the linkage specificity of these β-glucan synthases might be, these results raise the possibility that (1→3)-β-glucans and (1→4)-β-glucans are formed by related catalytic polypeptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium 3aDNA 3aamino acids 3abeta-glucans 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose synthase 3acurdlan 3afluorescent dyes 3agenomics 3aloci 3amultigene family 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3apolypeptides 3asequence analysis 3ayeasts 0a(1→3)-β-glucan 0aplant health 0arepetitive β-glycosyl transferases 0aAgrobacterium sp.

To determine the effect of chop length of GS and GS:maize silage (MS) ratio on the performance, reticular pH, metabolism and eating behaviour of dairy cows, 16 multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows were used in a 4×4 Latin square design with four periods each of 28-days duration. Ryegrass was harvested and ensiled at two mean chop lengths (short and long) and included at two ratios of GS:MS (100:0 or 40:60 dry matter (DM) basis). The forages were fed in mixed rations to produce four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets: long chop GS, short chop GS, long chop GS and MS and short chop GS and MS. The DM intake (DMI) was 3.2 kg/day higher (P<0.001) when cows were fed the MS than the GS-based diets. The short chop length GS also resulted in a 0.9 kg/day DM higher (P<0.05) DMI compared with the long chop length. When fed the GS:MS-based diets, cows produced 2.4 kg/day more (P<0.001) milk than when fed diets containing GS only. There was an interaction (P<0.05) between chop length and forage ratio for milk yield, with a short chop length GS increasing yield in cows fed GS but not MS-based diets. An interaction for DM and organic matter digestibility was also observed (P<0.05), where a short chop length GS increased digestibility in cows when fed the GS-based diets but had little effect when fed the MS-based diet. When fed the MS-based diets, cows spent longer at reticular pH levels below pH 6.2 and pH 6.5 (P<0.01), but chop length had little effect. Cows when fed the MS-based diets had a higher (P<0.05) milk fat concentration of C18 : 2n-6 and total polyunsaturated fatty acids compared with when fed the GS only diets. In conclusion, GS chop length had little effect on reticular pH, but a longer chop length reduced DMI and milk yield but had little effect on milk fat yield. Including MS reduced reticular pH, but increased DMI and milk performance irrespective of the GS chop length.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aLolium 3achop length 3achopping 3acorn silage 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aeating habits 3aforage 3agrass silage 3ametabolism 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk fat yield 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aparticle size 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arumen fermentation 0aforage ratio 0amilk production 0aparticle size distribution 0aryegrass silage1 aWilkinson, R.

Little to no research has been done to evaluate the effect of CYP genotype on sweet corn yield. Yield of 23 sweet corn hybrids of known CYP genotype was evaluated in 2007, 2008, and 2009 following postemergence applications of mesotrione, an hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitor, or nicosulfuron, an acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor, at two growth stages. Mesotrione and nicosulfuron were evaluated in separate experiments. Treatments included herbicide application during the V3 to V5 or V5 to V7 growth stages and a nontreated control. Crop injury, measured 7 d after treatment (DAT), ranged from 0 to 87% for mesotrione and 0 to 54% for nicosulfuron among CYP genotypes. Injury from both mesotrione and nicosulfuron was most severe following application during V3 to V5 growth stages on hybrids with mutant (i.e., nonfunctional) cyp alleles. Only hybrids homozygous for mutant cyp alleles (i.e., cypcyp) suffered yield losses from mesotrione, ranging from 9 to 40%. These hybrids were not evaluated for nicosulfuron because applications of ALS-inhibiting herbicides kill cypcyp hybrids. Nicosulfuron reduced the yield of CYPcyp hybrids only; whereas mesotrione did not. Yield losses from nicosulfuron ranged from 9 to 35% among CYPcyp hybrids and were associated with moderate to severe loss of kernel rows (i.e., ear pinching). Yield of CYPCYP hybrids was not affected by mesotrione or nicosulfuron.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aapplication timing 3aalleles 3agenetic resistance 3amesotrione 3adevelopmental stages 3agenetic variation 3ametabolic detoxification 3aheterozygosity 3acytochrome P-450 3acrop yield 3asweetcorn 3amutants 3aherbicide resistance 3ahomozygosity 3aplant damage 3anicosulfuron1 aPataky, Jerald K.1 aWilliams, Martin M.0 tAgronomy journal.g2010 July, v. 102, no. 4 p.1138-1144dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/506043Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2010.00933Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03791naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003500142245007400177300001600251520233800267592002802605650000902633650001302642650002302655650001102678650001102689650001802700650002302718650002402741650001502765650001502780650001002795650002102805650000902826650001702835651001302852651000902865653001402874653002802888653001102916653003502927653000902962653002002971653002102991653000903012700002003021700002403041773010903065856007803174852000903252655001203261IND50065182820221119093637.0151127e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006518282DNAL7 a10.3170/2008-8-184592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Heijden, Geertje M. F.10aInfestation of trees by lianas in a tropical forest in Amazonian Peru  ap. 747-756.  aQuestion: In Amazonian moist forest, four questions arose: 1. Do tree species differ in their susceptibility to lianas? 2. What host tree traits (branch-free bole height, growth rate, bark type, leaf length and adult stature) are correlated with the susceptibility of tree species to lianas infesting the trunk and the crown? 3. To what extent do spatial variables (proximity to liana-infested trees and the light environment of the tree crown) affect the likelihood of liana infestation? 4. Are spatial variables or tree traits relatively more important in influencing the susceptibility of trees to lianas? We address all questions separately for trunk and crown infestation.Location: Tambopata Nature Reserve, Peru.Methods: We collected information on liana infestation, tree morphological traits, growth, light-environment and position for 3675 trees in seven 1-ha permanent sample plots. We separated trunk from crown infestation and used correlation and logistic regression analyses for tree species and individual tree-level analyses, respectively.Results: Half of all trees were colonised by at least one liana. Of 41 relatively common dicot tree species, at least five have significantly greater and three significantly lower crown infestation rates than expected by chance. Trunk and crown infestation are influenced by different host traits –– trunk infestation was only affected by bark type, while crown infestation is reduced when trees are fast-growing, tall, have low-density wood, long branch-free boles and long leaves. The likelihood of both trunk and crown infestation increases for trees growing in close proximity to another liana-infested tree, but is invariant with the light environment of tree crowns.Conclusion: Crown and trunk infestation have not been properly distinguished before; it is important to do so as the factors determining the different modes of infestation differ fundamentally. The association between crown infestation and tree traits suggests that increases in liana dominance in Amazonian forests could cause changes in forest composition, including favouring faster growing tree species with low density wood, potentially reducing the carbon stored by mature forests.Nomenclature: We used current nomenclature at the time of analysis as provided at TROPICOS http://www.tropicos.org/  aPublisher supplied data 3abark 3abranches 3aconservation areas 3aleaves 3alianas 3amature plants 3aplant architecture 3aregression analysis 3atree crown 3atree trunk 3atrees 3atropical forests 3awood 3awood density 3aAmazonia 3aPeru 0aBark type 0aBranch-free bole height 0aCarbon 0aCrown illumination index (CII) 0aPalm 0aSpatial pattern 0aTree growth rate 0aVine1 aHealey, John R.1 aPhillips, Oliver L.0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2008 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.747-756dOpulus Press Uppsalax1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3170%2F2008-8-184593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006500183245006000248506007600308520189800384592002802282506003702310650001602347650001102363650002502374650001402399650002802413650001802441650002002459650001602479650000802495650002702503650002102530650002102551650001302572650001102585650001002596651001102606700006902617700006502686700003102751700003602782773010302818856007602921852000902997655001203006IND60624338120221207102202.0181203e20180502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062433812DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/71592162doi7 aPMC59548562pmcid7 a298544422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstrada-Reyes, César1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4932-221410aDietary Patterns and Fitness Level in Mexican Teenagers  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground. Nowadays, the term “physical fitness” has evolved from sports performance to health status, and it has been considered a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease. In this sense, test batteries have been developed to evaluate physical fitness such as the ALPHA-FIT battery. On the other hand, the analysis of dietary patterns has emerged as an alternative method to study the relationship between diet and chronic noncommunicable diseases. However, the association between dietary patterns and the physical fitness level has not been evaluated in both adults and adolescents. This association is most important in adolescents due to the fact that establishing healthy dietary behaviors and a favorable nutritional profile in early stages of life prevents various chronic-degenerative diseases. Objective. To analyze the association between dietary patterns and the level of fitness in Mexican teenagers. Methods. We analyzed the relationship between dietary patterns and the fitness level of 42 teenage students in Toluca, Mexico. Students were weighed and measured, and their food intake was recorded for 2 weekdays and one weekend day. Dietary patterns were obtained by factorial analysis. The ALPHA-FIT battery was used to measure the fitness level. Results. Fifty percent of the students were found to have a low fitness level (62.1% men; 37.9% women). There was no association (X2 = 0.83) between the dietary patterns “high in fat and sugar,” “high in protein”, and “low in fat and protein” and the level of physical condition in teens. Conclusions. In this study, all of teenagers with a very low level of fitness obtained a high dietary pattern in protein; however, 40% with a high level of physical condition resulted in the same pattern; that is why we did not find a relationship between the fitness level and the patterns investigated in this study.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3aadults 3aathletic performance 3abatteries 3acardiovascular diseases 3aeating habits 3afactor analysis 3afood intake 3amen 3anoninfectious diseases 3anutrient content 3aphysical fitness 3astudents 3asugars 3awomen 3aMexico1 aTlatempa-Sotelo, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0356-99911 aValdés-Ramos, Roxana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0093-886X1 aCabañas-Armesilla, María1 aManjarrez-Montes-de-Oca, Rafael0 tJournal of nutrition and metabolism.g2018 May 2, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:21568x2090-07327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/71592163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03971naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100001500175245008200190300001600272520242500288592002802713650001502741650001602756650001002772650001702782650001502799650001202814650003202826650002202858650002502880650002002905650001502925650002602940650002602966650002402992650001003016650001503026650001703041650001203058650001503070650001803085650001703103650002003120653002003140653000903160653000903169653001903178700001803197773011203215856008103327852000903408655001203417IND60652483720221122075047.0190713e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065248372DNAL7 a29983129 299831292pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311180015932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbidhi, R.10aWater footprint assessment of sheep farming systems based on farm survey data  ap. 407-416.  aWater scarcity is among the main challenges making vulnerable the livestock farming systems in drylands. The water footprint (WF) indicator was proposed as a metric to measure the impacts of livestock production on freshwater resources. Therefore, this study aimed to assess water use in five different Tunisian sheep production systems using the Water Footprint Network methodology. The primary data were obtained from 1050 sheep farms located in 13 Tunisian provinces. A multivariate analysis was performed to characterize the different farming systems. A validation step of the WF modeled values of sheep meat was conducted in 12 sheep farms belonging to two different farming systems. This was done through year-round monitoring of on-farm practices using water metres and recording equipment’s taking into account the direct and indirect water use. The typology analysis came up with five sheep farming systems that are the mixed sheep-cereal (MSC), the agro-sylvo-pastoral (ASP), the agro-pastoral (AP), the extensive agro-pastoral (EAP) and the mixed sheep-olive tree farming systems. The WF of sheep meat produced under the target farming systems ranged from 8654 to 13 056 l/kg live weight. The evaluation of WF of five different sheep production systems figured out that sheep raised under the EAP farming system had the greatest WF per ton of live animal. However, the ASP farming system exhibited the lowest WF. Water used to grow feedstuffs for sheep production accounts for 98% of the total WF of sheep. The green WF accounts for more than 92% of the total WF in all farming systems. Results of monitoring water use at farm scale show that the modeled values of WF are overestimated by an average of 23.3% and 24.1% for the selected farms assigned to the MSC and AP farming systems, respectively. Water use for sheep production is high in most of the Tunisian farms. Therefore, the general assumption that ‘meat production is a driver of water scarcity’ is supported and should be considered as an important focal point in agricultural and water policies. Particular attention should be given to forage crops with low WFs and high contribution to dry matter to provide ration with low WF. The efficient use of green water along the meat value chain is essential to minimize the depletion of blue water resources and to reduce the economic dependency on virtual water through the import of feedstuffs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abody weight 3afeeds 3aforage crops 3afreshwater 3aimports 3alivestock and meat industry 3alivestock farming 3alivestock production 3ameat production 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3aproduction technology 3arecording equipment 3asheep 3asheep meat 3asupply chain 3asurveys 3atree farms 3avirtual water 3awater policy 3awater shortages 0awater footprint 0ameat 0acrop 0afarming system1 aBen Salem, H.0 tAnimal.g2019 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.407-416dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311180015933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011400175300001600289520130500305592002801610650001301638650001101651650000901662650001201671650002301683650001401706650001201720650001001732650001501742650001201757650001601769650001901785650001001804700001801814773011901832856008201951852000902033655001202042IND60616858820221116161322.0181020e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061685882DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517505075003052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalasubramanian, K. K.10aBeck Dyeing Conditions Impact the Wear Performance of Nylon 66 Carpets Inserted with Low-Melt Polyamide Yarns  ap. 213-218.  aInserting a lower melting polyamide yarn between plies of nylon 66 yarn improves the appearance retention (AR) of carpet subjected to foot trafficking. However, the severe conditions associated with a commercial Beck dyeing process—water temperatures held close to the boil for several hours and unremitting physical rubbing of the heavy, wet surface—affect wear performance. Because Beck dyeing is preferred for contract carpet constructions, i.e., for use in schools, airports, hotels, hospitals, etc., where wear performance is of paramount importance, a low-melt inserted carpet’s ability to retain its improved wear performance following the rigors of dyeing raises important questions. A gas chromatographic method is developed to quantify the amount of insert yarn present in these carpets. Measurements taken from carpets sampled both before and after the Beck dyeing show that the loss of low-melt polyamide with dyeing is minimal. While these inserted carpets exhibit poorer AR performance under the extreme dye conditions of temperatures and dwell times, they outperform controls lacking the insert yarns. The slight performance deterioration likely results from a combination of redistribution of the low-melt material and the continual surface brushing during the dyeing operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairports 3adyeing 3adyes 3afabrics 3agas chromatography 3ahospitals 3amelting 3anylon 3apolyamides 3aschools 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3ayarns1 aMiller, R.

Several microbial diseases are associated with biofilms that pose challenges in treatment with antibiotics targeting individual cells. Bacteria in biofilms secrete exopolymeric substances that contribute to architectural stability and provide a secure niche to inhabiting cells. Quorum sensing (QS) plays essential roles in biofilm development. Pathogenic bacteria in biofilms utilize QS mechanisms to activate virulence and develop antibiotic resistance. This review is a brief overview of biofilm research and provides updates on recent understandings on biofilm development, antibiotic resistance and transmission, and importance of QS mechanisms. Strategies to combat biofilm associated diseases including anti-biofilm substances, quorum quenching molecules, bio-surfactants and competitive inhibitors are briefly discussed. The review concludes with updates on recent approaches utilized for biofilm inhibition and provides perspectives for further research in the field.  aPublisher supplied data  aSAU Startup GrantcSouth Asian University, New Delhi, India  aIYBA2008cDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abiosurfactants 3aquorum sensing 3avirulence 3avirulent strains1 aJoshī, Yogeśa,1 aRawat, Kartik1 aBisht, Renu0 tIndian journal of microbiology.g2019 Mar., v. 59, no. 1 p.3-12dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl14369x0046-89917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-018-0757-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01959naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245012400166300001400290520095500304592002801259506003701287650002801324650001501352650001501367650001401382650002601396700001901422773012401441852000901565856008301574655001201657IND2060304620221207123206.0220422e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206030462DNAL7 a10.1177/0261192997025001072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutsche, Walter10aPreselection of Potential Cancerostatics by Automatic Analysis of Suspended and Adherent Cells Incubated in Microplates  ap. 45-54.  aAlternative toxicological screening programmes, without the use of animal experiments, are intended to eliminate dangerous substances and to find new pharmacologically active agents in cell cultures.

Intercalating cytostatics which bind DNA were selected by measuring the statistical distributions of the cell diameters of K-562 and L-929 cells by using an electronic cell analyser (CASY1). These compounds were identified by cell enlargement or from flat concentration-activity curves created with the cell analyser system. Incubation for 72 hours with DNA-binding agents, such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin and Mitoxantron®, resulted in enlargement of cell diameter and cell volume. The antineoplastic agents actinomycin D and ambazone had no comparable effect.

The present study was conducted to identify genes determining post-anthesis drought stress tolerance in bread wheat through Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) analysis. Two cultivated bread wheat accessions were selected as parental lines. Population phenotyping was carried out on 133 F2:3 families. Two field experiments and two experiments in the greenhouse were conducted at IPK-Gatersleben, Germany with control and post-anthesis stress conditions in each experiment. Thousand-grain weight was recorded as the main wheat yield component, which is reduced by post-anthesis drought stress. Chemical desiccation was applied in three experiments as simulator of post-anthesis drought stress whereas water stress was applied in one greenhouse experiment. Analysis of variance showed significant differences among the F2:3 families. The molecular genetic linkage map including 293 marker loci associated to 19 wheat chromosomes was applied for QTL analysis. The present study revealed four and six QTLs for thousand-grain weight under control and stress conditions, respectively. Only one QTL on chromosome 4BL was common for both conditions. Five QTLs on chromosomes 1AL, 4AL, 7AS, and 7DS were found to be specific to the stress condition. Both parents contributed alleles for drought tolerance. Taking the known reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 4AL/7BS into account, the importance of the short arms of homoeologous group 7 is confirmed for drought stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalleles 3aanalysis of variance 3achromosome mapping 3adrought tolerance 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aloci 3aparents 3aquantitative trait loci 3areciprocal translocation 3astress tolerance 3awater stress 3awheat 3ayield components 3aGermany1 aWeber, W.

Environmental persistence of M. bovis excreted by infected hosts may cause indirect transmission to other animals. However, methodological constrains hamper assessment of M. bovis viability and molecular signature in environmental matrices. In this work, an innovative, modular, and highly efficient single-cell workflow combining flow cytometry (FLOW), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was developed, allowing detection, quantification, and sorting of viable and dormant M. bovis cells from environmental matrices. Validation with spiked water and sediments showed high efficiency (90%) of cell recovery, with high linearity between expected and observed results, both in cell viability evaluation (r² =0.93) and FISH-labelled M. bovis cells quantification (r² ≥0.96). The limit of detection was established at 10⁵ cells/g of soil in the cell viability step and 10² cells/g of soil in the taxonomical labelling stage. Moreover, FACS efficiency attained noteworthy recovery yield (50%) and purity (60% viable cells; 70% taxonomically labelled M. bovis). This new methodology represents a huge step for M. bovis assessment outside the mammal host, offering the rapid quantification of M. bovis cell load and cell viability, including viable but non-culturable cells, and further downstream cell analyses after FACS. Subsequent environmental data integration with the clinical component will expand knowledge on transmission routes, promising new paths in TB research and an intervention tool to mitigate the underlying biohazard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium bovis 3abiological hazards 3acell viability 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental fate 3afish 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3ahybridization 3amammals 3asoil 3atuberculosis 0aMycobacterium bovis 0aContaminated environment 0aIndirect transmission 0aFlow cytometry 0aFluorescence in situ hybridization 0aFluorescence-activated cell sorting1 aTenreiro, Ana1 aTenreiro, Rogério,1 aCunha, Monica V.,0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 June 15, v. 432 p.128687-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1286873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006500183245009500248506007600343520113300419592002801552596004401580506003701624650002401661650001001685650001101695650001601706650001401722650004301736650005201779650001001831650001201841650002901853650002601882650002001908650001001928700002201938700002401960700002601984700002402010700002002034700002302054700006102077700002802138773010302166856007602269852000902345655001202354IND60624338420221207102219.0181203e20180424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062433842DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/72034692doi7 aPMC59418162pmcid7 a298504752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShchennikova, Anna V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4692-372714aThe YABBY Genes of Leaf and Leaf-Like Organ Polarity in Leafless Plant Monotropa hypopitys  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMonotropa hypopitys is a mycoheterotrophic, nonphotosynthetic plant acquiring nutrients from the roots of autotrophic trees through mycorrhizal symbiosis, and, similar to other extant plants, forming asymmetrical lateral organs during development. The members of the YABBY family of transcription factors are important players in the establishment of leaf and leaf-like organ polarity in plants. This is the first report on the identification of YABBY genes in a mycoheterotrophic plant devoid of aboveground vegetative organs. Seven M. hypopitys YABBY members were identified and classified into four clades. By structural analysis of putative encoded proteins, we confirmed the presence of YABBY-defining conserved domains and identified novel clade-specific motifs. Transcriptomic and qRT-PCR analyses of different tissues revealed MhyYABBY transcriptional patterns, which were similar to those of orthologous YABBY genes from other angiosperms. These data should contribute to the understanding of the role of the YABBY genes in the regulation of developmental and physiological processes in achlorophyllous leafless plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a14-24-00175cRussian Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMonotropa hypopitys 3agenes 3aleaves 3amycorrhizae 3anutrients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3atrees1 aSlugina, Marya A.1 aBeletsky, Alexey V.1 aFilyushin, Mikhail A.1 aMardanov, Andrey A.1 aShulga, Olga A.1 aKochieva, Elena Z.1 aRavin, Nikolay V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1456-18321 aSkryabin, Konstantin G.0 tInternational Journal of Genomics.g2018 Apr. 24, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:26808x2314-43787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/72034693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245007900159300001600238500000900254500001500263520128500278592002801563650002701591650002401618650001501642650001401657650001601671650001801687650000901705650003001714650000901744653001601753700002501769700002301794700002001817700001801837700001801855773015701873852000902030856007902039655001202118IND4463467520221120212953.0191125e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446346752DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2011.02602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGould, Scott12aA New Method for Developing Equations Applied to the Water Retention Curve  ap. 806-814.  aepub  a2019-12-05  aThe soil water retention curve (WRC) represents the relationship between soil suction and water content. Previous equations for representing the WRC do not include a direct relationship between features of the curve and equation fitting parameters. We present a new method for developing equations for representing empirical data that ensures that features of the curve are directly related to fitting parameters in the equation. The method also ensures that the equation has a simple derivative and is readily integrated, an important property if the equation is to be used as part of a numerical model. This method has been applied to the WRC, producing a new equation that is able to accurately represent the entire WRC using a single equation. The direct relationship between the main features of the curve and fitting parameters ensures that the fitting parameters have clear theoretical meaning. Additionally, this direct relationship allows fitting parameters, such as the air-entry value, to be calculated using pedotransfer functions. The equation has been fitted to a wide range of experimental data and has been demonstrated to achieve an excellent fit for sand, silt, and clay soils across the entire suction range from the minimum measured suction value to 10⁶ kPa.  aPublisher supplied data 3apedotransfer functions 3amathematical models 3aclay soils 3aequations 3amethodology 3awater content 3asand 3asoil water characteristic 3asilt 0anew methods1 aRajeev, Pathmanathan1 aKodikara, Jayantha1 aZhao, Xiao-Ling1 aBurn, Stewart1 aMarlow, David0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2012 May, v. 76, no. 3 p.806-814dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2011.02603Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02424naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008300172300001600255520102600271592002801297650002301325650001901348650002201367650002201389650001801411650002001429650001101449650001301460650001401473650001901487650001401506650002201520650001401542650002101556653002301577653003101600653002901631653003601660700002001696700002101716773013501737856008501872852000901957655001201966IND60692856220221119121046.0200503e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069285622DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2019.15765012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitomo, Shunsuke10aNew xanthine oxidase inhibitors from the fruiting bodies of Tyromyces fissilis  ap. 813-823.  aExcessive uric acid production, which causes gout and hyperuricemia, can be blocked by inhibiting xanthine oxidase (XO). However, some agents to block on XO often cause side effects, thereby necessitating the identification of new inhibitors. During the screening of XO inhibitors from various mushroom extracts, we found that a methanolic extract of the fruiting bodies of Tyromyces fissilis, an inedible and non-toxic fungus, showed inhibitory activity. Both n-hexane and ethyl acetate layers, obtained by partitioning this extract exhibited XO inhibitory activity. Subsequently, using an activity-guided separation method, eight active compounds (1–8) were isolated. The structures of five of the new compounds, 2–4, 6, and 7, were elucidated by spectral analysis and chemical derivatization. All compounds had a salicylic acid moiety with an aliphatic group at the C-6 position. Notably, 2-hydroxy-6-pentadecylbenzoic acid (1) showed the highest level of XO noncompetitive inhibition (58.9 ± 2.2% at 25 µM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aderivatization 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aethyl acetate 3afruiting bodies 3ahexane 3amoieties 3amushrooms 3asalicylic acid 3ascreening 3aspectral analysis 3auric acid 3axanthine oxidase 0aTyromyces fissilis 0axanthine oxidase inhibitor 0aanacardic acid analogues 0astructure-activity relationship1 aHirota, Mitsuru1 aFujita, Tomoyuki0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2019 May 4, v. 83, no. 5 p.813-823dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2019.15765013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016200163300001400325520161200339592002801951596006301979596004302042650001502085650002002100650001102120650001802131650001102149650001302160650001002173650002302183650001502206650002202221650001802243650003702261650001602298700001802314700001102332700001302343700001202356700001802368773011202386856008202498852000902580655001202589IND60627583220221122220351.0190512e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062758322DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-018-1326-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiangbo10aComparison and Optimization of Models for Determination of Sugar Content in Pear by Portable Vis-NIR Spectroscopy Coupled with Wavelength Selection Algorithm  ap. 12-22.  aThe portable device could help to obtain a complete follow-up of fruit quality in orchards and during post-harvest. Thus, it is an important step to develop portable and non-destructive technology for current and future research in fruit. In this study, the ability of portable visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy to non-invasively determine sugar content in pear was studied. Partial least square regression (PLSR) was applied to establish calibration models based on the spectral signatures of three regions (550–1050, 650–950, 750–1050 nm) and four types of data sets (Set-I, Set-II, Set-III, and Set-IV), respectively, and the performance of models was compared to determine the optimal spectral calibration strategy. The spectral region of 650–950 nm was proved to be much better compared with other two spectral regions. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm was used to reduce redundancy and collinearity of the original spectral data based on the optimal spectral region for selecting the most important wavelengths. The CARS-PLSR was identified as the most effective method to calibrate the prediction models for sugar content determination, resulting in good coefficient of determination for prediction ([Formula: see text]) of 0.85–0.92 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.27–0.20 for four types of data sets, respectively. The overall results show that the portable Vis-NIR spectroscopy is a promising tool for the non-destructive on-site evaluation of sugar content in pear, as well as affording the additional advantage of low cost.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772052cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aZ171100001117035cBeijing Nova Program 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3afruits 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aorchards 3apears 3aportable equipment 3aprediction 3aspectral analysis 3asugar content 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awavelengths1 aWang, Qingyan1 aXu, Lu1 aTian, Xi1 aXia, Yu1 aFan, Shuxiang0 tFood analytical methods.g2019 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.12-22dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-018-1326-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245015500187300001600342520081900358592002801177506003701205650003201242650001801274650003001292650001101322650002801333700002101361700002001382700002001402700001801422773012601440852000901566856008301575655001201658IND2198982020221207133106.0220422e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219898202DNAL7 a260424902pmid7 a10.1177/0261192998026005082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalcone, Emiliana10aComparative Evaluation of In Vitro and In Vivo Assays for the Detection of Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus as a Contaminant of Live Poultry Vaccines  ap. 629-634.  aA reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay specific for identifying avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in poultry vaccines, and the serological response to IBV induced by the inoculation of chicks with a Newcastle disease vaccine spiked with the Massachusetts strain of IBV, were compared for their ability to detect IBV as a contaminant of avian vaccines. The sensitivity of the IBV-RT-PCR assay provided results which were at least equivalent to the biological effect produced by the inoculation of chicks, allowing this assay to be considered a valid alternative to animal testing in the quality control of avian immunologicals. This procedure can easily be adapted to detect a number of contaminants for which the in vivo test still represents the only available method of detection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3alive vaccines 3apolymerase chain reaction 3achicks 3aanimal use alternatives1 aVignolo, Edoardo1 aDi Trani, Livia1 aPuzelli, Simona1 aTollis, Maria0 tATLA.

The objective of the present paper is to give an overview of the literature dedicated to the textile reinforcement forming process. Therefore, experimental tests for the determination of the basic fabric properties, the experimental characterization of the forming and the numerical approaches for the modeling of the textile forming are reviewed. A great part of the literature has been devoted to the characterization of the shear behavior since it is the most important property for textile reinforcement forming processes. The bending behavior was initially neglected in mechanical models but was found to be important for the simulation of wrinkles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3afabrics 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3atesting1 aDöbrich, Oliver1 aHübner, Matthias,1 aCherif, Chokri0 tComposites.g2013 Mar., v. 46 p.1-10dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002100165245018800186300001600374520195400390592002802344506003702372650002302409650001502432650001502447650001302462650001402475650002802489650002002517650002502537650001402562650000802576650002002584650002502604650002702629773012602656852000902782856008302791655001202874IND2198982320221207133103.0220422e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219898232DNAL7 a260424922pmid7 a10.1177/0261192998026005102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Colin H.10aAlternative Approaches and Tests in Ecotoxicology: A Review of the Present Position and the Prospects for Change, Taking into Account ECVAM's Duties, Topic Selection and Test Criteria  ap. 649-677.  aThe objectives of this review are to summarise the present position concerning the use of vertebrates in ecotoxicity testing, giving particular attention to tests that cause suffering, and to discuss in some detail, alternatives to them, and the prospects for change. The report has been written with the objectives of the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) in mind, and some recommendations for action have been made at the end of the discussion section. The first section of the review describes the present requirements within the European Union for the ecotoxicity testing of industrial chemicals in general, and for pesticides in particular, and the very limited documentation of the tests that are actually carried out. The next four sections describe the many different assays and systems used to evaluate the harmful effects of chemicals on free-living organisms and natural populations, and the extent to which they might be suitable alternatives to vertebrate toxicity tests that cause suffering. Attention is drawn to certain assays and strategies that can already be used as satisfactory alternatives, and thus provide the basis for short-term change. Included here are nondestructive assays on vertebrates which are available for certain types of chemicals, and which provide a direct and relatively uncomplicated approach to the problem. Other approaches are described which still require development, but hold considerable promise in the longer term. The growth of knowledge in the broad field of biochemical toxicology and the development of related technologies should lead to the development of better and more-sophisticated alternatives in the future. In vitro assays employing vertebrate cell systems are of particular interest here. The last section of the review deals with conclusions and recommendations. The recommendations are made with a view to the activities and responsibilities of ECVAM.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alaboratory animals 3apesticides 3atoxicology 3atoxicity 3ascreening 3aanimal use alternatives 3aenzyme activity 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abioassays 3aova 3arisk assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3anondestructive methods0 tATLA.

This investigation aimed to incorporate bioactive compounds from pomegranate cryoconcentrated juice into apple slices using osmodehydration (OD) assisted by pulse vacuum (PV) and ohmic heating (OH). The apple slices (3 × 4 × 0.5 cm) were osmodehydrated using a 47 °Brix pomegranate cryoconcentrated juice at 30, 40, or 50°C for 180 min with an electric field of 6.66 V/cm (50 V) and a 5 min pulsed vacuum. Over the time, all of the treatments applied to the apple slices increased the soluble solids and bioactive compounds compared with the fresh sample. PVOD/OH at 50°C had the highest content of total anthocyanin during processing, and the best results for the total flavonoids were obtained with OD/OH at 50°C and 40°C. The osmodehydration assisted by pulse vacuum and ohmic heating using a cryoconcentrated juice is a useful combined technique to acquire enriched vegetal samples with bioactive compounds.  aPublisher supplied data  cComisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  a1160761cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico 3aanthocyanins 3aapples 3abioactive compounds 3abrix 3aelectric field 3aohmic heating 3apomegranate juice 3apomegranates 3atotal soluble solids1 aMoreno, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2994-09201 aLillo-Pérez, S.1 aPetzold, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6924-78161 aSimpson, R.1 aNuñez, H.0 tJournal of food quality.g2018 Oct. 21, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/72419813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245007300182300001600255520152600271592002801797650001101825650000901836650001001845650001201855650001101867650002201878650001301900650001501913650002101928650000901949651002201958651001301980653001301993653001802006653002602024653003702050653001202087700001502099700001702114700001602131700006102147773011202208856008102320852000902401655001202410IND60652484220221122075027.0190713e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065248422DNAL7 a299831312pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311180016472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlowman, J.10aCharacterisation of white and black merino wools: a proteomics study  ap. 659-665.  aWool is an important agricultural commodity with merino wool being rated alongside the finest quality fibres, which include the goat fibres Mohair and Cashmere. Although pigmented wool merinos have become extremely rare, the market for this wool is increasing. In Portugal, there are two merino breeds: white and black, descendants of animals originally bred on the Iberian Peninsula. These breeds have the potential to assist in our understanding of how protein expression relates to wool traits of importance to the textile industry. Herein, we study the characteristics and protein expression profiles of wool from ewes of the Portuguese black and white merino (n=15). Both breeds had very similar results for fibre diameter (25 µm) and curvature (105 to 111°/mm). Significant between-breed differences were found in the two types of keratin-associated proteins (KAPs): high-sulphur proteins (HSPs) and high-glycine–tyrosine proteins (HGTPs). The expression of HSPs, KAP2-3 and KAP2-4, decreased expression in the pigmented animals, whereas KAP13-1 was found in higher amounts. Likewise, the expression of the ultra-high-sulphur proteins, KAP4-3 and KAP4-7-like, was reduced in black sheep to half the levels of the white wools, whereas the HGTPs, KAP6, KAP6-1, KAP6-2 and KAP16-2, were more abundant in black sheep. These results suggest structural differences between the black and white merino wool, because of differences among some KAPs. These differences have important implications for the textile industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aewes 3agoats 3amarkets 3amohair 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3atextile industry 3awool 3aIberian Peninsula 3aPortugal 0aproteome 0afibre quality 0ahigh-sulphur proteins 0ahigh-glycine–tyrosine proteins 0akeratin1 aThomas, A.1 aPerloiro, T.1 aClerens, S.1 ade Almeida, A.

It has been argued that the disconnect between the formal statutory reality at national level and what is happening on the ground may have widened rather than shrunk. There is, therefore, a renewed interest in local water allocation arrangements and how they function. This study looks at water sharing practices and agreements among smallholder farmers in Makanya catchment (300kmÂ²), which is part of Pangani river basin (42,200kmÂ²) in northern Tanzania. Existing water sharing agreements have been studied in the Vudee sub-catchment (25kmÂ²), which has about 38 irrigation furrows of which 20 have micro-dams. Five micro-dams are located at the downstream side of the sub-catchment. At the outlet of the Makanya catchment, farmers practice spate irrigation, using the residual flows from the highlands to irrigate. Based on interviews with smallholder farmers and supported by hydrological data water sharing agreements were found to exist among irrigators using the same furrow, among furrows using the same river and at sub-catchment scale. Some agreements date back to the 1940s. They mostly specify water sharing on a rotational basis at all three scales. No water sharing agreements were found at catchment scale, such as between the water users in Vudee sub-catchment and Makanya village. The study concludes that, as a result of the increase in demand for a diminishing resource, tradeoffs between upstream and downstream water uses have emerged at an increasingly larger spatial scale. At the catchment scale, downstream water users have changed their practices to accommodate the changes in the flow. Currently these claims for water do not clash as upstream water users use the base flow (which does not reach downstream anymore) and downstream water users utilise the flood flows. The water sharing arrangements at sub-catchment scale are negotiated through the social networks of the smallholder farmers and are therefore build on the social ties between the communities. However, at catchment scale, the social ties appear relatively weak in addition to the hydrological disconnect; these links are possibly too weak to build new water sharing arrangements on. It may therefore be necessary to involve more formal levels of government, such as Pangani Basin Water Office, to facilitate the negotiation process and create awareness on the inter-linkages of various water uses at catchment scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase flow 3afarmers 3afurrows 3ahighlands 3ahydrologic data 3ainterviews 3airrigation 3amountains 3arivers 3asocial networks 3asubwatersheds 3awater allocation 3aTanzania1 aKemerink, J.S.1 aVyagusa, N.F.1 aMshana, M.G.1 avan der Zaag, P.1 aMakurira, H.0 tAgricultural water management.g2011 Sept., v. 98, no. 11 p.1752-1760dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2010.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05153naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245017500183300001600358520315800374592002803532650001603560650001203576650002203588650001803610650001903628650001903647650002203666650000903688650002003697650001503717650001303732650002203745650001803767650001603785650001403801650001303815650001103828650001303839650003303852650001303885650001303898650001003911650001603921650001803937650001903955650001203974650004703986650004304033650001404076650002004090650001304110650005104123650001204174650001604186700001804202700001504220700001804235700001704253700002104270773010704291856004804398852000904446655001204455IND4467392020221120104746.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446739202DNAL7 a220379262pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-011-9566-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristensen, T.10aEffects of production intensity and production strategies in commercial Atlantic salmon smolt (Salmo salar L.) production on subsequent performance in the early sea stage  ap. 273-282.  aA data set from commercial Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) producers on production intensity and production strategies in smolt tanks (N = 63–94) was obtained during 1999–2006. The effects of production intensity on subsequent fish mortality and growth during the early sea phase (90 days) were examined by principal component analysis and subsequent generalized linear model analysis. Levels of accumulated metabolites (CO2, total ammonia nitrogen and NH3), and information provided by producers (production density (kg fish m3−1), specific water use (l kg fish−1 min−1) and oxygen drop (mg l−1) from tank inlet to tank outlet), were used as predictor variables. In addition, several other welfare relevant variables such as disease history, temperature during freshwater and sea stage; season (S1) or off-season (S0) smolt production; and the use of seawater addition during the freshwater stage were analyzed. No strong intensity effects on mortality or growth were found. CO2 levels alone (P < 0.001, R 2 = 0.16), and in combination with specific water use (R 2 = 0.20), had the strongest effect on mortality. In both cases, mortality decreased with increasing density. For growth, the intensity model with the most support (R 2 = 0.17) was O2 drop, density and their interaction effects, resulting in the best growth at low and high intensity, and poorer growth at intermediate levels. Documented viral disease outbreaks (infectious pancreatic necrosis and two cases of pancreas disease) in the sea phase resulted in significantly higher mortalities at 90 days compared with undiagnosed smolt groups, although mortalities were highly variable in both categories. The temperature difference between the freshwater stage and seawater had a small, but significant, effect on growth with the best growth in groups stocked to warmer seawater (P = 0.04, R 2 = 0.06). S0 and S1 smolt groups did not differ significantly in growth, but the mortality was significantly (P = 0.02) higher in S1 groups. Seawater addition as a categorical variable had no significant effects, but when analyzed within the seawater addition group, intermediate salinities (15–25 ppt) gave the best results on growth (p = 0.04, R 2 = 0.15). Production intensity had small explanatory power on subsequent seawater performance in the analyzed smolt groups. If anything, the analysis shows a beneficial effect of intensive production strategies on subsequent performance. Analysis of the various production strategies indicates better survival of S0 compared with S1 smolt groups, improved growth when stocked in seawater warmer than freshwater, and a negative effect of viral disease outbreaks on survival. The results clearly demonstrate the difficulty of extrapolating results from experimental work on fish welfare and production intensity variables to commercial production. On the other hand, the presented results may simply demonstrate that the traditional fish welfare criteria growth and mortality may not suffice to evaluate welfare consequences of suboptimal water quality or production strategies in the aquaculture industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanimal growth 3aanimal welfare 3acarbon dioxide 3adisease outbreaks 3afish 3afish production 3afreshwater 3aindustry 3aintensive farming 3alinear models 3ametabolites 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aoxygen 3apancreas 3aprincipal component analysis 3asalinity 3aseawater 3atanks 3atemperature 3awater quality 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aFish Diseasesxmortalityxphysiopathology. 2aFisheriesxstatistics & numerical data 2aMortality 2aOceans and Seas 2aSalinity 2aSalmo salarxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSeasons 2aTemperature1 aHaugen, T.

It is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of proteins consisting of eight Ig- and three fibronectin (FNIII)-like domains, along with a unique regulatory sequence referred to as the M-domain, whose structure is unknown. Domains near the C-terminus of cMyBP-C bind tightly to myosin and mediate the association of cMyBP-C with thick (myosin-containing) filaments, whereas N-terminal domains, including the regulatory M-domain, bind reversibly to myosin S2 and/or actin. The ability of MyBP-C to bind to both myosin and actin raises the possibility that cMyBP-C cross-links myosin molecules within the thick filament and/or cross-links myosin and thin (actin-containing) filaments together. In either scenario, cMyBP-C could be under mechanical strain. However, the physical properties of cMyBP-C and its behavior under load are completely unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanical properties of recombinant baculovirus-expressed cMyBP-C using atomic force microscopy to assess the stability of individual cMyBP-C molecules in response to stretch. Force-extension curves showed the presence of long extensible segment(s) that became stretched before the unfolding of individual Ig and FNIII domains, which were evident as sawtooth peaks in force spectra. The forces required to unfold the Ig/FNIII domains at a stretch rate of 500 nm/s increased monotonically from ∼30 to ∼150 pN, suggesting a mechanical hierarchy among the different Ig/FNIII domains. Additional experiments using smaller recombinant proteins showed that the regulatory M-domain lacks significant secondary or tertiary structure and is likely an intrinsically disordered region of cMyBP-C. Together, these data indicate that cMyBP-C exhibits complex mechanical behavior under load and contains multiple domains with distinct mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aatomic force microscopy 3acrosslinking 3aextensibility 3afibronectins 3aimmunoglobulins 3amechanical properties 3amechanical stress 3amyosin 3arecombinant proteins 3asarcomeres1 aKellermayer, Miklós S.Z.1 aHarris, Samantha P.0 tBiophysical journal.g2011 Oct. 19, v. 101, no. 8 p.1968-1977dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2011.08.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010800177500002200285520161200307592002801919650002301947650001701970650001601987650001302003650001802016650001202034650001302046653000802059653000802067653002702075653003702102653003802139653001002177700002202187773009202209856008602301852000902387655001202396IND60770092220221123034029.0220404e20220203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077009222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2022.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan de Sijpe, Nicolas10aOn the power of the conditional likelihood ratio and related tests for weak-instrument robust inference  aPre-press version  aPower curves of the Conditional Likelihood Ratio (CLR) and related tests for testing H0:β=β0 in linear models with a single endogenous variable, y=xβ+u, estimated using potentially weak instrumental variables have been presented for two different designs. One design keeps the variance matrix of the structural and first-stage errors, Σ, constant, the other instead keeps the variance matrix of the reduced-form and first-stage errors, Ω, constant. The values of Σ govern the endogeneity features of the model. The fixed-Ω design changes these endogeneity features with changing values of β in a way that makes it less suitable for an analysis of the behaviour of the tests in low to moderate endogeneity settings, or when β and the correlation of the structural and first-stage errors, ρuv, have the same sign. At larger values of |β|, the fixed-Ω design implicitly selects values for Σ where the power of the CLR test is high. We further show that the Likelihood Ratio statistic is identical to the t0(βˆL)2 statistic as proposed by Mills et al. (2014), where βˆL is the Liml estimator. In fixed-Σ design Monte Carlo simulations, we find that Liml- and Fuller-based conditional Wald tests and the Fuller-based conditional t02 test are more powerful than the CLR test when the degree of endogeneity is low to moderate. The conditional Wald tests are further the most powerful of these tests when β and ρuv have the same sign. We show that in the fixed-Ω design, setting β0=0 and the diagonal elements of Ω equal to 1 is not without loss of generality, unlike in the fixed-Σ design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aeconometrics 3aexhibitions 3ajournals 3alinear models 3atesting 3avariance 0aC12 0aC26 0aInstrumental variables 0aWeak-instrument robust inference 0aConditional likelihood ratio test 0aPower1 aWindmeijer, Frank0 tJournal of econometrics.g2022 Feb. 03, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2022.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008900170500002200259520095300281592002801234650001701262650001301279650001101292650001601303650003101319653000801350653000801358653000801366653002801374653001601402653003501418653003801453700001601491700001201507773009201519856008601611852000901697655001201706IND60770092320221117161644.0220328e20211228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077009232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Jiangtao10aQuasi-maximum likelihood estimation of break point in high-dimensional factor models  aPre-press version  aThis paper proposes a quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimator of the break point for large-dimensional factor models with a single structural break in the factor loading matrix. We show that the QML estimator is consistent for the true break point when the covariance matrix of the pre- or post-break factor loading (or both) is singular. Consistency here means that the deviation of the estimated break date from the true break date k0 converges to zero as the sample size grows. This is a much stronger result than the break fraction kˆ/T being T-consistent (super-consistent) for k0/T. Also, singularity occurs for most types of structural changes, except for a rotational change. Even for a rotational change, the QML estimator is still T-consistent in terms of the break fraction. Simulation results confirm the theoretical properties of our estimator, and it significantly outperforms existing estimators for change points in factor models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometrics 3ajournals 3amodels 3asample size 3avariance covariance matrix 0aC13 0aC38 0aC65 0aChange point estimation 0aConsistency 0aHigh-dimensional factor models 0aNearly singular covariance matrix1 aBai, Jushan1 aHan, Xu0 tJournal of econometrics.g2021 Dec. 28, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013100164300001600295520153800311592002801849650002001877650002101897650002101918650001301939650001601952650001201968650002101980650002302001650001502024650001602039650001002055650000902065650001302074650001502087700002302102700001702125700001802142700002002160700002102180773011002201856008102311852000902392655001202401IND60440367520221116204454.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044036752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1773-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Varun10aProbing Phosphorus Efficient Low Phytic Acid Content Soybean Genotypes with Phosphorus Starvation in Hydroponics Growth System  ap. 689-699.  aPhosphorus is an essential nutrient required for soybean growth but is bound in phytic acid which causes negative effects on both the environment as well as the animal nutrition. Lowering of phytic acid levels is associated with reduced agronomic characteristics, and relatively little information is available on the response of soybean plants to phosphorus (P) starvation. In this study, we evaluated the effects of different P starvation concentrations on the phytic acid content, growth, and yield of seven mutant genotypes along with the unirradiated control, JS-335, in a hydroponics growth system. The low phytic acid containing mutant genotypes, IR-JS-101, IR-DS-118, and IR-V-101, showed a relatively high growth rate in low P concentration containing nutrient solution (2 μM), whereas the high P concentration (50 μM) favored the growth of IR-DS-111 and IR-DS-115 mutant genotypes containing moderate phytate levels. The mutant genotypes with high phytic acid content, IR-DS-122, IR-DS-114, and JS-335, responded well under P starvation and did not have any significant effect on the growth and yield of plants. Moreover, the reduction of P concentration in nutrient solution from 50 to 2 μM also reduced the phytic acid content in the seeds of all the soybean genotypes under study. The desirable agronomic performance of low phytic acid containing mutant genotype IR-DS-118 reported in this study suggested it to be a P-efficient genotype which could be considered for agricultural practices under P limiting soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aagronomic traits 3aanimal nutrition 3agenotype 3ahydroponics 3amutants 3anutrient content 3anutrient solutions 3aphosphorus 3aphytic acid 3aseeds 3asoil 3asoybeans 3astarvation1 aSingh, Tiratha Raj1 aHada, Alkesh1 aJolly, Monica1 aGanapathi, Andy1 aSachdev, Archana0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 177, no. 3 p.689-699dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1773-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009900166300001300265520114300278592002801421650003501449650001201484650001101496650001101507650001101518650001101529650001701540650000901557650001101566650001401577650000901591651001101600651001201611700001801623700002201641773011701663856008101780852000901861655001201870IND60120416820221122025949.0150216e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012041682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4275-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarakat, S.

Several living coral samples of different species (e.g., Porites) were collected from shallow depths (of about 5 m) at a number of sites along the Jordanian Gulf of Aqaba coast. The coral samples were collected using either a pneumatic diamond drill corer (for Porites) or a hammer and chisel (for other branched species). Some of the corals that had been collected were analyzed for heavy metals using atomic absorption spectrometry, and other samples were used in incubation experiments. The heavy metal concentrations were determined separately in the coral skeleton and the tissue layer. Heavy metal concentrations have not previously been determined in corals from the Gulf of Aqaba. We conclude that corals are suitable for use as proxy tools for assessing environmental pollution (i.e., they are bioindicators) in the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea. Therefore, this study provides useful information on the degree of heavy metal contamination in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acoasts 3acobalt 3acopper 3acorals 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anickel 3apollution 3azinc 3aJordan 3aRed Sea1 aAl-Rousan, S.1 aAl-Trabeen, M.

If particular functional traits characterize the favored plant species, then defaunation may alter community‐wide patterns of functional trait composition. Changes in plant functional traits occurring with defaunation may help identify the species interactions affected by defaunation and the potential for other cascading effects of defaunation. We tested the hypotheses that defaunation would (1) disrupt seed dispersal, thereby favoring species whose dispersal agents are not affected (e.g., small birds, bats, and abiotic agents), (2) reduce seed predation, thereby favoring larger‐seeded species, and (3) reduce herbivory, thereby favoring species with lower leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf toughness, and wood density. We examined how these six traits responded to vertebrate defaunation caused by hunters or by experimental exclosures among more than 30 000 woody seedlings in a lowland tropical moist forest. Exclosures reduced terrestrial frugivores, granivores, and herbivores, while hunters also reduced volant and arboreal frugivores and granivores. The comparison of exclosures and hunting allowed us to parse the impacts of arboreal and volant species (reduced by hunters only) and terrestrial species (reduced by both hunters and exclosures). The loss of terrestrial vertebrates alone had limited effects on plant trait composition. The additional loss of volant and arboreal vertebrates caused significant shifts in plant species composition towards communities with more species dispersed abiotically, including lianas and low wood‐density tree species, and fewer species dispersed by large vertebrates. In contrast to previous studies, community seed mass did not decline significantly in hunted sites. Our exclosure results suggest this is because reducing seed predators disproportionately benefits large‐seeded species, partially compensating for the reduction of seed dispersers at hunted sites. Our results demonstrate that decreased seed dispersal and seed predation are important determinants of seedling community compositional change as a consequence of defaunation. Defaunation may also negatively impact carbon storage in tropical forests, by favoring lianas and low wood density tree species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3abirds 3acarbon sequestration 3afrugivores 3agranivores 3ahunters 3aleaves 3alianas 3aseed dispersal 3aseed predation 3aseedlings 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3atropical forests 3awood density1 aWright, S.

Louisiana sugarcane mills use a portion of the sugarcane bagasse for fuel producing over 20,411 mt of sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA) as a by-product. The purpose of this research was to investigate the use of SBA as an amendment to soilless planting media for the production of vegetable seedlings. The SBA was combined by volume with a commercial soilless growing media into 5 combinations (0%:100%, 25%:75%, 50%:50%, 75%:25%, and 100%:0%, SBA and growing media, respectively). Squash var. ‘Straightneck’ and cantaloupe var. ‘Magnum Hybrid Melon’ were planted in each of the 5 different planting mixtures. The research indicates that the addition of SBA can enhance squash and cantaloupe seedling growth depending on the percentage of the ash added to the growth media. Squash plant stalk lengths and total plant fresh weights (stalk, leaves, tops, roots, and total plant) overall responded best at the 75% SBA. Squash dry weights were consistently greater when SBA was added to the soilless media compared to no SBA. The 25% and 50% SBA media produced the greatest cantaloupe leaf fresh weights. Cantaloupe leaf dry weights followed a similar trend, where the 25% and 50% SBA media produced greater plant weights with lesser yields observed at the 75% and 100% SBA levels. This data suggests that the 75% SBA and 25% SBA were certainly suitable potting media combinations for squash and cantaloupe seedling production, respectively. 3aCucumis melo subsp. melo var. cantalupo 3aCucurbita 3aash (inorganic matter) 3acantaloupes 3aculture media 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3aplanting 3aroots 3aseedling growth 3aseedling production 3aseedlings 3asoilless media 3asquashes 3asucrose 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3avegetable growing 3aLouisiana1 aWhite, Paul M.1 aPetrie, Eric C.1 aShrefler, James W.1 aTaylor, Merritt J.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.1-7wJournal:2242x1916-97607nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/619863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5539/jas.v8n1p13Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Webber%20322533.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006500142245015500207520122300362592002801585650001201613650002501625650001201650650002501662650002901687650001301716650000901729650001401738650001501752650002801767650001201795650001301807650001501820650001701835650001701852650001801869650001901887650001201906650002901918650001701947650001201964650002501976651001002001700002602011773010702037856007602144852000902220655001202229IND60624336420221123003014.0181203e20180603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062433642DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/68374042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMensah, Albert Kobina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5966-728910aBiochar and/or Compost Applications Improve Soil Properties, Growth, and Yield of Maize Grown in Acidic Rainforest and Coastal Savannah Soils in Ghana  aUse of biochar for soil fertility improvement is gaining popularity due to its potential to improve soil quality, increase crop yield, and sequester carbon from the atmosphere-biosphere pool into the soil. A 40-day pot experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of corncob biochar and compost applied alone (at a rate of 2%, w/w) or in combination (1% of each, thus 1% compost + 1% biochar) on soil physicochemical properties, growth, and yield of maize on two soils of contrasting pH and texture collected from the Rainforest and Coastal Savannah agroecological zones of Ghana. Biochar and compost applied alone or in combination significantly increased soil pH, total organic carbon, available phosphorus, mineral nitrogen, reduced exchangeable acidity, and increased effective cation exchange capacity in both soils. Additionally, combined application and single application biochar or compost additions increased the plant height, stem girth, and dry matter yields of two maize (local (“ewifompe”) and hybrid (Obaatanpa)) varieties used in the study. The study showed that biochar applied alone or in combination with compost offers the potential to enhance soil quality and improve maize yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aagroecological zones 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3acation exchange capacity 3acomposts 3acorn 3acorn cobs 3acrop yield 3adry matter accumulation 3ahybrids 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant height 3arain forests 3asavanna soils 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asoil physical properties 3asoil quality 3atexture 3atotal organic carbon 3aGhana1 aFrimpong, Kwame Agyei0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2018 June 3, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/68374043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011900159300001800278500002000296520139200316592002801708650001701736650002601753650002401779650002001803650003201823650001501855650002001870650002501890650001301915650002601928650001101954650001301965650001501978650002601993650001202019700001802031700001702049773009802066856007302164852000902237655001202246IND60523704120221118031534.0160623e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052370412DNAL7 a10.1890/14-1127.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowell, Jeff R.10aMicrobial functional diversity enhances predictive models linking environmental parameters to ecosystem properties  ap. 1985-1993.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicroorganisms drive biogeochemical processes, but linking these processes to real changes in microbial communities under field conditions is not trivial. Here, we present a model‐based approach to estimate independent contributions of microbial community shifts to ecosystem properties. The approach was tested empirically, using denitrification potential as our model process, in a spatial survey of arable land encompassing a range of edaphic conditions and two agricultural production systems. Soil nitrate was the most important single predictor of denitrification potential (the change in Akaike's information criterion, corrected for sample size, ΔAICc = 20.29); however, the inclusion of biotic variables (particularly the evenness and size of denitrifier communities [ΔAICc = 12.02], and the abundance of one denitrifier genotype [ΔAICc = 18.04]) had a substantial effect on model precision, comparable to the inclusion of abiotic variables (biotic R² = 0.28, abiotic R² = 0.50, biotic + abiotic R² = 0.76). This approach provides a valuable tool for explicitly linking microbial communities to ecosystem functioning. By making this link, we have demonstrated that including aspects of microbial community structure and diversity in biogeochemical models can improve predictions of nutrient cycling in ecosystems and enhance our understanding of ecosystem functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3afunctional diversity 3agenotype 3amicrobial communities 3amodels 3anitrates 3aprediction 3aproduction technology 3asurveys1 aWelsh, Allana1 aHallin, Sara0 tEcology.g2015 July, v. 96, no. 7 p.1985-1993dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/14-1127.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014400171300001600315520146500331592002801796650002401824650001601848650001801864650001201882650002601894650001301920650001701933650001001950650001201960650001201972650001601984650001302000650001502013650002502028650002902053700002602082700002002108700002002128700002502148700003102173700002102204700002802225700002202253773011002275856008102385852000902466655001202475IND60440368120221116204358.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044036812DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1763-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSongserm, Pajareeya10aRegulating Pyruvate Carboxylase in the Living Culture of Aspergillus Terreus Nrrl 1960 by L-Aspartate for Enhanced Itaconic Acid Production  ap. 595-609.  aAspergillus terreus was reported as the promising fungal strain for itaconic acid; however, the commercial production suffers from the low yield. Low production yield was claimed as the result of completing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle towards biomass synthesis while under limiting phosphate and nitrogen; TCA cycle was somewhat shunted and consequently, the metabolite fluxes move towards itaconic acid production route. By regulating enzymes in TCA cycle, it is believed that itaconic acid production can be improved. One of the key responsible enzymes involved in itaconic acid production was triggered in this study. Pyruvate carboxylase was allosterically inhibited by L-aspartate. The presence of 10 mM L-aspartate in the production medium directly repressed PC expression in the living A. terreus while the limited malate flux regulated the malate/citrate antiporters resulting in the increasing cis-aconitate decarboxylase activity to simultaneously convert cis-aconitate, citrate isomer, into itaconic acid. The transport of cis-aconitate via the antiporters induced citrate synthase and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase activities in response to balance the fluxes of TCA intermediates. Successively, itaconic acid production yield and final concentration could be improved by 8.33 and 60.32 %, respectively, compared to those obtained from the control fermentation with the shortened lag time to produce itaconic acid during the production phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus terreus 3aantiporters 3aaspartic acid 3abiomass 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3acitrates 3afermentation 3afungi 3aisomers 3amalates 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3apyruvate carboxylase 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aThitiprasert, Sitanan1 aTolieng, Vasana1 aPiluk, Jiraporn1 aTanasupawat, Somboon1 aAssabumrungrat, Sutthichai1 aYang, Shang-Tian1 aKarnchanatat, Aphichart1 aThongchul, Nuttha0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 177, no. 3 p.595-609dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1763-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245005700202520129000259592002801549596001101577596003701588596001201625596001201637596001001649596004001659596003901699596008001738650001501818650001601833650002301849650002401872650001901896650002201915650001901937650001701956650003101973650002402004650002702028650001602055650002002071650003002091651001002121651001002131651000902141651001302150700005802163700005802221700002202279700005902301773009602360856007602456852000902532655001202541IND60624336720221122051949.0181203e20181025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062433672DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/69061052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampolo, Orlando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1243-843510aEssential Oils in Stored Product Insect Pest Control  aAmong botanical extracts used as insecticides, essential oils (EOs) are promising alternatives to chemical insecticides. EOs are synthesized by plants, and they play a key role in plant signaling processes including also attractiveness toward pollinators and beneficial insects. Plant species producing essential oils (over 17,000 species) are called aromatic plants and are distributed worldwide. Our review aims to evaluate research studies published in the last 15 years concerning the use of EOs in stored product protection. More than 50% of the retrieved manuscripts have been published by authors from Eastern countries (Iran, China, India, and Pakistan), investigating different aspects related to insect pest management (exposure route, effect on the target pest, and mode of action). Coleoptera was the most studied insect order (85.41%) followed by Lepidoptera (11.49%), whereas few studies targeted new emerging pests (e.g., Psocoptera). Almost all the trials were carried out under laboratory conditions, while no experiments were conducted under real operating conditions. Future research studies concerning the use of EOs as insecticides should focus on the development of insecticide formulations which could be successfully applied to different production realities.  aPublisher supplied data  cMIPAAF  cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  cDEMETER  cMESRSFC  cMHERS  a618127cSeventh Framework Programme  a5A722192113cUniversity of Catania  a2015BABFCFcMinistero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca 3aColeoptera 3aLepidoptera 3abeneficial insects 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3aexposure pathways 3ainsect control 3ainsecticides 3alaboratory experimentation 3amechanism of action 3apesticide formulations 3apollinators 3astorage insects 3astored product protection 3aChina 3aIndia 3aIran 3aPakistan1 aGiunti, Giulia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0258-61831 aRusso, Agatino1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6949-397X1 aPalmeri, Vincenzo1 aZappalà, Lucia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2804-39800 tJournal of food quality.g2018 Oct. 25, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/69061053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04410naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002700176245009600203300001600299500024500315500002400560500001500584520202100599650001602620650001602636650002202652650002302674650001602697650001802713650002102731650003102752650002202783650001302805650003502818650001002853650001202863650003402875650003402909650004702943650004002990650003203030650003203062650001003094650005203104650005003156651001403206653002003220653001603240653002103256653002703277653002103304653002603325653002203351700002503373700002503398700002603423773009703449852000903546856008803555930003303643945002503676946001103701655001203712IND4425237820140725000000.0090828e20090223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442523782DNAL7 a190546172pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.10.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8221 aVenturiello, Stella M.10aEvaluation of three immunoserological techniques in the detection of porcine trichinellosis  ap. 364-367.  aIn the special issue: Selected papers presented at the 12th International Conference on Trichinellosis - Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia / edited by Alvin A.

Three groups of animals were analyzed: Group 1, animals naturally infected with parasite burdens (PB) of <1 muscle larvae (ML)/g (n =18); Group 2, animals naturally infected with PB of >=2ML/g (n =23); Group 3, animals raised and home-slaughtered on farms in Argentina (n =59). Animals from Groups 1 and 2 were identified in outbreaks and were analyzed by individual artificial digestion (AD) of >=30g of muscle. Animals in Group 3 were subjected to AD of 5g of muscle. The detection percentages in sera of swine with the lower PB were 100% for IF, 72% for EIA, and 50% for WB. Eighty-three percent of the animals were serologically positive by two or three techniques. In pigs with the higher PB, the detection percentage was similar for IF and EIA (100% vs. 91%, respectively), and was lower for the WB (61%). Ninety-six percent of the animals were serologically positive by two or three techniques. Group 3 animals had similar detection percentages for the three techniques (IF, 30%; EIA, 29%; WB, 42%). Twenty-five percent of the animals were serologically positive by two or three techniques. Two animals were positive by AD with PB of 0.33 and 2.4ML/g, and were positive for IF and WB, or IF, EIA, and WB. Results indicate that the sensitivity of each technique depends on the PB, and always ranked in sensitivity as IF>EIA>WB. For the lower PB, the decrease in the sensitivity is more pronounced for the EIA. Although the WB has a low sensitivity, the detection of the specific bands for Trichinella spiralis makes it a useful confirmatory tool. Considering that more than 83% of the parasitologically positive animals had 2 or 3 positive serological results using the techniques tested here, for the diagnosis of porcine trichinellosis, pigs positive by two of these serological techniques must be regarded as truly infected pigs. 3atrichinosis 3aTrichinella 3adisease detection 3ain vitro digestion 3ablood serum 3aserodiagnosis 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3adisease outbreaks 3aaccuracy 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Westernxveterinary 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aFluorescent Antibody Techniquexveterinary 2aImmunoenzyme Techniquesxveterinary 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSerologic Testsxveterinary 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxbloodxdiagnosisxparasitology. 2aTrichinellosisxbloodxdiagnosisxveterinary. 0aArgentina 0aparasite burden 0amethodology 0atest specificity 0aimmunologic techniques 0atest sensitivity 0aenzyme-immunoanalysis 0adisease diagnosis1 aNuñez, Guillermo G.1 aCalcagno, Marcela A.1 aCostantino, Susana N.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2009 Feb. 23, v. 159, no. 3-4 p.364-367dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.10.0543Available from publisher's Web site  a20091106b20091204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02601naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001400185245007900199300001600278500002400294500001500318520073100333650001601064650002101080650002701101650001701128650000901145650001001154650002101164650001001185650001901195650002701214650001701241650001201258650001201270650005701282650004601339650000901385650002401394650000901418650001301427651001301440651002801453653001001481653002801491653002801519653001001547653001401557700001901571700001901590700001701609700002501626700001601651773009401667852000901761856008801770930003301858945002501891946001101916655001201927IND4425238820221117011025.0090828e20090205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442523882DNAL7 a190365202pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL8101 aBasso, W.10aFirst isolation of Neospora caninum from the faeces of a dog from Portugal  ap. 162-166.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe report the in vitro isolation of Neospora caninum from the faeces of a naturally infected 8-year-old male stray boxer from Portugal.

In total, 3.6% of Danish and German dogs shed lungworm larvae. In Denmark, patent infections of dogs with Angiostrongylus vasorum were more prevalent (2.2%) than those with Crenosoma vulpis (1.4%). In Denmark, the majority of A. vasorum- (98%) and C. vulpis-infected (80%) dogs originated from Northern Zealand. The frequency of A. vasorum and C. vulpis infections in Danish dogs obviously decreased from 2003 to 2006. In Germany, canine faecal samples were found more frequently positive for C. vulpis than for A. vasorum larvae (2.4% and 1.2%, respectively). Lungworm-infected dogs originated mainly from southern and western Germany. Larvae of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus were detected in 5.6% of cats from Germany. Overall, a distinct seasonal pattern in the detection of infected dogs was apparent for A. vasorum in Denmark and C. vulpis in Germany. The relatively high number of lungworm-infected dogs and cats indicate that these parasitic diseases should be considered in differential diagnosis of cases of treatment-resistant respiratory/cardiopulmonary distress. 3adogs 3adog diseases 3acats 3acat diseases 3aAngiostrongylus vasorum 3anematode larvae 3afecal egg count 3alungworms 3anematode infections 3aCrenosoma 3aAelurostrongylus 3aseasonal variation 3adisease diagnosis 3arespiratory tract diseases 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aCats 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aDogs 2aFecesxparasitology 2aLung Diseases, Parasiticxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aSeasons 2aStrongylidaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aStrongylida Infectionsxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aTime Factors 3aGermany 3aDenmark 0aDenmarkxepidemiology. 0aGermanyxepidemiology. 0aCrenosoma vulpis 0aAelurostrongylus abstrusus 0adifferential diagnosis 0acardiopulmonary distress1 aPantchev, Nikola1 aVrhovec, Majda Globokar1 aBauer, Christian1 aHermosilla, Carlos0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2009 Feb. 5, v. 159, no. 2 p.175-180dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2008.10.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20091105b20091204c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/10/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03964naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245016800199300001800367500002400385506007600409520215900485506003702644650001602681650001202697650001202709650003902721650001902760650002002779650002202799650002002821650001102841650001802852650003002870650003002900650003702930650001302967650001402980650001402994650001403008700002703022700003003049700002003079700002203099700002103121700002003142700002303162773013603185852000903321856008003330655001203410IND4450528920221207075729.0110311e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445052892DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02089-102doi7 aPMC30673162pmcid7 a212395432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadic, Jordan10aDetection of Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli Serotypes O26:H11, O103:H2, O111:H8, O145:H28, and O157:H7 in Raw-Milk Cheeses by Using Multiplex Real-Time PCR  ap. 2035-2041.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aShiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains are a diverse group of food-borne pathogens with various levels of virulence for humans. In this study, we describe the use of a combination of multiple real-time PCR assays for the screening of 400 raw-milk cheeses for the five main pathogenic STEC serotypes (O26:H11, O103:H2, O111:H8, O145:H28, and O157:H7). The prevalences of samples positive for stx, intimin-encoding gene (eae), and at least one of the five O group genetic markers were 29.8%, 37.3%, and 55.3%, respectively. The H2, H7, H8, H11, and H28 fliC alleles were highly prevalent and could not be used as reliable targets for screening. Combinations of stx, eae variants, and O genetic markers, which are typical of the five targeted STEC serotypes, were detected by real-time PCR in 6.5% of the cheeses (26 samples) and included stx-wzxO₂₆-eae-β1 (4.8%; 19 samples), stx-wzxO₁₀₃-eae-ε (1.3%; five samples), stx-ihp1O₁₄₅-eae-γ1 (0.8%; three samples), and stx-rfbEO₁₅₇-eae-γ1 (0.3%; one sample). Twenty-eight immunomagnetic separation (IMS) assays performed on samples positive for these combinations allowed the recovery of seven eaeβ1-positive STEC O26:H11 isolates, whereas no STEC O103:H2, O145:H28, or O157:H7 strains could be isolated. Three stx-negative and eaeβ1-positive E. coli O26:[H11] strains were also isolated from cheeses by IMS. Colony hybridization allowed us to recover STEC from stx-positive samples for 15 out of 45 assays performed, highlighting the difficulties encountered in STEC isolation from dairy products. The STEC O26:H11 isolates shared the same virulence genetic profile as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O26:H11, i.e., they carried the virulence-associated genes EHEC-hlyA, katP, and espP, as well as genomic O islands 71 and 122. Except for one strain, they all contained the stx1 variant only, which was reported to be less frequently associated with human cases than stx2. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed that they displayed high genetic diversity; none of them had patterns identical to those of human O26:H11 strains investigated here.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aShiga toxin 3aalleles 3acheeses 3aenterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 3afood pathogens 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenomic islands 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3araw milk 3ascreening 3aserotypes 3avirulence1 aVingadassalon, Noémie1 ade Garam, Carine Peytavin1 aMarault, Muriel1 aScheutz, Flemming1 aBrugère, Hubert1 aJamet, Emmanuel1 aAuvray, Frédéric0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 77, no. 6 p.2035-2041dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02089-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01322naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245003500117300001600152500001500168520054700183650001200730650001700742650002400759650000900783650001900792650001600811653002400827653001900851653001400870773007400884852000900958939003300967945000801000655001201008991593575200742620221117010425.0781001e197803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894831382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aLacto fruit: a new soft drink?  ap. 116-117.  a2019-12-04  aA process called enzymatic electrocatalysis which is used to produce a new beverage made from hydrolyzed whey is diagrammed and discussed.

If research reveals encouraging economic possibilities, a prototype drink will be produced and tested in the market. 3alactose 3anew products 3aalcoholic beverages 3awhey 3adietetic foods 3asoft drinks 0aBeverage production 0adairy products 0abeverages0 tFood engineering.g1978 Mar., v. 50, no. 3 p.116-117x0015-637X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19781001c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle01292naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245005200117300001100169520050000180650002400680650002400704650001900728650001500747650002300762650001500785650001200800650002100812653003400833773007300867852000900940939003300949945000800982655001200990991593574720742620221117005929.0780701e197803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894830342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aImpaired response to hypoxia in semi starvation  ap. 94.  aA study of the response to hypoxia in semi starvation is summarized. The study involved seven healthy volunteers over 15 days, and the results indicate that ten days of partial calorie deprivation may seriously impair the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia. Metabolic rate decreased by about 25 percent in parallel with the hypoxic ventilatory response and increased with refeeding.

Mixed diets (16% CP) contained 42% sorghum grain with alfalfa hay as the forage source. When grain was steam flaked to .40 kg/L (31 lb(bu), milk yield was increased, and efficiency was improved, without decreasing intake or milk fat percentage. Further processing of the grain to a flake density of .27 kg/L (21 lb/bu) depressed intake and milk fat percentage, and inclusion of buffer in the diet did not alleviate these problems. Steam flaking sorghum grain increased DM, OM, starch, and CP digestibilities; lowered ruminal ammonia and acetate to propionate ratio; and increased fecal pH. The sodium sesquicarbonate buffer did not influence diet digestibility, milk fat percentage, or ruminal pH, but it increased acetate to propionate ratio in ruminal fluid. Cows fed the buffered diets consumed less feed, which resulted in increased gross efficiency. Compared with dry rolling, steam flaking the sorghum grain to .40 kg/L improved performance, but the lowest flake density was detrimental, and effects were not alleviated by inclusion of 1% buffer in the diet. 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3adairy cows 3aforage evaluation 3asteaming 3aflaking 3abuffers 3amilk yield 3amilk composition 3adigestibility 3arumen fermentation 0astarch digestion 0aroller processing1 aPoore, M.H.1 aEck, T.P.1 aSwingle, R.S.1 aHuber, J.T.1 aArana, M.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1992 Dec., v. 75, no. 12 p.3465-3472x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02008naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011300126300001800239500001500257520108300272650001401355650001901369650002001388650002001408650001801428650001001446650001501456653002201471700001901493700001801512773008501530852000901615939003301624946001301657655001201670IND9300964920221117005751.0930217e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930096492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenry, P.R.10aRelative bioavailability of manganese for a manganese-methionine complex and inorganic sources for ruminants  ap. 3473-3478.  a2019-12-04  aTwo experiments were conducted to study the relative bioavailability of Mn from a feed grade Mn-Met complex or from two feed grade MnO sources using reagent grade MnSO4.H2O as the standard.

In this article, we describe two outbreaks of toxoplasmosis that occurred in 2001 and 2006 in an outdoor captive breeding colony of squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) kept by the Institut Pasteur in French Guiana. A microsatellite DNA analysis of the biological samples collected in the 2001 and 2006 outbreaks showed that two different Toxoplasma strains were involved. The 2001 strain exhibited a type II genotype whereas the 2006 strain showed a combination of type I, type III and atypical alleles. Infection could be related to oocysts contaminating water or food, or to ingestion of rats by monkeys. In 2006, a second episode was observed 3 weeks after the first, and was believed to be related to direct contamination by tachyzoites of bronchopulmonary origin from dying monkeys of the first event. During both outbreaks, a total of 50 monkeys died and none recovered spontaneously, confirming the virulence of both type II and non-type II Toxoplasma strains in New World monkeys. 3adietary exposure 3abreeding stock 3aSaimiri sciureus 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonkeys 3adisease severity 3agenotype 3avirulence 3amorbidity 3arisk factors 3awildlife diseases 3atoxoplasmosis 3adisease outbreaks 3apathogen identification 3amolecular epidemiology 3aToxoplasma gondii 3amortality 3adisease transmission 3acaptive animals 3agenetic variation 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aMonkey Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aSaimirixparasitology 2aToxoplasmaxgenetics 2aToxoplasmosis, Animalxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aVirulence 3aFrench Guiana 0amolecular sequence data 0aCebidae1 aAjzenberg, Daniel1 aDemar, Magalie1 aSimon, Stéphane.1 aDardé, Marie Laure1 aMaubert, Bertrand1 aThoisy, Benoit de.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2009 July 7, v. 163, no. 1-2 p.132-135dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20091105b20091204c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/10/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02556naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001200151245007000163300001400233500010300247520115400350650001001504650002401514650001901538650001201557650000901569650001101578650002101589650001901610650002501629650001801654650002401672650001201696650001601708650002701724700001601751700001201767700001401779700001601793700001501809700001301824700001401837700001701851773014301868856005402011852000902065655001202074IND4533914920221117005430.0160205e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453391492DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1092.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, H.12aAnEffective Embryogenesis Procedure from Anther Culture in Loquat  ap. 59-64.  aPaper presented at the IV International Symposium on Loquat held May 12-15, 2014, Palermo, (Italy)  aThe objective of this study was to establish a highly effective embryogenesis procedure in anther culture of loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl. âDawuxingâ). The results showed correlations between diameters of flower bud and microspore developmental stages. When the transverse and vertical diameters of flower buds were 4.68 and 4.52 mm, respectively, microspores were at the late-uninucleate developmental stage, and were suitable for inducing embryos. Two days of cold treatment at 4Â°C under darkness were more favorable than the control, resulting in 69.89% of callus formation. The most suitable medium for induction of callus from anthers was MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/L 2,4-D and 2.0 mg/L 6-BA, in which calli were induced at a frequency of 78.3%. The optimal induction of anther-derived embryos was achieved on MS medium supplemented with 0.05 mg/L ZT, 0.01 mg/L NAA and 0.05 mg/L IBA, in which the rate of embryo induction was 25.7%. The most suitable medium for anther-derived embryo proliferation was MS supplemented with 0.05 mg/L ZT, 0.02 mg/L NAA and 0.02 mg/L IBA, in which the proliferation coefficient was 5.8. 3a2,4-D 3aEriobotrya japonica 3aanther culture 3aanthers 3abuds 3acallus 3acallus formation 3acold treatment 3adevelopmental stages 3aembryogenesis 3aindole butyric acid 3aloquats 3amicrospores 3anaphthaleneacetic acid1 aWang, Y.

Immature embryos were isolated from cvs 'Azumamugi' (difficult to differentiate), 'Kanto Nakate Gold' (easy to differentiate), their hybrids (F1) and a backcross population derived from a cross 'Azumamugi' X F1. The embryos were cultured in vitro for callus initiation and subsequent shoot differentiation. The shoot differentiation rate was closely associated with ear type (v locus), isocitrate dehydrogenase isozyme (Idh-2), and esterase isozyme (Est-11). These markers were found to reside in a chromosome segment of approximately 30 cM on chromosome 2. Recombination frequency was 9.9% between v and a proposed QTL named "Shd1" (shoot differentiation), 11.5% between Idh-2 and Shd1, and 21.3% between Est-11 and Shd1. All data showed the Idh-2, v, Shd1 and Est-11 loci to be arranged in this order from proximal to distal on the long arm of chromosome 2. 3aorganogenesis 3ainflorescences 3aloci 3aHordeum vulgare 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3aembryo (plant) 3achromosome mapping 3aplant morphology 3agenetic markers 3agenetic recombination 3alinkage (genetics) 3acell differentiation 3aquantitative traits 3aisozymes 3aesterases 3acallus 3ashoots 0asegregation 0aidh-2 locus 0av locus 0achromosomes 0aest-11 locus 0ashd1 locus 0agene location1 aAnnaka, T.1 aOka, S.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1993 July, v. 86, no. 6 p.713-720x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02457naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245004500175300001600220500002400236520144500260650002001705650002101725650001101746650001101757650001201768650001401780650001501794650002201809650002201831650001501853650001101868700001801879773013201897852000902029856005702038655001202095IND4461394920221117010151.0110812e199008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446139492DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1990.tb00195.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMANGALY, JOSE K.10aPalynology of South Indian Zingiberaceae  ap. 351-366.  aIncludes references  aMANGALY, J.

Light microscope studies on pollen morphology of 21 Old World, tropical taxa of Zingiberaceae reveal that an exine is absent only in Kaempferia. A discontinuous exine layer consisting of circular plates joined together at margins occurs in Alpinia galanga and Amomum hypoleucum while all other taxa possess an uninterrupted exine layer which is commonly 0.7 μm to less than 2.0 μrn thick (3.2 μm in Zingiber zerumbet, 2.5 μm in Amomum hypoleucum). Exine is spinose in Alpinia (smooth in Alpinia sanderae), Amomum and Boesenbergia, verrucose in Eleltaria, tuberculate to areolate or striate in Zingiber, papillose in Globba and smooth or nearly so in Curcuma, Costus and Hedychiurn. Pollen grains are spheroidal, 50-90 μm in size (35 μm in Globba ophioglossa), and inaparturate (foraminate in Costus), except in Curcuma and Zingiber where they are ovoid to ellipsoidal, 70-135 times 60-80 μm in size and sulcate. A lamellated intine, much thicker than the exine, occurs in all, and it is thinner at the apertural region in Curcuma, Costus and Zingiber; in Elettaria and Hedychiurn it is thinner in one or few large scattered circular areas, and in Boesenbergia and Alpinia zerumbet on one side of the grains. Palynologirally Alpinia, Amomum, Boesenbergia, Kaempferia and Zingiber constitute one group while Elettaria, Hedychiurn and Costus constitute another. 3aAlpinia galanga 3aAlpinia zerumbet 3aAmomum 3aCostus 3aCurcuma 3aElettaria 3aKaempferia 3aZingiber zerumbet 3alight microscopes 3apalynology 3apollen1 aNAYAR, JYOTHI0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1990 Aug., v. 103, no. 4 p.351-366dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw50656x0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1990.tb00195.x 7aarticle02692naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245016300165300001600328500002400344500001500368520147400383650002801857650001001885650002001895650002201915650001201937650001301949650001401962650001201976651001001988653002401998700002302022700002102045700002302066700002202089700002202111773009202133852000902225856004802234655001202282IND4420629920221117005933.0090515e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442062992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-008-0531-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamasaki, Kenji10aRelative importance of within-habitat environment, land use and spatial autocorrelations for determining odonate assemblages in rural reservoir ponds in Japan  ap. 597-605.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aTo clarify the major factors affecting odonate assemblages in rural reservoir ponds among within-habitat environments, land use around ponds and spatial autocorrelation, we surveyed odonate adults (Zygoptera and Anisoptera) in 70 study ponds in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, during three sampling periods in 2005. Redundancy analyses (RDA) for these three factor groups were executed to determine their strength in explaining the odonate species composition. Their relative contributions were also evaluated by the method of variation partitioning. A total of 41 odonate species were recorded in the study ponds, and 24 of them, excluding rare species, were used for our analysis. Summed effects including all three factor groups explained approximately 39% of the variation in odonate species composition. We found that spatial autocorrelation was the most important, though the within-habitat environment and land use had comparable effects. We conclude that spatial autocorrelation should be considered in this type of analysis, though we could not clearly explain what caused such a spatial structure. Pond area and debris that had accumulated at the bottom of ponds were selected as the within-habitat environment, and the forests and paddy fields around ponds were selected for land use after the procedure of forward stepwise selection. These results suggest that the recent decrease of forests around the ponds has had a negative effect on the odonate assemblages. 3ainterspecific variation 3aponds 3aautocorrelation 3aspecies diversity 3apaddies 3aland use 3aZygoptera 3aforests 3aJapan 0aspecies differences1 aYamanaka, Takehiko1 aTanaka, Kōichi.1 aNakatani, Yukinobu1 aIwasaki, Nobusuke1 aSprague, David S.0 tEcological research.g2009 May, v. 24, no. 3 p.597-605dSpringer Japanx0912-38147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-008-0531-z 7aarticle02568naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245012100144300001600265500001500281520102000296650002901316650004301345650002601388650002701414650002301441650001901464650001401483650001801497650002101515650002301536651001301559653003001572653003601602653001401638653006001652653003701712653001201749653001701761700001801778700001501796700001501811700001901826700001401845700001401859773008701873852000901960930003301969945002502002946001102027655001202038IND4373452920221117005609.0050819e20050810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437345292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Ten strains harbored type I integrons and two different integron profiles were detected. Typing by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) resulted in observation of 10 profiles that differed by one to six bands. Salmonella strains were screened for presence of phage genes using a PCR-phage typing; five genes from P22 phage and genes encoding putative virulence factors from phages Gifsy-1, Gifsy-2 and Fels-1 were selected for testing. This set of genes was sufficient for dividing the strains into eight different PCR-phage profiles. Similar grouping of strains was observed in case of all the employed DNA techniques and they corresponded well with the phage type and antimicrobial resistance of the strains. The highest discriminating power was achieved with use of the AFLP, yet the detection of integrons and PCR-phage typing also proved to be valuable in typing the S. Typhimurium strains. 3aantimicrobial properties 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aantibiotic resistance 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3astrain differences 3abacteriophages 3avirulence 3asalmonellosis 3agenetic variance 3amicrobial genetics 3aSlovakia 0apolymerase chain reaction 0aantibiotic resistance profiling 0aintegrons 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0astrains 0aphage typing1 aDrahovska, H.1 aSzemes, T.1 aKuchta, T.1 aKarpiskova, R.1 aSasik, M.1 aTurna, J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Aug. 10, v. 109, no. 1-2 p.113-120x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02925naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245008300187300001600270500002400286520164100310650002501951650001101976650002101987650002502008650001602033650002202049650001302071650001102084650001602095650001802111650002102129650001602150650001502166650001802181650001302199650001002212651001402222700002102236700002002257700002202277773009202299852000902391856005502400655001202455IND4407896120221117005810.0080718e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440789612DNAL7 a182667282pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00427.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunt, R. J.10aImportance of Unsaturated Zone Flow for Simulating Recharge in a Humid Climate  ap. 551-560.  aIncludes references  aTransient recharge to the water table is often not well understood or quantified. Two approaches for simulating transient recharge in a ground water flow model were investigated using the Trout Lake watershed in north-central Wisconsin: (1) a traditional approach of adding recharge directly to the water table and (2) routing the same volume of water through an unsaturated zone column to the water table. Areas with thin (less than 1 m) unsaturated zones showed little difference in timing of recharge between the two approaches; when water was routed through the unsaturated zone, however, less recharge was delivered to the water table and more discharge occurred to the surface because recharge direction and magnitude changed when the water table rose to the land surface. Areas with a thick (15 to 26 m) unsaturated zone were characterized by multimonth lags between infiltration and recharge, and, in some cases, wetting fronts from precipitation events during the fall overtook and mixed with infiltration from the previous spring snowmelt. Thus, in thicker unsaturated zones, the volume of water infiltrated was properly simulated using the traditional approach, but the timing was different from simulations that included unsaturated zone flow. Routing of rejected recharge and ground water discharge at land surface to surface water features also provided a better simulation of the observed flow regime in a stream at the basin outlet. These results demonstrate that consideration of flow through the unsaturated zone may be important when simulating transient ground water flow in humid climates with shallow water tables. 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3abasins 3agroundwater flow 3agroundwater recharge 3ahumid zones 3ahydrologic models 3asnowmelt 3aspring 3astream flow 3asurface water 3aunsaturated flow 3awater table 3awatersheds 3awetting front 2aHumidity 2aWater 3aWisconsin1 aPrudic, David E.1 aWalker, John F.1 aAnderson, Mary P.0 tGround water.g2008 , v. 46, no. 4 p.551-560dBlackwell Publishing Incx0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00427.x 7aarticle02129naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245013600178300001400314500001500328520073100343650002001074650001701094650001901111650001801130650001201148650001501160650001101175650002001186650002401206650002301230650002101253650003901274650001201313650002501325650002301350653001601373653001701389700001501406700001901421700002001440773008501460852000901545930003301554945002501587946001101612655001201623IND4373449120221117005537.0050819e20050810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437344912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

MIC values obtained ranged from 0.0078 to 0.5 μg/ml. These very low values imply that no resistance to tylosin was found in any isolate of the Foulbrood pathogen. The measurement of diseased larvae with AFB-clinical symptoms in three different field studies demonstrated that tylosin treatment could be effective in vivo. No negative effects in colonies were noted at any dosage rates or forms of application. These studies demonstrate that tylosin, as tartrate, can be used to treat AFB in honeybee colonies. 3ain vivo studies 3adrug therapy 3aApis mellifera 3adose response 3atylosin 3ahoney bees 3adosage 3adisease control 3aAmerican foul brood 3adisease resistance 3ain vitro studies 3aPaenibacillus larvae subsp. larvae 3astrains 3abacterial infections 3ahoney bee colonies 0aantibiotics 0abee diseases1 aAlbo, G.N.1 aReynaldi, F.J.1 aDe Giusti, M.R.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Aug. 10, v. 109, no. 1-2 p.47-55x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02376naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245007800148300001200226500001500238520087200253650002201125650001001147650002201157650002401179650001401203650001001217650002301227650002501250650001301275650002501288650004101313651001101354653002001365653004101385653001501426653001901441653002801460653001301488653001201501653001801513700002101531700002601552700002601578700001601604700002101620700002001641773008301661852000901744930003301753945002501786946001101811655001201822IND4373448220221117010600.0050819e20050810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437344822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this study, we present the sequence of a 574-nucleotide (191-amino acid) region of the gag gene of SRLV strains from four sheep and one goat from a single geographic area of Greece. All five sequences appeared to be closely related at both nucleotide (2.1-14.2% variation) and deduced amino acid (1.6-4.2% variation) level. Greek SRLV strains were closer to ovine prototypic strains (average divergence 16.8%) than to the caprine strain CAEV-Co (21% divergence). By amino acid composition, the Greek SRLVs were on the average more than twice as distant from CAEV-Co as from other ovine strains. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that Greek strains segregate into a unique group, separate from, but related to, other ovine prototype sequences. 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3aVisna maedi virus 3amaedi-visna disease 3aphylogeny 3agoats 3astrain differences 3aamino acid sequences 3agenotype 3anucleotide sequences 3aCaprine arthritis encephalitis virus 3aGreece 0asmall ruminants 0aviral diseases of animals and humans 0aLentivirus 0asheep diseases 0amolecular sequence data 0agag gene 0astrains 0agoat diseases1 aKaranikolaou, K.1 aPapanastasopoulou, M.1 aKoumpati-Artopiou, M.1 aVlemmas, I.1 aPapadopoulos, O.1 aKoptopoulos, G.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Aug. 10, v. 109, no. 1-2 p.1-9x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/01/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02172naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245009600163300001600259500001500275520089600290650002201186650002601208650001401234650001501248650001501263650001301278650002301291650002501314650001801339650002501357650002401382650001301406650002301419650001401442650002501456653002801481653001201509700001901521773008401540852000901624930003301633945002501666946001101691655001201702IND4372870520221117010131.0050729e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437287052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To investigate its potential role in virulence, an isogenic hemolysin mutant strain of E. ictaluri R4383 was constructed by transposon mutagenesis. Sequencing of the chromosomal insertion site identified two genes, designated eihA and eihB, that encode proteins with homology to the Serratia family of two-component hemolysins.

The objective of this study was to investigate alterations in transcription of genes for cytokines and chemokines in association with feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) mRNA transcription. Nasal samples from 21 cats were submitted for FHV-1 virus isolation (VI), traditional endpoint polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of FHV-1 DNA, and quantitative real-time TaqMan PCR analysis of cytokines and chemokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-16, IL-18, interferon [IFN]-γ, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted protein [RANTES]) and of FHV-1 mRNA and DNA. Co-infection with feline calicivirus or Chlamydophila spp. was excluded in all cats. Gene transcription in nasal samples from four specific pathogen free (SPF) cats served as the calibrator for cytokines. FHV-1 was detected by VI in 14 of 21 samples, by traditional PCR in 18 of 21 samples, and by quantitative PCR in 13 (mRNA+) and 18 (DNA+) samples. Nasal samples from cats positive for FHV-1 mRNA displayed significantly increased transcription of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-18, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and RANTES (P < 0.05) in comparison to samples from cats negative for FHV-1 mRNA. The cycle threshold for FHV-1 DNA was significantly higher in cats with detectable FHV-1 mRNA (P < 0.05). Increased transcription of cytokines/chemokines in cats with detectable mRNA for FHV-1 suggests a role for FHV-1 in nasal inflammation. 3amessenger RNA 3adisease detection 3ainterleukins 3acats 3aFelid alphaherpesvirus 1 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainflammation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 3achronic diseases 3anasal mucosa 3acat diseases 3atumor necrosis factors 3aprotein secretion 3agene expression regulation 3ainterferons 0aFelid herpesvirus 1 0acytokines1 aMaggs, D.J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 July, v. 108, no. 3-4 p.225-233x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080918b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/01/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03089naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012400169300001400293500002400307520176300331650002702094650002202121650002302143650001902166650001702185650002102202650001002223650001702233650001602250650001102266650001102277650001802288650001802306650001902324650001602343650001102359650001902370650001002389700001502399700001702414700001602431773010802447852000902555856005502564655001202619IND4451858920221117005617.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445185892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2010.00325.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrillo, E.10aMain factors underlying consumer's food choice: a first step for the understanding of attitudes toward "healthy eating"  ap. 85-95.  aIncludes references  aThis research investigates consumers' factors underlying food choice and their attitudes toward healthy eating. The participants completed a questionnaire composed by two parts. The first one was based on the Food Choice Questionnaire where the mean scores and factor analyses pointed to “sensory appeal,”“price” and “convenience” as the most important factors in Spaniards' food choice. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering grouped women and adult people as the most concerned population about health and weight control. Considering the latter factor, the items “is low in calories,”“help me to control my weight” were more associated with “is low in fat” than “Is low in sugar.” The second part of the questionnaire asked about the consumption frequencies of different kind of foods and revealed dairy products as the most consumed ones. Furthermore, foods with specific health-promoting ingredients exhibited low consumption frequency, most likely motivated by the low interest or knowledge about their health benefits. Practical Applications: Knowing the main factors underlying consumers' food choice provides important information for having a better understanding of consumers' interest and attitudes toward healthy eating, as well as their concerns about factors involving purchase decision. Knowledge about perceptions toward healthy foods is useful for researchers, producer, manufacturers and health professionals as a first step to design public health policies and consumer education strategies. In addition, the methodology used in the present study with potential application to any kind of population, establishes relationships between consumers perception and food consumption behavior for Spanish consumers. 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconsumer behavior 3aconsumer education 3adairy products 3afood choices 3afood consumption 3afoods 3ahealthy diet 3aingredients 3alipids 3aprices 3aprofessionals 3apublic policy 3aquestionnaires 3aresearchers 3asugars 3aweight control 3awomen1 aVarela, P.1 aSalvador, A.1 aFiszman, S.0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2011 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.85-95dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2010.00325.x 7aarticle02790naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245015800159300001500317520126000332650001701592650002601609650002001635650001601655650001301671650001901684650001901703650001801722650001901740650001001759650001001769650001801779650001401797650001401811650001201825650001701837650001801854650002301872651001001895700001801905700001701923700001301940700001801953700001501971700001501986700001402001700001502015700001702030773008702047852000902134930003302143945002502176946001102201655001202212IND4375197020221117010345.0051014e20050930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437519702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYamada, T.10aLeukotoxin family genes in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from domestic animals and prevalence of lukM-lukF-PV genes by bacteriophages in bovine isolates  ap. 97-103.  aLeukotoxin family genes in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from domestic animals were examined by polymerase chain reaction. LukS and lukF genes were detected in all 48 avian and 72 porcine isolates of S. aureus. LukE and lukD genes, located in a putative staphylococcal pathogenicity island (Sapln3/Saplm3), were recognized in 44 (91.7%) of 48 avian isolates, but these genes were not detected in porcine isolates. In 297 bovine isolates collected from mastitic cow's milk and bulk milk from dairy farms in two regions, lukM and lukF-PV(P83) genes in addition to lukS-lukF and lukE-lukD genes were detected in 100 (62.5%) of the 160 isolates from Ishikawa and in 118 (86.1%) of the 137 isolates from Hokkaido. When the lysogeny of S. aureus bovine isolates was examined by treatment with mitomycin C, clearing of the culture due to cell lysis was observed in 34 (91.9%) of 37 lukM-lukF-PV(P83) genes - positive isolates. In addition, we isolated a novel lukM-lukF-PV(P83)-carrying (designated phiLukM), and revealed that the lukM-lukF-PV(P83) genes were located very close to an amidase gene on the temperate phage genomes. These results suggest horizontal transmission of lukM-lukF-PV(P83) genes by temperate bacteriophages in S. aureus of bovine origin. 3adairy cattle 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abovine mastitis 3aleukotoxins 3alysogeny 3agene frequency 3abacteriophages 3abird diseases 3aswine diseases 3abirds 3aswine 3apathogenicity 3abulk milk 3amitomycin 3aamidase 3acell culture 3agene transfer 3afood contamination 3aJapan1 aTochimaru.

To identify specific sources of mastitis-causing S. uberis strains, samples were collected monthly from the environment and feces of dry cows in a grazing herd. Environmental and fecal strains of S. uberis were compared to those found in milk. S. uberis was detected in 63% of 94 environmental samples, including water, soil, plant matter, bedding material, flies, and hay, in 23% of 107 fecal samples, and in 4% of 787 milk samples. Automated PvuII ribotyping revealed 48 ribotypes among 266 isolates. Per sample, up to five ribotypes were detected. The distribution of ribotypes did not differ significantly among environmental, fecal and milk samples. Specific environmental sources or strains of udder-pathogenic S. uberis were not identified. Fecal shedding was not persistent and did not differ between dry-off and calving. The proportion of fecal samples containing S. uberis was highest during the summer grazing season. S. uberis was common in farm soil (31 of 35 samples) but not in non-farm soil (0 of 11 samples). We hypothesize that fecal shedding of S. uberis may play a role in maintenance of S. uberis populations in the dairy ecosystem. 3adairy cows 3astrain differences 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3afeces 3adisease transmission 3aStreptococcus uberis 3amilk 3amammary involution 3aDNA fingerprinting 3abovine mastitis 0astrains 0abacterial infections 0aenvironmental samples1 aTikofsky, L.L.1 aBoor, K.J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Aug. 30, v. 109, no. 3-4 p.257-265x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080722b20080801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02889naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245010400163300001600267520173100283650001002014650001202024650001902036650002102055650002702076650001302103650001202116650001902128650001302147650001402160650002202174650002402196650001602220700001802236700001702254700001802271773008802289852000902377930003302386945002502419946001102444655001202455IND4375197320221117010418.0051014e20050930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437519732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCarstensen, L.10aEscherichia coli post-weaning diarrhoea occurrence in piglets with monitored exposure to creep feed  ap. 113-123.  aThe objective of the study was to investigate the effect of offering supplementary creep feed to piglets during the suckling period on the faecal shedding of haemolytic Escherichia coli bacteria and occurrence of spontaneous post-weaning diarrhoea 0-5 days after weaning. Supplementary creep feed was offered to half of the piglets in 12 litters, from 2 weeks of age until weaning at 4 weeks, and the individual feed contact was recorded by direct observations. It was found that diarrhoea occurrence was associated with faecal shedding of haemolytic E. coli bacteria (p = 0.003), specifically E. coli O149 (p = 0.004). Occurrence of diarrhoea and faecal shedding of haemolytic E. coli was not associated with creep feeding per se. However, the faecal E. coli O149 shedding occurred significantly less often in piglets that were offered creep feed in the suckling period but only showed limited interest in the feed (i.e. contacted the feed less than or equal to the median level of contact) compared to piglets that had frequent creep feed contact or piglets that had not had access to creep feed at all (p = 0.015). Correspondingly, the diarrhoea occurrence tended to be lower in these piglets (p = 0.081). Piglets with low creep feed contact during the suckling period ate the same total amount of feed during the 5 days after weaning, however, they ate less feed on days 0-2 after weaning compared to the piglets with frequent creep feed contact and non-creep fed piglets. It is suggested that intestinal function associated with a voluntary low creep feed contact during the suckling period leads to decreased feed intake just after weaning, and thus reduces the intestinal proliferation of E. coli O149 in these piglets. 3afeces 3apiglets 3aswine diseases 3aEscherichia coli 3aEscherichia infections 3adiarrhea 3aweaning 3apiglet feeding 3asuckling 3ahemolysis 3adisease incidence 3afeeding preferences 3afeed intake1 aErsboll, A.K.1 aJensen, K.H.1 aNielsen, J.P.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Sept. 30, v. 110, no. 1-2 p.113-123x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03058naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245020200142300001400344500001500358520159100373650004501964650002002009650001702029650004102046650001702087650001102104650002602115650002302141650002702164650001402191650002502205650001002230650002502240650002202265650001902287651001002306653002802316653001202344700001402356700001502370700001602385773008502401852000902486930003302495945002502528946001102553655001202564IND4372454520221117001423.0050720e20050615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437245452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The env fragment of BLV was successfully amplified from 33 serologically positive bulk milk samples collected from different geographical areas in the south of Chile. Restriction analysis allowed to classify 17 isolates within the Australian subgroup and 16 within the Belgium subgroup. DNA sequence and multiple alignment analysis of eight Chilean isolates showed a significantly higher frequency of single and double nucleotide substitutions. Most of these mutations were non-silent, resulting in changes at the protein level in several important epitopes of gp51. The Chilean sequences and 59 BLV env sequences available at GenBank, were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis, resulting in four different clusters. The groups identified were not related to those previously defined by restriction analysis. Chilean isolates were included in two different clusters and were genetically not related to isolates collected from neighbouring countries. Considering our results we can conclude: (i) bulk milk samples are suitable to identify the presence of BLV allowing epidemiological and genetic studies to be conducted on large geographical areas; (ii) at least four different genetic groups of BLV were identified by phylogenetic analysis, with Chilean isolates included in two different sub clusters. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3acattle diseases 3aepidemiology 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3afood animals 3acattle 3aBovine leukemia virus 3astrain differences 3ageographical variation 3aphylogeny 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3apoint mutation 3aChile 0amolecular sequence data 0astrains1 aMunoz, G.1 aZuniga, J.1 aRecabal, M.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 June 15, v. 108, no. 1-2 p.39-47x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03588naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245015500145300001300300500001500313520209500328650002002423650001802443650002402461650004102485650001702526650001102543650002802554650002302582650005202605650002502657650002602682650001902708650002502727650002402752650001802776653003902794653002802833653002202861653001202883700002002895700001702915773008402932852000903016930003303025945002503058946001103083655001203094IND4372453720221117001412.0050720e20050615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437245372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aValentova, V.10aRestriction enzyme analysis of RT-PCR amplicons as a rapid method for detection of genetic diversity among bovine respiratory syncytial virus isolates  ap. 1-12.  a2019-12-05  aOur current knowledge of antigenic variability of the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is quite limited and is mainly dependent on the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). In this study, we present not only analysis of the antigenic, but also of the genetic variability of BRSV. Using a panel of BRSV-specific mAb we distinguished five main reactivity patterns, three of which corresponded to the previously established subgroups A, B and AB. A single viral strain yielded the fourth pattern, while four viral strains did not react with any of the used mAbs forming the fifth pattern. To investigate the genetic basis for the antigenic heterogeneity of the BRS virus G protein, DNA of 11 BRSV isolates was directly sequenced. The comparison of the obtained nucleotide or amino acid sequences to those BRSV strains present in the GenBank revealed 88.1-99.4% and 77.7-98.4% similarity, respectively. These results supported the previously stated suggestion to type BRSV isolates according to their genetic relationship. In order to introduce a rapid and simple method to study the genetic variability of BRSV, we utilized the restriction enzyme analysis of RT-PCR products derived from mRNAs corresponding to the most variable region of the BRSV glycoprotein G ectodomain. Using this restriction enzyme analysis we were able to identify genetic variability among BRSV isolates. The detected non-synonymous mutations led frequently to a change in digestion pattern and were predominantly located in two mucin-like regions of the G protein gene. A correlation has been found between grouping of isolates in the phylogenetic tree and their restriction patterns clustering together isolates with the same restriction profiles. However, viruses placed distant in the tree sharing the same restriction patterns were detected supposing that phylogenetic analysis should be necessary for BRSV typing. Thus, we propose to use DNA restriction polymorphism for a rapid detection of genetic variants among BRSV isolates circulating in cattle population and as a preliminary tool for their typing. 3acattle diseases 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3afood animals 3acattle 3aBovine orthopneumovirus 3astrain differences 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aamino acid sequences 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aviral proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aantigenic variation 3aglycoproteins 0aBovine respiratory syncytial virus 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic variation 0astrains1 aAntonis, A.F.G.1 aKovarcik, K.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 June 15, v. 108, no. 1-2 p.1-12x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02800naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001000127245014200137300001600279500001500295520147500310650002201785650002001807650002501827650001701852650002301869650002101892650002801913650002001941650002501961650001001986650001501996650002502011650003102036650001002067653002802077653001202105700001202117700001902129700001802148773008602166852000902252930003302261945002502294946001102319655001202330IND4370987220221117002103.0050604e20050520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437098722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using PCR, the gene was detected in all the 48 strains of B. hyodysenteriae examined and in Brachyspira innocens strain B256T, but not in 11 other strains of B. innocens nor in 42 strains of other Brachyspira spp. The gene was sequenced from B. innocens strain B256T and from 11 strains of B. hyodysenteriae. The B. hyodysenteriae genes shared 97.9-100% nucleotide sequence similarity and had 97.5-99.5% similarity with the gene of B. innocens strain B256T. Southern hybridisation indicated that bmpB was present on a 1.9 kb HindIII fragment of the B. hyodysenteriae genome and on a 3.1 kb fragment of the B. innocens B256T genome. The B. innocens lipoprotein did not react in Western blots with monoclonal antibody BJL/SH1 that reacts with the B. hyodysenteriae lipoprotein. The difference in binding with the monoclonal antibody may reside in the replacement of a serine residue with a tyrosine residue at base position 210 in the lipoprotein from B. innocens B256T. Comparison of the BmpB amino acid sequence with sequences in the SWISS-PROT protein database indicated that it has 33.9-39.9% similarity with the D-methionine binding proteins (MetQ) of a number of pathogenic bacterial species. The bmpB gene was confirmed to be the same as a gene of B. hyodysenteriae that was recently designated "blpA". 3asequence analysis 3aswine dysentery 3aBrachyspira innocens 3alipoproteins 3astrain differences 3abinding proteins 3aouter membrane proteins 3agene expression 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3amethionine 3anucleotide sequences 3aBrachyspira hyodysenteriae 3aswine 0amolecular sequence data 0astrains1 aTan, P.1 aPhillips, N.D.1 aHampson, D.J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 May 20, v. 107, no. 3-4 p.249-256x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/01/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01506naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245006400131300001600195520066700211650001600878650001900894650001500913650001800928650001500946650002500961650001600986653002701002773010001029852000901129939003301138945000801171946001301179655001201192991593552580742620221117001713.0850613e198502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859255742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoran, H.E.10a"Small" or "large" farm: some methodological considerations  ap. 130-132.  aExtract: Often the estimation of agricultural production technologies in less developed countries is achieved by dividing the sample arbitrarily into "small" and "large" farms and estimating a separate production function for each group. This is equivalent to including an appropriate dummy variable in a single regression on the whole sample. A modification of this approach is to replace the dummy variable (a step-function) by either a cumulative normal or logistic function. The parameters of such a "generalized dummy variable" convey valuable information on whether a small-large categorization is appropriate and, if so, where the division should be made. 3asmall farms 3aclassification 3atechnology 3alinear models 3aestimation 3aproduction functions 3alarge farms 0acobb-douglas functions0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1985 Feb., v. 67, no. 1 p.130-132x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19850613c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle01686naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001900157245010000176300001600276500001500292520052700307650002600834650000900860650002000869650001500889653001900904653001900923653002300942653002800965653002700993700001701020700001701037773009001054852000901144856007801153930003301231945001301264946001101277655001201288IND2042927420221117001858.0941031e199407  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204292742DNAL7 a241861122pmid7 a10.1007/BF012409202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernando, R.L.14aThe finite polygenic mixed model: an alternative formulation for the mixed model of inheritance  ap. 573-580.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper presents a mixed model of inheritance with a finite number of polygenic loci.

Embryos were collected from selection lines and reciprocal crosses of selection lines (HFLF and LFHF) and frozen by established slow-cool methods. Embryos were thawed for 40s at room temperature and then placed in a 37 degrees C waterbath for 1 min. Cryoprotectant was diluted from embryos with either 0.5 M sucrose (GLY-treated) or 1.0 M sucrose (PG-treated). Post-thaw survival was measured as the percentage of embryos developing to 36 h (PTS36), 48 h (PTS48) and hatched blastocyst (PTSHB), respectively. Non-frozen controls were cultured concurrently with frozen embryos. No significant genotype or genotype X cryoprotectant inters action effects were found. Results of the embryo freezing study indicated that selection for high or low fat content did not affect the ability of embryos to survive cryopreservation. preservation. There was no indication of embryo heterosis for post-thaw survival. Embryos frozen with GLY survived the freeze-thaw stress significantly better than those frozen in PG (P < 0,05). In vitro development of non-frozen controls at 36 and 48 h did not var significant among lines, but in vitro development was significant different among lines at the hatched blastocyst stage (P < 0.05). Linear contrasts showed that the embryonic genome was responsible for differential in vitro development at the hatched blastocyst stage between these selected lines (HF > LF; P < 0.05); asymmetric response also occurred in that both HF and LF exceeded the unselected control line (P < 0.05). 3amice 3aline differences 3abody fat 3acorrelated responses 3aanimal breeding 3amortality 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3aglycerol 3apropylene glycol 3aartificial selection 3aembryo (animal)1 aEisen, E.J.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 June, v. 88, no. 3/4 p.479-485x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02296naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011200125300001600237500001500253520103700268650004501305650001001350650001201360650001701372650001801389650001901407650001301426650001001439653003101449653003201480653002101512653001101533653002701544700001401571700002301585700001501608700001701623700002301640700001701663773009201680852000901772930003301781945001301814946001101827655001201838IND2042054520221117002410.0940916e199406  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204205452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlee, P.10aGrowth hormone and insulin-like growth factor I concentrations in bulls of various growth hormone genotypes  ap. 497-500.  a2019-12-05  aA leucine/valine substitution at amino acid position 127 was identified by the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism in the bovine growth hormone gene. Genotyping was performed in 84 Al bulls of three different breeds, in which plasma concentrations of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) were also measured. Gene frequencies of variants L (leucine) und V (valine) were 0.80/0.20 (Black and White). 0.90/0.10 (Brown), 0.71/0.29 (Simmental). Hormone concentrations were measured during different physiological conditions (normal feeding, fasting, realimentation) in the majority of animals. Generally, genotype LL was associated with higher concentrations of GH than LV. This difference was significant in Black and White bulls (P < 0.05). In contrast, IGF- 1 concentrations were higher in LV than in LL animals. This was most pronounced in mature, realimented Simmental bulls. We conclude that the various GH alleles influence the circulating concentrations of GH and IGF-1. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3abulls 3aalleles 3asomatotropin 3acattle breeds 3agene frequency 3agenotype 3ablood 0ainsulin-like growth factor 0abavarian and tyrolean brown 0agerman simmental 0acattle 0agerman black and white1 aGraml, R.1 aSchallenberger, E.1 aSchams, D.1 aRottmann, O.1 aOlbrich-Bladau, A.1 aPirchner, F.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 June, v. 88, no. 3/4 p.497-500x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02966naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008700130300001600217500002800233500001500261520190900276650001902185650001502204650001702219650001702236650001402253650001502267650001802282650001702300650002502317650001902342650001602361650001102377653001802388700002102406700002102427773010002448852000902548946001102557655001202568IND4415972920221117001353.0090206s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441597292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabity, Paul D.10aIndirect suppression of photosynthesis on individual leaves by arthropod herbivory  ap. 655-663.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-12-05  aBACKGROUND: Herbivory reduces leaf area, disrupts the function of leaves, and ultimately alters yield and productivity. Herbivore damage to foliage typically is assessed in the field by measuring the amount of leaf tissue removed and disrupted. This approach assumes the remaining tissues are unaltered, and plant photosynthesis and water balance function normally. However, recent application of thermal and fluorescent imaging technologies revealed that alterations to photosynthesis and transpiration propagate into remaining undamaged leaf tissue. SCOPE AND CONCLUSIONS: This review briefly examines the indirect effects of herbivory on photosynthesis, measured by gas exchange or chlorophyll fluorescence, and identifies four mechanisms contributing to the indirect suppression of photosynthesis in remaining leaf tissues: severed vasculature, altered sink demand, defence-induced autotoxicity, and defence-induced down-regulation of photosynthesis. We review the chlorophyll fluorescence and thermal imaging techniques used to gather layers of spatial data and discuss methods for compiling these layers to achieve greater insight into mechanisms contributing to the indirect suppression of photosynthesis. We also elaborate on a few herbivore-induced gene-regulating mechanisms which modulate photosynthesis and discuss the difficult nature of measuring spatial heterogeneity when combining fluorescence imaging and gas exchange technology. Although few studies have characterized herbivore-induced indirect effects on photosynthesis at the leaf level, an emerging literature suggests that the loss of photosynthetic capacity following herbivory may be greater than direct loss of photosynthetic tissues. Depending on the damage guild, ignoring the indirect suppression of photosynthesis by arthropods and other organisms may lead to an underestimate of their physiological and ecological impacts. 3aimage analysis 3aarthropods 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3aleaf area 3aherbivores 3atranspiration 3aspatial data 3aenvironmental impact 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 0awater balance1 aZavala, Jorge A.1 aDeLucia, Evan H.0 tAnnals of botany.g2009 Feb., v. 103, no. 4 p.655-663dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL  aNon-US 7aarticle02030naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006800124300001600192500001500208520101400223650004501237650001601282650000801298650003001306650001501336650002901351650002001380653001801400653001501418653002501433700002401458700001601482773009201498852000901590930003301599945001301632946001101645655001201656IND2042053320221117001253.0940916e199406  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204205332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolff, K.10aRFLP analysis in chrysanthemum.

Probe and primer development  ap. 472-478.  a2019-12-05  aIn order to study genetic variability at the DNA level in chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora Tzvelev) Pst1 and HindIII genomic libraries were constructed. Probes from both libraries were tested for the presence of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Of the probes from the PstI library 91% appeared to hybridize to low-copy genes, while only 35% of those from the HindIII library appeared to do so. The Pst1 probes were used in further analyses as 79% of them showed RFLPs, whereas the HindIII low-copy number probes gave only 14% polymorphic patterns. Because of the hexaploid character of chrysanthemum. complex patterns generally consisting of 6-12 fragments were visible on a Southern blot after hybridization. To simplify the genetic analysis, locus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were developed that gave simple polymorphic patterns in a number of cases. The RFLP probes and primers developed will be used in future marker-assisted selection in this polyploid crop. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aDNA primers 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolyploidy 3aChrysanthemum morifolium 3agenetic markers 0aChrysanthemum 0aDNA probes 0agenetic polymorphism1 aPeters-Van Rijn, J.1 aHofstra, H.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 June, v. 88, no. 3/4 p.472-478x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02437naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007100127300001600198500001500214520122400229650002701453650001801480650002001498650002201518650003001540650002001570650004101590650001901631650002701650650001901677650002301696653001201719653001601731653003501747653003001782700001701812700001601829773009201845852000901937930003301946945001301979946001101992655001202003IND2042051120221117001105.0940916e199406  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204205112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlilan, E.C.10aExpression and inheritance pattern of two foreign genes in petunia  ap. 433-440.  a2019-12-05  aTransgenic petunia (Petunia hybrida Vilm.) plants were obtained from Agrobacterium-mediated shoot apex transformation. Studies at the phenotypic as well as molecular level established both the presence of the NPT II (neomycin phosphotransferase II) and GUS (beta-glucuronidase) genes and their level of activity. Twenty-nine primary transformed plants showed varying patterns of phenotype expression of both genes. NPT II and GUS expression in 7 primary plants over a 4-month interval showed varying levels of gene expression within and among individual plants. All primary transgenic plants were self-pollinated and backcrossed to establish the inheritance patterns of both genes. Mendelian and non-mendelian inheritance patterns for both genes were observed. Analysis of the progeny showed poor transmission of the foreign genes through the pollen especially when two or more bands were present in the Southern hybridization. Most plants whose progeny segregated in Mendelian ratios for either the NPT II or GUS gene had just one copy of the gene. In this study where both foreign genes were examined in both self and test crosses, no transgenic plant showed Mendelian patterns of inheritance for both foreign traits. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aPetunia hybrida 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3agene expression 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3areporter genes 3ainheritance (genetics) 3ahistochemistry 3abeta-glucuronidase 0aPetunia 0asegregation 0aneomycin phosphotransferase ii 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aMagill, J.M.1 aSmith, R.H.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 June, v. 88, no. 3/4 p.433-440x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03549naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010200126300001600228500001500244520216100259650003802420650004502458650001602503650002102519650000902540650003602549650002202585650001302607650002102620650001602641653001602657653001902673653001402692653001302706653001702719653003602736653001402772653001802786653001302804700001602817700001702833700001802850700001702868773009202885852000902977930003302986945001303019946001103032655001203043IND2042049020221117001434.0940916e199406  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204204902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgihara, Y.10aChromosome assignment of four photosynthesis-related genes and their variability in wheat species  ap. 383-394.  a2019-12-05  aCopy numbers of four photosynthesis-related genes, PhyA, Ppc, RbcS and Lhcb1*1, in wheat genomes were estimated by slot-blot analysis, and these genes were assigned to the chromosome arms of common wheat by Southern hybridization of DNA from an aneuploid series of the cultivar Chinese Spring. The copy number of PhyA was estimated to be one locus per haploid genome, and this gene was assigned to chromosomes 4AL, 4BS and 4DS. The Ppc gene showed a low copy number of small multigenes, and was located on the short arm of homoeologous group 3 chromosomes and the long arm of chromosomes of homoeologous group 7. Rbcs consisted of a multigene family, with approximately 100 copies in the common wheat genome, and was located on the short arm of group 2 chromosomes and the long arm of roup 5 chromosomes. Lhcb1*1 also consisted of a multigene family with about 50 copies in common wheat. Only a limited number of restriction fragments (approximately 15%) were used to determine the locations of members of this family on the long arm of group I chromosomes owing to the multiplicity of DNA bands. The variability of hybridized bands with the four genes was less in polyploids, but was more in the case of multigene families. RFLP analysis of polyploid wheats and their presumed ancestors was carried out with probes of the oat PhyA gene, the maize Ppc gene, the wheat RbcS gene and the wheat Lhcb1*1 gene. The RFLP patterns of common wheat most closely resembled those of T. dicoccum (Emmer wheat), T. uratu (A genome), Ae. speltoides (S genome) and Ae. squarrosa (D genome). Diversification of genes in the wheat complex appear to have occurred mainly at the diploid level. Based on RFLP patterns, B and S genomes were clustered into two major groups. The fragment numbers per genome were reduced in proportion to the increase of ploidy level for all four genes, suggesting that some mechanism(s) might operate to restrict, and so keep to a minimum, the gene numbers in the polyploid genomes. However, the Rbcs genes, located on 2BS, were more conserved (double dosage), indicating that the above mechanism(s) does not operate equally on individual genes. 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3awild plants 3astructural genes 3aloci 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aTriticum aestivum 3aAegilops 3amultigene family 3aphytochrome 0achromosomes 0amultiple genes 0aphya gene 0appc gene 0alhcb1*1 gene 0achlorophyll a/b binding protein 0arbcs gene 0agene location 0aTriticum1 aShimizu, H.1 aHasegawa, K.1 aTsujimoto, H.1 aSasakuma, T.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 June, v. 88, no. 3/4 p.383-394x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03266naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011900165300001600284500002400300520192200324650001702246650002202263650001802285650001302303650001602316650001802332650001602350650002002366650002302386650002302409650002002432650002102452650001602473650001702489650001802506650001002524650000902534650002202543700002202565700001902587700002202606773011102628852000902739856004802748655001202796IND4384961420221117000120.0061105e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438496142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-006-9056-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, Carsten10aGrowth performance and body composition of pike perch (Sander lucioperca) fed varying formulated and natural diets  ap. 577-586.  aIncludes references  aTo assess the effect of dietary composition on growth performance and body composition of pike perch (Sander lucioperca), fingerlings with an initial body weight of 1.36 g (just trained to accept formulated feed) were fed three experimental diets in triplicate for 90 days. Two feeding groups were fed with formulated diets (CD, CD+7) containing varying levels of crude lipid (CL) of 14.65% and 21.94% dry matter (d.m.) with crude protein (CP) levels of 59.73% and 56.56%, and one feeding group was fed a natural diet (chironomids, CP = 65.93% d.m.; CL = 7.20% d.m.). Furthermore, pike perch of the same age caught in different natural habitats were analysed to determine their naturally fluctuations in body composition. Specific growth rate (SGR; CD = 3.36, CD+7 = 3.47) and feed conversion ratio (FCR; CD = 1.02, CD+7 = 0.93) of fish fed formulated diets did not differ significantly with rising dietary lipid content, due to high variability within the individuals of each feeding groups. In contrast, pike perch fed with chironomids showed a significantly lower SGR of 2.49 and higher FCR of 2.37 (on a dry matter basis). Body composition of pike perch fed formulated diets was affected by dietary composition and showed increased lipid contents [CD=6.25% original matter (o.m.), CD+7 = 9.00% o.m.] with rising dietary lipid levels. Pike perch of CD and CD+7 feeding groups showed significant increased hepatosomatic indices (HSIs) of 1.99 and 2.05 in contrast to fish fed chironomids with HSI of 1.11. Fish caught in the different natural habitats were characterised by low body lipid and dry matter contents of 0.64-1.88% o.m. and 21.08-23.75% o.m. Higher lipid incorporation of fish fed with formulated diets accompanied with poor benefit on growth performance at higher dietary lipid content indicated that pike perch ability to utilise lipids is low when dietary crude protein content is higher than 56.56%. 3aChironomidae 3aSander lucioperca 3aanimal growth 3abody fat 3abody weight 3acrude protein 3adietary fat 3adietary protein 3adry matter content 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afeed formulation 3afingerlings 3afish feeding 3alipid content 3aperch 3apike 3awildlife habitats1 aGünther, Steffen1 aWirth, Manfred1 aRennert, Bernhard0 tAquaculture international.g2006 Dec., v. 14, no. 6 p.577-586dKluwer Academic Publishersx0967-61207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-006-9056-z 7aarticle01780naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010400126300001600230500001500246520081600261650004701077650000901124650001901133650000801152650001601160650002301176650002001199653001601219653002301235700001401258773009201272852000901364930003301373945001301406946001101419655001201430IND2042046120221117000747.0940916e199406  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204204612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinelli, G.12aA genetic linkage map of Picea abies Karst., based on RAPD markers as a tool in population genetics  ap. 283-288.  a2019-12-05  aNorway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) is a most important species among European forest trees for both economical and ecological reasons.

In this study we have used a population of 72 megagametophytes from a single tree in a natural Italian stand to produce a genetic linkage map by means of RAPD markers. Ninety-six random decamers used as primers yielded 185 polymorphic loci showing Mendelian inheritance. Analysis of the segregation by multi-point analysis allowed us to define 17 major linkage groups covering a total distance of 3584 cM, with an average spacing between markers of 22 cM. Possible uses of a genetic linkage map with respect to population ecology and genetics are discussed. 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aloci 3alinkage groups 3aDNA 3aPicea abies 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 0asegregation 0alinkage (genetics)1 aBucci, G.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1994 June, v. 88, no. 3/4 p.283-288x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02868naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245012400169300001600293500011900309520142200428650001401850650001601864650001301880650002201893650002401915650001101939650001801950650001101968650001301979650001401992650002202006650001002028650002402038650001202062700001702074700001702091700001702108700001602125700001502141700001702156700001602173773014502189856005502334852000902389655001202398IND60592012020221117001135.0180327e20171125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059201202DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1180.262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGionga, L.10aFruit quality profiling of blueberries for parental choice in breeding: aroma and texture at harvest and in postharvest  ap. 197-204.  aPaper presented at the XI International Vaccinium Symposium held April 10-14, 2016 Orlando, Florida United  States  aParental choice is a key process in breeding, with particular regard to traits that are still poorly defined in blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) like flavour and texture, which are crucial in consumer acceptance. Breeding selection of these traits is generally based on non-analytical observations or assessed at a unique data point, which makes it extremely difficult to precisely address specific parameters to be ameliorated. The aim of this work was to obtain a high throughput quality profiling of blueberries, with regard to two complex and commercially important traits like aroma/flavour and texture, in order to unravel the variability present in the germplasm and use the information for breeding advancements, at the ripe fruit stage and during postharvest. We profiled 47 accessions among which different species of Vaccinium, southern, northern, lowbush, half-high blueberries and rabbiteyes were included. The analyses were carried out at harvest and after storage at 2°C for six weeks at normal atmosphere conditions, in order to monitor the dynamics of the different parameters of the traits for each genotype. The results of these coupled analyses, namely Texture Analysis and Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS), are reported, with particular emphasis on developing explanatory knowledge toward an optimized parental choice for quality in blueberry breeding programs. 3aVaccinium 3ablueberries 3abreeding 3abreeding programs 3aconsumer acceptance 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3amass spectrometry 3aodors 3astorage temperature 3atexture1 aGrisenti, M.1 aKhomenko, I.1 aPoncetta, P.1 aLoretti, P.1 aAjelli, M.1 aBiasioli, F.1 aFarneti, B.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Nov. 25, , no. 1180 p.197-204dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1180.26  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245017300171300001500344500011900359520215700478650002702635650002502662650002302687650002302710650001602733650001402749650002102763650001202784650002502796650001402821650003102835650001302866650001302879650001602892650000902908650001802917650001302935650001702948650001302965650001602978650001002994650001403004650001403018700002503032700001603057700002203073773014403095856005503239852000903294655001203303IND60592010620221117000311.0180326e20171125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059201062DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1180.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, B.

Inoculum was prepared as a mycelial slurry, zoospore suspension, or grown on rice grains or vermiculite. The effect of flood treatments on root rot symptom development was investigated by immersing the pots containing plants grown in P. cinnamomi infested potting medium for 24 or 48 h at 3 or 6-week intervals. The effect of drought was investigated by watering plants 4, 5 or 7 days each week. Plants were assessed for plant vigor and disease severity at regular intervals. Based on the results of the four studies the following protocol was developed to achieve rapid, consistent root rot symptom development. Blueberry potting medium should be infested with a virulent isolate of P. cinnamomi using the rice grain inoculum delivery method. Rooted cuttings of germplasm to be tested should then be transplanted into the infested medium, and the pots containing the plants should be flooded for 48 h every 6 weeks to allow rapid infection of the root systems. Disease evaluations based on above-ground symptoms should be made beginning six months after transplanting the cuttings into the infested potting medium. Rooted cuttings of a susceptible southern highbush cultivar should be used as the assay plant when evaluating chemical or biological control products or when studying environmental effects. We will use this protocol to study environmental effects on the development of Phytophthora root rot of blueberries and to evaluate blueberry germplasm for tolerance to root rot, and to determine the efficacy of chemical and biological products for root rot control. 3aPhytophthora cinnamomi 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aVaccinium virgatum 3abiological control 3ablueberries 3acultivars 3adisease severity 3adrought 3aenvironmental impact 3agermplasm 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ainoculum 3amycelium 3arhizosphere 3arice 3aroot cuttings 3aroot rot 3aroot systems 3aslurries 3avermiculite 3avigor 3avirulence 3azoospores1 aMiller-Butler, M.

Generally, a risk preferrer prefers an installment purchase. The percentage of insurance funding preferred increases as aversion to risk increases. Higher income tax rates, lower discount rates, and lower premium costs move the preference for greater percentages of life insurance to lower levels of risk aversion. The funding decision clearly depends upon the characteristics of the individuals involved in the business. Nevertheless, partial funding with life insurance appears optimal in many cases. 3alife insurance 3astochastic processes 3arural areas 3acosts and returns 3autility functions 3arisk 0ainheritance tax 0acash flow 0aowner's equity 0aestates 0apartition of estates 0auses0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1985 Feb., v. 67, no. 1 p.60-69x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19850612c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle02444naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011500172300001800287520121600305650001501521650001601536650001401552650002301566650002201589650001901611650001201630650001301642650003301655650001601688650002201704700001801726700002101744700002201765773011401787852000901901856009201910930003302002946001102035655001202046IND4408692320221117000132.0080808e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440869232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06575.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuruta, Hiroki14aThe role of group bulkiness in the catalytic activity of psychrophile cold-active protein tyrosine phosphatase  ap. 4317-4328.  aThe cold-active protein tyrosine phosphatase found in psychrophilic Shewanella species exhibits high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures as well as low thermostability, both of which are characteristics shared by many cold-active enzymes. The structure of cold-active protein tyrosine phosphatase is notable for the presence of three hydrophobic sites (termed the CA, Zn-1 and Zn-2 sites) behind the loop structures comprising the catalytic region. To identify the structural components responsible for specific enzyme characteristics, we determined the structure of wild-type cold-active protein tyrosine phosphatase at high resolution (1.1 Å) and measured the catalytic efficiencies of enzymes containing mutations in the three hydrophobic sites. The bulkiness of the amino acid side chains in the core region of the Zn-1 site strongly affects the thermostability and the catalytic efficiency at low temperatures. The mutant enzyme I115M possessed a higher kcat at low temperatures. Elucidation of the crystal structure of I115M at a resolution of 1.5 Å revealed that the loop structures involved in retaining the nucleophilic group and the acid catalyst are more flexible than in the wild-type enzyme. 3aShewanella 3aamino acids 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3ahydrophobicity 3amutants 3amutation 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aMikami, Bunzo1 aYamamoto, Chiaki1 aYamagata, Hiroshi0 tFEBS journal.g2008 Sept., v. 275, no. 17 p.4317-4328dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06575.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01770naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245008600175300001800261520077500279650002501054650000901079650001201088650002001100650001101120653001401131653001601145773015001161852000901311856009201320930003301412946001101445655001201456IND4408677120221117000310.0080808e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440867712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2008.01750.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowgiallo, Andrzej14aThe effect of cutting and fish-orientation systems on the deheading yield of carp  ap. 1688-1692.  aApplied research into carp-deheading yield indicated that the V-cut with two circular knives averaged 77.9%; the V-cut with one cup-type knife - 75.6%, and the straight cut at a 79° angle to the fish backbone - 77.4%. The yield averages for deheaded and gutted carp were 63.6%, 62.4% and 62.9%, respectively. Standard analysis of variance demonstrated that there were no statistically significant differences between the mean yields of these three deheading systems. Furthermore, the potential influence of the fish-orientation system in close connection with the cutting systems on the deheading yield was analysed. This indicated that, with the same yields, the straight-cutting system simplifies the precise orientation of the fish in relation to the cutting knives. 3aanalysis of variance 3acarp 3acutting 3afish processing 3aknives 0adeheading 0aorientation0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2008 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.1688-1692dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2008.01750.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03810naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245010500192300001600297520176000313650002502073650002102098650001902119650001702138650002002155650001002175650003002185650001602215650002802231650001402259650001102273650001302284650001102297650003702308650001202345650001402357650001702371650002102388650004302409650007902452650004302531650005502574650002102629650002902650650003302679650003102712650003102743653001202774653001302786653001402799700002002813700002502833700002602858700002102884773011002905852000903015856009203024930003303116946001103149655001203160IND4408677920221116235629.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440867792DNAL7 a184525902pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03540.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChassot, Céline10aWounding of Arabidopsis leaves causes a powerful but transient protection against Botrytis infection  ap. 555-567.  aPhysical injury inflicted on living tissue makes it vulnerable to invasion by pathogens. Wounding of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, however, does not conform to this concept and leads to immunity to Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent of grey mould. In wounded leaves, hyphal growth was strongly inhibited compared to unwounded controls. Wound-induced resistance was not associated with salicylic acid-, jasmonic acid- or ethylene-dependent defence responses. The phytoalexin camalexin was found to be involved in this defence response as camalexin-deficient mutants were not protected after wounding and the B. cinerea strains used here were sensitive to this compound. Wounding alone did not lead to camalexin production but primed its accumulation after inoculation with B. cinerea, further supporting the role of camalexin in wound-induced resistance. In parallel with increased camalexin production, genes involved in the biosynthesis of camalexin were induced faster in wounded and infected plants in comparison with unwounded and infected plants. Glutathione was also found to be required for resistance, as mutants deficient in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase showed susceptibility to B. cinerea after wounding, indicating that wild-type basal levels of glutathione are required for the wound-induced resistance. Furthermore, expression of the gene encoding glutathione-S-transferase 1 was primed by wounding in leaves inoculated with B. cinerea. In addition, the priming of MAP kinase activity was observed after inoculation of wounded leaves with B. cinerea compared to unwounded inoculated controls. Our results demonstrate how abiotic stress can induce immunity to virulent strains of B. cinerea, a process that involves camalexin and glutathione. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aabiotic stress 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutamate-cysteine ligase 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3agray mold 3ahyphae 3aimmunity 3aleaves 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphytoalexins 3avirulent strains 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aBotrytisxdrug effectsxpathogenicity. 2aGlutathionexisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aImmunity, Innate 2aIndolesxtherapeutic use 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aThiazolesxtherapeutic use 0apriming 0awounding 0acamalexin1 aBuchala, Antony1 aSchoonbeek, Henk-jan1 aMétraux, Jean-Pierre1 aLamotte, Olivier0 tPlant journal.g2008 Aug., v. 55, no. 4 p.555-567dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03540.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02906naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245015500164300001800319520136200337650001301699650001401712650001701726650000901743650003301752650001301785650001601798650002001814650001901834650001401853650001201867650002201879650001301901650003301914650002301947650002001970650001201990650002102002653002002023653001202043653001502055700001702070700001802087773015002105852000902255856009202264930003302356946001102389655001202400IND4408675920221116235941.0080808e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440867592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01616.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, He10aComparison of full-fat and low-fat cheese analogues with or without pectin gel through microstructure, texture, rheology, thermal and sensory analysis  ap. 1581-1592.  aThe effects of pectin gel and protein base on processed semi-solid cheese analogues were studied through microstructure, texture, rheology, thermal analysis and sensory evaluation. Scanning electron microscopy revealed differences in the microstructure of processed cheese analogues. Samples made with full-fat contained higher concentrations of fat globules and were denser compared with low-fat cheese analogues with or without pectin gel. The pectin gel in the products acted as a linkage with other ingredients and made the products more compact and had less cavity compared with the products without pectin gel added. On rheological analysis, the full-fat products manifested a more solid-like form. The storage modulus of pectin gel sample was higher than that without pectin gel. All the samples' rheological parameters were depending on the oscillatory frequency and temperature. In low-fat samples, pectin gel added or not affected the hardness, gumminess, chewiness and adhesiveness significantly. The pectin gel addition show positive effect to the texture profile of the low-fat cheese analogues. Through thermal analysis, the meltability and glass transition temperature of the processed cheese analogues were measured. The low-fat cheese analogue with pectin gel addition got the higher texture and mouthfeel scores through sensory evaluation. 3aadhesion 3achewiness 3afat globules 3agels 3aglass transition temperature 3ahardness 3aingredients 3alow fat cheeses 3amicrostructure 3amouthfeel 3apectins 3aprocessed cheeses 3arheology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensory evaluation 3astorage modulus 3atexture 3athermal analysis 0aCheese analogue 0alow fat 0apectin gel1 aXu, Xue Ming1 aGuo, Shi Dong0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2008 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.1581-1592dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01616.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02797naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245014800171300001800319500002800337520169400365650001302059650002602072653002202098653002502120653001802145653003402163700002502197700002002222773011702242852000902359856009202368946001102460655001202471IND4408680420221116235734.0080808s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440868042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03862.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSTEPPUHN, ANKE10aSilencing jasmonate signalling and jasmonate-mediated defences reveals different survival strategies between two Nicotiana attenuata accessions  ap. 3717-3732.  aPublisher supplied data  aTo determine the impact of genotypic variation in secondary metabolite production on antiherbivore resistance and plant fitness, we genetically silenced biosynthetic genes for nicotine, trypsin proteinase inhibitors (TPI), and jasmonate (JA) production in two accessions of Nicotiana attenuata: one from Utah (UT) which responds to herbivory with JA-induced nicotine and TPI production, and one from Arizona (AZ) which is TPI-deficient but also produces JA-induced nicotine. Transient silencing of JA biosynthesis increased Manduca sexta larval growth on wild type (WT) plants of both accessions, but not on TPI-deficient UT or nicotine-deficient AZ lines, demonstrating that JA-mediated resistance to M. sexta requires TPIs in the UT and nicotine in the naturally TPI-deficient AZ accession. When transplanted into a native UT population, AZ and UT plants, rendered equally able or unable to produce nicotine and TPIs by stable transformation, received significantly different levels of herbivory. Both accessions differed in their resistance depending on the type of herbivores: resistance to rare, voracious herbivores (Saltatoria and Mammalia) was greater in AZ than UT lines, and dependent on nicotine production, while resistance to small, abundant herbivores (Coleoptera and Thysanoptera) was greater in UT lines, and dependent on TPI production. AZ lines produced more flowers and seed capsules than UT lines independently of TPI production costs. This fitness advantage was lost when accessions did not produce nicotine. We conclude that these two accessions have developed different survival strategies and thus differ in the cost-benefit functions of their JA-mediated defences. 3anicotine 3asecondary metabolites 0acosts of defences 0agenotypic plasticity 0aplant defence 0atrypsin proteinase inhibitors1 aSCHUMAN, MEREDITH C.1 aBaldwin, Ian T.0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Aug., v. 17, no. 16 p.3717-3732dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03862.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02949naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245014900190300001800339520111100357650002201468650001301490650001501503650002701518650002301545650002201568650002001590650002501610650001401635650001201649650002101661650001201682650001801694650001401712650001401726650002201740650002501762650002701787650002701814650002301841650002401864651001801888653002401906653002701930700002301957700001701980700002201997700002302019700002302042700002002065773011702085852000902202856009202211930003302303946001102336655001202347IND4408679720221117000145.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440867972DNAL7 a186438832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03868.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBARR, KELLY R.10aPopulation structure in an endangered songbird: maintenance of genetic differentiation despite high vagility and significant population recovery  ap. 3628-3639.  aBlack-capped vireos (Vireo atricapilla), an endangered, migratory species dependent upon early successional habitat, have experienced significant recovery since its protection. In light of its vagility and known increase in population size and range, limited genetic differentiation would be expected in the species. Using 15 microsatellite loci and an extensive sampling regime, we detected significant overall genetic differentiation (FST = 0.021) and high interpopulation differentiation compared to other migratory birds. Although proximate sites (separated by < 20 km) tended to be genetically similar, there was no apparent association of either geographical distance or landscape attributes with differentiation between sites. Evidence of a population bottleneck was also detected in a site located near other large concentrations of birds. Although black-capped vireos are capable of large-scale movements and the population has experienced a recent expansion, dispersal appears too insufficient to eliminate the genetic differentiation resulting from restricted colonization of ephemeral habitats. 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amigratory behavior 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3asongbirds 2aAlleles 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aDNAxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPopulation Density 2aSongbirdsxgenetics 0aUnited States 0ablack-capped vireos 0arecovering populations1 aLindsay, Denise L.1 aATHREY, GIRI1 aLANCE, RICHARD F.1 aHAYDEN, TIMOTHY J.1 aTWEDDALE, SCOTT A.1 aLEBERG, PAUL L.0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Aug., v. 17, no. 16 p.3628-3639dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03868.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02983naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245011800192300001600310520102900326650001701355650000801372650003101380650001701411650001001428650002501438650001401463650000901477650002701486650001801513650002601531650001601557650001601573650002901589650005001618650002201668650002801690650003001718650003301748650004201781650003001823650002501853650002701878653002801905653003401933653003601967653002902003700002302032700002002055700001902075700002002094773011002114852000902224856009202233930003302325946001102358655001202369IND4408678420221116235508.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440867842DNAL7 a184358252pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03529.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazama, Tomohiko10aSuppression mechanism of mitochondrial ORF79 accumulation by Rf1 protein in BT-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice  ap. 619-628.  aIn BT-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice (Oryza sativa L.) with Chinsurah Boro II cytoplasm, cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is caused by an accumulation of the cytotoxic peptide ORF79. The ORF79 protein is expressed from a dicistronic gene atp6-orf79, which exists in addition to the normal atp6 gene in the BT-type mitochondrial genome. The CMS is restored by a PPR (pentatricopeptide-repeat) gene, Rf1, via RNA processing. However, it has not yet been elucidated how the accumulation of ORF79 is reduced by the action of the Rf1 protein. Here, we report that the level of processed orf79 transcripts in the restorer line was reduced to 50% of the unprocessed atp6-orf79 transcripts in the CMS line. Ninety percent of the processed orf79 transcripts, which remained after degradation, were not associated with the ribosome for translation. Our data suggests that the processing of atp6-orf79 transcripts diminishes the expression of orf79 by the translational reduction and degradation of the processed orf79 transcripts. 3aOryza sativa 3aRNA 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3acytotoxicity 3agenes 3amitochondrial genome 3aribosomes 3arice 3atranslation (genetics) 2aBase Sequence 2aCytoplasmxmetabolism 2aDNA Primers 2aInfertility 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aOryzaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0afertility restorer gene 0amitochondrial gene expression 0apost-transcriptional regulation 0atranslational regulation1 aNakamura, Takahiro1 aWatanabe, Masao1 aSugita, Mamoru1 aToriyama, Kinya0 tPlant journal.g2008 Aug., v. 55, no. 4 p.619-628dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03529.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03758naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111024002200153040001800175100001700193245008100210300001600291506007600307520166000383506003702043650001602080650004702096650001402143650001002157650001102167650001402178650001602192650002102208650000902229650003102238650002202269650001802291650001002309650002402319650005902343650002302402650003802425650003502463650004102498650003102539650002802570650004202598650003002640650003302670650002302703650002702726650003602753653000702789653000702796653000902803653000802812700002102820773011002841852000902951856009202960930003303052946001103085655001203096IND4408677820221207074307.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440867782DNAL7 a184334372pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03526.x2doi7 aPMC47397432pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chengxia10aWheat FT protein regulates VRN1 transcription through interactions with FDL2  ap. 543-554.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA precise regulation of flowering time is central to plant species survival. Therefore, mechanisms have evolved in plants to integrate various environmental cues to optimize flowering time. In this study, we show that the product of the wheat gene TaFT, which integrates photoperiod and vernalization signals promoting flowering, interacts with bZIP proteins TaFDL2 and TaFDL6. We also show that TaFDL2 can interact in vitro with five ACGT elements in the promoter of the meristem identity gene VRN1, suggesting that TaFDL2 is a functional homologue of Arabidopsis FD. No direct interactions between the TaFT protein and the VRN1 promoter were detected. Transgenic wheat plants over-expressing TaFT showed parallel increases in VRN1 transcripts, suggesting that TaFT provides transcriptional activation of VRN1, possibly through interactions with the TaFDL2 protein. The same transgenic plants also showed increased transcript levels of TaFT2 (a TaFT paralogue), indicating that TaFT2 acts downstream of TaFT. The fact that TaFT2 interacts with another bZIP protein TaFDL13, which lacks the ability to interact with the VRN1 promoter, suggests that TaFT and TaFT2 have different gene targets. This observation agrees with the functional divergence observed for the TaFT and TaFT2 orthologous genes in rice. The temperate cereals analyzed so far show VRN1 transcripts in the leaves, a characteristic not observed in Arabidopsis or rice. The high levels of TaFDL2 transcripts observed in wheat leaves provide a simple explanation for this difference. We present a hypothesis to explain the conservation of VRN1 expression in the leaves of temperate cereals.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3abasic-leucine zipper transcription factors 3aflowering 3agenes 3aleaves 3ameristems 3aphotoperiod 3apromoter regions 3arice 3atranscriptional activation 3atransgenic plants 3avernalization 3awheat 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBasic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factorsxmetabolism 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aFarnesyltranstransferasexmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRepressor Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTriticumxenzymologyxgenetics. 0aFT 0aFD 0aVRN1 0aAP11 aDubcovsky, Jorge0 tPlant journal.g2008 Aug., v. 55, no. 4 p.543-554dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03526.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02414naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001800193245006900211300001400280520095100294650001301245650001201258650003801270650003001308650004101338650006501379650001101444650003801455650000901493650004601502650004401548650003601592653001501628653002401643653001401667653002501681773011701706852000901823856009201832930003301924946001101957655001201968IND4408653920221116235911.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440865392DNAL7 a187599212pmid7 aPMC25872432pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00660.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Eric O.10aNegative signaling by inhibitory receptors: the NK cell paradigm  ap. 70-84.  aReceptors carrying immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic tail control a vast array of cellular responses, ranging from autoimmunity, allergy, phagocytosis of red blood cells, graft versus host disease, to even neuronal plasticity in the brain. The inhibitory function of many receptors has been deduced on the basis of cytoplasmic ITIM sequences. Tight regulation of natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and cytokine production by inhibitory receptors specific for major histocompatibility complex class I molecules has served as a model system to study the negative signaling pathway triggered by an ITIM-containing receptor in the physiological context of NK-target cell interactions. Advances in our understanding of the molecular details of inhibitory signaling in NK cells have provided a conceptual framework to address how ITIM-mediated regulation controls cellular reactivity in diverse cell types. 3aimmunity 2aAnimals 2aCytoskeletal Proteinsximmunology 2aCytotoxicity, Immunologic 2aFeedback, Physiologicalximmunology. 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class Iximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aKiller Cells, Naturalxmetabolism 2aMice 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-vavximmunology 2aReceptors, KIRximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transductionximmunology 0ainhibition 0anatural killer cell 0asignaling 0atyrosine phosphatase0 tImmunological reviews.g2008 Aug., v. 224, no. 1 p.70-84dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00660.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02607naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245012000168300001600288520136000304650002201664650001501686650001601701650001801717650001301735650000901748650001401757650001201771650001301783650002001796650001301816653001701829653001301846700001901859700001901878700001801897773012501915852000902040856009202049930003302141946001102174655001202185IND4408669020221116235630.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440866902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01586.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOSOYA, Sho10aIndividual variations in behavior and free cortisol responses to acute stress in tiger pufferfish Takifugu rubripes  ap. 755-763.  aThe aim of the present study was for individual variation in behavior to be characterized and related to differences in physiological stress responses in juvenile tiger pufferfish (fugu) Takifugu rubripes. A set of siblings (n = 330) from wild parents was subjected to behavior tests, and some were classified into active and inactive groups (n = 42 each group). The active animals consisted of those individuals that kept active swimming during 6 min after transfer from one tank to another, and the inactive animals were those that stopped swimming within 6 min. Time-course acute stress responses, which were elicited by anesthesia and subsequent removal of a pectoral fin, were compared between the active and inactive fish. The stress indicators used were free and total plasma cortisol, and plasma glucose. Although no significant difference was observed at each sampling point between groups, the inactive fish required shorter recovery time from acute stress in all three indicators than the active fish. The percentage of free to total plasma cortisol in the pre-stress condition was significantly lower in the inactive group than in the active group. Our findings indicate that fugu has behavioral variation that is associated with stress responsiveness. The inactive fish are expected to be more tolerant of stress and suitable for aquaculture. 3aTakifugu rubripes 3aanesthesia 3aaquaculture 3ablood glucose 3acortisol 3afish 3ajuveniles 3aparents 3asiblings 3astress response 3aswimming 0aacute stress 0ahandling1 aKANEKO, Toyoji1 aSUZUKI, Yuzuru1 aHINO, Akinori0 tFisheries science.g2008 Aug., v. 74, no. 4 p.755-763dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0919-92687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01586.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100907b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03255naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245013600168300001600304520178700320650002602107650004302133650001302176650001502189650001502204650002102219650002202240650001602262650001102278650002702289650003102316650000902347651001002356653002002366653002702386700001502413700001502428700001502443700001402458700001302472700001402485773012902499852000902628856009202637930003302729946001102762655001202773IND4408672520221117000211.0080808e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440867252DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01387.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Y.-L.10aGenetic Diversity of Rice False Smut Fungus, Ustilaginoidea virens and its Pronounced Differentiation of Populations in North China  ap. 559-564.  aRice false smut caused by Ustilaginoidea virens is an important constraint affecting rice yield and quality in Asia. In China, rice false smut is especially severe in the japonica rice-growing areas in the North China. Nothing is known neither about the diversity of the pathogen in this region nor about the characteristic of its local population. In this study, 110 U. virens isolates sampled from Liaoning and Beijing of North China were analysed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to primarily understand the genetic diversity of this pathogen and its population characteristics. At the genetic distance of 0.32, all isolates were divided into two groups. Group A consists of two subgroups differentiated at the genetic distance of 0.55, subgroup 1 included all isolates from Liaoning with an average genetic similarity over 0.82 and subgroup 2 included 27 isolates from Beijing with similarity of 0.74. Group B consists of 28 isolates from Beijing having a diversity of 0.054. The isolates from the Liaoning province, where rice false smut has generated different take-all epidemic for 20 years, showed a genetic diversity of 0.305, which was approximately equally distributed within and among populations. Whereas genetic diversity was 0.458 among isolates from Beijing, an extremely high level of genetic differentiation among 55 isolates was observed in this disease hotspot. Our results suggested that the populations among different locations where sexual stage of the pathogen was rare to be found within ecological region were similar, and the variation of this pathogen has mainly arisen via asexual mechanisms. The migration through human activities in breeding perhaps provides a means of transporting the pathogen from one region to another. 3aUstilaginoidea virens 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abreeding 3aecoregions 3afalse smut 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3ahumans 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apopulation characteristics 3arice 3aChina 0arice false smut 0aUsitilaginoidea virens1 aPan, Y.-J.1 aXie, X.-W.1 aZhu, L.-H.1 aXu, J.-L.1 aWang, S.1 aLi, Z.-K.0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2008 Sept., v. 156, no. 9 p.559-564dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2008.01387.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01872naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001400135245006900149300001800218500002300236520091800259650001001177650002201187653002601209653002401235653002801259700002101287773009701308852000901405856007501414930003301489945001301522946001101535655001201546IND2039893320221116235421.0940527e199306  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203989332DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeide, B.10aSelection of site trees: the combined method and its application  ap. 1019-1025.  aSummary in French.  aA new method is proposed for the selection of site trees. It is a combination of the two oldest and best-known methods: the fixed number and the fixed proportion methods. The fact that both methods have survived the trial of time suggests that neither is superior. The presented analysis shows that both methods are biased and that the biases are of opposite sign. Therefore, their estimates, when taken together, could produce an accurate site index. Weights needed to generate an unbiased estimate were calculated using permanent plots established in jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) stands in Ontario. For this species, weights were found to be constant and almost equal. In general, it is likely that weights vary with species tolerance. A practical guide to applications of the combined method for the construction of site index curves, estimation of site index, and preparation of yield tables is provided. 3atrees 3aselection methods 0asite class assessment 0afixed number method 0afixed proportion method1 aZakrzewski, W.T.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.1019-1025x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-1303Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02977naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245012400152300001800276500002300294500001500317520180700332650001802139650001802157650002202175650000902197650001302206650002802219650001102247651003002258653002302288653001002311700001902321773009802340852000902438856007502447930003302522945001302555946001102568655001202579IND2036791220221116235635.0940115e199309  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203679122DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-2422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewton, P.F.10aAboveground dry matter partitioning, size variation, and competitive processes within second-growth black spruce stands  ap. 1917-1929.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThree density-stressed black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) populations that naturally regenerated following harvesting in 1970 were selected for study within central insular Newfoundland. Employing historical tree and stand reconstruction techniques, bark, stem, branch, foliage, and total mass distributions were estimated by age-class. Regression analysis was used to assess the effect of density stress on distributional indices, and stepwise multivariate analysis of variance was used to investigate dry matter partitioning patterns. Bark and foliar mass proportions increased with increasing density stress, whereas stem and branch mass proportions declined. Among components, decreased stem proportions best expressed the effects of increasing density stress on dry matter partitioning. Asymmetry within the mass frequency distributions for bark, branch, and foliar components shifted from negative skewness at low relative densities to positive values at high relative densities. Inequality (mass concentration) within the stem mass frequency distributions remained constant, whereas inequality within the bark mass frequency distribution declined in direct proportion to increasing density stress. Inequality within both the branch and foliar mass distributions had curvilinear relationships with increasing density stress: inequality increased from low to intermediate levels of density stress, but declined thereafter. Specific leaf areas did not differ among trees of varying size, suggesting that competition for light may not have been of consequence within the sampled stands. The results are consistent with a resource depletion competitive process, implying that competition within the dense second-growth black spruce stands may have been principally for belowground resources. 3aPicea mariana 3astand density 3aplant competition 3abark 3abranches 3adry matter partitioning 3aleaves 3aNewfoundland and Labrador 0aresource depletion 0astems1 aJolliffe, P.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1917-1929x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-2423Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02072naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245007600151300001800227500002300245500001500268520103200283650001601315650002101331650001701352653001401369653001601383653001401399653002601413700001501439773011501454852000901569856007501578930003301653945001301686946001101699655001201710IND2036790920221117000257.0940115e199309  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203679092DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-2392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodge, G.R.10aFreezing stress tolerance of hardy and tender families of loblolly pine  ap. 1892-1899.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe freezing behavior of shoot tips of cold-acclimated loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) from four half-sib families varying in hardiness were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Freeze dehydration strain was measured both as the fraction of freezable water frozen (FWF), and contraction strain index (CSI), and differences in hardiness of hardy and tender families were partitioned into differences in strain avoidance and strain tolerance. If dehydration strain is measured as FWF, differences between hardy and tender loblolly families could be explained almost completely as differences in strain tolerance. If dehydration strain is measured as CSI, strain tolerance accounts for a large percentage (greater than or equal to 60%) of the difference in hardiness, although avoidance may also play a role. Hardy families keep a larger fraction of their total cell water in a bound or osmotically inactive state, thus incurring less cell contraction associated with losing cell water volume to freeze dehydration. 3aPinus taeda 3afrost resistance 3awater stress 0atolerance 0aintolerance 0ahardiness 0abiological resistance1 aWeir, R.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1892-1899wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-2393Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02202naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001400135245008500149300001800234500002300252520111800275650001901393650001101412650001201423650001901435650001801454650001401472650002401486650001401510653001601524700001701540700002001557773009801577852000901675856007501684930003301759945001301792946001101805655001201816IND2036791120221116235541.0940115e199309  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203679112DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-2412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlygh, G.10aInduction, rooting, and growth capacity of adventitious shoots of Pinus contorta  ap. 1907-1916.  aSummary in French.  aZygotic embryos of Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. developed adventitious buds after a pulse treatment with 250 micromolar benzyladenine for 2 h. The number of embryos forming adventitious buds, as well as the number of adventitious buds per embryo, depended on the length of time after pulse treatment before the embryos were transferred to fresh medium. Adventitious shoots pulse-treated with 1.23 mM indole-3-butyric acid for 6 h started to develop roots within 3 weeks and after 3 months 75% of the shoots had developed roots. Roots usually emerged from vascular tissue that was connected to the vascular cylinder in the stem. However, roots could also be initiated directly from the vascular cylinder in the stem. The average relative growth rate per day for plantlets was 5.9% compared with 9.3% for seedlings. However, there was a correlation between the initial weight of the plantlets and their relative growth rate per day. Thus, plantlets classed in the group with highest initial fresh weight had a relative growth rate of 7.3%. Differences in growth rate between plantlets and seedlings are discussed. 3aPinus contorta 3ashoots 3arooting 3aembryo (plant) 3abenzyladenine 3aseedlings 3aindole butyric acid 3aplantlets 0agrowth rate1 aGronroos, R.1 aArnold, S. von.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1907-1916x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-2413Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02460naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245010100152300001800253500002300271500001500294520134100309650001501650650001301665650001301678650002201691653002701713653002601740653002501766653001301791700001601804700001501820773009801835852000901933856007501942930003302017945001302050946001102063655001202074IND2036790620221117000156.0940115e199309  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203679062DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-2372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, J.D.10aDetermining the effects of harvesting guidelines on the age-class profile of the residual forest  ap. 1870-1880.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aChromatic scheduling was used to demonstrate that harvest unit adjacency constraints can be translated into age-class profile constraints that are suitable for regulating the rate of harvest in strategic forest planning models. The advantage of the age-class approach is that strategic harvest rates will reflect the spatial constraints without the onerous task of designing and scheduling cut blocks for the entire forest. Other factors that are relevant to determining the steady-state age-class profile are the exclusion period and the width of the leave strip between any two harvest units. Through the analysis of four spatial data sets it was observed that the chromatic number decreases as the block size increases-, however, the absolute block size was not a factor. The controlling factor is the underlying block pattern (maximum number of adjacent units and the number of units sharing a common boundary point). When high chromatic numbers are combined with long exclusions periods the results are long rotations and reduced periodic harvests. There is a wide range in the number and timing of harvest entries and the resulting age-class structures that are spatially feasible. This suggests that resource policy makers should think in terms of the desired residual forest structure prior to prescribing harvesting guidelines. 3aharvesting 3aplanning 3atree age 3aforest management 0aharvesting constraints 0aadjacency constraints 0achromatic scheduling 0aforestry1 aShannon, T.1 aErrico, D.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1870-1880x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-2373Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle03649naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245011900153300001800272500002300290500001500313520231600328650001202644650001302656650001902669650001302688650002202701650002602723650002302749650001102772650002402783650001902807650001202826650002502838653002102863653004302884653001102927700001402938773009802952852000903050856007503059930003303134945001303167946001103180655001203191IND2036790320221116235707.0940115e199309  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203679032DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-2362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeilman, P.E.10aInfluence of nitrogen on growth and productivity of short-rotation Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides hybrids  ap. 1863-1869.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe nitrogen fertilization response of six generally unrelated Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray X Populus deltoides Marsh. hybrids was examined. The nitrogen-treated trees received a total of 500 kg N.ha-1 in three equal applications at the beginning of the second, third, and fourth growing seasons. Annual growth in height and diameter were significantly increased by nitrogen only in the third growing season. Mean stem dimensions and productivity after four growing seasons for fertilized and control plots, respectively, were as follows: total height, 13.2 vs. 12.6 m; DBH, 11.2 vs. 10.1 cm; total basal area, 20.1 vs. 16.6 M2.ha-1; mean annual volume growth (inside bark). 22.2 vs. 18.4 m3.ha-1.year-1; and mean annual woody biomass production (above ground), 25.3 vs. 20.9 Mg.ha-1.year-1. Nitrogen increased yield at the end of 4 years by 21%. All values were significantly different according to analysis of variance except total height. Based on the lack of fertilizer response in the fourth year, two annual applications of nitrogen in the second and third growing seasons may have been enough to obtain the measured growth response. Competition among trees at the relatively close spacing may have limited the ability of these very fast growing trees to respond to the third nitrogen application. Nitrogen appeared to shorten the time required to reach culmination of periodic annual increment. At the wider spacing now recommended for these plantations (40% greater than used in this study), the culmination of periodic annual increment would be delayed and nitrogen responses may be of longer duration. Clones differed significantly from each other in all measures of growth except annual height growth, but generally, the clones responded similarly to nitrogen since the clone X nitrogen interactions were no significant for most of the parameters studied. Despite similar response to nitrogen treatment, the clones appear to differ in efficiency of nitrogen use efficiency. The three most productive clones produced more without added nitrogen than the three least productive did with added nitrogen. Consequently, the top three clones appear to be more efficient in using nitrogen (and other needs supplied by the site) even though the top clones also responded positively to increased nitrogen. 3ahybrids 3adiameter 3aalluvial soils 3anitrogen 3aPopulus deltoides 3aplant characteristics 3abiomass production 3aheight 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3anitrogen fertilizers 0afoliar nutrition 0aPopulus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa 0agrowth1 aXie, F.G.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1863-1869x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-2363Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02363naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245010800153300001800261500002300279520129200302650001801594650001701612650002901629650002101658650001001679650001401689650001401703651001101717700001801728773011401746852000901860856007501869930003301944945001301977946001101990655001202001IND2040191320221116235810.0940609e199306  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204019132DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-1532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, E.A.10aWildfires in the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains and their relationship to mid-tropospheric anomalies  ap. 1213-1222.  aSummary in French.  aIn this paper we present evidence for a large-scale (synoptic-scale) meteorological mechanism controlling the fire frequency in the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains. This large-scale control may explain the similarity in average fire frequencies and timing of change in average fire frequencies for the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains. Over the last 86 years the size distribution of fires (annual area burned) in the southern Canadian Rockies was distinctly bimodal, with a separation between small- and large-fire years at approximately 10-25 ha annual area burned. During the last 35 years, large-fire years had significantly lower fuel moisture conditions and many mid-tropospheric surface-blocking events (high-pressure upper level ridges) during July and August (the period of greatest fire activity). Small-fire years in this period exhibited significantly higher fuel moisture conditions and fewer persistent mid-tropospheric surface-blocking events during July and August. Mid-tropospheric surface-blocking events during large-fire years were teleconnected (spatially and temporally correlated in 50 kPa heights) to upper level troughs in the North Pacific and eastern North America. This relationship takes the form of the positive mode of the Pacific North America pattern. 3awater content 3aforest fires 3awildland fire management 3aclimatic factors 3afuels 3amountains 3afrequency 3aCanada1 aWowchuk, D.R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.1213-1222wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-1533Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle01867naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245004700153300001800200500002300218520078000241650001701021650001801038650002401056650003701080650002201117650001901139653001301158653001701171653002201188653001301210653002001223773009701243852000901340856007501349930003301424945001301457946001101470655001201481IND2039899720221116235548.0940527e199306  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203989972DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagnussen, S.10aDesign and analysis of tree genetic trials  ap. 1144-1149.  aSummary in French.  aMany current tree genetic trials are only suited for a general purpose ranking of genetic entries on a single site. Variance components and genetic estimates from trials with damaged trees, outliers, competition, and microsite effects will often be seriously inflated and have large standard errors. Most trials will encounter one or more of these problems. New robust techniques, spatial analysis, and inclusion of covariates may ameliorate the analysis situation somewhat, but a more rigorous definition of objectives and hypotheses are needed in the design phase to produce results that can prove the value of tree improvement efforts. A better understanding of the deployment "environment" is a prerequisite for more biologically oriented genotype X environment analyses. 3aforest trees 3atree breeding 3aexperimental design 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aplant competition 3aabiotic stress 0ainjuries 0asite factors 0amicrosite factors 0aoutliers 0abiotic injuries0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.1144-1149x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-1453Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02726naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245012700154300001800281500002300299500001500322520133200337650002201669650001101691650001601702650001301718650001301731650001201744650001801756650002301774650001201797650001401809650001301823650001901836650001401855650001101869650001301880651001201893653002101905653002001926700001701946700001901963773009701982852000902079856007502088930003302163945001302196946001102209655001202220IND2039899320221117000401.0940527e199306  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203989932DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCappellato, R.10aAcidic atmospheric deposition and canopy interactions of adjacent deciduous and coniferous forests in the Georgia Piedmont  ap. 1114-1124.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of acidic atmospheric deposition on leaching of base cations from the canopy and the origin of the major ions in throughfall and stemflow were evaluated in a 2-year study of adjacent deciduous and coniferous forests at Panola Mountain Research Watershed in the Georgia Piedmont. In each forest, the NO3- and SO4 2- in throughfall and stemflow were derived primarily from atmospheric deposition, whereas the base cations Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ were derived primarily from canopy leaching. Acidic atmospheric deposition was partially neutralized in each forest. Exchange of H+ with base cations appeared to be the major mechanism for the neutralization of atmospheric acidity by the deciduous canopy. Major neutralization mechanisms could not be differentiated in the coniferous canopy. Base-cation leaching accounted for 86% of the base cations in throughfall and stemflow in the deciduous forest and 69% in the coniferous forest. Exchange with H+ accounted for about 30% of base cations in throughfall in the deciduous forest, whereas it could not be clearly estimated in coniferous throughfall. The current level of acidic atmospheric deposition is hypothesized to have caused an increased leaching of base cations of the deciduous canopy, but methods were insufficient to determine its effect on the coniferous canopy. 3adeciduous forests 3acanopy 3athroughfall 3astemflow 3asulfates 3acalcium 3ahydrogen ions 3aconiferous forests 3acations 3amagnesium 3aleaching 3adry deposition 3apotassium 3asodium 3anitrates 3aGeorgia 0afoliar nutrition 0aacid deposition1 aPeters, N.E.1 aRagsdale, H.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.1114-1124x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-1423Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02306naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245008000154300001800234500002300252520131200275650002901587650001701616650001801633650001501651650001501666650001501681700001701696773011401713852000901827856007501836930003301911945001301944946001101957655001201968IND2039894920221117000049.0940527e199306  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203989492DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAlpine, R.S.14aThe use of fractal dimension to improve wildland fire perimeter predictions  ap. 1073-1077.  aSummary in French.  aFire managers currently use simple elliptical models to predict the perimeter of a fire when the fire starts from a single point. However, when examined closely wildland fire perimeters are highly irregular. We tested the hypothesis that a fire is actually fractal in nature and thus the true length of a fire perimeter depends on the amount of fine-edge detail included in the measurement. The amount of perimeter detail incorporated is dependent on the length of the base unit of measurement; the longer the unit, the less the perimeter detail, and the shorter the perimeter. Different forest fire suppression techniques have inherent scale characteristics that are associated with different base unit measurements of perimeter; therefore, the length of the fire perimeter is dependent on the suppression technique used. Analysis of 14 forest-fire perimeters yielded a consistent fractal dimension of 1.15, and a relationship was found to adjust predicted fire perimeter with this fractal dimension for a specific unit measurement length. The fractal length of fire fronts between two identifiable points can also be calculated given the base unit measurement of the suppression technique. This information should improve fire managers' ability to optimally dispatch suppression resources to forest fires. 3awildland fire management 3aforest fires 3afire fighting 3aprediction 3adimensions 3afire break1 aWotton, B.M.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.1073-1077wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-1373Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle01676naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245006800152300001800220500002300238520060200261650001700863650001700880650001000897650002100907650001500928650001900943650001700962650001700979653002000996700001901016700001701035773009701052852000901149856007501158930003301233945001301266946001101279655001201290IND2036761620221117000348.0940113e199307  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203676162DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-1692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRangen, S.A.10aPalatability of Anispray-treated white spruce to snowshoe hares  ap. 1321-1324.  aSummary in French.  aAnispray, a foliar spray, is a relatively new chemical product used to deter herbivore browsing.

Glucose concentration in the culture broth also became very low after the initiation of continuous fermentation. A new control system for delivering fresh substrate into the fermentor is discussed that solves the problems of low dilution rate and low residual glucose. This new system involves linking the feeding of fresh substrate into the fermentor with the outflow of alkali (NaOH) from the alkali reservoir by monitoring weight changes of the two solutions. Dilution rates of about 0.33 h-1 and productivity values of about 11.00 g.l-h-1 could be achieved with this method, while maintaining the concentration of ethanol in the fermentor at about 33.00 g.l-1 when the ratio (alpha) of weight of glucose fed into the fermentor to the unit weight of alkali used in neutralizing acid produced in the broth was 25.00. 3aBiological Sciences1 aIshizaki, A.1 aShimizu, K.0 tFuels and chemicals from biomass.dWashington, DC : American Chemical Society, c1997.7nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02200naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245013500152300001800287500002300305520108000328650001801408650002101426650001701447650001801464650001101482650002001493651001001513653002201523653002401545700001801569773009801587852000901685856007501694930003301769945001301802946001101815655001201826IND2036789320221116235818.0940115e199309  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203678932DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-2282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFajvan, M.A.10aCanopy stratification, age structure, and development of multicohort stands of eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, and red spruce  ap. 1799-1809.  aSummary in French.  aThe causes of canopy stratification were investigated in five mixed stands of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.), hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.), and white pine (Pinus strobus L.) in eastern Maine. All species were present in all crown classes; however, there was a clear pattern of pine dominance and eventual emergence. Red spruce was prevalent in the middle stratum, and hemlock most common in the lower strata. Canopy stratification was caused by interspecific differences in shade tolerance and height growth, and by multicohort structures. The multicohort structures developed as a result of episodic partial disturbances such as spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens) outbreaks and partial harvesting that both initiated regeneration and released previously suppressed trees of older, surviving cohorts. Spatial and temporal variability in disturbances created extremely variable patterns of competition among cohorts, resulting in a more complex developmental pattern than would be found in a single-cohort model involving stand-replacing disturbances. 3aPinus strobus 3aTsuga canadensis 3aPicea rubens 3amixed forests 3acanopy 3astand structure 3aMaine 0astand development 0acohort distribution1 aSeymour, R.S.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1799-1809x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-2283Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02412naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245010800154300001800262500002300280500001500303520124800318650001001566650002001576650002101596650001501617650001801632650002101650651001301671653001101684653001601695653001501711700001801726700001901744773009801763852000901861856007501870930003301945945001301978946001101991655001202002IND2036788620221117000248.0940115e199309  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203678862DNAL7 a10.1139/x93-2212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, D.L.10aEffects of ozone and climate on ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) growth in the Colorado Rocky Mountains  ap. 1750-1759.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aLong-term radial growth trends of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum) were studied in second-growth stands in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains to determine if there has been any impact from oxidant air pollution. Although ozone concentrations are relatively high at some locations, visible pollutant injury was not found in any trees. Time series of basal area increments are generally homogeneous within stands. Concurrent periods of increasing and decreasing growth can be found in stands throughout the Front Range, which indicates that there are temporal growth trends at the regional level. Most of these trends appear to be related to the effects of stand dynamics and climate. Correlation analysis with climatic variables indicates that soil moisture supply is the dominant factor controlling interannual variation of basal area growth. Palmer hydrological drought index is highly correlated (positively) with growth during the summer months-. total precipitation in spring is positively correlated with growth, and mean temperature in spring is negatively correlated with growth. There are no recent changes in growth trends that might be associated with elevated levels of ambient ozone in the Front Range. 3aozone 3aPinus ponderosa 3astand basal area 3asoil water 3aair pollution 3aclimatic factors 3aColorado 0atrends 0agrowth rate 0abasal area1 aArbaugh, M.J.1 aRobinson, L.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1993 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.1750-1759x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-2213Available from publisher's Web site  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02985naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245013300208300001600341500002400357506007600381520156700457506003702024650001602061650001502077650000902092650001102101650002202112650001302134650001502147650001802162650000902180650001502189650002002204650001702224650003902241650002002280650002102300700001402321700001802335773010502353852000902458856004802467655001202515IND4399402920221207073925.0071226e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439940292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-007-9257-52doi7 aPMC21400922pmcid7 a180343142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu-Sato, Sae10aPsRBR1 encodes a pea retinoblastoma-related protein that is phosphorylated in axillary buds during dormancy-to-growth transition  ap. 125-135.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn intact plants, cells in axillary buds are arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle during dormancy. In mammalian cells, the cell cycle is suppressed at the G1 phase by the activities of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB) family proteins, depending on their phosphorylation state. Here, we report the isolation of a pea cDNA clone encoding an RB-related protein (PsRBR1, Accession No. AB012024) with a high degree of amino acid conservation in comparison with RB family proteins. PsRBR1 protein was detected as two polypeptides using an anti-PsRBR1 antibody in dormant axillary buds, whereas it was detected as three polypeptides, which were the same two polypeptides and another larger polypeptide 2 h after terminal decapitation. Both in vitro-synthesized PsPRB1 protein and lambda protein phosphatase-treated PsRBR1 protein corresponded to the smallest polypeptide detected by anti-PsRBR1 antibody, suggesting that the three polypeptides correspond to non-phosphorylated form of PsRBR1 protein, and lower- and higher-molecular mass forms of phosphorylated PsRBR1 protein. Furthermore, in vivo labeling with [³²P]-inorganic phosphate indicated that PsRBR1 protein was more phosphorylated before mRNA accumulation of cell cycle regulatory genes such as PCNA. Together these findings suggest that dormancy-to-growth transition in pea axillary buds is regulated by molecular mechanisms of cell cycle control similar to those in mammals, and that the PsRBR1 protein has an important role in suppressing the cell cycle during dormancy in axillary buds.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3abuds 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3adormancy 3ainterphase 3amessenger RNA 3apeas 3aphosphates 3aphosphorylation 3apolypeptides 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aregulator genes 3asuppressor genes1 aIke, Yoko1 aMori, Hitoshi0 tPlant molecular biology.g2008 Jan., v. 66, no. 1-2 p.125-135dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-007-9257-5 7aarticle04765naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245012800172300001600300520316100316650001903477650001803496650002003514650001903534650001103553650002503564650001403589650002003603650002903623650001303652650002703665650002003692650001403712650002203726650001203748650001403760650002503774650001903799653001303818653001603831653001803847653001903865653002503884653002603909700002503935773013503960852000904095856008504104930003304189946001304222655001204235IND4411864520221116232602.0081025e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441186452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-007-9085-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuesemann, Michael H. 10aWill progress in science and technology avert or accelerate global collapse? A critical analysis and policy recommendations  ap. 787-825.  aIndustrial society will move towards collapse if its total environmental impact (I), expressed either in terms of energy and materials use or in terms of pollution, increases with time, i.e., dI/dt > 0. The traditional interpretation of the I = PAT equation reflects the optimistic belief that technological innovation, particularly improvements in eco-efficiency, will significantly reduce the technology (T) factor, and thereby result in a corresponding decline in impact (I). Unfortunately, this interpretation of the I = PAT equation ignores the effects of technological change on the other two factors: population (P) and per capita affluence (A). A more heuristic formulation of this equation is I = P(T)·A(T)·T in which the dependence of P and A on T is apparent. From historical evidence, it is clear that technological revolutions (tool-making, agricultural, and industrial) have been the primary driving forces behind successive population explosions, and that modern communication and transportation technologies have been employed to transform a large proportion of the world's inhabitants into consumers of material- and energy-intensive products and services. In addition, factor analysis from neoclassical growth theory and the rebound effect provide evidence that science and technology have played a key role in contributing to rising living standards. While technological change has thus contributed to significant increases in both P and A, it has at the same time brought about considerable eco-efficiency improvements. Unfortunately, reductions in the T-factor have generally not been sufficiently rapid to compensate for the simultaneous increases in both P and A. As a result, total impact, in terms of energy production, mineral extraction, land-use and CO₂ emissions, has in most cases increased with time, indicating that industrial society is nevertheless moving towards collapse. The belief that continued and even accelerated scientific research and technological innovation will automatically result in sustainability and avert collapse is at best mistaken. Innovations in science and technology will be necessary but alone will be insufficient for sustainability. Consequently, what is most needed are specific policies designed to decrease total impact, such as (a) halting population growth via effective population stabilization plans and better access to birth control methods, (b) reducing total matter-energy throughput and pollution by removing perverse subsidies, imposing regulations that limit waste discharges and the depletion of non-renewable resources, and implementing ecological tax reform, and (c) moving towards a steady-state economy in which per-capita affluence is stabilized at lower levels by replacing wasteful conspicuous material consumption with social alternatives known to enhance subjective well-being. While science and technology must play an important role in the implementation of these policies, none will be enacted without a fundamental change in society's dominant values of growth and exploitation. Thus, value change is the most important prerequisite for avoiding global collapse. 3acarbon dioxide 3acontraception 3acontrol methods 3aeco-efficiency 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aequations 3afactor analysis 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland use 3anonrenewable resources 3apolicy analysis 3apollution 3apopulation growth 3asociety 3asubsidies 3atechnological change 3atransportation 0aCollapse 0aConsumption 0aIPAT equation 0aRebound effect 0aSteady-state economy 0aSubjective well-being1 aHuesemann, Joyce A. 0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2008 Dec., v. 10, no. 6 p.787-825dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1387-585X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-007-9085-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20081026b20081101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03527naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100003100146245015900177300001800336520170000354650002202054650002702076650002202103650001602125650001702141650002002158650001302178650001202191650001102203650002102214650001202235650002302247650001202270650002802282650002802310650003102338650001702369650001102386650003102397650004702428650004902475650003202524650002302556650003802579650001702617650001102634653004502645700002402690700002502714700001902739773008702758852000902845930003302854945002502887946001302912655001202925IND4411843220221116231941.0081024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441184322DNAL7 a189397462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBarmpalia-Davis, Ioanna M.10aSurvival of Listeria monocytogenes in a Simulated Dynamic Gastrointestinal Model during Storage of Inoculated Bologna and Salami Slices in Vacuum Packages  ap. 2014-2023.  aListeria monocytogenes counts were determined during storage (82 days, 4°C) in vacuum packages of inoculated bologna and salami slices and after exposure to a simulated dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine. Variables controlled in the model included gastric emptying and gastrointestinal fluid secretion rates, gradual gastric acidification, and intestinal pH maintenance. L. monocytogenes populations increased on bologna and decreased on salami, reaching 8.7 and 1.4 log CFU/g, respectively, on day 82. Inactivation rates (IR) during gastric exposure of bologna and salami ranged from 0.079 (day 14) to 0.158 (day 57) log CFU/g/min and from 0.013 (day 42) to 0.051 (day 1) log CFU/g/min, respectively. On corresponding days, gastric IR for cells on salami were lower than on bologna, suggesting potential protective effects of the former product. However, it is also possible that the low initial L. monocytogenes levels reached with storage of salami (<=2.5 log CFU/g after day 27) may have resulted in slower reductions than in the high levels on bologna. Gradual decline of gastric pH allowed survival in the gastric compartment during the initial stages, which resulted in a large fraction of the cells being delivered into the intestinal compartment. Intestinal IR ranged from 0.003 to 0.048 (bologna) and from 0.002 to 0.056 (salami) log CFU/g/min throughout storage. Although findings indicated potential effects of salami against gastric killing of L. monocytogenes, any effects of the food matrix per se on the gastrointestinal survival of the pathogen were overwhelmed by the high and low contamination levels reached on bologna and salami, respectively, during storage. 3apathogen survival 3aListeria monocytogenes 3asimulation models 3afood safety 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3ainoculum 3abologna 3asalami 3avacuum packaging 3aslicing 3ain vitro digestion 2aAnimals 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFood Packagingxmethods 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aGastric Acid 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIntestine, Smallxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aModels, Biological 2aStomachxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aTime Factors 2aVacuum 0asimulated dynamic gastrointestinal model1 aGeornaras, Ifigenia1 aKendall, Patricia A.1 aSofos, John N.0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 Oct., v. 71, no. 10 p.2014-2023x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20081208b00000000c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/12/01  aOther US 7aarticle03655naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002000163245011200183300001800295520140400313650001401717650002801731650003001759650002301789650001801812650001701830650001001847650001401857650001801871650002201889650001901911650001701930650000901947650001301956650001301969650006801982650007902050650001202129650004802141650002702189650002802216650002702244650004202271650003302313650002202346650003402368650001302402650001102415650003902426650002602465650003202491650002402523650001402547651001102561651001102572653005002583700001702633700002402650700001802674700002302692700002702715773008702742852000902829930003302838945002502871946001302896655001202909IND4411845220221116232513.0081024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441184522DNAL7 a189397592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChang, Yu-Chang10aMultiplex PCR Detection of Enterotoxin Genes in Aeromonas spp. from Suspect Food Samples in Northern Taiwan  ap. 2094-2099.  aAeromonads possess an array of virulence factors and are causative agents of a number of human infections. Among them, genes of one cytotoxic (Act) and two cytotonic (Alt, Ast) enterotoxins are implicated in a human diarrheal disease. A rapid, specific, simultaneous detection of these enterotoxin genes in suspected food poisoning samples is not yet reported. Hence, a multiplex PCR assay was designed to amplify the cytotoxic (act), heat-labile cytotonic (alt), and heat-stable cytotonic (ast) enterotoxin genes of aeromonads. The PCR assay was tested with 133 Aeromonas spp. isolated from suspect food poisoning samples and retail samples of poultry and fish from wet markets in and around Taipei, Northern Taiwan. The Aeromonas spp. isolates were divided into six genotypes based on absence or presence of one or more enterotoxin genes. Of these 133 isolates, Aeromonas caviae (52.5%) and Aeromonas hydrophila (43.4%) were the most frequently isolated species from food poisoning samples and retail samples, respectively. Among the species, A. hydrophila had a significantly higher proportion for harboring three enterotoxin genes than had the others, whereas Aeromonas encheleia, considered a nonpathogen, was found harboring three enterotoxin genes. The multiplex PCR assays are rapid and specific, and provide a useful tool for the detection and genotyping of enterotoxin genes of aeromonads. 3adetection 3abacterial contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3afood contamination 3afood analysis 3aenterotoxins 3agenes 3aAeromonas 3arapid methods 3afoodborne illness 3afood pathogens 3apoultry meat 3afish 3aseafoods 3agenotype 2aAeromonasxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aAeromonas hydrophilaxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDiarrheaxmicrobiology 2aEnterotoxinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aGastroenteritisxmicrobiology 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSeafoodxmicrobiology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVirulence 3aTaiwan 0aTaiwan 0amultiplex polymerase chain reaction detection1 aWang, Jan-Yi1 aSelvam, Ammaiyappan1 aKao, Shu-Chen1 aYang, Shang-shyng.1 aShih, Daniel Yang-Chih0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 Oct., v. 71, no. 10 p.2094-2099x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20081208b00000000c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle01663naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100003100181245009700212300001800309500002400327506007600351520036200427506003700789650001200826650001900838650002500857650001100882650002000893650002300913650001800936700002100954700002100975700002300996700002201019773013501041852000901176856008001185655001201265IND4402291820221207060240.0080302e20080301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440229182DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02237-072doi7 aPMC22586192pmcid7 a181924312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilvestry-Rodriguez, Nadia10aSilver as a Residual Disinfectant To Prevent Biofilm Formation in Water Distribution Systems  ap. 1639-1641.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiofilms can have deleterious effects on drinking water quality and may harbor pathogens.

  1 aAl-Adhami, Batol H.10aRapid discrimination of Salmonella isolates by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis  ap. 1960-1966.  aA molecular typing technique was developed for the differentiation of Salmonella isolates based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of amplicons generated by PCR. Amplicons from parts of the fimA (both the 5' and 3' ends), mdh, invA, and atpD genes were generated separately from a panel of Salmonella strains representing Salmonella bongori, and four subspecies and 17 serovars of Salmonella enterica. These amplicons were subjected to SSCP analysis for differentiation of the salmonellae on the basis of different conformational forms arising due to nucleotide sequence variations in the target genes. Several distinct SSCP banding patterns (a maximum of 14 each for atpD and fimA 3' end) were observed with this panel of Salmonella strains for amplicons generated from each target gene. The best discrimination of Salmonella subspecies and serovar was achieved from the SSCP analysis of a combination of at least three gene targets: atpD, invA, and either mdh or fimA 3' end. This demonstrates the applicability of SSCP analysis as an important additional method to classical typing approaches for the differentiation of foodborne Salmonella isolates. SSCP is simple to perform and should be readily transferable to food microbiology laboratories with basic PCR capability. 3arapid methods 3amicrobial detection 3aSalmonella 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3asalmonellosis 3afood contamination 3abacterial contamination 3afood microbiology 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aGene Amplification 2aHumans 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational 2aSalmonellaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSalmonella entericaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSpecies Specificity 0amolecular typing1 aHuby-Chilton, Florence1 aBlais, Burton W.1 aMartinez-Perez, Amalia1 aChilton, Neil B.1 aGajadhar, Alvin A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2008 Oct., v. 71, no. 10 p.1960-1966x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20081208b00000000c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/12/01  aOther US 7aarticle03717naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001800181245012900199300001600328500001500344520172800359650001602087650001802103650001002121650001902131650001802150650001402168650002502182650001702207650002002224650001402244650001402258650000902272650002502281650002002306650002802326650002102354650001702375650001702392650001802409650003302427650001102460650001102471650003102482650002702513650002602540650001602566653001002582653002502592700002702617700002302644700002002667700002302687700001902710700002002729700002002749773008702769852000902856856008502865930003302950945002502983946001103008655001203019IND4411841620221116231752.0081024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441184162DNAL7 a182795562pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145089254592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To investigate how eating behaviours (cognitive dietary restraint, disinhibition and susceptibility to hunger) were associated with food and drink consumption, energy density and meal pattern in 112 healthy postmenopausal women (age 56·8 (sd 4·4) years) not on hormonal therapy. Women completed a 3 d weighed food record and filled out the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. The sample was divided according to the median of the distribution of cognitive dietary restraint and disinhibition (9 and 6 respectively). Both subgroups of women with high restraint level (presenting either high or low disinhibition) consumed a diet with a lower energy density than subgroups of women with lower restraint level. Women with high restraint-low disinhibition had a lower consumption of red meat and processed meat and a lower consumption of diet soft drinks than women with low restraint-high disinhibition. They were also characterised by a higher intake of whole grains than women with high restraint-high disinhibition and than women with lower restraint level (with either high or low disinhibition). Women with high restraint-high disinhibition levels showed differences in dietary variables when compared with subgroups of women with lower restraint level, namely for refined grains and diet soft drinks. We conclude that in healthy postmenopausal women, dietary consumption of specific food and drink may be related to particular eating behaviours. Women with high restraint and low disinhibition levels generally showed the most healthy dietary pattern. 3afood intake 3aeating habits 3awomen 3aenergy density 3ahealth status 3amenopause 3anutritional adequacy 3afood records 3abody mass index 3aingestion 3abeverages 2aAged 2aAppetitexphysiology 2aBody Mass Index 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aDietxpsychology 2aDiet Records 2aDiet Therapy 2aEnergy Intake 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInhibition, Psychological. 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aMenopausexpsychology 2aMiddle Aged 0afoods 0apostmenopausal women1 aProvencher, Véronique1 aPiché, Marie-Ève1 aLapointe, Annie1 aWeisnagel, S.

In green leaves, plant mitochondria are surrounded by ample respiratory substrates and abundant molecular oxygen, both resulting from active photosynthesis, while in roots and bulky rhizomes and fruit carbohydrates may be plenty, whereas oxygen levels are falling. Several enzymatic complexes in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) are capable of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation under physiological and pathological conditions. Inherently connected parameters such as the redox state of electron carriers in the ETC, ATP synthase activity and inner mitochondrial membrane potential, when affected by external stimuli, can give rise to ROS formation via complexes I and III, and by reverse electron transport (RET) from complex II. Superoxide radicals produced are quickly scavenged by superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and the resulting H₂O₂ is detoxified by peroxiredoxin-thioredoxin system or by the enzymes of ascorbate-glutathione cycle, found in the mitochondrial matrix. Arginine-dependent nitric oxide (NO)-releasing activity of enzymatic origin has been detected in plant mitochondria. The molecular identity of the enzyme is not clear but the involvement of mitochondria-localized enzymes responsible for arginine catabolism, arginase and ornithine aminotransferase has been shown in the regulation of NO efflux. Besides direct control by antioxidants, mitochondrial ROS production is tightly controlled by multiple redundant systems affecting inner membrane potential: NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenases, alternative oxidase (AOX), uncoupling proteins, ATP-sensitive K⁺ channel and a number of matrix and intermembrane enzymes capable of direct electron donation to ETC. NO removal, on the other hand, takes place either by reactions with molecular oxygen or superoxide resulting in peroxynitrite, nitrite or nitrate ions or through interaction with non-symbiotic hemoglobins or glutathione. Mitochondrial ROS and NO production is tightly controlled by multiple redundant systems providing the regulatory mechanism for redox homeostasis and specific ROS/NO signaling. 3acarrier state 3aelectrons 3areactive oxygen species 3aornithine 3amammals 3anitrites 3aroots 3anitrates 3aglutathione 3acarbohydrates 3aelectron transfer 3amitochondria 3ahomeostasis 3aphotosynthesis 3aoxygen 3aleaves 3aarginase 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aarginine 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aenzyme activity 3aretting 3afruits 3aions 3anitric oxide 3ahemoglobin 3arhizomes 3aelectron transport chain 3amembrane potential 2aElectron Transport Complex Ixmetabolism 2aElectron Transport Complex IIxmetabolism 2aElectron Transport Complex IIIxmetabolism 2aHomeostasis 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 0aantioxidants1 aFagerstedt, Kurt V.0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2010 Apr., v. 138, no. 4 p.447-462dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2009.01340.x 7aarticle01190naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245005700124300001600181300002100197520032000218650004200538650002200580650002000602650001200622650002500634650001100659650002100670651001100691653001300702653001100715773007300726852000900799939003300808946001100841655001200852IND9103255620221116232328.0910822e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910325562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolel, Z.10aAlternaria brown spot on Minneola tangelos in Israel  ap. 145-147.  ap. 145-147. ill.  aBrown spots were observed on the rind of fruit and foliage of Minneola tangelo (Citrus reticulata X C. paradisi) for the first time in Israel.

Generally the disease incidence was low, but in one crop the majority of plants were affected and over 50% died. The causal fungus, identified as Penicillium oxalicum, occurred on stubs left after fruit picking and leaf and sideshoot trimming, and developed to cause stem softening and withering. Blue green sporulation of penicillium on the main stem was usually surrounded by a ring of brown tissue. P. oxalicum failed to infect undamaged fruit, but was an aggressive pathogen of damaged fruit, with rot progressing more rapidly at 20 C and above than at 15 C. Inoculation of damaged cotyledon leaves induced lesions on a range of cultivars, with Cilla and Elka more resistant than others. Young plants of cv. Corona grown at 22-25 C and 90% r.h. and inoculated with mycelial plugs on the stems at fresh leaf scars developed stem lesions with Canadian isolates but not with UK isolates; in the former case wilting and collapse of the plant sometimes followed. No lesions developed following inoculation on plants grown at 70-80 r.h. P. oxalicum was consistently recovered from within the stem of most plants at the leaf axils two leaves above and two leaves below the inoculation site. Growth on potato dextrose agar of isolates of P. oxalicum from cucumber occurred more rapidly at 20 C than at 15 C. Spore germination of most isolates on agar occurred more rapidly at 20 or 25 C than at either 15 or 30 C. Isolates of P. oxalicum grew on agar amended with benomyl at 2 and 20 microgram/ml but showed no growth on agar amended with iprodione at the same rates. In a crop with a high incidence of the disease, sprays of iprodione and imazalil appeared to reduce the rate of disease spread; sprays of benomyl and vinclozolin were less effective. Iprodione and vinclozolin were the most effective of five fungicides applied as paints to stem lesions to limit their development. 3ainfection 3aCucumis sativus 3astems 3aPenicillium oxalicum 3aepidemiology 3aair temperature 3aspore germination 3achemical control 3avinclozolin 3aiprodione 3aimazalil 3abenomyl 3achlorothalonil 3adisease control 3aplant diseases and disorders 0asymptoms 0arockwool1 aBagabe, M.1 aAnn, D.M.0 tPlant pathology.g1991 Mar., v. 40, no. 1 p.78-84x0032-08627nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02883naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245016100125300001400286300001900300520185200319650001402171650001302185650002502198650002302223650001002246650002602256650002502282650002702307653001902334653000902353700001902362700001602381773007102397852000902468939003302477946001102510655001202521IND9103254420221116231612.0910817e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910325442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrusky, D.14aThe relationship between antifungal diene levels and fungal inhibition during quiescent infection of unripe avocado fruits by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides  ap. 45-52.  ap. 45-52. ill.  aQuantitative changes in the antifungal compound, 1-acetoxy-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-heneicosa-12,15-diene, in freshly harvested avocado fruits during the initial stages of fungal development were investigated to determine the possible involvement of the compound in quiescent infections of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The concentration of the antifungal compound in the peel decreased to subfungitoxic concentrations 16 h after harvest. Fifty-six hours later the antifungal diene had increased to c. 3800 micrograms/g fresh weight. At this stage, germinated appressoria had penetrated the cuticle to the epidermal cells but no fungal development was observed until 7 days later when the concentration of the diene had decreased to 100-110 micrograms/g fresh weight. Following a dip treatment at 55 degrees C for 5 or 10 min. the antifungal diene concentration decreased as in the controls, but it remained at subfungitoxic concentrations for a longer period enabling fungal development and early symptom expression. The concentration of the diene in the flesh of freshly harvested fruit decreased to 120 microgram/g fresh weight 24 h after harvest. Inoculation of peeled fruits with spores of C. gloeosporioides showed germination without appressoria formation and symptom expression occurred 24-48 h later. Symptom expression was delayed if fruits were inoculated after coating the flesh with epicuticular wax extracts or if the flesh was inoculated 3 days after harvest when the antifungal diene had regained a fungitoxic concentration. Disease symptoms were expressed in soft fruits containing subfungitoxic concentrations of the diene. We conclude that the diene in unripe avocado fruits inhibits fungal development of germinated appressoria or conidia. The quiescent structure of C. gloeosporioides in unripe avocado fruit is a subcuticular hypha. 3ainfection 3aavocados 3aGlomerella cingulata 3adisease resistance 3awaxes 3aantifungal properties 3achemical composition 3apostharvest physiology 0aripening stage 0apeel1 aPlumbley, R.A.1 aKobiler, I.0 tPlant pathology.g1991 Mar., v. 40, no. 1 p.45-52x0032-08627nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02201naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245007100172300001600243500001500259520108900274650003001363650002201393650003101415650001301446650001601459650001001475653002301485653002401508653002401532700001401556773009501570852000901665856009401674930003301768945001301801946001301814655001201827IND2049242620221116231633.0951218e199509  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204924262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1995.tb00563.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGvirtzman, H.10aFeasibility study of in-well vapor stripping using airlift pumping  ap. 155-162.  a2019-12-04  aThis study tests the feasibility of an aquifer remediation concept proposed by Givirtzman and Gorelick (1991) that involves the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) dissolved in ground water. The principal is to inject air into a well, creating airlift pumping, which is used as a means of in-well vapor stripping. The partially treated water is diverted away from the well and infiltrates back to the water table, thus allowing remediation of a larger aquifer volume. A remediation well prototype, constructed in a laboratory aquifer model, was used to demonstrate the processes involved. The removal rates of trichloroethylene, toluene, and chloroform were monitored using eight triple-level observation wells. The continuous decrease of VOC concentrations during the short-term experiment has yielded macroscopic evidence that the process offers some promise. It was found that the flow field in the saturated zone, involving the continuous water circulation between the pumping well and the recharging area, caused temporal and spatial variation in remediation efficiency. 3agroundwater contamination 3aorganic compounds 3avolatile organic compounds 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3awells 0avolatile compounds 0afeasibility studies 0aaquifer remediation1 aGonen, O.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1995 Fall, v. 15, no. 4 p.155-162x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1995.tb00563.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle04142naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245009500174300001600269500001500285520276100300650001403061650001703075650002503092650002203117650001303139650001503152650003003167650001803197650001603215650001403231650001903245651001303264653001403277653001403291653002403305700001903329700001503348700001603363700002203379773009703401852000903498856009403507930003303601945001303634946001303647655001203660IND2050471320221116231419.0960322e199612  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205047132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1996.tb00579.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallagher, D.L.10aGround water discharge of agricultural pesticides and nutrients to estuarine surface water  ap. 118-129.  a2019-12-04  aThis research investigated the transport of land-applied nutrients and pesticides from unconfined aquifers to tidal surface waters of Virginia's coastal plain. Ground water, estuarine surface water, ground water discharge, upland soil, and offshore sediment samples were collected from May 1992 until February 1993 from four agricultural sites. Samples were analyzed for inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and five pesticides atrazine, cyanazine, alachlor, metolachlor, and carbofuran. Pesticides from aqueous samples were determined by liquid-solid phase extraction followed by gas chromatography-electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and/or by pesticide-specific immunoassay. Soil and sediment samples were analyzed by extraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Nutrient measurements indicated that fertilizer nitrogen was moving from the ground water to the surface water, and nitrogen fluxes across the sediment-water interface were correlated with fresh water discharge rates. Mean nitrate-N flux was 2.48 mg/m2.hr, with a maximum value of 30.98 mg/m2.hr. Pesticides were detected in more than half of the upland soil samples, in approximately 40 percent of the ground water samples, and in just under 20 percent of the seepage meter samples. Pesticides were not detected in any of the offshore sediment samples or surface water samples. Alachlor and metolachlor were detected in upland soil samples at concentrations ranging from 10 to almost 500 micrograms/kg. All five pesticides were found in ground water samples at concentrations generally below 1 microgram/L, with alachlor atrazine, and metolachlor most frequently found. Alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine, and metolachlor were detected in water discharging across the sediment-water interface and entering estuarine waters at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 micrograms/L. These levels were generally consistent with the amount of dilution due to the mixing of fresh ground water and saline pore waters prior to discharge across the sediment-water interface. Based on all positive detections of pesticides in ground water discharge, which represented approximately 18 percent of all samples, average flux rates of cyanazine, metolachlor, alachlor, and atrazine were 0.32, 0.37, 0.80, and 1.12 micrograms/m2.hr, respectively. These findings indicate that submarine ground water transport of both nutrients and pesticides does occur, and this transport route should be considered when implementing agricultural management practices. The levels of nitrogen transport to surface water appears significant. The overall levels of pesticide movement through ground water, although generally quite low, represent a transport route that is commonly neglected in watershed management. 3asediments 3aupland soils 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aagricultural land 3anitrogen 3apesticides 3anonpoint source pollution 3asurface water 3agroundwater 3aestuaries 3acoastal plains 3aVirginia 0adischarge 0apollution 0atransport processes1 aDietrich, A.M.1 aReay, W.G.1 aHayes, M.C.1 aSimmons, G.M.

Gaseous components of a system are the most mobile and easiest to monitor. Continuous monitoring of soil gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and contaminant vapors can provide important quantitative information regarding the progress of bioremediation efforts and the area of influence of air sparging or soil venting. Laboratory and field tests of a commercially available oxygen sensor show that the subsurface oxygen sensor provides rapid and accurate data on vapor phase oxygen concentrations. The sensor is well suited for monitoring gas flow and oxygen consumption in the vadose zone during air sparging and bioventing. The sensor performs well in permeable, unsaturated soil environments and recovers completely after being submerged during temporary saturated conditions. Calibrations of the in situ oxygen sensors were found to be stable after one year of continuous subsurface operation. However, application of the sensor in saturated soil conditions is limited. The three major advantages of this sensor for in situ monitoring are as follows: (1) it allows data acquisition at any specified time interval; (2) it provides potentially more accurate data by minimizing disturbance of subsurface conditions; and (3) it minimizes the cost of field and laboratory procedures involved in sample retrieval and analysis. 3amonitoring 3abioremediation 3asoil 3agroundwater 3aoxygen 0asensors 0asubsurface layers1 aLundegard, P.D.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1996 Winter, v. 16, no. 1 p.106-111x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1996.tb00577.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02614naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245008800169300001400257500001500271520125800286650001301544650001601557650001301573650003001586650001301616650002401629650002001653650001401673650003501687650002501722653001301747653001401760653002201774653002101796653002601817653001701843700001401860700001501874773009301889852000901982856009401991930003302085945001302118946001302131655001202144IND2054725820221116232033.0970102e199609  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205472582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1996.tb01174.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLesage, S.10aVitamin B12-catalyzed dechlorination of perchloroethylene present as residual DNAPL  ap. 76-85.  a2019-12-04  aThe goal of this study was the cleanup of residual solvents in the saturated zone using an in situ biochemical treatment. Perchloroethylene (PCE) was chosen as a model compound because it is the most commonly found organic ground water contaminant. A mixture of vitamin B12 with titanium citrate was pumped as the remedial solution through a column containing 100 microliters of PCE residual. The rate of reaction was found to be first order with respect to the concentration of PCE and to the concentration of vitamin B12. At 10 ppm B12, more than 85 percent PCE was degraded to trichloroethylene (TCE) and dichloroethylene (DCE) in two hours. The presence of low to moderate concentrations of organic carbon had no significant effect on the reaction. Vitamin B12 reduced by titanium citrate was found to be compatible with the survival of anaerobic bacteria. The four major advantages of the biochemical system over the use of anaerobic bacteria are that (1) the rate is faster; (2) there is no need for the careful balance of nutrients or the addition of an extraneous carbon source; (3) there is no restriction in the concentration range of the compound to be treated; and (4) the remedial solution is mobile, even in the presence of organic carbon. 3acitrates 3avitamin B12 3atitanium 3agroundwater contamination 3asorption 3atetrachloroethylene 3awaste treatment 3acatalysts 3adense nonaqueous phase liquids 3achemical degradation 0aresidues 0areduction 0aresidual solvents 0atitanium citrate 0abiochemical treatment 0acontaminants1 aBrown, S.1 aMillar, K.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1996 Fall, v. 16, no. 4 p.76-85x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1996.tb01174.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02863naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245005700169300001600226500001500242520154600257650001401803650001901817650003001836650001501866650001701881650001501898650001401913650000801927650001301935651001101948653002101959653001901980653002401999653001702023653001602040653003802056700002002094700002002114773009702134852000902231856009402240930003302334945001302367946001302380655001202393IND2052191820221116232042.0960719e199604  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205219182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1996.tb00133.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchima, S.10aMonitoring air sparging using resistivity tomography  ap. 131-138.  a2019-12-04  aAir sparging is a relatively new technique for the remediation of ground water contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. In this technique, air is injected below the water table, beneath the contaminated soil. Remediation occurs by a combination of contaminant partitioning into the vapor phase and enhanced biodegradation. The air is usually removed by vacuum extraction in the vadose zone. The efficiency of remediation from air sparging is a function of the air flow pattern, although the distribution of the injected air is still poorly understood. Cross-borehole resistivity surveys were performed at a former service station in Florence, Oregon, to address this unknown. The resistivity measurements were made using six wells, one of which was the sparge well. Data were collected over a two-week period during and after several air injections, or sparge events. Resistivity images were calculated between wells using an algorithm that assumes axially symmetric structures. The movement of the injected air through time was defined by regions of large increases in resistivity, greater than 100 percent from the background. During early sparge times, air moved outward and upward from the injection point as it ascended to the unsaturated zone. At later sparge times, the air flow reached a somewhat stable cone-shaped pattern radiating out and up from the injection point. Two days after sparging was discontinued, a residue of entrained air remained in the saturated zone, as indicated by a zone of 60 to 80 percent water saturation. 3apetroleum 3aimage analysis 3agroundwater contamination 3amonitoring 3ahydrocarbons 3atomography 3ainjection 3aair 3aair flow 3aOregon 0aunsaturated zone 0asaturated zone 0aresistivity mapping 0ainjected air 0amethodology 0agroundwater pollution remediation1 aLaBrecque, D.J.1 aLundegard, P.D.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1996 Spring, v. 16, no. 2 p.131-138x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1996.tb00133.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02774naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245009300171300001600264520172800280650003002008650001002038650002102048653001702069653001502086653004202101700001702143700001702160773009702177852000902274856009402283930003302377945001302410946001302423655001202436IND2063066820221116231840.0980410e199706  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206306682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1997.tb00594.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, R.D.10aArrays of unpumped wells for plume migration control by semi-passive in situ remediation  ap. 185-193.  aArrays of unpumped wells can be used as discontinuous permeable walls in which each well serves both as a means to focus ground water flow into the well for treatment and as a container either for permeable reactive media which directly destroy dissolved ground water contaminants or for devices or materials which release amendments that support in situ degradation of contaminants within the aquifer downgradient of the wells. This paper addresses the use of wells for amendment delivery, recognizing the potential utility of amendments such as electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen, nitrate), electron donors (primary substrates), and microbial nutrients for stimulating bioremediation, and the potential utility of oxidizers, reducers, etc for controlled abiotic degradation. Depending on its rate and constraints, the remedial reaction may occur within the well and/or downgradient. For complete remediation of ground water passing through the well array, the total flux of amendment released must meet or exceed the total flux demand unposed by the plume. When there are constraints on the released concentration of amendment (relative to the demand), close spacing of the wells may be required. If the flux balance allows wider spacing, it is likely that limited downgradient spreading of the released amendment will then be the primary constraint on interwell spacing. Divergent flow from the wells, roughly two times the well diameter, provides the bulk of downgradient spreading and constrains maximum well spacing in the absence of significant lateral dispersion. Stronger lateral dispersion enhances the spreading of amendment, thereby increasing the lateral impact of each well, which allows for wider well spacing. 3agroundwater contamination 3awells 3agroundwater flow 0acontaminants 0aamendments 0adissolved phase contamination cleanup1 aMackay, D.M.1 aCherry, J.A.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1997 Summer, v. 17, no. 3 p.185-193x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1997.tb00594.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02381naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245009600171300001400267520111000281650001701391650001401408650001301422650001401435650002601449650001901475650001901494650003001513651001401543653001701557653002401574653001501598653001301613653003601626653001501662700001501677773009301692852000901785856009401794930003301888945001301921946001301934655001201947IND2123270220221116231328.0980610e199709  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212327022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1997.tb01266.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLinn, E.L.10aBiodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in fractured, unsaturated dolomite at a field site  ap. 73-80.  aGasoline constituents were detected in unsaturated soil and rock during abandonment of a leaky underground storage tank (UST).

Pore gas from the till and dolomite in the source area was enriched in petroleum hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide, and was depleted in oxygen, relative to pore gas from the background area. During two years of ground water monitoring at the site, methyl tertiary butyl ether was periodically detected in the ground water beneath the source area as pulses of recharge passed through the unsaturated zone, but no other gasoline constituents were detected.

An expression for predicting saturated water permeability (k(l,s)) in undisturbed soils from the soil total porosity and the field capacity soil-water content was developed by fitting a tortuous-tube fluid flow model to measured water permeability and gas diffusivity data. The new k(l,s) expression gave accurate predictions when tested against independent k(l,s) data. The k(l,s) expression was implemented in the Campbell relative water permeability model to yield a predictive model for water permeability in variably saturated, undisturbed soil. The water permeability model, together with recently developed predictive equations for gas permeability and gas diffusivity, was used in a two-dimensional numerical SVE model that also included non-equilibrium mass transfer of VOC from a separate phase (nonaqueous phase liquid [NAPL]) to the air phase. SVE calculations showed that gas permeability is likely the most important factor controlling VOC migration and vapor extraction efficiency. Water permeability and gas diffusivity effects became significant at water contents near and above field capacity. The NAPL-air mass transfer coefficient also had large impacts on simulated vapor extraction efficiency. The calculations suggest that realistic SVE models need to include predictive expressions for both convective, diffusive, and phase-partitioning processes in natural, undisturbed soils. 3apolluted soils 3asoil water 3asoil air 3avolatile compounds 3apermeability 3aprediction 3aequations 3amathematical models 3asoil remediation 0acontaminants 0atransport processes1 aMoldrup, P.1 aYamaguchi, T.1 aSchjonning, P.1 aHansen, J.A.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1999 Summer, v. 19, no. 3 p.61-70x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1999.tb00225.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03267naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245014800173300001500321520198900336650001602325650003002341650001902371650002402390650002302414650001602437650002102453651001802474653001702492653002802509653004202537700001302579700001902592773009602611852000902707856009402716930003302810945001302843946001302856655001202869IND2199331820221116231317.0990616e199904  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219933182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1999.tb00210.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiGiulio, D.C.10aEvaluation of mass flux to and from ground water using a vertical flux model (VFLUX): application to the soil vacuum extraction closure problem  ap. 96-104.  aSite closure for soil vacuum extraction (SVE) application typically requires attainment of specified soil concentration standards based on the premise that mass flux from the vadose zone to ground water not result in levels exceeding maximum contaminant levels (MCLs). Unfortunately, realization of MCLs in ground water may not be attainable at many sites. This results in soil remediation efforts that may be in excess of what is necessary for future protection of ground water and soil remediation goals which often cannot be achieved within a reasonable time period. Soil venting practitioners have attempted to circumvent these problems by basing closure on some predefined percent total mass removal, or an approach to a vapor concentration asymptote. These approaches, however, are subjective and influenced by venting design. We propose an alternative strategy based on evaluation of five components: (1) site characterization, (2) design, (3) performance monitoring, (4) rate-limited vapor transport, and (5) mass flux to and from ground water. Demonstration of closure is dependent on satisfactory assessment of all five components. The focus of this paper is to support mass flux evaluation. We present a plan based on monitoring of three subsurface zones and develop an analytical one-dimensional vertical flux model we term VFLUX. VFLUX is a significant improvement over the well-known numerical one-dimensional model, VLEACH, which is often used for estimation of mass flux to ground water, because it allows for the presence of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) in soil, degradation, and a time-dependent boundary condition at the water table interface. The time-dependent boundary condition is the centerpiece of our mass flux approach because it dynamically links performance of ground water remediation to SVE closure. Progress or lack of progress in ground water remediation results in either increasingly or decreasingly stringent closure requirements, respectively. 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3apolluted soils 3amathematical models 3afederal government 3avadose zone 3asoil remediation 3aUnited States 0acontaminants 0agroundwater remediation 0aenvironmental protection agency (epa)1 aRavi, V.1 aBrusseau, M.L.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1999 Spring, v. 19, no. 2 p.96-104x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1999.tb00210.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02036naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245005300164300001600217520109100233650002601324650002101350650002401371650001701395700001601412773011801428852000901546856008501555930003301640945001301673946001301686990002301699655001201722IND2052772720221116231407.0960827e199512  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205277272DNAL7 a10.1177/1077727X9502420062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHertzler, A.A.10aCollege students' nutrition information networks  ap. 191-202.  aNutrition information networks accessible to or being accessed by college students were studied.

Undergraduate students (179 men, 300 women) in an introductory nutrition class rated their perceived use of nutrition information networks; provided frequency-of-use responses to a survey of food choices, fat practices, and fast-food practices; and estimated nutrient intakes from 3-day diet records for iron, calcium, folacin, Vitamin C, and fat. Five nutrition information network categories were established through factor analysis: consumer market, media, authority, family, and teenage educational. Factor-related scores reflected each subject's perceived frequency of use for each category. None of the vitamin or mineral intake measures was related to any of the nutrition information network factor-related scores. However, use frequency for media and for consumer market were related to food behavior indicators reflecting low-fat practices, especially for women. 3anutrition information 3acollege students 3anutrition knowledge 3afood beliefs1 aFrary, R.B.0 tFamily and consumer sciences research journal.g1995 Dec., v. 24, no. 2 p.191-202wJournal:14647x1077-727X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077727X9502420063Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02316naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245007800163300001600241500001500257520103300272650001301305650002101318650001401339650001201353650002401365650001301389650001201402650002301414650002401437651001301461653002501474653002001499653003201519653002101551700001901572773010301591852000901694856008501703930003301788945001301821946001301834990002301847655001201870IND2060657120221116231920.0971124e199703  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206065712DNAL7 a10.1177/1077727X9702530052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTravers, R.D.10aReading instructional practices of New York State home economics teachers  ap. 316-333.  a2019-12-04  aThe goal of this study was to survey and analyze the classroom-reading instructional practices of New York State home economics teachers.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis demonstrated that the exogenous gene was integrated into the tobacco genome. Wild type (WT), the sense-transgenic line T₁-24(+) and the antisense-transgenic line T₁-17(-) were used for physiological measurement. The ratio of (A+Z)/(V+A+Z) and non-photochemical quenching in WT were lower than that in sense plants and higher than that in antisense ones under high light and chilling stress with low irradiance. The maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm) and the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in the sense line decreased less, while Fv/Fm and Pn in the antisense line decreased most obviously among all lines. These results suggest that the expression of the violaxanthin de-epoxidase gene in transgenic plants affects the sensitivity of PSII photoinhibition to high light and chilling stress. 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aWestern blotting 3acooling 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3alight intensity 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosystem II 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 3aviolaxanthin 2aBlotting, Western 2aCold Temperature 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aLight 2aSolanum lycopersicumxenzymology. 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhotosynthesisxradiation effects 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRNA, Antisensexmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aStress, Physiologicalxradiation effects 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aXanthophyllsxmetabolism1 aHan, Han1 aFeng, Hai-Long1 aZhao, Shi-Jie1 aMeng, Qing-Wei0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2010 Mar., v. 52, no. 3 p.332-339dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00891.x 7aarticle02528naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245012300175300001400298500002400312520137800336650001601714650000901730650001201739650001201751650002001763650001001783650002601793650001501819650001101834650001001845650002101855650002901876650001801905650001501923650002401938773010401962852000902066856005502075655001202130IND4378588720221116231443.0060308e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0080.2006.00035.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTemple, Jeromey B.10aHousehold factors associated with older Australian's purchasing a varied diet: Results from household expenditure data  ap. 28-35.  aIncludes references  aTo examine the household factors associated with older Australian's (aged 55 years and over) purchasing a varied diet. National cross-sectional survey. All states and territories of Australia. A total of 1898 households headed by adults aged 55 years and over. Food diversity was measured using the Dietary Variety Score (DVS). The DVS is the total number of food items purchased within a two-week period, from a possible 110 individual food expenditure items. Negative binomial regression was used to examine the association between the respondent's individual and household characteristics with the DVS, after controlling for all factors in the model. Among the demographic factors, living arrangements, age and education are found to be associated with dietary diversity. Lone males, lone females, and households headed by people with no secondary school education, or aged over 75 years were most likely to experience lower levels of dietary diversity. The finding that both poor education and low income in old age are associated with dietary diversity suggests the need for early life-course interventions to improve nutritional outcomes.

Histopathological studies show that cells in hepatopancreatic ducts and tubules are vacuolized and degenerated. Large numbers of membrane-bound yeast aggregates are observed in the affected tissues. Two hundred and seventeen yeast isolates were obtained from diseased prawns, pond water and sediments from six areas. DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was used to analyse the yeast genomes and to categorize them into five groups. Conventional biochemical and metabolic methods were then used to identify the yeasts of each group. The results showed that two strains of Candida sake (I and II), Pichia anomala, Endomyces fibuliger and Candida famata were present. In addition, the RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) method was used to determine their genomic similarities. Two strains (I and II) of C. sake were the most similar (72%). C. sake I appears to be the primary causative agent of disease, based on frequencies of occurrence of the yeasts found in the diseased prawns. 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3asediments 3aDNA 3aponds 3aCandida saitoana 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3afreshwater 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3awinter 3ayeasts 3apathogen identification 3amicrobial genetics 3amortality 3ahistopathology 3aEndomyces 3aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 3afarmers 3asake 3ashrimp 3aTaiwan 0aTorulopsis candida 0aCandida 0aHansenula anomala1 aTang, K.F.J.1 aChen, S.N.0 tJournal of fish diseases.g1998 May, v. 21, no. 3 p.185-192dBlackwell Science Ltdx0140-77757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2761.1998.00094.x 7aarticle03009naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001800155245007000173300001600243500002400259520109300283650004001376650002901416650003001445650002301475650003701498650001301535650002601548650003601574650001101610650001201621650006201633650006901695650002001764650003901784650002001823650004301843650006301886650001501949650001301964650004401977650001202021650007402033650004902107650002402156650003602180700002202216700001802238700002002256700001902276773008802295852000902383856003902392655001202431IND4439826420221116231601.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443982642DNAL7 a201625362pmid7 a10.1002/yea.17582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPincus, David10aReagents for investigating MAPK signalling in model yeast species  ap. 423-430.  aIncludes references  aHere we present a set of resources (bacterial expression plasmids and antibodies) for the interrogation of proteins involved in yeast MAPK signalling. We constructed bacterial protein expression plasmids for 25 proteins involved in MAPK signalling in budding yeast. From these constructs we expressed and purified proteins and generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against 13 proteins in the pheromone MAPK pathway. We verified the specificity of the antibodies and employed them to follow pathway proteins in cells stimulated with pheromone. We show that these reagents can be used to detect pheromone-induced post-translational modifications and changes in the oligomeric state of pathway proteins. In addition to recognizing their target proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these antibodies allow the detection of predicted orthologues in the distant evolutionary relatives Kluyveromyces lactis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These antibodies are new tools for investigating MAPK signalling in model yeast species and may be useful for studying MAPK signalling in higher eukaryotes. 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3abacterial proteins 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aplasmids 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apost-translational modification 3ayeasts 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Fungalximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenetic Vectors 2aKluyveromycesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPheromones 2aPlasmids 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational. 2aRabbits 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aSchizosaccharomycesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSignal Transduction 2aYeastsxmetabolismxphysiology.1 aBenjamin, Kirsten1 aBurbulis, Ian1 aTsong, Annie E.1 aResnekov, Orna0 tYeast.g2010 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.423-430dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1758 7aarticle02865naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010400167300001600271500001500287520168400302650002301986650001002009650001002019650001302029650002202042650002402064650001702088650001002105650001102115651001502126653001202141700001402153700001702167700001802184773008302202852000902285856009202294930003302386945001302419946001102432655001202443IND2333007620221116231024.0030611e20020912enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233300762DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00726.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThoang, T.10aObservations on growth, sexual maturity and spawning performance of pond-reared Penaeus merguiensis  ap. 863-873.  a2019-12-04  aThis 12-month preliminary study investigated the development of sexual characters, primary sexual maturity, ovarian maturity and spawning performance of pond-reared Penaeus merguiensis in relation to culture conditions in south-east Queensland, Australia. Post-larvae of P. merguiensis were produced and cultured in two 60-m3 tanks during the first 14 weeks. Before winter, they were harvested and stocked in three different overwintering facilities: a 200-m2 covered pond, two 60-m3 outdoor tanks and a 15-m3 indoor, recirculated tank at a stocking density of 10 individuals m(-2). The development of sexual characters was found to be similar to that reported previously in wild P. merguiensis. Males matured at younger ages and smaller sizes than females. Overall, the average size at primary sexual maturity of pond-reared P. merguiensis was 23.1 mm carapace length for males (possessed spermatophores) and 29.3 mm for females (being impregnated). Water temperature and the availability of natural food strongly influenced prawn growth, maturity rate and their subsequent spawning performance. Growth, maturity rate and spawning performance of prawns in the covered pond were significantly higher than in the other overwintering facilities. Prawns started mating at 6-7 months, reached full ovarian maturation and spawned as early as about 8 (peaked at 9-11) months from hatching, producing high fecundity and viable larvae. There was a strong relationship (P < 0.001) between prawn size and fecundity. The results of this study suggest a potential for using pond-reared broodstock P. merguiensis for hatchery production and for domestication or selective breeding programmes. 3asexual development 3afeeds 3aponds 3aspawning 3awater temperature 3asexual reproduction 3awild animals 3atanks 3alength 3aQueensland 0aovaries1 aLee, S.Y.1 aKeenan, C.P.1 aMarsden, G.E.0 tAquaculture research.g2002 Sept. 12, v. 33, no. 11 p.863-873x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00726.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01466naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245012500165300001600290520048400306650001300790650001900803650001600822650001200838700001900850700001500869700001500884773008300899852000900982856009200991930003301083945001301116946001101129655001201140IND2333011120221116231916.0030611e20020912enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233301112DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00741.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTort, L.10aCortisol and haematological response in sea bream and trout subjected to the anaesthetics clove oil and 2-phenoxyethanol  ap. 907-910.  aClove oil has been tested for anaesthesia induction and recovery time as well as for haematology and stress indicators in the gilthead sea bream and rainbow trout.

  1 aGlencross, B.10aNutritional assessment of Australian canola meals. II. Evaluation of the influence of the canola oil extraction method on the protein value of canola meals fed to the red seabream (Pagrus auratus, Paulin)  ap. 25-34.  aThis study examined the biological value of expeller- and solvent-extracted canola meals when included in the diets of juvenile red seabream. Notably, the test and reference diets in this study were prepared to be protein (300 g kg-1 DM) and energy (16.5 MJ kg-1 DM) limiting. Test diets were prepared, in which canola meal provided either 20%, 40% or 60% of the total dietary digestible protein. To minimize the influence of compensatory feed intake, all diets were pair-fed to the fish on restricted basis. Positive and negative controls were also included as treatments in the study to demonstrate that the diets were protein limiting and also to demonstrate the relative value of the highest inclusion levels of each test ingredient. The canola meals, either expeller- or solvent-extracted, were found to be nutritionally useful in diets for red seabream. Both ingredients were of similar value to that of the soybean meal when included on an equivalent digestible protein basis. No significant differences in weight gain, survival, FCR, N retention, energy retention or the apparent biological value of the N content were observed among any of the groups receiving the test or reference diets. A few significant differences were observed among some of the test and reference diets with regard to the apparent biological value of their energy content, although no consistent pattern was evident. The positive control treatment supported significantly superior growth and food utilization by the fish relative to all other treatments. The negative control treatment resulted in significantly poorer growth and food utilization by the fish relative to all other treatments. On a relative basis, there were no declines in fish performance between the highest inclusion levels of the expeller- and solvent-extracted canola meals or the soybean meal. Hence, the fish in this study obtained equivalent nutritional value from these ingredients, on a digestible basis, to that of the fishmeal in the reference diet. 3aPagrus 3amarine fish 3aanimal growth 3amortality 3abody weight 3afeed intake 3anutrition assessment 3afeed conversion 3acanola oil 3aplant extracts 3acanola meal 3aplant proteins 3adigestible protein 3afish culture 3aAustralia 0aPagrus auratus1 aHawkins, W.1 aCurnow, J.0 tAquaculture research.g2004 Jan. 3, v. 35, no. 1 p.25-34x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2004.00975.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRSCe2004/03/10  aNon-US 7aarticle01741naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100001500220245016400235300001400399520042900413650001200842650001200854650002200866650001100888650001400899650002100913650002500934650001700959650002000976651001000996653002201006700001801028700001801046700001601064773007801080852000901158856009201167945002501259946001101284655001201295IND4361505520221116231444.0040305e20040103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436150552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2004.00985.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVromant, N.10aSurvival rate and growth performance of Cyprinus carpio L. in intensively cultivated rice fields  ap. 171-177.  a2019-12-04  aIn the freshwater area of Vietnam's Mekong Delta, Barbodes gonionotus (Bleeker), Cyprinus carpio L. and Oreochromis niloticus (L.) are often reared together in rice fields. The survival rate and specific growth rate (SGR) of C. carpio showed a large variance. To understand the underlying reasons for this variation, we used multiple regressions for the variables SGR and survival rate, using the results of eight experiments in such polycultures at the Co Do rice-fish experimental station. The SGR of C. carpio declined with increasing rice density. Interspecific competition with O. niloticus also had a negative effect on C. carpio SGR. When fertilizer or manure is added to the trench of the rice-fish field or when extra food can be given to the fish, O. niloticus seems more appropriate than C. carpio. The survival rate of C. carpio depended on season, C. carpio stocking weight and density and the biomass of wild fish species. To obtain higher survival rates, one should stock fewer fish but of a larger size, after thorough eradication of wild fish species. 3afish culture 3aanimal growth 3arice 3aanimal manures 3afish production 3aOryza sativa 3acarp 3aOreochromis niloticus 3afertilizer application 3aCyprinus carpio 3afreshwater aquaculture 3aregression analysis 3afreshwater fish 3aseasonal variation 3ainterspecific competition 3amortality 3aVietnam 0aintensive culture 0aBarbodes gonionotus 0aplant cultural practices1 aNam, C.Q.1 aChau, N.T.H.1 aOllevier, F.0 tAquaculture research.g2004 Jan. 30, v. 35, no. 2 p.171-177x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2004.00999.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRSCe2004/03/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02765naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100001600220245015400236300001600390500001500406520129300421650001901714650001801733650001801751650002001769650001201789650002601801650002001827650001601847650001201863650001901875650001501894650002001909650001401929650003201943653000901975653002901984700001402013700001302027773008202040852000902122856009202131945002502223946001102248655001202259IND4361605320221116231058.0040312e20030820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436160532DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00891.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHuang, C.H.10aEffect of dietary calcium and phosphorus supplementation in fish meal-based diets on the growth of soft-shelled turtle Pelodiscus sinensis (Wiegmann)  ap. 843-848.  a2019-12-04  aA growth experiment was conducted to determine the effect of supplementing dietary calcium in fish meal-based diets on the growth of cultured soft-shelled turtle Pelodiscus sinensis. Juvenile soft-shelled turtles of 4.1 g mean body weight were fed nine diets containing two levels of phosphorus (2.7% or 3.0%) and analysed calcium levels ranging from 4.7% to 6.6% for 10 weeks. The growth of the turtles was enhanced when inorganic calcium was added to the diets. The weight gain of the turtles fed the control diet containing calcium solely from fish meal was the lowest among the test groups, and was significantly lower than those fed the diet containing 5.7% calcium at the 3.0% phosphorus level (P<0.05). Feed conversion and protein efficiency ratios were not affected by different dietary treatments. Whole-body moisture and crude protein contents of turtles were not affected by different dietary treatments. The body ash of turtles fed 3.0% phosphorus diets tended to be higher than turtles fed 2.7% phosphorus diets. The body calcium to phosphorus ratio of turtles fed 3.0% phosphorus diets was greater than that of turtles fed diets containing 2.7% phosphorus. Supplementation of Ca in a fish meal-based practical diet is required for the optimum growth of soft-shelled turtles. 3aturtle culture 3aanimal growth 3aprotein value 3afeed conversion 3acalcium 3anutrient availability 3aliveweight gain 3aash content 3aturtles 3aanimal feeding 3aphosphorus 3amineral content 3afish meal 3adietary mineral supplements 0adiet 0aprotein efficiency ratio1 aLin, W.Y.1 aWu, S.M.0 tAquaculture research.g2003 Aug. 20, v. 34, no. 10 p.843-848x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00891.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRHFe2004/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03346naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100001600220245010300236300001600339500008100355500001500436520180600451650001702257650002002274650001402294650002702308650004702335650002402382650000802406650002702414650001502441650002002456650002002476650002602496650002002522650002402542653002302566653001302589700001802602773008302620852000902703856009202712945002502804946001102829655001202840IND4361608820221116231615.0040312e20030912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436160882DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00950.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Lim and P. Sorgeloos.  a2019-12-04  aMolecular markers have significant potential for use in precise breeding programmes in aquaculture. This paper reviews the use of DNA markers to estimate inbreeding depression and heterosis in the guppy Poecilia reticulata. Full-sib matings revealed that inbreeding causes declines in survival and salinity tolerance, but not in undwarfism, growth and high water temperature tolerance, indicating the effects of inbreeding differ among fitness-related traits. Salinity tolerance was used to quantify the level of inbreeding depression and heterosis because the trait is strongly sensitive to inbreeding and shows a linear decrease with an increase in inbreeding coefficient. A positive correlation was observed between heterozygosity at microsatellite loci and salinity tolerance among 17 guppy populations. This indicates that heterozygosity estimated from microsatellites is a useful indicator for the estimation of inbreeding depression, suggesting that overall heterozygosity is important for fitness-related traits that show inbreeding depression. Use of DNA markers to estimate the amount of heterosis in various strain combinations was examined using diallele and reciprocal crosses among four domestic strains. The amount of heterosis differed among the strain combinations and correlated with Nei's genetic distance measured by microsatellites and also by dissimilarity using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. This indicates that microsatellite and RAPD markers are useful for estimating the amount of heterosis in various strain combinations, further suggesting that the amount of heterosis depends on the genetic differences between the strains. The present study showed that DNA markers are useful tools for estimating inbreeding depression and heterosis in guppy breeding. 3afish culture 3aornamental fish 3aheterosis 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aDNA 3afreshwater aquaculture 3ainbreeding 3afreshwater fish 3aanimal breeding 3ainbreeding depression 3agenetic markers 3aquantitative traits 0aliterature reviews 0acrossing1 aTaniguchi, N.0 tAquaculture research.g2003 Sept. 12, v. 34, no. 11 p.905-911x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00950.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRSCe2004/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02540naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152100001800169245013100187300001600318500001500334520117500349650004501524650003101569650001401600650002201614650001301636650003001649650001001679650002101689650001901710650002601729651001001755651001001765651001101775653001401786653001401800653002501814773007301839852000901912856009201921930003302013945002502046946001102071655001202082IND4362809320221121205756.0040607e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436280932DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2003.00899.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using PCR amplification patterns and RFLP of a PCR product of the region, 232 wild and 420 cultivated radish plants were classified into one of three types of orfB variation. The wild radish (especially the Japanese one) showed large polymorphism in each population with eight of 13 Japanese populations studied containing all three types, whereas cultivars were generally monomorphic. Although type 1 having Ogura male sterile cytoplasm was present with the highest frequency in Japanese wild radish, most cultivars were divided into type 2 or 3 with normal cytoplasm. Type 2 was widely distributed in European, Chinese and major Japanese varieties, while some Chinese varieties and several Japanese local radishes had type 3 cytoplasm. The comparison provides valuable information about the origin and differentiation of cultivated radishes and the relationship between cultivated and wild radishes. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3acultivars 3amitochondrial DNA 3aradishes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agenes 3aRaphanus sativus 3awild relatives 3aRaphanus raphanistrum 3aChina 3aJapan 3aEurope 0avarieties 0aorfB gene 0agenetic polymorphism0 tPlant breeding.g2004 Apr., v. 123, no. 2 p.141-144x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2003.00899.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01670naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245005300122300001600175500001500191520092100206650001401127650002301141653002401164700001401188700001701202773009301219852000901312930003301321945001301354946001301367655001201380IND2043879620221121172602.0941229e199409  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204387962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, J.10aSelected thermo-physical properties of rice bran  ap. 709-711.  a2019-12-05  aBran obtained from milling two commercial rice varieties, a long grain ('Lemont') and a medium grain ('NATO'), was used for the determination of thermo-physical properties such as bulk and particle density, porosity, thermal conductivity and diffusivity, and specific heat.

  1 aNegi, M.S.10aUtility of AFLP markers for the assessment of genetic diversity within Brassica nigra germplasm  ap. 13-16.  aGenetic diversity of 18 Brassica nigra accessions was estimated using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker technology. Two B. rapa and two B. juncea accessions were selected as outliers in the study. Eight AFLP primer combinations generated a total of 426 bands, of which 79% were polymorphic. The UPGMA method was employed to construct a dendrogram based on the Jaccard's similarity coefficient. The accessions of B. rapa separated from those of B. nigra at a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.27 while those of B. juncea did so at 0.5. The genetic similarity coefficients within the B. nigra accessions ranged from 0.58 to 0.86. Based on these coefficients it was concluded that the B. nigra accessions show high levels of genetic variation. These results have significant implications in the crop improvement programmes for the agronomically important crop B. juncea, an amphidiploid of B. nigra and B. rapa. Two incorrectly labelled B. nigra accessions were also identified. These accessions were found to cluster with those of B. juncea accessions. This result demonstrates the great value of AFLP markers in the management of genebanks. 3aBrassica nigra 3aBrassica juncea 3aBrassica rapa 3agermplasm 3aplant genetic resources 3agenetic variation 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic markers1 aSabharwal, V.1 aBhat, S.R.1 aLakshmikumaran, M.0 tPlant breeding.g2004 Feb., v. 123, no. 1 p.13-16x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0179-9541.2003.00926.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040603b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03721naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245010000194300001800294520182600312650002502138650001702163650001602180650001202196650001502208650001402223650001502237650001302252650001502265650001102280650001402291650002202305650002002327650002202347650001202369650004302381650001202424650003302436650002502469650001402494650002202508650002502530650001402555650002002569650001402589650002702603651001502630651001302645651001802658653002302676653001502699653001602714653002502730653001802755700002402773773011702797852000902914856009202923930003303015946001103048655001203059IND4424231320221121172526.0090807e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442423132DNAL7 a196594812pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04287.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoville, Sean D.10aAlpine biogeography of Parnassian butterflies during Quaternary climate cycles in North America  ap. 3471-3485.  aGrowth of alpine glaciers during the Pleistocene had profound effects on montane landscapes in North America and the organisms now inhabiting alpine ecosystems. Biogeography of this region has often been viewed as a system of sky islands despite the fact that species richness patterns deviate from a strict island biogeographic model. One explanation is that alpine species are not in equilibrium because of late Quaternary geographic range shifts. Genetic data can provide evidence of nonequilibrium dynamics and the distributional shifts that occur during glaciation events in alpine landscapes. Using mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data, we examine the evolutionary history of butterflies in the Parnassius phoebus complex. We test explicit, alternative models of the biogeographic history of Parnassius smintheus and Parnassius behrii, including an equilibrium island model, ancestral radiation and fragmentation, an expanding alpine archipelago and an alpine archipelago refuge model. Our results support the alpine archipelago refuge model, in which alpine butterflies undergo population contraction during glacial climates followed by population expansion during interglacial phases. While butterflies can disperse between distant mountain ranges during glacial periods, gene flow is rare. We find evidence of recent connectivity between California and Colorado, population expansion events following deglaciation ~20 000 years B.P., and small population sizes during the last glacial period. An analysis of lineage splitting suggests that morphological differences in P. smintheus and P. behrii are the result of late Pleistocene divergence (~48 000 years B.P.) with limited gene flow. Our results demonstrate that spatially complex and nonequilibrium population dynamics influence alpine diversity patterns. 3aParnassius smintheus 3abiogeography 3abutterflies 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3agene flow 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amountains 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3aspecies diversity 2aAnimals 2aButterfliesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aClimate 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aModels, Genetic 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aCalifornia 3aColorado 0aNorth America 0aalpine archipelago 0aParnassius 0aPleistocene 0apopulation expansion 0aSierra Nevada1 aRoderick, George K.0 tMolecular ecology.g2009 Aug., v. 18, no. 16 p.3471-3485dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04287.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120324b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02736naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001700180245005700197300001600254500001500270520102700285650002501312650002601337650000901363650002101372650001701393650001601410650001201426650001901438650002501457650002001482650002101502650001201523650002801535650001601563650001901579650004001598650003801638650005301676650002901729650003501758650004801793650002301841653001701864700001801881700001401899700001801913700001401931700001801945773008101963852000902044930003302053945002502086946001102111655001202122IND4363331520221121141554.0040713e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436333152DNAL7 a152155052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The gek1 mutant displays an enhanced sensitivity (10-100 times greater than the wild type) to ethanol in growth medium, while it grows normally in the absence of ethanol, and responds normally to other alcohols and to environmental stresses such as heat shock and high salinity. The ethanol-hypersensitive phenotype of gek1 requires alcohol dehydrogenase activity, indicating that gek1 is sensitive not to ethanol itself but to the metabolites of ethanol. Consistent with this, gek1 shows enhanced sensitivity to acetaldehyde in the medium. The endogenous acetaldehyde levels were not different between gek1-2 and wild-type seedlings treated with ethanol. These results indicate that the ethanol hypersensitivity of gek1 is due to an enhanced sensitivity to acetaldehyde toxicity, instead of abnormally elevated accumulation of toxic acetaldehyde, which has been thought to be the major cause of ethanol toxicity in mammal cells. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aloci 3aoxidative stress 3aacetaldehyde 3aheat stress 3amutants 3aplant response 3aphenotypic variation 3aenzyme activity 3aplant morphology 3aethanol 3ahypersensitive response 3asalt stress 3aplant proteins 2aAcetaldehydexmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aAlcohol Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrug Tolerancexgenetics 2aEthanolxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aMutationxgenetics 0aplant stress1 aFujishige, N.1 aKunii, T.1 aNishimura, N.1 aIuchi, S.1 aShinozaki, K.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.703-711x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/07/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02626naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002300163245006300186300001600249520121700265650002201482650001701504650001601521650001401537650001701551650000901568650001301577650001601590650001901606650001701625650001401642650001901656650001201675650004701687650002901734650002101763650002901784650002901813650002501842650002401867700001501891700001801906700001301924773008101937852000902018930003302027945002502060946001102085655001202096IND4363331420221121141440.0040713e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436333142DNAL7 a128814952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAbdrakhamanova, A.10aIs microtubule disassembly a trigger for cold acclimation?  ap. 676-686.  aCold acclimation was followed in three cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that differ in freezing tolerance, using root growth as the indicator. During acclimation (followed through 7 d at 4 degrees C), growth rate progressively recovered. The recovery was fast in the tolerant, slow in the sensitive cultivars. The development of freezing tolerance was followed by a challenging cold shock administered after various time intervals of acclimation. Acclimation proceeded faster in the tolerant cultivars. Microtubules were monitored during the acclimation period. A rapid, but transient partial disassembly in the tolerant cultivars preceded the formation of cold-stable microtubules and the recovery of growth rate. In contrast, this transient disassembly was absent in the sensitive cultivar. When a transient disassembly was artificially generated by a pulse-treatment with the antimicrotubular herbicide pronamide, this could induce freezing tolerance. The appearance of cold-stable microtubules was accompanied by a reduced abundance of type TUA1/2 alpha-tubulin isotypes. These findings are discussed with respect to a role of microtubule disassembly in the sensing of low-temperature stress. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3agrain crops 3acultivars 3amicrotubules 3acold 3afreezing 3aacclimation 3acold tolerance 3aplant stress 3apronamide 3aplant proteins 3atubulin 2aAcclimatizationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBenzamidesxpharmacology 2aCold Temperature 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aMicrotubulesxphysiology 2aTriticumxphysiology 2aTubulinxmetabolism1 aWang, Q.Y.1 aKhokhlova, L.1 aNick, P.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2003 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.676-686x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050419b20050501c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02642naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001900146245008000165300001600245520109400261650002501355650002601380650001701406650005501423650004801478650005501526650003101581650004801612650002501660650001301685650006001698650003301758650005501791650004401846653002301890700001601913700001501929700001601944700001801960700002301978773008102001852000902082930003302091945002502124946001102149655001202160IND4363331120221121105545.0040713e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436333112DNAL7 a128814932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMatsushima, R.14aThe ER body, a novel endoplasmic reticulum-derived structure in Arabidopsis  ap. 661-666.  aPlant cells develop various endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived structures with specific functions. The ER body, a novel ER-derived compartment in Arabidopsis, is a spindle-shaped structure (approximately 10 micrometer long and approximately 1 micrometer wide) that is surrounded by ribosomes. Similar structures were found in many Brassicaceae plants in the 1960s and 1970s, but their main components and biological functions have remained unknown. ER bodies can be visualized in transgenic Arabidopsis expressing the green fluorescent protein with an ER-retention signal. A large number of ER bodies are observed in cotyledons, hypocotyls and roots of seedlings, but very few are observed in rosette leaves. Recently nail, a mutant that does not develop ER bodies in whole seedlings, was isolated. Analysis of the nail mutant reveals that a beta-glucosidase, called PYK10, is the main component of ER bodies. The putative biological function of PYK10 and the inducibility of ER bodies in rosette leaves by wound stress suggest that the ER body functions in the defense against herbivores. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aplant stress 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMutation 2aPlant Structuresxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2abeta-Glucosidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aliterature reviews1 aHayashi, Y.1 aYamada, K.1 aShimada, T.1 aNishimura, M.1 aHara-Nishimura, I.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2003 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.661-666x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050419b20050501c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01965naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009100129300001600220520116200236650001401398650001601412650002401428653001201452653001201464653002601476773010501502852000901607930003301616945001301649946001301662655001201675IND2042296420221121105520.0940928e199405  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204229642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, B.W.10aElectronic failure detection and redundancy for computer-based central control systems  ap. 407-411.  aControl and monitoring of multiple areas with central control systems has many advantages, but it also carries with it an increased risk in the event of a failure. Typical failures include those caused by power losses or surges, hardware, or software. Failures can occur in the computer, an input/output (I/O) device, an individual I/O module, or in sensors. Failure detection techniques include looking for computer lockup, toggling a symbol on the screen, setting up error messages, setting alarms for failed I/O boards, looking for sensor outputs that are significantly out of range, watching for toggling of the least significant bit on a sensor output, monitoring serial communication activity with another computer, and using an expert system. Equipment which may be used for backup control of critical systems includes uninterruptible power supplies, battery backed nonvolatile memory, auto execute programs, manual switch over systems, automatic switch over systems, watchdog timers, conventional controls, and backup computers. Several examples of failure detection techniques and backup systems for an environmental control application were given. 3adetection 3aelectronics 3acomputer techniques 0afailure 0asystems 0aenvironmental control0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1994 May, v. 10, no. 3 p.407-411wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01304naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007600130300001600206520053700222650001700759650001100776650001200787650001500799650002500814653001600839773009100855852000900946930003300955945001300988946001301001655001201014IND2042296620221121105528.0940928e199405  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204229662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegerlind, L.J.10aPrediction of dairy heifer numbers for the design of housing facilities  ap. 413-415.  aA stochastic model was used to predict replacement heifer numbers.

Important historical developments included a voluntary equipment testing program and development of a computerized engineering design program, STALDVENT. Based on the Danish experience, recommendations are made for the development of ventilation performance standards for Canada. Performance standards are not possible unless test reports are available on the performance of ventilation components, especially inlet and exhaust units. Performance standards should be functional, rather than prescriptive, setting limits for environmental conditions that will be achieved within the building rather than dictating how those conditions will be met. Performance standards should be limited to only those aspects over which the ventilation equipment suppliers have some control. Canadian livestock producers have been willing to take all the risk for the performance of ventilation systems. They are encouraged to adapt to a system where the risk is shared with design engineers or with equipment suppliers. They would have to abandon the practice of assembling ventilation components by themselves into a self-designed system in favor of the practice of installing systems that have been professionally engineered and/or sold as a complete system. Standardized engineering design aids, such as computer software, are needed to assist equipment suppliers to assemble HVAC systems for which they can offer performance guarantees. 3aanimal housing 3acooling systems 3aheating systems 3aCanada 0astandards 0aperformance 0aartificial ventilation1 aStrom, J.S.1 aBantle, M.R.L.1 aMorsing, S.1 aFeddes, J.J.R.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1994 May, v. 10, no. 3 p.395-401x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01256naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245003100122300001600153500001500169520042600184650001100610650001300621653001200634653001300646653002400659653002100683700002100704700001600725700001800741773009100759852000900850930003300859945001300892946001300905655001200918IND2042295420221121105532.0940928e199405  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204229542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, J.10aDynamic tractor ballasting  ap. 363-367.  a2019-12-05  aImproved tractive efficiency was achieved by use of a dynamic ballasting system to control wheel slip on a two-wheel-drive tractor.

To determine the effects of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis, the numbers of chloroplasts in treated Physcomitrella patens cells were counted. Ampicillin and D-cycloserine caused a rapid decrease in the number of chloroplasts per cell. Fosfomycin affected half of the cells, while vancomycin affected a few cells. Conversely, bacitracin had no effect. With the decrease in chloroplast number, macrochloroplasts appeared in antibiotic-treated cells. Removal of the antibiotics resulted in the recovery of chloroplast number, suggesting that the decrease in number was directly dependent on the antibiotic treatment. Microscopic observations showed that the decrease in the number of chloroplasts resulted from cell division without chloroplast division. These results suggest that enzymes derived from the bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis pathway are related to moss chloroplast division. 3abeta-lactam antibiotics 3abiosynthesis 3abacitracin 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3abiochemical pathways 3acycloserine 3apolysaccharides 3amosses and liverworts 3achloroplasts 3aglycopeptides 2aAmpicillinxpharmacology 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacitracinxpharmacology 2aBryopsidaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aChloroplastsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCycloserinexpharmacology 2aFosfomycinxpharmacology 2aPeptidoglycanxbiosynthesis 2aVancomycinxpharmacology 0apeptidoglycan 0achloroplast division 0aantibiotics 0avancomycin 0afosfomycin1 aTakano, H.1 aSugiyama, M.1 aTakio, S.1 aSakai, A.1 aTanaka, K.1 aKuroiwa, H.1 aOno, K.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2003 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.776-781x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20050419b20050501c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02970naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100001800180245010100198300001800299500001500317520092200332650002601254650001501280650002301295650001001318650002801328650001301356650002801369650002501397650001001422650003001432650001901462650002401481650001201505650001801517650002501535650004201560650001601602650002501618650002801643650002401671650005701695650005901752650003901811650003401850653002201884653001901906653002901925653002801954653002301982653002502005700001302030700001702043700002002060700001702080700001302097773008402110852000902194930003302203945002502236946001102261655001202272IND4365444220221121023031.0041108e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436544422DNAL7 a155098552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The nucleotide sequence, consisting of 1,631 bp, contains an open reading frame coding for a 300-amino-acid protein named CrMIP1. It possesses conserved NPA motifs, but is not highly homologous to known aquaporins. CrMIP1 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and assayed for water and glycerol transport activity. By the stopped-flow spectrophotometric assay, CrMIP1 did not enhance the osmotic water permeability of membrane vesicles of the yeast transformant. However, the transformant cells showed glycerol transport activity in the in vivo assay using [14C]glycerol. This is the first report on the isolation and functional identification of a MIP member from algae. 3amembrane permeability 3aaquaporins 3asequence alignment 3aalgae 3aphysiological transport 3aglycerol 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aamino acid sequences 3awater 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixmetabolism 2aDNA Primers 2aGlycerolxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aProtozoan Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0asequence analysis 0awater channels 0amajor intrinisic protein 0amolecular sequence data 0aalgae and seaweeds 0anucleotide sequences1 aSuga, S.1 aFuruichi, T.1 aShimogawara, K.1 aMaeshima, M.1 aMuto, S.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.1313-1319x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20051128b20051202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/11/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02450naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245014000167300001600307500001500323520111500338650001401453650001901467650001701486650001901503650001201522650002301534650002601557650001401583650002301597650002201620650002501642653004301667700001501710700001601725700001701741700001501758773007301773852000901846856009201855930003301947945001301980946001101993655001202004IND2331774720221121014228.0030403e200110  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233177472DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2001.00626.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorras, O.12aA first attempt to use a Fusarium subglutinans culture filtrate for the selection of pineapple cultivars resistant to fusariose disease  ap. 435-438.  a2019-12-04  aPineapple, Ananas comosus L.

The susceptible cultivars proved to be the most sensitive in each test, whereas resistant cultivars showed resistance to CF. FA affected all the cultivars independently of the degree of resistance of the cultivars The presence of other metabolites in CF was responsible for the screening effect between the varieties. Using CF as selection criteria allowed the selection of resistant plants with behaviour quite similar to plants where the fungus itself was used as the selection agent. 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3afusaric acid 3aAnanas comosus 3ahybrids 3adisease resistance 3aFusarium subglutinans 3ascreening 3aselection criteria 3aculture filtrates 3aartificial selection 0aGibberella fujikuroi var. subglutinans1 aSantos, R.1 aMatos, A.P.1 aCabral, R.S.1 aArzola, M.0 tPlant breeding.g2001 Oct., v. 120, no. 5 p.435-438x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2001.00626.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01826naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010000160300001600260520064900276650001400925650002000939650001100959650002400970650002500994650001701019650001301036650001101049653001701060653001401077700001301091700001501104700001501119700001701134700001701151773011001168852000901278856008501287930003301372946001101405655001201416IND4429314420221120233311.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442931442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-009-0139-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, C. 10aDifferent maternal genome donor to Kengyilia species inferred from chloroplast trnL-F sequences  ap. 759-763.  aTo reveal the maternal donor of species in genus Kengyilia, the chloroplast trnL-F sequences of 14 Kengyilia species and several related diploid species were analyzed by using Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Bayesian Inference (BI) methods.

  1 aNguyen, T.T.10aGenetic diversity estimates in Cicer using AFLP analysis  ap. 173-179.  a2019-12-04  aAmplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was used to evaluate the genetic variation among cultivated chickpea and wild Cicer relatives. In total, 214 marker loci were assessed, of which 211 were polymorphic (98.6%) across the 95 accessions that represented 17 species of Cicer. The genetic variation within a species was highest in C. pinnatifidum followed by C. reticulatum and lowest in C. macracanthum. Three main species groups were identified by UPGMA clustering using Nei's pair-wise distance calculations. Group I included the cultivated species C. arietinum, C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum. Within this group, C. reticulatum accessions were clustered closest to the C. arietinum cultivars 'Lasseter', 'Kaniva' and 'Bumper', supporting the hypothesis that C. reticulatum is the most probable progenitor of the cultivated species. Cicer bijugum, C. judaicum and C. pinnatifidum were clustered together creating group II. Group III contained all nine perennial species assessed and two annual species C. yamashitae and C. cuneatum. The genetic distance detected between group I and group III (0.13) was equivalent to the genetic distance detected between group I and group II (the primary and annual tertiary species, respectively; 0.14). This indicated that the perennial tertiary species may be as valuable for increasing variation to incorporate novel germplasm in the cultigen as the annual tertiary species. 3aannuals 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aloci 3aperennials 3awild relatives 3agenetic distance 3achickpeas 3agenetic variation 3aCicer arietinum 3agenetic markers 0aCicer1 aTaylor, P.W.J.1 aRedden, R.J.1 aFord, R.0 tPlant breeding.g2004 Apr., v. 123, no. 2 p.173-179x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2003.00942.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02658naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001400163245011900177300001600296500001500312520066700327650001400994650002101008650001201029650001501041650002001056650002201076650002001098650001201118650002001130650002801150650002501178650002101203650002401224650003601248650001901284650003001303650004201333650005301375650002301428650005301451650002301504650002301527650006701550650005301617650004001670650004501710650002801755653002801783653001901811700001401830700001701844773008101861852000901942930003301951945002501984946001102009655001202020IND4362927920221120192112.0040618e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436292792DNAL7 a149884962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The liberated OEC33 and also OEC24 to a lesser extent were subsequently damaged and then exhibited smeared bands in SDS/urea-PAGE. Once deteriorated, OEC33 could not bind to PSII. The effects of scavengers and chelating reagents on the damage indicated that hydroxyl radicals generated from superoxide in the presence of metal ions were responsible for the damage. These results suggest that, like the D1 protein of the PSII reaction center complex, OEC subunits suffer oxidative damage and turnover under illumination. 3amanganese 3achelating agents 3aspinach 3athylakoids 3avegetable crops 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aphotoinhibition 3acations 3alight intensity 3aoxygen evolving complex 3aantioxidant activity 3asuperoxide anion 3aprotein degradation 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers 3aplant proteins 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aFree Radical Scavengersxpharmacology 2aHydroxyl Radicalxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aMetalsxmetabolism 2aOxidative Stressxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aProtein Subunitsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSpinacia oleraceaxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 0areactive oxygen species 0aphotosystem II1 aMiyao, M.1 aYamamoto, Y.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.243-250x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20040629b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/06/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02414naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245007200190300001600262520085500278650001401133650001201147650000801159650002401167650002901191650002001220650002901240650002001269650002901289650002001318650000901338650004201347650001301389650000901402650002201411650003301433653003201466653002801498653001401526700001801540700002001558700001801578700002101596773013401617852000901751856009201760930003301852946001101885655001201896IND4423868020221120192107.0090731e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442386802DNAL7 a213146722pmid7 a10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01117.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeshay, Morris14aThe feasibility of non-viral gene transfer to the diaphragm in vivo  ap. 547-553.  aGene transfer using electroporation is an essential method for the study of developmental biology, especially to understand the internal control of degeneration and apoptosis of the muscle cells that occurs earlier and quicker than the usual degeneration process occurring by aging. Such experimental studies may have a role in developing new strategies for treating patients suffering from inherited primary myopathies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The present study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of electroporation mediated transfer of reporter genes to the diaphragm in vivo.

  1 aDomon, E.10aSingle nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of the barley waxy gene by polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers  ap. 225-228.  aA high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping procedure was developed to select amylose-free barley mutants whose waxy genes had a C- to T-base substitution in exon 5, which converted Gln-89 of the wild-type gene into a termination codon. An F2 population carrying an amylose-free waxy gene was checked for segregation. Polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP) produced allele-specific PCR products that have different sizes and are inherited in a co-dominant manner. Two alleles of the barley waxy gene with SNP were correctly identified in parental strains using the PCR-CTPP procedure. Segregation of the SNP as detected by PCR-CTPP in an F2 population fitted the expected 1 : 2 : 1 ratio. The PCR-CTPP procedure can provide a time saving and cost-effective alternative to derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence in marker-assisted selection. 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare 3abarley 3astructural genes 3aexons 3astarch synthase 3agenotype 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA primers 3aalleles 3agene segregation 3amutants 0agranule-bound starch synthase1 aYanagisawa, T.1 aSaito, A.1 aTakeda, K.0 tPlant breeding.g2004 June, v. 123, no. 3 p.225-228x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2004.00970.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03259naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002000163245010400183300001600287500001500303520125700318650001701575650001001592650001401602650003801616650001701654650001901671650001701690650001501707650001201722650001001734650001101744650002301755650005501778650002801833650004801861650002401909650005301933650002301986650005902009650005402068650002702122650005302149650003402202650002402236653002202260653001002282653002302292700002402315700001802339700003202357700001802389700001602407700001602423773008002439852000902519930003302528945002502561946001102586655001202597IND4363074220221120181841.0040628e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436307422DNAL7 a151699322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTansengco, M.L.10aPollen development and tube growth are affected in the symbiotic mutant of Lotus japonicus, crinkle  ap. 511-520.  a2019-12-05  aThe symbiotic mutant of Lotus japonicus, crinkle (crk), exhibits abnormal nodulation and other alterations in the root hairs, trichomes, and seedpods. Defective nodulation in crk mutant is due to the arrested infection thread growth from the epidermis into the cortex. Here, we describe that crk is also affected in male fertility that causes the production of small pods with few seeds. Under in vitro conditions, pollen germination and tube growth were markedly reduced in the crk mutant. A swollen tip phenotype with disorganized filamentous actin (F-actin) was observed in the mutant pollen tubes after prolonged in vitro culture. During pollen development, the striking difference noted in the mutant was the small size of the microspores that remained spherical. Histological examination of ovule development, as well as outcrosses of the mutant as female to wild type as male, showed no evidence of abnormality in the female gametophyte development. Based on these findings, the Crk gene, aside from its role in the infection process during nodulation, is also involved in male gametophyte development and function. Therefore, this gene represents a connection between nodule symbiosis, polar tip growth, and other plant developmental processes. 3aplant growth 3aseeds 3asymbiosis 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aroot nodules 3amicrofilaments 3apollen tubes 3anodulation 3amutants 3aactin 3apollen 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aFlowersxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGametogenesisxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLotusxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPollenxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSeedsxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSex Differentiationxgenetics 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 0aplant development 0aLotus 0apollen germination1 aImaizumi-Anraku, H.1 aYoshikawa, M.1 aTakagi, Shūji,d1923-2006.1 aKawaguchi, M.1 aHayashi, M.1 aMurooka, Y.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.511-520x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02293naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169100001600186245011100202300001600313500001500329520099600344650001101340650001001351650001001361650001901371650002101390650002401411650002201435650001901457650002301476653001401499653001601513700001401529700001601543700001801559700001501577773007301592852000901665856009201674930003301766945002501799946001101824655001201835IND4362812620221120181854.0040607e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436281262DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2003.00914.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The mean seed oil content varied from 10.26 to 22.89% in 22 species of Gossypium and six races of G. arboreum. In this material the weight of delinted seed varied from 43.33 to 54.54 mg/seed. The highest seed oil content was recorded in the species G. lobatum followed by G. harknessii. On average, for both traits, the means were higher for G. arboreum and its races. However, G. africanum and G. harknessii reached the level of G. arboreum and its races for seed weight, while five wild species surpassed the best races and G. arboreum in seed oil content, among them was G. harknessii. To breed simultaneously for seed oil content and seed weight, crosses between races of G. arboreum and wild species of Gossypium seem to be promising. 3acotton 3araces 3aseeds 3acottonseed oil 3aagronomic traits 3aGossypium herbaceum 3agenetic variation 3awild relatives 3aGossypium arboreum 0aGossypium 0aseed weight1 aSingh, P.1 aMayee, C.D.1 aDeshpande, V.1 aBhagat, C.0 tPlant breeding.g2004 Apr., v. 123, no. 2 p.207-208x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2003.00914.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02499naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152100001800169245010800187300001600295500001500311520105400326650001701380650003901397650002301436650002701459650003101486650001701517650002401534650001501558650001001573650002801583650002201611650002001633650001801653653002501671653001701696700001701713700001901730700002501749773007301774852000901847856009201856930003301948945002501981946001102006655001202017IND4363288320221120181810.0040709e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436328832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2004.00932.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The lines 170/98i and 178/98i carried one and two subtelomeric regions of Ae. speltoides (per haploid genome), respectively, marked by Spelt1 repeats according to FISH data. SSR analysis detected homoeologous substitution of wheat chromosome 7D with Ae. speltoides chromosome 7S in the lines 178/98i and 170/98i as well as the assumed terminal translocation in the short arm of chromosome 3A in the line 178/98i. Anthocyanin pigmentation of the coleoptiles was found in the lines 170/98i and 178/98i and resulted from the 7S (7D) substitution. It was demonstrated that Spelt1 could be effectively used for the rapid identification (without DNA isolation) of terminal translocations of T. aestivum x Ae. speltoides introgressive lines as well as for further analysis of the stability of the hybrid plants. 3aanthocyanins 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3asubstitution lines 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aintergeneric hybridization 3apigmentation 3aAegilops speltoides 3aDNA probes 3awheat 3achromosome substitution 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenetic markers 3aintrogression 0arepetitive sequences 0acytogenetics1 aSalina, E.A.1 aEfremova, T.T.1 aPshenichnikova, T.A.0 tPlant breeding.g2004 June, v. 123, no. 3 p.220-224x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2004.00932.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02465naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245018800165300001600353520105000369650001701419650001601436650001401452650000901466650001201475650001101487650002501498650001301523650001401536650001401550650001101564650001301575650001201588653001601600653001601616700001701632700001801649700001801667700001901685700001701704773012901721852000901850856009201859930003301951946001101984655001201995IND4428601420221120181848.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442860142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00705.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPALM, D.10aInfluence of European sculpin, Cottus gobio, on Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, recruitment and the effect of gravel size on egg predation - implications for spawning habitat restoration  ap. 501-507.  aThe study examined if recruitment of juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., was influenced by the presence of European sculpin, Cottus gobio L., and if the spawning substrate size used by salmon influences sculpin predation on salmon eggs. A combination of information on spawning site selection by female salmon and associated densities of juvenile salmon indicated that recruitment of juvenile salmon was 10 times lower in areas where sculpin was present than areas without sculpin. Predation rate on salmon eggs was found to be dependent on substrate size in artificial redds created in stream aquaria using four different sizes of substrate (13, 23, 37 and 62 mm). Predation rate averaged 83% in the aquaria with the largest substrate size, whereas a rate of only 2-3% was observed using smaller substrate sizes. Sculpin may thus be an important factor influencing the recruitment of juvenile salmon. Selecting small enough gravel sizes during restoration of salmon spawning habitat could therefore be important to minimise egg predation. 3aCottus gobio 3aSalmo salar 3aaquariums 3aeggs 3afemales 3agravel 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3apredation 3asalmon 3aspawning 3astreams 0acompetition 0arestoration1 aLindberg, M.1 aBRÄNNÄS, E.1 aLUNDQVIST, H.1 aÖSTERGREN, J.1 aCARLSSON, U.0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 16, no. 6 p.501-507dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0969-997X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00705.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02137naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245011900161300001600280500001500296520082200311650001501133650002801148650003101176650001001207650001901217650002101236650002001257650003101277650002101308653002801329653002501357653002301382653002501405700001401430700001701444700001801461700001501479700001401494773008101508852000901589930003301598945002501631946001101656655001201667IND4362931920221120181931.0040618e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436293192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We have challenged concurrent monitoring of two independent promoter activities within the same cells to precisely compare their characteristics in vivo. In this report, we describe a simple dual-reporter system capable of simultaneously monitoring two promoter activities in living cyanobacterial cells. Two railroad-worm luciferases catalyzing the bioluminescent emissions of different colors served as the dual reporters; each emission was successfully separated by interference filters to estimate the individual bioluminescence signals using photomultiplier tubes. Using this system, we clearly demonstrated the difference in the expression profiles between promoters in the same cells. 3aluciferase 3aSynechococcus elongatus 3aSynechococcus sp.

However, this continuum theory remains hindered by uncertainty surrounding a potentially common etiology. This review sheds light on our current understanding of the epidemiology of WG and MPA with the aim of weighing the evidence supporting whether or not these two vasculitis forms are distinct diseases. At present, some epidemiological evidence exists that WG and MPA might correspond to mere variants of a single AAV entity. 3aepidemiology 3aetiology 2aAntibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmicxphysiology 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGranulomatosis with Polyangiitisxclassificationxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aHumans 2aRisk Factors 2aVasculitisxclassificationxepidemiologyxetiology. 0aWegener's granulomatosis 0amicroscopic polyangiitis 0aANCA-associated vasculitis0 tAPMIS.g2009 June, v. 117, no. s127 p.41-47dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0903-46417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2009.02476.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090605b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01883naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169100001500186245005700201300001400258500001500272520060800287650002000895650001900915650001900934650002300953650001800976650001000994650002201004650002701026650002301053650002101076650001801097653001001115653002701125700001601152700001601168773007101184852000901255856009201264930003301356945002501389946001101414655001201425IND4362595020221120161334.0040520e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436259502DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0179-9541.2003.00923.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The number of KB-free and KB-affected plants in BC1, BC2, BC3 and BC4 as well the F2 was recorded after artificial inoculations. The segregation pattern in these generations clearly indicated two independently segregating, dominant genes which jointly confer the KB-free attribute.

From Akihikari//IR36/Dular, neutral genes at ga11 and six sterility loci, S5, S7, S8, S9, S15 and S16, were combined and elite lines were obtained in their successive progeny. Four of the lines tested were confirmed to combine the neutral alleles S5-n, S7-n, S8-n, S9-n, S15-n and S16-n at the sterility loci and, among them, two harboured an additional gamete abortion-neutral allele, ga11-n. F1s, which used the lines and various testers as parents, mitigated the spikelet sterilities by six sterility loci and gamete abortion by a gametophyte gene, ga11. These lines could be selectively used as parents or donors to increase the width of compatibility of rice varieties for improving fertility in inter-subspecific hybrid rice breeding. 3ainflorescences 3arice 3aplant breeding 3aalleles 3aloci 3aOryza sativa 3aplant fertility 3agametogenesis 3asegregation distortion 3apollen 3aabortion (plants) 0alines 0agene segregation1 aZou, J.S.1 aIkehashi, H.0 tPlant breeding.g2004 Feb., v. 123, no. 1 p.98-100x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0179-9541.2003.00931.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040604b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/06/04  aNon-US 7aarticle01966naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152100002200169245006600191300001400257500001500271520082200286650002701108650001001135650001201145650000901157650002401166650001601190650002301206650002501229650002001254653002801274653002501302773007101327852000901398856009201407930003301499945002501532946001101557655001201568IND4362594720221120150628.0040520e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436259472DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0179-9541.2003.00929.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Publically available DNA sequence data of P. vulgaris were searched for SSR motifs. Twenty sequences containing microsatellites were identified and primer pairs were designed to amplify those microsatellites. Primers were evaluated for their ability to detect polymorphisms within a set of P. vulgaris accessions, local landraces and hybrids and in addition, two accessions of the closely related species P. coccineus. Eighteen polymorphic SSR loci were identified. Polymorphisms were found at both levels of accessions and Phaseolus species. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3abeans 3aalleles 3aloci 3aPhaseolus coccineus 3aDNA primers 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences0 tPlant breeding.g2004 Feb., v. 123, no. 1 p.87-89x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0179-9541.2003.00929.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20040604b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/06/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03727naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245013400190300001800324500001500342520175100357650001402108650002702122650001202149650001402161650001202175650001802187650001902205650001402224650002702238650002002265650002502285650002502310650001902335650001802354650001302372650002202385650001202407650001602419650003402435650001902469650001802488650001402506650002702520650002202547650002402569651001802593651001802611653001802629653002602647653002802673653002302701653001002724700001902734700002102753700001702774773011702791852000902908856009202917930003303009946001103042655001203053IND4392947620221120150541.0070708e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439294762DNAL7 a176149152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03340.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDUPUTIÉ, ANNE10aNatural hybridization between a clonally propagated crop, cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) and a wild relative in French Guiana  ap. 3025-3038.  a2019-12-05  aBecause domestication rarely leads to speciation, domesticated populations often hybridize with wild relatives when they occur in close proximity. Little work has focused on this question in clonally propagated crops. If selection on the capacity for sexual reproduction has been relaxed, these crops would not be expected to hybridize with their wild relatives as frequently as seed-propagated crops. Cassava is one of the most important clonally propagated plants in tropical agriculture. Gene flow between cassava and wild relatives has often been postulated, but never demonstrated in nature. We studied a population of a wild Manihot sp. in French Guiana, which was recently in contact with domesticated cassava, and characterized phenotypes (10 morphological traits) and genotypes (six microsatellite loci) of individuals in a transect parallel to the direction of hypothesized gene flow. Wild and domesticated populations were strongly differentiated at microsatellite loci. We identified many hybrids forming a continuum between these two populations, and phenotypic variation was strongly correlated with the degree of hybridization as determined by molecular markers. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium and of the diversity of hybrid pedigrees showed that hybridization has gone on for at least three generations and that no strong barrier prevents admixture of the populations. Hybrids were more heterozygous than either wild or domesticated individuals, and phenotypic comparisons suggested heterosis in vegetative traits. Our results also suggest that this situation is not uncommon, at least in French Guiana, and demonstrate the need for integrated management of wild and domesticated populations even in clonally propagated crops. 3aheterosis 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ahybrids 3aphenotype 3acassava 3ahybridization 3aheterozygosity 3agene flow 3alinkage disequilibrium 3agenetic markers 3atropical agriculture 3aphenotypic variation 3awild relatives 3adomestication 3apedigree 3aManihot esculenta 2aAlleles 2aClone Cells 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aGene Frequency 2aGenome, Plant 2aGeography 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aManihotxgenetics 2aPopulation Dynamics 3aFrench Guiana 0aFrench Guiana 0awild relative 0anatural hybridization 0amorphological variation 0aclonal propagation 0acrops1 aDAVID, PATRICE1 aDebain, Chantal.1 aMCKEY, DOYLE0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 July, v. 16, no. 14 p.3025-3038dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03340.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070708b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04335naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245012000195300001800315520245600333650001402789650002002803650001502823650001302838650001402851650002202865650001302887650001302900650002802913650001502941650001702956650002702973650002503000650002603025650001503051650001303066650003703079650002103116650001203137650001803149650002403167650001403191650001403205650001303219650001403232650002403246651001203270651001203282653002803294653002203322653002403344653002503368700002703393700002003420773011603440852000903556856007603565930003303641946001103674655001203685IND4390002120221120135707.0070401e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439000212DNAL7 a174029782pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03223.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGIORDANO, ANDREW R.14aThe influence of altitude and topography on genetic structure in the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactulym)  ap. 1625-1637.  aA primary goal of molecular ecology is to understand the influence of abiotic factors on the spatial distribution of genetic variation. Features including altitudinal clines, topography and landscape characteristics affect the proportion of suitable habitat, influence dispersal patterns, and ultimately structure genetic differentiation among populations. We studied the effects of altitude and topography on genetic variation of long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum), a geographically widespread amphibian species throughout northwestern North America. We focused on 10 low altitude sites (< 1200 m) and 11 high-altitude sites in northwestern Montana and determined multilocus genotypes for 549 individuals using seven microsatellite loci. We tested four hypotheses: (1) gene flow is limited between high- and low-altitude sites; and, (2) gene flow is limited among high-altitude sites due to harsh habitat and extreme topographical relief between sites; (3) low-altitude sites exhibit higher among-site gene flow due to frequent flooding events and low altitudinal relief; and (4) there is a negative correlation between altitude and genetic variation. Overall FST values were moderate (0.08611; P < 0.001). Pairwise FST estimates between high and low populations and a population graphing method supported the hypothesis that low-altitude and high-altitude sites, taken together, are genetically differentiated from each other. Also as predicted, gene flow is more prominent among low-altitude sites than high-altitude sites; low-altitude sites had a significantly lower FST (0.03995; P < 0.001) than high altitude sites (FST = 0.10271; P < 0.001). Use of Bayesian analysis of population structure (BAPS) resulted in delineation of 10 genetic groups, two among low-altitude populations and eight among high-altitude populations. In addition, within high altitude populations, basin-level genetic structuring was apparent. A nonequilibrium algorithm for detecting current migration rates supported these population distinctions. Finally, we also found a significant negative correlation between genetic diversity and altitude. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that topography and altitudinal gradients shape the spatial distribution of genetic variation in a species with a broad geographical range and diverse life history. Our study sheds light on which key factors limit dispersal and ultimately species' distributions. 3aAmbystoma 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3aintraspecific variation 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3asalamanders and newts 2aAlgorithms 2aAltitude 2aAmbystomaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aComputer Simulation 2aEcosystem 2aGene Flow 2aGenotype 2aGeography 2aPopulation Dynamics 3aMontana 0aMontana 0aAmbystoma macrodactylum 0agenetic structure 0alandscape influence 0along-toed salamander1 aRIDENHOUR, BENJAMIN J.1 aSTORFER, ANDREW0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 Apr., v. 16, no. 8 p.1625-1637dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03223.x3electronic resource  a20070401b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03965naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010800193300001600301520215100317650001802468650002502486650001902511650001402530650001002544650002002554650002202574650001502596650001102611650001502622650001302637650002502650650002402675650002002699650001502719650002202734650001402756650001402770650001302784650002402797650001202821650002802833650002502861650001502886650002102901650002502922650003102947650002302978650002403001650002303025653001203048653002003060773011403080852000903194856009203203930003303295946001103328655001203339IND4399345220221120135818.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439934522DNAL7 a181735012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03414.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCOLTMAN, DAVID W.10aMolecular ecological approaches to studying the evolutionary impact of selective harvesting in wildlife  ap. 221-235.  aHarvesting of wildlife populations by humans is usually targeted by sex, age or phenotypic criteria, and is therefore selective. Selective harvesting has the potential to elicit a genetic response from the target populations in several ways. First, selective harvesting may affect population demographic structure (age structure, sex ratio), which in turn may have consequences for effective population size and hence genetic diversity. Second, wildlife-harvesting regimes that use selective criteria based on phenotypic characteristics (e.g. minimum body size, horn length or antler size) have the potential to impose artificial selection on harvested populations. If there is heritable genetic variation for the target characteristic and harvesting occurs before the age of maturity, then an evolutionary response over time may ensue. Molecular ecological techniques offer ways to predict and detect genetic change in harvested populations, and therefore have great utility for effective wildlife management. Molecular markers can be used to assess the genetic structure of wildlife populations, and thereby assist in the prediction of genetic impacts by delineating evolutionarily meaningful management units. Genetic markers can be used for monitoring genetic diversity and changes in effective population size and breeding systems. Tracking evolutionary change at the phenotypic level in the wild through quantitative genetic analysis can be made possible by genetically determined pedigrees. Finally, advances in genome sequencing and bioinformatics offer the opportunity to study the molecular basis of phenotypic variation through trait mapping and candidate gene approaches. With this understanding, it could be possible to monitor the selective impacts of harvesting at a molecular level in the future. Effective wildlife management practice needs to consider more than the direct impact of harvesting on population dynamics. Programs that utilize molecular genetic tools will be better positioned to assess the long-term evolutionary impact of artificial selection on the evolutionary trajectory and viability of harvested populations. 3aage structure 3aartificial selection 3abioinformatics 3abody size 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aharvesting 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apedigree 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3asequence analysis 3asex ratio 3aviability 3awildlife 3awildlife management 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wildxgenetics 2aBiological Evolution 2aDemography 2aEcologyxmethods 2aGenetics, Population 2aMolecular Biologyxmethods 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSelection, Genetic 0ahunting 0awild population0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.221-235dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03414.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02986naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245013700124300001600261500001500277520163400292650001601926650002501942650001701967650001001984650001201994650002302006650002602029650002002055650002102075650002502096650001502121650004102136650002202177650001902199650002002218650002102238653001502259653001102274653001502285653001102300700001502311773011002326852000902436930003302445945001302478946001302491655001202504IND2053767220221120114845.0961028e199603  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205376722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, G.10aCholinephosphotransferase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase: Substrate specificities at a key branch point in seed lipid metabolism  ap. 923-931.  a2019-12-05  aMany oilseed plants accumulate triacylglycerols that contain unusual fatty acyl structures rather than the common 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids found in membrane lipids of these plants. In vitro experiments demonstrate that triacylglycerols are synthesized via diacylglycerols in microsomal preparations and that this same subcellular fraction is the site for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, which in seeds is synthesized from diacylglycerol by CDP-choline: diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. In microsomes from Cuphea lanceolata, a plant that accumulates fatty acids with 10 carbons and no double bonds (10:0) in its oil, the diacylglycerol acyltransferase exhibited 4-fold higher activity with 10:0/10:0 molecular species of diacylglycerol than with molecular species containing 18-carbon fatty acids. In castor bean (Ricinus communis), which accumulates oil containing ricinoleic acid, diricinoleoyldiacylglycerol was the favored substrate for triacylglycerol synthesis. In contrast to these modest specificities of the diacylglycerol acyltransferases, the cholinephosphotransferases from these plants and from safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) showed little or no specificity across a range of different diacylglycerol substrates. Consideration of these results and other data suggests that the targeting of unusual fatty acids to triacylglycerol synthesis and their exclusion from membrane lipids are not achieved on the basis of the diacylglycerol substrate specificities of the enzymes involved and may instead require the spatial separation of two different diacylglycerol pools. 3afatty acids 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3abiosynthesis 3aseeds 3acholine 3achemical reactions 3aquantitative analysis 3adiacylglycerols 3aRicinus communis 3abiochemical pathways 3amicrosomes 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3aCuphea lanceolata 3aBrassica napus 3aenzyme activity 3aacyltransferases 0ametabolism 0alipids 0asubstrates 0aCuphea1 aBrowse, J.0 tPlant physiology.g1996 Mar., v. 110, no. 3 p.923-931aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02364naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010800126300001600234520084300250650004301093650002401136650002201160650002001182650001301202650002501215650002201240650003101262650001701293650001401310650001101324650002601335650001301361650002401374650001301398650002001411653002401431653001701455653001601472653001301488653001401501653001501515653001101530653003201541653003401573700002001607700001701627773011001644852000901754930003301763945001301796946001301809655001201822IND2053764420221120114758.0961028e199603  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205376442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehta, R.A.10aTomato fruit carboxypeptidase.

The abundance and stability of wound-induced carboxypeptidase were developmentally regulated. Oxidative stress caused by cupric ions impaired the membrane permeability in the slices from pink fruit, resulting in leakage of the carboxypeptidase into the medium and in its redistribution in the cell. The patterns of carboxypeptidase activity did not parallel the cupric ion effect on ethylene levels. Immunogold electron microscopy studies indicated that the fruit carboxypeptidase is associated with electron-dense inclusions in the vacuole. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aprotein composition 3acarboxypeptidases 3aenzyme activity 3aripening 3adevelopmental stages 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aphysicochemical properties 3abiosynthesis 3aoxidation 3acopper 3amembrane permeability 3aethylene 3aimmunocytochemistry 3avacuoles 3astress response 0acell ultrastructure 0alocalization 0aion balance 0ainjuries 0ainduction 0asubstrates 0afruits 0adiisopropyl fluorophosphate 0aphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride1 aWarmbardt, R.D.1 aMattoo, A.K.0 tPlant physiology.g1996 Mar., v. 110, no. 3 p.883-892aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01744naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245005100130300001600181500001500197520087600212650001401088650001101102650001001113650001601123650001501139651001101154653001901165653001301184700001901197700001801216773009201234852000901326930003301335945001301368946001301381655001201394IND2046304520221120114851.0950602e199503  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204630452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChurchill, D.B.10aMethod for composting grass seed straw residue  ap. 275-279.  a2019-12-05  aLong and short straw from grass seed production fields were collected, formed into windrows, and turned with a commercial compost turner zero, two, four, or six times over a nine-month period.

Volume was reduced by as much as 88% for long-straw windrows and 80% for short-straw windrows. Near-maximum volume reductions were achieved with as few as four turns for the short straw and two turns for the long straw. Number of turns had a significant effect on the rate of volume reduction. Four or more turns were necessary to produce a compost product with a soil-like texture. Temperatures necessary to kill all seed contained in the compost were not achieved and use of the compost should be limited to situations where crop and weed seedlings are not a concern. 3aequipment 3avolume 3astraw 3atemperature 3acomposting 3aOregon 0aplant residues 0awindrows1 aBilsland, D.M.1 aElliott, L.F.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1995 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.275-279x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdGSO  aOther US 7aarticle02457naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007600126300001600202500001500218520158700233650001101820650001801831650002001849650001001869653001301879653002301892653001401915653001401929700001601943773009201959852000902051930003302060945001302093946001302106655001202119IND2046303620221120104934.0950602e199503  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204630362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzekici, B.10aManufacturing variation for various trickle irrigation on-line emitters  ap. 235-240.  a2019-12-05  aThe efficiency of trickle irrigation systems depends directly on the uniformity with which water is discharged from the emission devices throughout the system. Ideally, all emitters in the system should discharge equal amounts of water. One major cause of flow rate difference between two identical emitters from the same manufacturer is the manufacturing variation. This study compared manufacturers' rated discharges and coefficient of manufacturing variation values with tested values for various on-line emitters. Discharge rates from different types of trickle irrigation emitters were collected at five different pressure levels. Pressure compensating emitters were tested at 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 kPa (15, 21.8, 29.0, 36.3, and 43.5 psi). Nonpressure compensating emitters were tested at 75,100,125,150, and 175 kPa (10.9, 15, 18.1, 21.8, and 25.4 psi). Emitter discharge rates and coefficient of manufacturing variation were compared with manufacturers' specifications. At the suggested operating pressure of 100 kPa (15 psi) only 11 of the 17 emitters had flow rates within 10% to those claimed by the manufacturers. This was particularly true for the noncompensating emitters. Measured values of coefficient of manufacturing variation were higher than those specified by the manufacturers. High coefficients of manufacturing variation could result in low emission uniformities. Designs based on supplied data may deliver too little water to some plants and too much water to others. Designs should be based on reliable test data, not on manufacturer's supplied data. 3adesign 3amanufacturing 3amicroirrigation 3awater 0aemitters 0airrigation systems 0adischarge 0avariation1 aSneed, R.E.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1995 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.235-240x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdGSO  aOther US 7aarticle02556naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008400126300001600210520129000226650001901516650001501535650001501550650002101565650001601586650000701602650001201609650001401621650001201635650002001647650001201667650001501679650001801694650001801712650002001730650001801750650001501768653001301783653002101796653002301817653001201840700001801852700001401870773011001884852000901994930003302003945001302036946001302049655001202062IND2053752120221120104808.0961028e199603  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205375212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTassoni, A.10aPolyamine binding to plasma membrane vesicles isolated from zucchini hypocotyls  ap. 817-824.  aThe general features of [14C]spermidine binding to plasmalemma vesicles isolated from zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) etiolated hypocotyls are reported in the present paper. The specific interaction of the polyamine with the plasma membranes was reversible and thermolabile, since it decreased by about 50% in the assay performed at 40 degrees C compared to that carried out on ice. On the contrary, nonspecific binding was unaffected by temperature. Specific spermidine binding showed a pH dependence with a maximum at pH 8.0 and it reached saturation between 0.75 and 1 mM external spermidine concentration. The value of the dissociation constant calculated from Scatchard analysis was 4.4 X 10(-5) M. Specific spermidine interaction appeared to be sensitive to detergents and was markedly reduced by the presence of divalent cations, such as Mg2+ and Ca2+, whereas it was stimulated by monovalent cations. Polyamine binding sites were highly sensitive to pronase treatment. Competition experiments, performed using a series of compounds structurally related to spermidine, may provide some indication of the characteristics of spermidine binding sites. The results presented here suggest that specific spermidine binding occurs mainly with the protein component of the plasma membrane. 3aCucurbita pepo 3ahypocotyls 3aspermidine 3abinding proteins 3atemperature 3apH 3acations 3amagnesium 3acalcium 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3adetergents 3adose response 3aradiolabeling 3aplasma membrane 3abinding sites 3aetiolation 0avesicles 0adivalent cations 0amonovalent cations 0apronase1 aAntognoni, F.1 aBagni, N.0 tPlant physiology.g1996 Mar., v. 110, no. 3 p.817-824aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02952naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245013200123300001600255500001500271520138700286650001201673650000901685650001401694650001401708650001801722650002201740650002501762650002101787650003701808650002001845650001501865650001101880650001201891650001801903650001501921650001801936653001001954653001701964653001501981653001201996653001902008653001802027653001602045653002702061653001202088653001802100653001602118700001802134700001502152700001702167773011002184852000902294930003302303945001302336946001302349655001202362IND2053699820221120095638.0961024e199602  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205369982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, C.F.14aThe auxin transport inhibitor N-(1-naphthyl)phthalamic acid elicits pseudonodules on nonnodulating mutants of white sweetclover  ap. 501-510.  a2019-12-05  aThe collection of symbiotic (sym) mutants of white sweetclover (Melilotus alba Desr.) provides a developmental sequence of mutants blocked early in infection or nodule organogenesis. Mutant phenotypes include non-nodulating mutants that exhibit root-hair deformations in response to Rhizobium meliloti, mutants that form ineffective nodules lacking infection threads, and mutants that form infection threads and ineffective nodules. Mutant alleles from both the sym-1 and the sym-3 loci exhibited a non-nodulating phenotype in response to R. meliloti, although one allele in the sym-1 locus formed ineffective nodules at a low frequency. Spot-inoculation experiments on a non-nodulating allele in the sym-3 locus indicated that this mutant lacked cortical cell divisions following inoculation with R. meliloti. The auxin transport inhibitor N-(1-naphthyl)phthalamic acid elicited development of pseudonodules at a high frequency on all of the sweetclover sym mutants, including the nonnodulating mutants, in which the early nodulin ENOD2 was expressed. This suggests that N-(1-naphthyl)phthalamic acid activates cortical cell divisions by circumventing a secondary signal transduction event that is lacking in the non-nodulating sweetclover mutants. The sym-3 locus and possibly the sym-1 locus appear to be essential to early host plant responses essential to nodule organogenesis. 3aalleles 3aloci 3aphenotype 3asymbiosis 3aphthalic acid 3agenetic variation 3adevelopmental stages 3aEnsifer meliloti 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3agene expression 3aroot hairs 3aauxins 3amutants 3apathogenicity 3anodulation 3aorganogenesis 0agenes 0atransduction 0ainhibition 0asignals 0amelilotus alba 0amorphogenesis 0aderivatives 0aSinorhizobium meliloti 0anodules 0aplant anatomy 0aenod2 genes1 aDickstein, R.1 aCary, A.J.1 aNorris, J.H.0 tPlant physiology.g1996 Feb., v. 110, no. 2 p.501-510aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03882naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002100149245007800170300001600248500001500264520141200279650002201691650001401713650002101727650001101748650001901759650002301778650002201801650002101823650001101844650001401855650001501869650002401884650001901908650002201927650002001949650001701969650002501986650002002011650001802031650001502049650002502064650002402089650002602113650001802139650002302157650002102180650001602201650002302217650001902240650005802259650003102317650002802348650004402376650006002420650005202480650003002532650005102562650003402613653003502647653001902682653002402701653001702725653001702742653002802759653002302787653002502810653002002835700001902855773011002874852000902984930003302993945001303026946001303039655001203052IND2053701920221120095707.0961024e199602  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205370192DNAL7 a87423352pmid7 aPMC1577552pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunkelmann, J.R.10aAscorbate peroxidase. A prominent membrane protein in oilseed glyoxysomes  ap. 589-598.  a2019-12-05  aThe glyoxysomes of growing oilseed seedlings produce H2O2, a reactive oxygen species, during the beta-oxidation of lipids stored in the cotyledons. An expression library of dark-grown cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cotyledons was screened with antibodies that recognized a 31-kD glyoxysomal membrane polypeptide. A full-length cDNA clone (1258 bp) was isolated that encodes a 32-kD subunit of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) with a single, putative membrane-spanning region near the C-terminal end of the polypeptide. Internal amino acid sequence analysis of the cotton 31-kD polypeptide verified that this clone encoded this protein. This enzyme, designated gmAPX, was immunocytochemically and enzymatically localized to the glyoxysomal membrane in cotton cotyledons. The activity of monodehydroascorbate reductase, a protein that reduces monodehydroascorbate to ascorbate with NADH, also was detected in these membranes. The co-localization of gmAPX and monodehydroascorbate reductase within the glyoxysomal membrane likely reflects an essential pathway for scavenging reactive oxygen species and also provides a mechanism to regenerate NAD+ for the continued operation of the glyoxylate cycle and beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Immunological cross-reactivity of 30- to 32-kD proteins in glyoxysomal membranes of cucumber, sunflower, castor bean, and cotton indicate that gmAPX is common among oilseed species. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aseedlings 3aglyoxylate cycle 3alipids 3acell membranes 3aGossypium hirsutum 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aRicinus communis 3aclones 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3aprotein composition 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3acomplementary DNA 3aCucumis sativus 3agenetic code 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme activity 3aascorbic acid 3acotyledons 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscorbate Peroxidases 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Fractionation 2aCyanogen Bromide 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Complementary 2aImmunoblotting 2aMembrane Proteinsxanalysisxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aMicroscopy, Immunoelectron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrganellesxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aPeroxidasesxanalysisxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0amonodehydroascorbate reductase 0agenbank/u15933 0acell ultrastructure 0alocalization 0agmapx enzyme 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic regulation 0abiochemical pathways 0aoxidoreductases1 aTrelease, R.N.0 tPlant physiology.g1996 Feb., v. 110, no. 2 p.589-598aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02469naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245012200171300001400293500001500307520135900322650001801681650002201699650000901721650001201730650002001742650001801762650001501780653002701795700001501822700002901837773007101866852000901937856009201946930003302038945001302071946001102084655001202095IND2333127720221120085055.0030619e200202  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233312772DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00655.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Vich, B.10aInheritance of high palmitic acid content in the sunflower mutant CAS-12 and its relationship with high oleic content  ap. 49-56.  a2019-12-04  aCAS-12 is a sunflower mutant with increased levels of palmitic (C16:0 = 30%) and oleic (C18:1 = 55%) acids in its seed oil, hence it has a reduced linoleic acid content (C18:2 < 5%). This study was conducted to determine the inheritance of high C16:0 content and its relationship with high C18:1 content in CAS-12. Reciprocal crosses involving CAS-12, CAS-5 (high C16:0 content), HAOL-9 (high C18:1 content) and HA-89 (standard fatty acid profile) were made. The F1, F2 and BC1F1 generations were obtained. The genetic control of the high C16:0 trait in CAS-12 was partially recessive and gametophytic. In all cases, this character segregated in the ratio 19:38:7 (low:intermediate:high C16:0 content) in the F2 generation. These results, together with the lack of segregation for C16:0 content in crosses between CAS-12 and CAS-5, indicated that the genetic control of the high C16:0 trait in CAS-12 was similar to that in CAS-5 in being controlled by partially recessive alleles (p1, p2, and p3) at three loci. Crosses between HA-89 and CAS-12, and HAOL-9 and CAS-5 (segregating for C16:0 and C18:1) demonstrated that the high C16:0 and the high C18:1 traits were independently inherited. However, C18:1 segregation in these crosses exhibited reversal of dominance. Apparently, the low C18:1 parental lines carried modifier genes causing the deviation. 3asunflower oil 3aHelianthus annuus 3aloci 3amutants 3arecessive genes 3apalmitic acid 3aoleic acid 0along chain fatty acids1 aGarces, R.1 aFernandez-Martinez, J.M.0 tPlant breeding.g2002 Feb., v. 121, no. 1 p.49-56x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00655.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02597naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245012300172300001400295500001500309520125800324650001401582650001201596650002401608650002301632650002101655650001501676650002801691650002201719650001701741650001801758651001001776653001901786653003301805700001701838700001901855700001901874700001701893773007101910852000901981856009201990930003302082945001302115946001102128655001202139IND2333126720221120085031.0030619e200202  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233312672DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00657.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrocke, K. vom.10aFarmers' seed management practices open up new base populations for pearl millet breeding in a semi-arid zone of India  ap. 36-42.  a2019-12-04  aFarmers in western Rajasthan (north-west India) produce and maintain their landrace populations of pearl millet through their own distinct seed management practices. The objective of this study was to characterize morphological and agronomic variability of different traits between and within three farmers' populations using quantitative-genetic parameters. Populations examined were a typical landrace and two modified landraces, which were generated through farmer introgression of modern varieties with different levels of subsequent selection. From these three populations, 100 random full-sib progenies were evaluated in field trials at two locations in western Rajasthan over two years. Significant genetic variation existed within the three populations. Estimates of heritability were moderate to high for all observed traits. Predicted selection response for grain yield across environments was 1.6% for the typical landrace and 2.2% for both the modified landraces. Results suggest that the introgression of modern varieties into landraces had increased the genetic diversity. Therefore, farmers' current breeding activities could open up new resources for plant breeding programmes aiming at plant improvement for the semiarid zones of India. 3alandraces 3afarmers 3agenetic improvement 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aagronomic traits 3acrop yield 3aplant genetic resources 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3aintrogression 3aIndia 0aplant breeding 0aparticipatory plant breeding1 aPresterl, T.1 aChristinck, A.1 aWeltzien R, E.1 aGeiger, H.H.0 tPlant breeding.g2002 Feb., v. 121, no. 1 p.36-42x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00657.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01752naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010900170300001600279520064100295650002100936650001400957650003100971650002001002650002401022650002301046650001101069650001901080651001501099700001701114700001601131773007301147852000901220856009201229930003301321945001301354946001101367655001201378IND2332899320221120073314.0030604e200208  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233289932DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00721.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, M.A.10aInvestigations into the causes of segregation of Ogura male sterility in Bangladeshi cultivars of radish  ap. 354-356.  aIn a series of three experiments during 1998-99 and 1999-2000 at Gazipur, Bangladesh, the causes of segregation of Ogura cytoplasmic genetic male sterility in local cultivars of radish were studied. Male-sterile populations at the BC5 and BC6 generations were grown under a range of field temperatures for 2 years and the results on pollen fertility tests revealed that the expression of male sterility was not affected by temperature. Neither was a genotype-year interaction found. The unexpected segregation observed in the male-sterile backcross generations might be due to the presence of restorer alleles in the maintainer parents. 3aRaphanus sativus 3acultivars 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3aseasonal variation 3apollen 3amale fertility 3aBangladesh1 aMian, M.A.K.1 aRasul, M.G.0 tPlant breeding.g2002 Aug., v. 121, no. 4 p.354-356x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00721.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02225naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245013200169300001600301500001500317520103600332650003801368650001201406650003401418650001401452650003801466650001901504650003201523650002201555650001601577653002701593773007301620852000901693856009201702930003301794945001301827946001101840655001201851IND2332899720221120073233.0030604e200208  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233289972DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00711.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, M.H.10aFatty acid composition of resynthesized Brassica napus and trigenomic Brassica void of genes for erucic acid in their A genomes  ap. 357-359.  a2019-12-04  aThe fatty acid composition of seed oil of four interspecific hybrids, resulting from crosses between zero erucic acid Brassica rapa (AA), and high erucic acid Brassica alboglabra/Brassica oleracea (CC) and Brassica carinata (BBCC), void of erucic acid genes in their A-genomes was examined. The erucic acid content in resynthesized Brassica napus (AACC) lines derived from these crosses was only about half that of the high erucic acid CC genome parents, indicating equal contributions of the two genomes to oil (fatty acid) synthesis and accumulation. The differences in C18 fatty acid synthesis between the parents were also evident in the resulting resynthesized B. napus plants. Hexaploid Brassica plants of the genomic constitution AABBCC, in which the AA genome was incapable of erucic acid synthesis, had lower erucic acid contents than the B. carinata (BBCC) parent. This is plausible considering the fact that the zero erucic acid AA genome contributes to oil synthesis in AABBCC plants, thus reducing erucic acid content. 3aBrassica oleracea var. alboglabra 3ahybrids 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3aseed oils 3aBrassica rapa subsp. trilocularis 3aBrassica napus 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aBrassica carinata 3aerucic acid 0along chain fatty acids0 tPlant breeding.g2002 Aug., v. 121, no. 4 p.357-359x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00711.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02270naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245005400175300001600229500001500245520107400260650002201334650002401356650002101380650001201401650001801413650002201431650002101453650002501474650000901499653001901508653001501527653004201542700001501584700001801599773007301617852000901690856009201699930003301791945001301824946001101837655001201848IND2332899020221120073228.0030604e200208  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233289902DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00710.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadigannavar, A.M.10aGenetic base and diversity in groundnut genotypes  ap. 348-353.  a2019-12-04  aFor the last four decades, genetic improvement of groundnut by induced mutation and recombination breeding at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai, India, has led to the isolation of 61 distinct genotypes, of which eight have been released for commercial cultivation. The present study was undertaken to quantify the genetic base and study the diversity through coefficient of parentage and cluster analysis. Eight ancestors have contributed to the entire genetic base, and of these 'Spanish Improved', through its induced mutants and mutant derivatives, accounts for 67.7% coefficient of parentage, leading to a narrow genetic base. However, the genotypes used in this study exhibited considerable variability for vegetative, reproductive and agronomic traits. Cluster analysis indicated no relationship between clustering pattern and subspecies among genotypes during rainy or summer seasons. Despite this narrow base, greater diversity could be possible following judicious use of mutation and recombination breeding to bring about genetic improvement. 3aplant development 3agenetic improvement 3aagronomic traits 3amutants 3aharvest index 3agenetic variation 3aArachis hypogaea 3aphenotypic variation 3apods 0aplant breeding 0acrop yield 0aphenotypic coefficient of variability1 aKale, D.M.1 aMurty, G.S.S.0 tPlant breeding.g2002 Aug., v. 121, no. 4 p.348-353x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00710.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02716naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001500146245012400161300001800285500001500303520106900318650002001387650002201407650001201429650002501441650001901466650002201485650001701507650003301524650001201557650001901569650001601588650001401604650001701618650002901635650008601664650002101750650002001771650002201791653001701813653002801830653003601858653003101894700001701925700001501942700001601957700001501973773008401988852000902072930003302081945002502114946001102139655001202150IND4365441220221120063650.0041108e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436544122DNAL7 a155098462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHamada, T.10aCharacterization of a 200 kDa microtubule-associated protein of tobacco BY-2 cells, a member of the XMAP215/MOR1 family  ap. 1233-1242.  a2019-12-05  aA microtubule-associated protein composed of a 200 kDa polypeptide (MAP200) was isolated from tobacco-cultured BY-2 cells. Analysis of the partial amino acid sequence showed that MAP200 was identical to TMBP200, the tobacco MOR1/XMAP215 homolog. Although several homolog proteins in animal and yeast cells have been reported to promote MT dynamics in vitro, no such function has been reported for plant homologs. Turbidity measurements of tubulin solution suggested that MAP200 promoted tubulin polymerization, and analysis by dark-field microscopy revealed that this MAP increased both the number and length of microtubules (MTs). Electron microscopy and experiments using a chemical crosslinker demonstrated that MAP200 forms a complex with tubulin. Throughout the cell cycle, some MAP200 colocalized with MT structures, including cortical MTs, the preprophase band, spindle and phragmoplast, while some MAP200 was localized in areas lacking MTs. Based on our biochemical and immunofluorescence findings, the function of MAP200 in MT polymerization is discussed. 3aprotein binding 3asequence analysis 3atubulin 3aamino acid sequences 3acultured cells 3aNicotiana tabacum 3amicrotubules 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atobacco 3aplant proteins 2aBiopolymers 2aCell Line 2aDimerization 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMicrotubule-Associated Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Weight 2aProtein Binding 2aTobaccoxcytology 0apurification 0amolecular sequence data 0amicrotubule-associated proteins 0amicrotubule polymerization1 aIgarashi, H.1 aItoh, T.J.1 aShimmen, T.1 aSonobe, S.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2004 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.1233-1242x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a20051128b20051202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/11/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02923naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245010700166300001600273520154300289650002201832650001901854650001101873650001901884650002301903650002801926650002001954650001701974650001301991650000802004650001202012650001202024650002102036650002402057650002502081650003602106653001502142653001602157700001602173700002102189773007302210852000902283856009202292930003302384945001302417946001102430655001202441IND2332315920221120063648.0030430e200210  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233231592DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00699.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, X.10aEffectiveness of selection for quality traits during the early stage in the potato breeding population  ap. 441-444.  aPotato cultivars resistant to cold-temperature sweetening are of major importance to the processing industry producing both chips (crisps) and French fries. When most modern potato cultivars are maintained in cold storage to retard sprouting, the tubers accumulate reducing sugars, and the products become an unacceptable brown colour when fried. Selection for better processing quality during the early generations of a breeding programme could be of considerable advantage. Using a portable 'sugarmeter', which requires only a drop of sap from the tuber on a test strip, many samples can be efficiently surveyed for low sugar as early as the F1 generation. Using seedlings of three test crosses, glucose and specific gravity of field-grown tubers, minitubers from greenhouses and microtubers from in vitro culture were compared after cold treatment. Although the mean glucose levels of minitubers and microtubers were higher than field-grown tubers, the correlation between the glucose contents of the three types of tubers was fairly high. A considerable genetic improvement was noted when progenies were grown as minitubers or microtubers, even though the response to selection for low glucose levels in minitubers and microtubers was lower than from direct selection from field-grown tubers. The specific gravity of field-grown tubers showed a significant association with freshly harvested minitubers and microtubers. Selection for low glucose content in minitubers can therefore save considerable resources in a breeding programme. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atissue culture 3atubers 3aplant breeding 3aselection criteria 3afood processing quality 3astorage quality 3acold storage 3apotatoes 3asap 3aglucose 3asucrose 3aspecific gravity 3agenetic improvement 3aartificial selection 3achemical constituents of plants 0aminitubers 0amicrotubers1 aTai, G.C.C.1 aSeabrook, J.E.A.0 tPlant breeding.g2002 Oct., v. 121, no. 5 p.441-444x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.00699.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02067naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245007300168300001600241500001500257520089000272650002001162650001801182650001501200650001201215650001001227650001701237650001601254650001301270650002601283653002401309653001301333653002801346653002501374700001501399773007301414852000901487856009201496930003301588945001301621946001101634655001201645IND2331775920221120063529.0030403e200110  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233177592DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2001.00629.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArabi, M.I.10aIn vitro quantification of the reaction of barley to common root rot  ap. 451-453.  a2019-12-04  aAn in vitro technique was used to quantify the infection level of common root rot. This disease produces a brown to black discoloration of the subcrown internodes of barley. Quantification was based on the percentage of germinated infected pieces (1.5 mm) of subcrown internodes cultured on potato dextrose agar media. The disease severity was apparent among four different visually classified categories and numerical values for each category were applied. The results were highly correlated (r = 0.97, P < 0.01) among the different in vitro experiments, indicating that this testing procedure is repeatable. Highly significant differences (P < 0.001) were found for the length of first leaf and fresh weight between plants inoculated and uninoculated with common root rot. However, the effect of inoculation on fresh weight only differed significantly (P < 0.02) among the genotypes. 3aHordeum vulgare 3adiscoloration 3ainternodes 3atesting 3acolor 3apathogenesis 3ameasurement 3aroot rot 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 0asubcrown internodes 0ain vitro 0aexperimental infections 0aCochliobolus sativus1 aJawhar, M.0 tPlant breeding.g2001 Oct., v. 120, no. 5 p.451-453x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2001.00629.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02781naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002100153245008600174300001600260500001500276520142800291650001401719650001901733650001301752650001901765650002201784650001001806650002101816650002001837650002501857650002701882653001601909653001301925653002701938653002801965700001501993700001302008700001502021700001502036700001602051773007302067852000902140856009302149930003302242945001302275946001102288655001202299IND2332313920221120063736.0030430e200210  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233231392DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.745267.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKenzie, R.I.H.10aInheritance of resistance to wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana, in spring wheat  ap. 383-388.  a2019-12-04  aInheritance of resistance to a wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Gehin), was investigated in spring wheats derived from nine resistant winter wheat cultivars. F1 hybrids were obtained from crosses between resistant winter wheats and susceptible spring wheats, and used to generate doubled haploid populations. These populations segregated in a ratio of 1:1 resistant to susceptible, indicating that a single gene confers the resistance. The F2 progeny from an intercross among spring wheats derived from the nine resistance sources did not segregate for resistance. Therefore, the same gene confers resistance in all nine sources of resistance, although other genes probably affect expression because the level of resistance varied among lines. Heterozygous plants from five crosses between diverse susceptible and resistant spring wheat parents all showed intermediate levels of response, indicating that resistance is partly dominant. Susceptible plants were reliably discriminated from heterozygous or homozygous resistant ones in laboratory tests, based on the survival and development of wheat midge larvae on one or two spikes. This powerful resistance gene, designated Sml, is simply inherited and can be incorporated readily into breeding programmes for spring or winter wheat. However, the use of this gene by itself may lead to the evolution of a virulent population, once a resistant cultivar is widely grown. 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3ahaploidy 3aheterozygosity 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenes 3adoubled haploids 3apest resistance 3aincomplete dominance 3aSitodiplosis mosellana 0asegregation 0asm1 gene 0ainheritance (genetics) 0aspring and winter habit1 aLamb, R.J.1 aAung, T.1 aWise, I.L.1 aBarker, P.1 aOlfer, O.O.0 tPlant breeding.g2002 Oct., v. 121, no. 5 p.383-388x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.745267.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02116naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001500153245007900168300001600247520082700263650001301090650001901103650002001122650001901142650001001161650001401171650001101185650002701196650001401223650001601237653001201253653001401265653001601279653002301295653002801318700001701346700001701363700001801380700001601398773007301414852000901487856009301496930003301589945001301622946001101635655001201646IND2332317920221123012827.0030430e200210  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233231792DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.734333.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPascal, T.10aInheritance of green peach aphid resistance in the peach cultivar 'Rubira'  ap. 459-461.  aThe green peach aphid (GPA) is a serious pest of peach tree in many areas of the world. To date, only one GPA resistance gene has been assigned in peach. This study was initiated to determine the inheritance of GPA resistance in the red leaf peach rootstock cultivar 'Rubira'. Crosses were made between 'Rubira' and the susceptible green leaf peach rootstock cultivar 'Pamirskij 5'. Genetic analysis was performed on the parents, F1 and F2 progenies. Analyses of segregation patterns of plants in F1 (1:0) and F2 (3:1) indicated single dominant gene control of GPA resistance in 'Rubira'. Reddish spots, probably due to aphid feeding punctures, are associated with, but not themselves responsible for, the GPA resistance in 'Rubira'. No relationship was found between GPA resistance and the red leaf character of 'Rubira'. 3acrossing 3aPrunus persica 3apest resistance 3aMyzus persicae 3agenes 3acultivars 3aleaves 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aphenotype 3aantixenosis 0amarkers 0adominance 0asegregation 0ared leaf character 0areddish spots on leaves1 aPfeiffer, F.1 aKervella, J.1 aLacroze, J.P.1 aSauge, M.H.0 tPlant breeding.g2002 Oct., v. 121, no. 5 p.459-461x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2002.734333.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01471naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245005100161300001600212520059600228653002500824653001200849653002000861653001800881653001000899700001800909773010400927852000901031856008501040930003301125946001101158655001201169IND4429647620221123012740.0091207e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442964762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00292-009-1223-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhrens, P. 10aBRCA1- and BRCA2- associated breast carcinomas  ap. 207-209.  aBreast cancers with a genetic BRCA1-/BRCA2 background differ from each other and sporadic cases.

The two species of Chlorophytum, namely C. borivillianum and C. comosum, both with 2n = 28, reveal diversity for copy number and localization of rDNA sites. C. borivillianum is comprised of five 45S-rDNA sites:one each in the secondary constriction region of chromosomes 7, 8, 9; one in the subtelomeric region of the short arm of chromosome 2 and the telomeric region of the short arm of chromosome 12; and one 5S-rDNA site in the subtelomeric region of the long arm of chromosome 1. In C. comosum, there are three 45S-rDNA sites (one each in the short arm of chromosomes 12, 13, and 14) and two 5S-rDNA sites (in the secondary constriction regions of chromosomes 2 and 13). Fiber FISH analysis conducted on extended DNA fibers revealed variation in the size of continuous tandem strings for the two r-DNA families. Taking the standard value of native B DNA equivalent to 3.27 kb for 1 [micro]m, it was estimated that the physical size of continuous DNA strings is of the order of [approximately]90 kb, 180 kb, and 300 kb for 45S-rDNA and of the order of 60 kb, 150 kb for 5S-rDNA in C. comosum, grossly in correspondence to their respective physical sizes at metaphase. 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3akaryotyping 3atelomeres 3aribosomal DNA 3aChlorophytum comosum 3arepetitive sequences 3ametaphase 2aAsparagaceaexgenetics. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aKaryotyping 2aSpecies Specificity 0aIndia 0achromosomes 0aChlorophytum borivillianum 0aChlorophytum1 aBasu, S.1 aSrivastava, S.1 aMukai, Y.1 aLavania, S.0 tJournal of heredity.g2005 Mar., v. 96, no. 2 p.155-160x0022-15037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esi0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20050814b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/08/13  aOther US 7aarticle03093naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160100001400177245012100191300001600312520147400328650002301802650002701825650002301852650001901875650000901894650001901903650002101922650002501943650002201968650003201990650002502022650001902047650002502066650001302091650001702104650003702121650002602158651001102184653003402195653001802229700002002247700002502267700002102292773007702313852000902390856008102399930003302480945002502513946001302538655001202551IND4369170720221122230511.0050421e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436917072DNAL7 a156019072pmid7 a10.1093/jhered/esi0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The number of detected alleles per locus ranged from 6 to 33, with an average of 19.8 ± 9.2. The average expected heterozygosity was 0.86 ± 0.11 and the average PIC was 0.83 ± 0.16. Using only three loci, it was possible to discriminate all 192 individuals. The overall probability of identity considering all six EMBRA microsatellite markers combined was lower than 1 in 2 billion. An analysis of the sample size necessary to estimate expected heterozygosity with minimum variance indicated that at least 64 individuals have to be genotyped to characterize this parameter with adequate accuracy for most microsatellites in EUCALYPTUS: The high degree of multiallelism and the clear and simple codominant Mendelian inheritance of the set of microsatellites used provide an extremely powerful system for the unique identification of Eucalyptus individuals for fingerprinting purposes and parentage testing. 3aEucalyptus grandis 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agene frequency 3aloci 3aheterozygosity 3agenetic distance 3agenetic polymorphism 2aBreedingxmethods 2aDNA Fingerprintingxmethods 2aEucalyptusxgenetics 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aHeterozygote 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 0aBrazil 0aallele frequency distribution 0amultiallelism1 aCordeiro, C.

An accurate estimation of land surface temperature involves correction for both the atmospheric and the surface emissivity effect. Combined ground truth, radiosonde and remote sensing data from the HAPEX-Sahel experiment have been used to evaluate three existing AVHRR-based split-window models designed for land surface temperature estimation and an algorithm for emissivity difference estimation. Local or regional model coefficients have been determined on the basis of simulated AVHRR measurements. The applied model for the emissivity difference determination turned out to be very sensitive under situations with medium to high water vapour content. It was found that results from the three models compared well except at large view angles. In semi-arid regions with high atmospheric water vapour content the atmospheric effect accounts for almost 90% of the correction whereas the emissivity effect typically accounts for 10%. An absolute evaluation was not performed, but comparison with ground truth data showed that the model-predicted temperatures were well within the expected range. 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3ahydrology 3amodels 3amonitoring 3asemiarid zones 3aspatial data 3asurface temperature 3awater vapor0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Feb., v. 188/189, no. 1/4 p.788-814x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02154naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245012500170300001600295500001500311520074300326650002001069650002301089650001201112650001301124650001401137650001601151650001001167650000901177650000701186650001701193650001301210650002001223650001801243650001901261650001601280653000901296653001901305653000901324653002001333653001301353700001501366700001601381773007701397852000901474856009401483930003301577945001301610946001301623655001201636IND2202947420221122230402.0000309e199905  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220294742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1999.tb15083.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Y.L.10aTextural and sensory properties of low-fat beef sausages with added water and polysaccharides as affected by pH and salt  ap. 550-554.  a2019-12-04  aLow-fat beef sausages with 23% added water, 1 or 2.5% NaCl, 0.5 % polysaccharide gums, and pH adjusted to 5.2, 5.6 or 6.2, were analyzed for textural properties. The iota- and kappa-carrageenans increased (P < 0.05) cooking yield, hardness, and bind strength for 1%-salt sausage, but had little effect on the 2.5%-salt sausage. Sausages containing alginate, locust bean gum, and xanthan gum were softer, more deformable, crumbly and slippery (P < 0.05), when compared to nongum controls. An increase in pH sharply enhanced the bind strength in all gum treatments. Both the instrumental and sensory panel results suggested that alpha- and kappa-carrageenans were the only acceptable gums for use in low- or high-salt beef sausage products. 3alocust bean gum 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3ahardness 3aalginates 3acarrageenan 3awater 3abeef 3apH 3apalatability 3asausages 3asodium chloride 3alow fat foods 3afood additives 3axanthan gum 0agums 0acooking losses 0asalt 0apolysaccharides 0astrength1 aNoel, D.C.1 aMoody, W.G.0 tJournal of food science.g1999 , v. 64, no. 3 p.550-554x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1999.tb15083.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03395naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245010300134300001600237500014500253520205900398650001002457650001102467650001502478650001402493650002002507650001102527650001202538650001102550650004002561650002302601650001602624650001902640650002002659650002302679700001602702700001902718700001702737700001402754700001802768773008502786852000902871930003302880945001302913946001102926655001202937IND2060336620221122220242.0971029e199702  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206033662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Leeuwen, W.J.D.10aDeconvolution of remotely sensed spectral mixtures for retrieval of LAI, fAPAR and soil brightness  ap. 697-724.  aIn the special issue: HAPEX-Sahel / edited by J.P.

However, operational use of mixture models has been limited by a lack of biophysical interpretation of the results. The main objectives of this study were to relate the deconvolved components of a mixture model with biophysical properties of vegetation and soil at the surface and to apply the mixture model results to remotely sensed imagery. A radiative transfer model (SAIL: Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) was used to generate reflectance 'mixtures' from leaf and bare soil spectral measurements made at HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot Experiment) study sites. The SAIL model was used to create canopy reflectances and fractions of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) for a range of mixed targets with varying leaf area index (LAI) and soils. A spectral mixture model was used to deconvolve the simulated reflectance data into component fractions, which were then calibrated to the SAIL-generated LAI, fAPAR and soil brightness. The calibrated relationships were validated with observational ground data (LAI, fAPAR and reflectance) measured at the HAPEX Sahel fallow bush/grassland, fallow grassland and millet sites. Both the vegetation and soil component fractions were found to be dependent upon soil background brightness, such that inclusion of the soil fraction information significantly improved the derivation of vegetation biophysical parameters. Soil brightness was also shown to be a useful parameter to infer soil properties. The deconvolution methodology was then applied to a nadir image of a HAPEX-Sahel site measured by the Advanced Solid State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS). Site LAI and fAPAR were successfully estimated by combining the fractional estimates of vegetation and soils, obtained through deconvolution of the ASAS image, with the calibrated relationships between vegetation fraction, LAI and fAPAR, obtained from the SAIL data. 3aSahel 3acanopy 3agrasslands 3ahydrology 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3amillets 3amodels 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aradiative transfer 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asoil properties 3aspectroradiometers1 aHuete, A.R.1 aWalthall, C.L.1 aPrince, S.D.1 aBegue, A.1 aRoujean, J.L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Feb., v. 188/189, no. 1/4 p.697-724x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02220naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008700127300001600214500014500230520100100375650001101376650002101387650001801408650001401426650001201440650000901452650001301461650000901474700001401483700001801497700001501515700002001530700001601550700001601566700002001582700001701602700001601619773008501635852000901720930003301729945001301762946001101775655001201786IND2060330020221122220221.0971029e199702  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206033002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGash, J.H.C.14aThe variability of evaporation during the HAPEX-Sahel Intensive Observation Period  ap. 385-399.  aIn the special issue: HAPEX-Sahel / edited by J.P.

The trends in evaporative fraction over the IOP are also presented for eight sites. The high rate of evaporation from bare soil in the days following rainfall produces a variability in evaporation which makes differences between sites difficult to interpret on a day-to-day basis, but over the whole IOP it is shown that the millet uses a smaller proportion of the available energy for evaporation than the tiger bush or fallow savannah. The combined effect of differences in the total energy used and its partitioning into evaporation and sensible heat flux is demonstrated from the trends in cumulative total energy use and evaporation at the three southern sites, where it is shown that there is systematically less evaporation from the millet than from the savannah or tiger bush sites. 3aenergy 3aevaporation rate 3aheat transfer 3ahydrology 3amillets 3arain 3asavannas 3asoil1 aKabat, P.1 aMonteny, B.A.1 aAmadou, M.1 aBessemoulin, P.1 aBilling, H.1 aBlyth, E.M.1 aDeBruin, H.A.R.1 aElbers, J.A.1 aFriborg, T.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Feb., v. 188/189, no. 1/4 p.385-399x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03919naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011200126300001600238500014500254520238900399650001402788650001402802650001402816650001602830650002302846650002002869650001102889650002102900650002202921650001002943650001202953650002002965650002102985650001103006650001203017650001103029650004003040650000903080650001003089650001103099650001503110650002503125650002503150650001903175650001503194700001703209773008503226852000903311930003303320945001303353946001103366655001203377IND2060335620221122182804.0971029e199702  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206033562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanan, N.P.10aStomatal conductance of West-Central Supersite vegetation in HAPEX-Sahel: measurements and empirical models  ap. 536-562.  aIn the special issue: HAPEX-Sahel / edited by J.P. Goutorbe, A.J. Dolman, J.H.C. Gash, Y.H. Kerr, T. Lebel, S.D. Prince and J.N.M. Stricker.  aEmpirical relationships were derived to describe the climatic control of stomatal conductance for four of the most common species of the HAPEX-Sahel study area. These species included a C3 shrub (Guiera senegalensis), a C3 forb (Mitracarpus scaber), a C4 grass (Digitaria gayanus) and the most common crop of the area, millet (Pennisetum glaucum), which is also a C4 species. For all four species the controlling climate variables were photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil water potential, and their responses to these variables differed in a manner that was consistent with their different photosynthetic physiologies. Air temperature was not found to be a significant variable. Canopy average stomatal conductances were estimated from leaf-level measurements and then modelled in this paper. By relating the distribution of leaf-level stomatal conductances to light attenuation through the canopy it was shown that total PAR intercepted by the canopy, divided by leaf area index (LAI) (i.e. average PAR interception), can be used to estimate average stomatal conductance to a good approximation of the non-linear canopy integral as long as LAI variation in the measurements is small (e.g. less than 1.0). This assumes that the other environmental variables are constant through the canopy, but is significant in that it simplifies the procedure for the estimation of average stomatal conductance and canopy conductance (gc). The values of average stomatal conductance were limited by PAR availability for brief periods at sunrise and sunset and, for the two C4 species, there was evidence that shading within the canopy reduced the average values. However, the strongest diurnal variation was correlated with the increase in VPD, associated with increasing air temperature, which resulted in decreasing conductances during most of the day, following the peak in the early morning. The long-term decline in stomatal conductances following the last rainfall was associated with increasingly negative soil water potential. G. senegalensis retained its leaves through December with low but measurable stomatal conductances. Canopy conductances (gc) were estimated from average stomatal conductance and leaf area. Maximum values of gc occurred near the end of the rains, when environmental conditions were still near optimum and LAI was high. 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3aDigitaria 3aMitracarpus 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aair temperature 3acanopy 3aclimatic factors 3adiurnal variation 3aforbs 3agrasses 3aleaf area index 3aleaf conductance 3aleaves 3amillets 3amodels 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3arain 3ashade 3ashrubs 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3astomatal conductance 3avapor pressure 3avegetation1 aPrince, S.D.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Feb., v. 188/189, no. 1/4 p.536-562x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02556naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012700127300001600254500014500270520137800415650002301793650001101816650002601827650001101853650002301864650001901887650001901906650001501925650002201940650001501962650001801977650000901995700001502004773008502019852000902104930003302113945001302146946001102159655001202170IND2060329220221122182810.0971029e199702  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206032922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagagi, R.D.10aRetrieval of soil moisture and vegetation characteristics by use of ERS-1 wind scatterometer over arid and semi-arid areas  ap. 361-384.  aIn the special issue: HAPEX-Sahel / edited by J.P. Goutorbe, A.J. Dolman, J.H.C. Gash, Y.H. Kerr, T. Lebel, S.D. Prince and J.N.M. Stricker.  aThe aim of this study is to use the information provided by the ERS-1 wind scatterometer (WSC) over land surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments to infer soil moisture in the presence of vegetation. Driven by dielectric properties and surface roughness, the soil contribution is attenuated by a factor which depends on canopy characteristics (water content, shape, height, density) and scatterometer viewing conditions. To describe the influence of vegetation on the signal, a semi-empirical 'water-cloud' model (a first-order radiative transfer solution) was used. The optical thickness (tau) and the single scattering albedo (omega) are the parameters used to quantify vegetation contribution to the measured signal. Through a simulation analysis for different soil moisture and viewing (incidence angle) conditions, we show the importance of tau and omega on the signal partition between vegetation and soil contributions. To quantify the effect of vegetation on the signal, we used information on the green vegetation acquired from NOAA-AVHRR, visible and near-IR data combined with WSC satellite data in a water-cloud model to extract tau and omega. The temporal evolution of the various contributions to the signal was then compared for different angular ranges. This semi-empirical model was then applied within suitable angular ranges to retrieve soil moisture. 3aangle of incidence 3acanopy 3adielectric properties 3amodels 3aradiative transfer 3aremote sensing 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3asurface roughness 3avegetation 3awater content 3awind1 aKerr, Y.H.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Feb., v. 188/189, no. 1/4 p.361-384x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02749naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009300125300001600218520170200234650001301936650001301949650002001962650002601982650001402008650001502022650000702037650001802044650003102062650001702093650001702110650002002127650002402147651001602171700001402187773008402201852000902285930003302294945001302327946001102340655001202351IND2123472120221122122609.0980618e19971220ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212347212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtteia, O.10aParticle size distributions in waters from a karstic aquifer: from particles to colloids  ap. 102-119.  aWaters from the surface hydrologic network and the spring of a karstic aquifer in Switzerland were sampled to analyse their colloidal content. The measurements were done weekly with a single particle counter and were verified by other techniques. The particle size distribution (PSD) was modelled in two portions, below and above 5 micrometers, using two types of equation: a power law (Pareto distribution) and an exponential law. The model results matched well with the entire PSD data set by varying the parameter values. The parameters obtained from fitting the measured PSD curves were then interpreted in relation to environmental factors. It appears that the two parts of the curves vary independently. The first part of the PSD curve, relating to the smallest particles, is dependent on the pH value of the spring or the temperature of the surface brook. In contrast, the second part of the curve depends mostly on the spring discharge volume. During high flow events, the major effect of the discharge on particle size occurs during the rising limb of the hydrograph, interpreted as clays deposited in the aquifer and resuspended due to high water velocity. The contrasted behaviour of the two parts of the PSD curves suggested that the break point in the curves represents the limit between colloidal and particulate behaviour. Knowing these dependencies, and the characteristics of the particulate matter, allowed the estimation of the role of the colloids in contaminant transport. Large fluxes of suspended matter, specific to karstic aquifers, demonstrate the critical role of colloids in contaminant transport, which is markedly different from what typically occurs in porous media. 3aaquifers 3acolloids 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3ahydrograph 3apH 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticulates 3aporous media 3asprings (water) 3asurface temperature 3aSwitzerland1 aKozel, R.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Dec. 20, v. 201, no. 1/4 p.102-119x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02780naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009600172300001400268520133300282650002201615650001801637650001401655650001401669650002801683650002301711650002301734650001601757650001701773650002701790650001901817650002101836650002001857650002301877650002101900650001901921650003201940653002901972700001802001700002102019700001702040773007102057852000902128856009202137930003302229945001302262946001102275655001202286IND2333963020221122122536.0030820e200302  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233396302DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0523.2003.00774.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHappstadius, I.10aIdentification of Brassica oleracea germplasm with improved resistance to Verticillium wilt  ap. 30-34.  aTwo hundred and ninety-nine accessions representing 11 cultivar groups of Brassica oleracea and eight additional accessions of the wild species B. cretica, B. incana, B. insularis and B. villosa were screened for resistance to Verticillium wilt. A disease index (DI) was calculated for each accession, and a correction of the DI was carried out to compensate for a fluctuating infection level between 11 independent trials. A total of 235, or 77% of the accessions tested, had a DIcorr less or equal to the oilseed rape cv. 'Express' (DIcorr = 2.81), the reference cultivar. Only one accession of the wild species, B. incana, showed an enhanced level of resistance (DIcorr = 2.01). Twenty-four accessions, distributed over eight cultivar groups of B. oleracea were selected for subsequent crosses involving B. rapa. Hybrid plants with 14 accessions were resultant and seed was obtained from crosses where the cultivar groups acephala, alboglabra, botrytis, capitata, gemmifera, italica and sabellica were used as female parents. When progeny of the produced resynthesized rapeseed lines were evaluated for Verticillium wilt resistance, three lines showed a significantly lower disease index (P < 0.01) compared with the cv. 'Express'. This source of resistance is now being crossed to advanced breeding material of oilseed rape. 3aBrassica oleracea 3aBrassica rapa 3acultivars 3agermplasm 3aplant genetic resources 3agenetic resistance 3adisease resistance 3afungal wilt 3aVerticillium 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3awild relatives 3aBrassica cretica 3aBrassica incana 3aBrassica insularis 3aBrassica villosa 3aplant breeding 3ainterspecific hybridization 0averticillium longisporum1 aLjungberg, A.1 aKristiansson, B.1 aDixelius, C.0 tPlant breeding.g2003 Feb., v. 122, no. 1 p.30-34x0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0523.2003.00774.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02099naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245012200170300001600292520084500308650003701153650001201190650001601202650003701218650002801255650001501283650001401298650001801312650002001330650002001350650002101370650002501391700001801416700001601434773007701450852000901527856009401536930003301630945001301663946001301676655001201689IND2200976620221122084922.0991007e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220097662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1999.tb15899.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPripp, A.H.10aProteolysis in cheese curd as affected by subcellular fractions from Lactococcus, Lactobacillus and Propionibacterium  ap. 353-358.  aIntracellular fraction (IF) and cell wall-associated fraction (CWAF) from lactococci, lactobacilli and propionibacteria were added to cheese curd slurries according to a mixture design.

This study pertains to two of these lakes. 18O, 2H and chemical patterns in the pore water of the broad aquitard formed from sediment in these lakes indicate that the origin of this paleo-lake water was local meteoric water, which entered the ancient lakes as runoff, and groundwater from springs. Evaporation of surface water in the former Chalco Lake caused concentration of dissolved salts and enrichment in the heavy isotopes 18O and 2H. During high water periods, the south easternmost ancient Lake Chalco fed partially evaporated water to the closed Lake Texcoco, the lowest of the lakes, where further evaporation occurred causing higher concentration of salts and enrichment of heavy isotopes. These major ions and stable isotopes follow the evaporation trends characteristic of closed or nearly closed evaporatic basins elsewhere in the world. Paleo-lake evaporation lines in Lakes Chalco and Texcoco originated from the same starting water and developed as a consequence of the topographic position of the former lakes and local climatological conditions. A modern evaporation line developed after the drainage of the lakes, reflecting evaporation of modern infiltrating meteoric water. The presence of brackish pore water in most of the Chalco aquitard, which has a maximum thickness of 300 m, indicates that upward vertical groundwater flow has not been capable of displacing the paleo-lake water. This suggests that vertical advection was not significant throughout the hundreds of thousands of years of existence of the aquitard sediments. One-dimensional numerical simulations of the deeper part of the 18O profile representing the thicker part of the aquitard sediments, 140 m, showed that this profile was developed by molecular diffusion with a small upward advective flux, where apparently the Chalco aquitard always had enriched brackish water overlying the fresh water aquifer. 3aaquifers 3abasins 3abrackish water 3adrainage 3aevaporation 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aions 3alakes 3amathematical models 3arunoff 3asalts 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3asurface water 3awater salinity 3aMexico1 aCherry, J.A.1 aAravena, R.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Oct., v. 197, no. 1/4 p.47-69x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03090naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001400194245012200208300001600330500015000346500001500496520092800511650001001439650001401449650002201463650000901485650002301494650001401517650001301531650002201544650002001566650001001586650001901596650002501615650002101640650001201661650001801673650002301691650003401714650002701748650000901775650001301784650001501797650001401812650000901826650000901835650003701844650002801881650001001909650002701919650001001946650002801956650002101984653001202005653001802017653001502035700001602050700002002066700002002086773007702106852000902183856008102192930003302273945002502306946001302331655001202344IND4376165320221122050222.0051120e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437616532DNAL7 a159587952pmid7 a10.1093/jhered/esi0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Whereas high levels of uric acid are known to be caused by the silencing of the urate oxidase (uox) gene in humans and higher primates, the molecular basis for the Dalmatian defect is unknown. Transplantation studies show that the organ responsible for the Dalmatian phenotype is the liver, which is where urate oxidase is exclusively expressed and uric acid is converted into allantoin. We cloned and sequenced the canine uox cDNA and compared the sequence between a Dalmatian and non-Dalmatian dog. No change in cDNA sequence was identified. A Dalmatian x pointer backcross family was used to track the segregation of microsatellite markers surrounding the urate oxidase locus. The uox gene was excluded for Dalmatian hyperuricosuria based on the cDNA sequence identity and negative LOD scores. 3aurine 3auric acid 3acomplementary DNA 3adogs 3alinkage (genetics) 3aDalmatian 3acrossing 3agenetic disorders 3aoxidoreductases 3agenes 3aliver diseases 3anucleotide sequences 3agene segregation 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistry 2aDog Diseasesxgenetics 2aDogs 2aGenotype 2aInbreeding 2aLod Score 2aMale 2aMice 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPapio 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSwine 2aUrate Oxidasexgenetics 2aUric Acidxurine 0aPointer 0aurate oxidase 0adog breeds1 aLing, G.

The labeled substrates [13C,3H]GA12-aldehyde,[13C,3H]GA12,[14C4]GA53, [14C4/2H2]GA44 and [14C4/2H2]GA19 were fed individually to dwarf-5 vegetative shoots. Both [13C,3H]GA12-aldehyde and [13C,3H]GA12 were also added individually to normal shoots. The labeled metabolites were identified by full-scan gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Kovats retention indices. GA12-aldehyde was metabolized to GA53-aldehyde, GA12, GA53, GA44, and GA19; GA12 was metabolized to 2beta-hydroxy-GA12, GA53, 2beta-hydroxyGA53, GA44, 2beta-hydroxyGA44, and GA19; GA53, was metabolized to GA44, GA19, GA20, and GA1; GA44 was metabolized to GA19; and GA19 was metabolized to GA20. These results, together with previously published data from this laboratory, document the most completely defined gibberellin pathway for the vegetative tissues of higher plants. 3aZea mays 3abiosynthesis 3achemical reactions 3aradiolabeling 3aseedlings 3abiochemical pathways 3aspectral analysis 3agibberellins 3aaldehydes 3ametabolites 3ashoots 0ametabolism 0asubstrates1 aSpray, C.R.1 aPhenney, B.O.1 aGaskin, P.1 aMacMillan, J.0 tPlant physiology.g1996 Feb., v. 110, no. 2 p.413-418aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03617naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245016100194300001800355520177000373650001402143650001302157650001602170650002102186650000902207650001202216650001202228650001402240650001302254650001102267650002402278650001202302650004302314650002402357650001402381650001202395650001302407650001102420650001602431650004302447650001202490650000902502650001402511650001302525650002602538653002802564653002402592653002302616653002102639653002602660700002302686700002002709773011702729852000902846856009202855930003302947946001102980655001202991IND4399000820221122025055.0071216e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439900082DNAL7 a180283052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03592.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOSOKAWA, TAKAHIRO10aHow many symbionts are provided by mothers, acquired by offspring, and needed for successful vertical transmission in an obligate insect-bacterium mutualism  ap. 5316-5325.  aVertical symbiont transmission is among the most pivotal processes for maintenance of symbiotic associations. However, it is poorly understood whether and how the levels of resource allocation and investment upon vertical transmission are regulated. The stinkbug Megacopta punctatissima is obligatorily associated with the gut symbiotic bacterium 'Candidatus Ishikawaella capsulata', whose transmission is mediated by a unique mechanism called 'symbiont capsule'. We investigated the population dynamics of the symbiont during vertical transmission in the host-symbiont mutualism. The stinkbug mothers produced one capsule for around 3.6 eggs irrespective of clutch size, suggesting a strict maternal control over symbiont supply for the offspring. However, experimental manipulation of egg/capsule ratios revealed that one capsule is sufficient for symbiont transmission to six nymphs. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that a capsule contains 1.2 x 10⁸ symbionts, a newborn nymph possesses 2 x 10⁷ symbionts from a capsule, and thus one capsule certainly contains a sufficient amount of symbiont cells for six nymphs. These results indicated that the stinkbug mothers produce 1.7 times more symbiont capsules than needed. The newborn nymphs consistently harboured around 2 x 10⁷ symbionts, also suggesting a nymphal control over symbiont transmission. The threshold symbiont titre minimally needed for successful vertical transmission was estimated to be 1.9 x 10⁶ symbionts, which is only 1/10 of the actual symbiont titre detected in a newborn nymph. These results illuminate several ecological factors that may be relevant to parental and offspring controls over symbiotic resource allocation through host insect generations. 3aMegacopta 3abacteria 3aclutch size 3adigestive system 3aeggs 3ainsects 3amothers 3amutualism 3aneonates 3anymphs 3apopulation dynamics 3aprogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresource allocation 3asymbionts 2aAnimals 2aBacteria 2aFemale 2aGene Dosage 2aHeteropteraxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aMothers 2aOvum 2aPhenotype 2aPueraria 2aSymbiosisxphysiology 0agut symbiotic bacterium 0amaternal investment 0aplataspid stinkbug 0asymbiont capsule 0avertical transmission1 aKIKUCHI, YOSHITOMO1 aFUKATSU, TAKEMA0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 Dec., v. 16, no. 24 p.5316-5325dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03592.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071216b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02100naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002400144242007500168245007000243300001600313500002400329520085900353650002401212650002501236650001601261650001301277650000901290650001101299650001001310650001901320650002001339650002001359650001401379650000901393651001101402700001501413700001601428773013201444852000901576930003301585945002501618946001101643655001201654IND4375320620221122005929.0051019e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND437532062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this work, the aim was to perform a diagnostic of the agricultural situation in Hocaba, Yucatan, based on the knowledge of rural farmers and technicians, for designing solution options. In the municipality of Hocaba, farmers carry out, at least, four types of milpas: slash and burn milpa, cane milpa of first and second years, and corn with cover crops. According to 85% of the farmers, rain is the most important factor that limits agriculture in Hocaba, due to the characteristics of rain (one short season and frequency) and by the low water retention capacity of the soil. Fallow was the second cause (5%), the third was weeds (3%), and the fourth cause was soil fertility (3%), and soil type (1%). 3atraditional farming 3ashifting cultivation 3acover crops 3aZea mays 3acorn 3afallow 3aweeds 3asoil fertility 3acrop production 3adryland farming 3aSaccharum 3arain 3aMexico1 aGarcia, J.1 aMizrahi, A.0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2005 , v. 23, no. 4 p.571-580x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a20051128b20051202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02578naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001900161242008300180245007600263300001600339500002400355500001500379520109400394650003701488650002101525650002701546650001801573650002701591650002301618650001601641650002901657650002001686650001501706650002401721651001101745653002401756700002401780700002001804700002401824700002601848773013201874852000902006930003302015945002502048946001102073655001202084IND4375320720221122005926.0051019e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND437532072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

During the last years, biofertilizers have been used to improve nutrient and water uptake; however, results have been inconsistent. The present work was carried out to evaluate sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) response to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus and foliar application of brassinosteroids under field conditions. In addition to the treatments, 45 kg ha(-1) P were applied to the soil. Results showed different P uptake of sorghum plants to treatments of biofertilizers. Glomus intraradices, alone or combined with CINVESTAV-4 (a mycorrhizal complex), registered the highest concentrations of foliar P. Addition of P to the soil had no influence on the evaluated parameters nor on mycorrhizal colonization. However, different response in grain yield was observed between biofertilizers and P level. G. fasciculatum and CINVESTAV-4 had the highest grain yields without P and G. intraradices was not affected by the application on soil of P. 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3abrassinosteroids 3afertilizer application 3agrain sorghum 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3afoliar application 3agrain yield 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3aSorghum bicolor 3aphosphorus 3aorganic fertilizers 3aMexico 0aGlomus intraradices1 aPecina-Quintero, V.1 aDiaz-Franco, A.1 aWilliams-Alanis, H.1 aRamirez-de Leon, J.A.0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2005 , v. 23, no. 4 p.581-586x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a20051128b20051202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02606naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002500144242010500169245011600274300001600390500002400406500001500430520112000445650002501565650002301590650002401613650001701637650002001654650002301674650001901697650001601716650002001732651001101752653002601763653001901789653001301808700002701821700002001848700002001868700002601888773013201914852000902046930003302055945002502088946001102113655001202124IND4375319320221121235601.0051019e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND437531932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In order to evaluate its physiological status under current environmental conditions, water potential (psi(w)), photosynthesis rate (F(n)), and stomatal conductance (g(s)) were periodically monitored over one year, using a young tree of the same species located nearby as reference. Results showed that the old Tule tree maintains favorable physiological conditions as compared to the young tree, but is very sensitive to seasonal changes in water availability. It was found that a critical period for the Tule tree is from November to February, associated with a lower level of the water table, greater decrease in diurnal psi(w), and retarded recovery at night. F(n) and g(s) also changed seasonally in response both to soil moisture conditions and vapor pressure deficit, but these changes were not strongly related to psi(w) of the trees. 3astomatal conductance 3asoil water content 3aTaxodium mucronatum 3awater stress 3atree physiology 3aseasonal variation 3aphotosynthesis 3awater table 3awater potential 3aMexico 0aplant-water relations 0ahistoric trees 0aTaxodium1 aVargas-Hernandez, J.J.1 aTrejo-Lopez, C.1 aLopez-Upton, J.1 aVelazquez-Mendoza, J.0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2005 , v. 23, no. 4 p.515-522x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a20051128b20051202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02305naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005800127300001400185520133500199650002601534650000801560650001101568650001601579650001801595650001201613650001801625650001401643650001501657650001101672650001101683650001101694650002401705650001801729700001501747773007901762852000901841930003301850945001301883946001101896655001201907IND2058984520221121162428.0970814e199706  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205898452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaap, M.G.10aForest floor evaporation in a dense Douglas fir stand  ap. 97-13.  aForest floor evaporation was measured with an accurate weighing lysimeter during 44 days in early spring and summer. The Penman-Monteith approach was used to model the evaporation rates as well as the temperature difference between forest floor surface and air at 1 m height. Values of resistance parameters were slightly different when the Penman-Monteith model was optimized for measured evaporation rates or for measured temperature differences. These discrepancies were partly due to field variability in forest floor water contents but also because our approach considered the forest floor to be isothermal. With the appropriate parameter sets, the model was able to predict measured hourly forest floor evaporation rates and surface temperature dynamics satisfactorily. We show that in the forest discussed in this paper the Penman-Monteith ventilation term dominates over the available energy term. As a result the evaporation flux is matched by an almost equal, sensible heat flux but in opposite direction. Forest floor water content dynamics have a strong control over the evaporation flux. Spatial variability in forest floor water contents cause the 44-day average forest floor evaporation to range from 0.19 mm d-1 in a dry pan of the forest to 0.3 mm d-1 in a wet pan with 0.23 mm d-1 as a site representative value. 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aair 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3aforest litter 3aforests 3aheat transfer 3ahydrology 3alysimeters 3amodels 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3awater content1 aBouten, W.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 June, v. 193, no. 1/4 p.97-13x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02040naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010300128300001400231520103100245650003001276650001601306650001401322650002501336651001001361651001801371651001001389651001901399651001201418700001501430700001501445700001401460700001801474700001701492773007901509852000901588930003301597945001301630946001101643655001201654IND2058874020221121162348.0970808e199704  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205887402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaturel, J.E.10aClimatic variability in humid Africa along the Gulf of Guinea. II. An integrated regional approach  ap. 16-36.  aThe analysis presented here deals with the annual precipitation levels and the number of rainy days a year as observed in several countries located along the Gulf of Guinea (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria) during the decades from the 1950s to the 1980s. The study is based on a set of methods used both for the interpolation and the cartographic representation of the results as well as on statistical methods for the detection of breaks in the time series. It is possible through them to underscore a climatic variability at the regional level at the end of the 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s, with, however, an important variability in space of the intensity of the phenomenon. The conclusions drawn previously from the study conducted on Cote d'Ivoire do not constitute a unique case. Generally speaking, it can be asserted that the whole region of humid west Africa was affected by a climatic accident that is comparable and in line with what was observed further to the north, in the Sahelian region. 3aatmospheric precipitation 3ahumid zones 3ahydrology 3atime series analysis 3aBenin 3aCote d'Ivoire 3aGhana 3aGulf of Guinea 3aNigeria1 aServat, E.1 aKouame, B.1 aLubes, H.1 aOuedraogo, M.1 aMasson, J.M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Apr., v. 191, no. 1/4 p.16-36x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle03143naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010000127300001600227520201500243650002102258650001402279650001402293650001002307650001902317650001902336650001502355650001702370650001302387650002102400650001302421650001502434650002302449650001202472650001702484650003002501650001502531700001602546773008102562852000902643930003302652945001302685946001102698655001202709IND2058877320221121162453.0970808e199704  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205887732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtle, J.M.14aThe influence of artificial macropores on water and solute transport in laboratory soil columns  ap. 290-314.  aThe role of macropores in infiltration through a sandy loam was studied using laboratory columns pretreated with water possessing a delta 18O signature of -8.7 per thousand and 15 mg l-1 Cl-. A simulated snowmelt pulse of delta 18O-depleted water containing 1100 mg l-1 Cl- was added to a control column and two columns containing a single vertical macropore, one continuous and the other discontinuous. Macropores were formed in situ by disintegration of a biodegradable foam thread inserted during column packing. Macropores were 2 mm in diameter, which has been suggested to be the threshold for significant macropore flow given the soil's mean textural pore diameter of 0.41 mm. Meltwater was flushed from the columns by adding two pore volumes of isotopically enriched water containing 15 mg l-1 Cl- at a rate of 17.2 mm day-1. Tensiometers, time domain reflectometry probes and suction samplers were used to monitor matric potential, soil water content and soil water chemistry at 0.1 m intervals down the columns. Column effluent was sampled daily for delta 18O and Cl-. Mobile soil water contents (theta m) and dispersivities (epsilon) were estimated by fitting a one-dimensional analytical solution of the convection-dispersion equation to Cl- breakthrough curves (BTCs). Thetam increased with depth in all columns, whereas only the discontinuous macropore column showed an increase in epsilon with flow length. Cl- and delta 18O breakthrough occurred earlier at all depths in the macropore columns relative to the control, resulting in larger epsilon values for macroporous soil. Epsilon for a given flow length tended to be greatest in the discontinuous macropore column, reflecting the role of internal catchment processes. Macropore presence was associated with decreased thetam during infiltration and bimodal BTCs in column effluent. The threshold ratio of macropore-to-micropore diameters at which macropores exert a detectable influence on water transport must be less than that examined here. 3abiodegradability 3achlorides 3aequations 3afoams 3ahydrochemistry 3amacropore flow 3amacropores 3aporous media 3asamplers 3asandy loam soils 3asnowmelt 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asolutes 3atensiometers 3atime domain reflectometry 3awatersheds1 aLeigh, D.G.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Apr., v. 191, no. 1/4 p.290-314x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle01394naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008600125300001600211520057900227650001300806650002400819650001600843650002100859650002500880650002200905700001800927773008100945852000901026930003301035945001301068946001101081655001201092IND2058876820221121132336.0970808e199704  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205887682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, P.G.10aRecent advances in dating young groundwater: chlorofluorocarbons, 3H/3He and 85Kr  ap. 245-265.  aChlorofluorocarbons 3H/3He and 85Kr are tracers of atmospheric origin that can be used to date groundwater over periods from 0 to 40 years.

The physiological control on transpiration is formulated using canopy resistance defined as a function of the net assimilation rate, the relative humidity and CO2 concentration at the leaf surface. Rainfall infiltration, runoff and redistribution are simulated with the Richards equation and evapotranspiration is calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation. Two innovative features of the model are (1) coupling of the vegetation-atmosphere system by changing the value of the vapour pressure deficit of air in the canopy, and (2) the plant carbon balance, which allows the simulation of plant growth using a saturation rate kinetics formulation The model was validated using evapotranspiration. soil moisture and leaf area index measurements from Wagga Wagga, N.S.W., Australia, for a period of 1992-1993. The calculated evapotranspiration was in good agreement with the observations. The soil moisture content at various depths was well simulated for two typical sites. The model also reasonably reproduced leaf area index of wheat and canola for two growing seasons. The success of the model simulations was due to the reasonably realistic treatment of the soil and canopy processes. The sensitivity analysis indicated that (1) the maximum assimilation rate of carbon affects canopy transpiration significantly, and (2) the total drainage is sensitive to the lower boundary conditions and the saturated hydraulic conductivity. TOPOG IRM is a valuable tool in studying catchment responses under different land management practices. However, the application of the model is limited by the large amount of data required regarding soil and vegetation properties, and their spatial distribution. 3aair 3acanola 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adrainage 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3agrowing season 3aland management 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3anet assimilation rate 3aplant growth 3arain 3arelative humidity 3arunoff 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atranspiration 3avapor pressure 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3awheat 3aAustralia1 aZhang, L.1 aHatton, T.J.1 aReece, P.H.1 aBeale, G.T.H.1 aPacker, I.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Apr., v. 191, no. 1/4 p.64-86x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02489naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002400144242007200168245007900240300001600319500002400335520119700359650001001556650001701566650001801583650001701601650001301618650001501631650001401646650001301660650001801673650001401691650001901705650002401724650001201748651001101760700002601771700002401797773013201821852000901953930003301962945002501995946001102020655001202031IND4369065820221121065516.0050418e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND436906582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

During June 1999, 500 plants of blackberry cv. Cheyenne were planted in Guerrero Valley, Chihuahua, Mexico. Distances were 1.5 m between rows and 1 m between plants. The area is temperate with temperatures of -20 degrees C in winter. The soil is shallow (40 cm depth) and sandy and has low fertility (0.253% organic matter), with furrow irrigation. In March 2000, the following treatments were applied in two lines 50 m each: 1) 3 kg of dry manure plant(-1) plus oat straw mulching, 15 cm thick; 2) 3 kg of dry manure plant(-1) plus pine sawdust mulching, 15 cm thick; and 3) 3 kg of dry manure plant(-1). Results showed that the flowering of blackberry cv. Cheyenne evades late frost. The period between flowering and fruit ready to harvest was 47 to 55 days. Average fruit weight was 4.5 g. The harvest period is from the third week of June to the third week of August. Dry manure plus oat straw resulted in the best cane growth, fructification, and yield. All treatments increased the content of organic matter in soil. 3aRubus 3ablackberries 3afruit growing 3aplant growth 3afruiting 3acrop yield 3aphenology 3amulching 3astraw mulches 3aoat straw 3aanimal manures 3asoil organic matter 3asawdust 3aMexico1 aAcosa-Rodriguez, G.F.1 aArreola-Avila, J.G.0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2005 , v. 23, no. 2 p.233-240x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02531naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002200161242006800183245007600251300001600327500002400343520137200367650002901739650002201768650001501790650002201805650002301827650002101850700002301871700002001894700002101914773013201935852000902067930003302076945002502109946001102134655001202145IND4369065520221121065548.0050418e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND436906552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In the technical context, there is no contrasted field methodology or mathematical model to evaluate the conduction efficiency in its component of in infiltration losses. This work developed a methodology based on the bi-dimensional equation of Richards for modeling water transference in the soil, to estimate losses by infiltration in soil channels. To solve this equation, the finite element method was applied, multiplying the equation by a weight function and integrating it using Green's theorem, on the domain of the limited solution by boundary conditions, and transforming that domain into small triangles, which constitute the finite elements. The process was simulated and evaluated using the geometric, hydraulic, hydrodynamic, and operational characteristics of the soil channel Antonio Coria, of the Irrigation District 011, Alto Lerma, Guanajuato, Mexico. The results obtained with the model are congruent with the observations and measurements in the field. Therefore the methodology can be used as a tool to estimate infiltration losses in soil channels, and to consider this variable in the development of water extraction and distribution programs in irrigation systems. 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3airrigation canals 3airrigation 3airrigated farming 3aRichards' equation 3airrigation water1 aPalacios-Velez, E.1 aMejia-Saenz, E.1 aRuiz-Carmona, V.0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2005 , v. 23, no. 2 p.213-223x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02527naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100002000178242010800198245011000306300001600416500002400432500001500456520077700471650002001248650001301268650002401281650002801305650002201333650001901355650002701374650002401401650002501425650002601450650000901476650002701485650002701512650001901539650002001558650001501578653003101593653002901624653002701653700002601680700002401706700002101730773013201751852000901883930003301892945002501925946001101950655001201961IND4369066220221121065552.0050418e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND436906622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Organic matter, available P, exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, pH, drought index, and disease index were used as potential diagnostic factors. Nine field experiments conducted in years 1993 to 1995 provided both the observed optimum rates and values of the uncontrolled factors. 3acrop production 3aZea mays 3amathematical models 3afertilizer requirements 3aeconomic analysis 3asoil nutrients 3afertilizer application 3asoil organic matter 3aexchangeable calcium 3anutrient availability 3acorn 3aexchangeable potassium 3aexchangeable magnesium 3asoil fertility 3aNPK fertilizers 3aphosphorus 0amathematics and statistics 0adiscrete additive models 0abinomial approximation1 aTurrent-Fernandez, A.1 aCortes-Flores, J.I.1 aVolke-Haller, V.0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2005 , v. 23, no. 2 p.249-256x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02199naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007500129300001600204500001500220520109400235650001901329650001401348650002401362650002201386650001501408650001401423650000901437650002101446650001201467650002101479650001501500650001501515653001801530700001701548700002001565700001601585700001701601773008101618852000901699930003301708945001301741946001101754655001201765IND2061189620221121065659.0980109e199710  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206118962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBemporad, G.A.12aA distributed approach for sediment yield evaluation in alpine regions  ap. 370-392.  a2019-12-05  aA distributed model for the simulation of the water budget and prediction of the sediment yield in Alpine catchments is presented. The strongly variable landscape typical of Alpine regions was schematically represented through a raster of square cells. The hydrological phenomena were modelled at this cell scale. A well-gauged Alpine catchment was selected to validate the model. A catchment digital terrain model (DTM) was created through an automatic treatment of the catchment contour lines, selected stream lines, and soil and vegetation cover maps. Water and sediment routing to the catchment outlet was performed by integrating simplified versions of the equations of continuity and motion for both water and sediment. The governing equations were integrated and calibrated on a monthly time scale by using available field data on rainfall, discharge and sediment yield at the catchment outlet. The numerical simulations showed that the proposed mathematical model was able to adequately simulate the water and sediment budgets of the test catchment on a yearly and a monthly scale. 3asediment yield 3asediments 3ameteorological data 3asimulation models 3alandscapes 3aequations 3asoil 3amodel validation 3astreams 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds 3aprediction 0awater balance1 aAlterach, J.1 aAmighetti, F.F.1 aPeviani, M.1 aSaccardo, I.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Oct., v. 197, no. 1/4 p.370-392x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle02730naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012300124300001600247500014500263500001500408520146500423650002301888650001201911650001201923650001801935650001301953650001001966650000901976650001201985650001401997650001302011650002002024650001002044650001602054651001002070653001902080700001602099700001802115773008502133852000902218930003302227945001302260946001102273655001202284IND2060325620221121065615.0971029e199702  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206032562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeduc, C.10aWater table fluctuation and recharge in semi-arid climate: some results of the HAPEX-Sahel hydrodynamic survey (Niger)  ap. 123-138.  aIn the special issue: HAPEX-Sahel / edited by J.P.

Stricker.  a2019-12-05  aGroundwater level measurements taken over a 4-year period from an extensive network of wells and boreholes within the HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrologic Atmospheric Pilot Experiment in the Sahel) degree square (south Niger), together with existing data, have provided an insight into infiltration and recharge processes taking place in the porous phreatic aquifer of the Continental Terminal formation. Despite high spatial and temporal variability of aquifer response to rainfall (rises of between 0 and 9 m are recorded), a pattern of recharge can be recognised. Aquifer responses vary from site to site, but the type of response at any single point tends to be consistent from year to year. Recharge is dominated by infiltration from temporary drainage networks (pools and streams) and aquifer response depends to a large extent on aquifer hydraulic characteristics and distance from the nearest infiltrating zone. In many wells, for which data extending back to 1987 is available, water levels show a consistent year by year rise. This is interpreted as a process of aquifer recovery following the severe drought of the 1970s and early 1980s, though part may also be attributable to changing patterns of land management (e.g. woodland clearance). Initial estimates of regional recharge are from 50-60 mm year-1, or in other words about 10% of annual rainfall. The figure is supported by other methods of investigation (hydrochemical analyses; water budgets of pools). 3atemporal variation 3asurveys 3adrought 3ahydrodynamics 3aaquifers 3aSahel 3arain 3astreams 3awoodlands 3adrainage 3aland management 3awells 3awater table 3aNiger 0asemiarid zones1 aBromley, J.1 aSchroeter, P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1997 Feb., v. 188/189, no. 1/4 p.123-138x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle01754naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245008900173300001600262520067400278650002400952650001300976650001700989650001901006650001001025650001101035650001201046650001401058650001901072653003601091700001401127773007701141852000901218856009401227930003301321945001301354946001301367655001201380IND2202942020221121054712.0000309e199905  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220294202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1999.tb15066.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZasypkin, D.V.10aExtracellular ice nucleators from Pantoea ananas: effects on freezing of model foods  ap. 473-478.  aParameters of freezing of sucrose solutions and emulsions were evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at cooling rates of 1 to 20 degrees C/min. The differential and cumulative nucleation spectra of extracellular ice nucleators (ECINs) were established using a w/o emulsion technique. Freezing curves were obtained in a cabinet at -7 and -12 degrees C. The ECINs increased the ice nucleation temperature and reduced the time of the supercooling stage. Although the time of phase transition increased in the presence of ECINs, the total time of freezing decreased. The ECINs caused lower onset temperatures of freezing as compared to the original cells. 3aPantoea agglomerans 3afreezing 3afood storage 3afrozen storage 3afoods 3amodels 3asucrose 3aemulsions 3aice nucleation 0aerwinia herbicola subsp. ananas1 aLee, T.C.0 tJournal of food science.g1999 , v. 64, no. 3 p.473-478x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1999.tb15066.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02067naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001300154245010100167300001600268500001500284520069200299650001300991650001701004650001301021650001201034650001501046650001601061650001901077650002701096650002001123650002301143650001301166650001601179650001401195650001201209650002901221653001301250653002701263653001601290700001101306700001701317773007701334852000901411856009401420930003301514945001301547946001301560655001201573IND2202941920221121054812.0000309e199905  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220294192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1999.tb15065.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Z.10aAntibacterial efficacy of electrochemically activated solution for poultry spraying and chilling  ap. 469-472.  a2019-12-04  aAn electrochemically activated solution (EAS) was evaluated for its antibacterial efficacy against Salmonella typhimurium on chicken carcasses during inside/outside (I/O) birdwasher spraying at 20 degrees C and 413 kPa for 17s and chilling at 4 degrees C for 45 min in a pilot plant.

Research objectives were to evaluate effectiveness of gluten and cysteine addition in improving properties of soy protein-based films. Thickness, mechanical, and barrier properties were evaluated. Gluten addition and pH 3.0 lowered water vapor permeability and thickness. Mechanical properties were enhanced at pH 7.0 with cysteine addition. Cysteine increased tensile strength of some treatments due to increase in disulfide bond formation. Best compromise between barrier and mechanical properties was observed for the cysteine-added soy:gluten (4:1) film at pH 7.0.

These scions do not require photosynthesis nor receive photosynthates from the rootstock during union development. Carbohydrate and neutral lipid contents, along with respiration and scion water relations, were measured during union development. Stored carbon compounds were sufficient to supply the needs of the scion during the 9 weeks of union development. Estimates of carbohydrate use indicated that decreases in sugar content (bark and needle) were insufficient to account for more than 25% of the estimated respiration. The results indicate that the quantity of carbon storage compounds is not a factor in graft success. We propose that neutral lipids may be the major carbon reserve of the scion during graft formation. 3ametabolism 3acarbohydrates 3atriacylglycerols 3ascions 3aPicea pungens 3astorage 0adevelopment 0awater relations 0arespiration 0alipids 0aunions1 aProebsting, W.M.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1988 Sept., v. 113, no. 5 p.800-805wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880909c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02331naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245009400131300001600225500002400241520141200265650001201677650001401689651001501703653003401718653007301752653002401825700001901849773008801868852000901956939003301965945000801998946001102006655001202017991609188860742620221120231927.0840813s1981    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840051682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZdarska, Z.10aHistochemistry of the sporocyst and metacercaria of Leucochloridium paradoxum Carus, 1833  ap. 221-226.  aSummary in Russian.  aThe contents of mucosubstances and proteins and activity of some enzymes in the sporocyst and metacercaria of L. paradoxum were studied by histochemical methods. The enormously high glycocalyx on the surface of metacercaria tegument contained neutral mucosubstances, acid mucosubstances with COOH- and sulphogroups and proteins with tyrosine and tryptophan. Gland cells showing a strong positive reaction for tyrosine, tryptophan and cystine were demonstrated for the first time in the body of metacercaria. A high activity of non-specific esterase was detected in its nerve system. The wall of the intestinal branches gave a strong positive reaction for neutral mucosubstances, acid mucosubstances with sulphogroups, proteins with tryptophan, tyrosine, cystine and cysteine. It exhibited a high activity of acid phosphatase and low activity of non-specific esterase. A high activity of non-specific esterase was localized in the sporocyst wall in the inner layer of the central branched portion. The inner limiting layer of pigmented sacs contained neutral mucosubstances, acid mucosubstances with sulphogroups and proteins with cystine, cysteine, tyrosine and tryptophan. Pigmented granules in the sac-like portion of sporocyst were PAS-positive, salivary test-resistant, gave a strong positive reaction for cystine and cysteine and exhibited a high activity of acid phosphatase and non-specific esterase. 3aenzymes 3aTrematoda 3aKazakhstan 0aHistocytochemistry, Trematoda 0aLeucochloridium paradoxum (Trematoda)Succinea altaica evoluta (Host) 0aProteins, Trematoda1 aSoboleva, T.N.0 tFolia parasitologica.g1981, v. 28, no. 3 p.221-226wJournal:16656x0015-56837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840813c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03619naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245008200193300001800275520175200293650002002045650001202065650002302077650002202100650001402122650001502136650002202151650001902173650002202192650002002214650001202234650001802246650001202264650002102276650003302297650001502330650001902345650002502364650001402389650002402403650002502427650003702452650002802489650001402517650002702531651002602558651001302584651000902597653001402606653002002620653003302640700002202673700002402695773011602719852000902835856009302844930003302937946001102970655001202981IND4391593420221120180220.0070522e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439159342DNAL7 a174982332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03265.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBAILEY, NATHAN W.10aDispersal differences predict population genetic structure in Mormon crickets  ap. 2079-2089.  aResearch investigating the geographical context of speciation has primarily focused on abiotic factors such as the role of Pleistocene glacial cycles, or geotectonic events. Few study systems allow a direct comparison of how biological differences, such as dispersal behaviour, affect population genetic structure of organisms that were subdivided during the Pleistocene. Mormon crickets exist in solitary and gregarious 'phases', which broadly correspond with an east-west mtDNA division across the Rocky Mountains. Gregarious individuals form bands that can move up to 2 km daily. This study assessed whether population genetic structure results mainly from deep Pleistocene vicariance or if we can also detect more recent genetic patterns due to phase and dispersal differences superimposed on the older, deeper divisions. We found that separation in refugia was a more important influence on genetic divergence than phase, with the Rockies acting as a barrier that separated Mormon cricket populations into eastern and western refugia during Pleistocene glacial cycles. However, patterns of isolation by distance differ between eastern and western clades for both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, with greater divergence within the eastern, solitary clade. An mtDNA haplotype mismatch distribution is compatible with historical population expansion in the western clade but not in the eastern clade. A persistent (and possibly sex-biased) difference in dispersal ability has most likely influenced the greater population genetic structure seen in the eastern clade, emphasizing the importance of the interaction of Quaternary climate fluctuations and geography with biotic factors in producing the patterns of genetic subdivision observed today. 3aAnabrus simplex 3aclimate 3adispersal behavior 3agenetic variation 3ageography 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3apopulation growth 3arefuge habitats 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aClimate 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDemography 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aGryllidaexgenetics 2aHaplotypesxgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aRocky Mountain region 0aColorado 0aUtah 0adispersal 0aglacial refugia 0apopulation genetic structure1 aGwynne, Darryl T.1 aRitchie, Michael G.0 tMolecular ecology.g2007 May, v. 16, no. 10 p.2079-2089dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03265.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02862naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110242008600137245008600223300001400309500002400323520140800347650002201755650001401777650001101791650002401802650002901826650002301855650001701878650001201895650001001907650003101917650001401948650001101962650002101973650001401994650002302008650003102031650001702062650001702079650001002096700002402106700002602130700002902156773013002185852000902315939003302324946001102357655001202368IND4382688820221120180054.0060810e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND438268882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez-Martinez, M.10aMycorrhizal inoculation and its effect on the growth of two arboreous Leguminosae10aInoculacion micorrizica y su efecto en el crecimiento de dos leguminosas arboreas  ap. 65-73.  aSummary in English.  aThe effect of two soils (forest and agricultural), and tepetate and inoculation with Glomus spp. Zac-19, G. intraradices FS-18 and Gigaspora rosea BEG-111 on Acacia farnesiana and Prosopis glandulosa was studied. A greenhouse experiment using randomized blocks with three replicates with a factorial arrangement 4 x 3 x 2 was established. Evaluations were carried out every 14 days during 126 days. The variables evaluated were plant height, stem diameter, and leaf number. Additionally, at 126 days, leaf area, aerial and root dry weight, root volume and length of roots, phosphorus content of foliage, and mycorrhizal colonization were evaluated. Inoculated plants showed higher values than non-inoculated plants in most evaluated variables in forest soil and tepetate. Inoculated plants growing in the agricultural soil had maximum values in the evaluated variables, but they did not show significant differences in comparison to non-inoculated plants (control). This suggests that physical and chemical characteristics in this soil, such as nutrient content, had more influence on plant growth than inoculation. There were no statistical differences among fungi; however, Glomus spp. Zac-19 produced better numeric response. Mycorrhizal inoculation may help to produce healthier and more vigorous plants in the nursery, giving them an advantage to compete in environments with low nutrients content. 3aAcacia farnesiana 3aGigaspora 3aGlomus 3aProsopis glandulosa 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3aagricultural soils 3aforest soils 3aforests 3afungi 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus content 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3aroots1 aCetina-Alcala, V.M.1 aGonzalez-Chavez, M.C.1 aCervantes-Martinez, C.T.0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2006 , v. 24, no. 1 p.65-73x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20111102  aNon-US 7aarticle03301naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245010200190300001600292520162000308650002201928650001301950650001401963650001401977650001001991650002202001650000902023650002702032650002002059650002502079650001002104650003702114650002102151650002602172650002502198650002702223650002202250650001302272650004802285650003702333650002302370650002402393651001802417653000902435653002002444700002402464773011402488852000902602856009202611930003302703946001102736655001202747IND4399349220221120180146.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439934922DNAL7 a177255672pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03467.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKane, Nolan C.10aGenetics and evolution of weedy Helianthus annuus populations: adaptation of an agricultural weed  ap. 384-394.  aAgricultural weeds are a major cost to economies throughout the world, and have evolved from numerous plant species in many different plant families. Despite their ubiquity, we do not yet know how easily or often weeds evolve from their wild ancestors or the kinds of genes underlying their evolution. Here we report on the evolution of weedy populations of the common sunflower Helianthus annuus. We analysed 106 microsatellites in 48 individuals from each of six wild and four weed populations of the species. The statistical tests lnRV and lnRH were used to test for significant reductions in genetic variability at each locus in weedy populations compared to nearby wild populations. Between 1% and 6% of genes were significant outliers with reduced variation in weedy populations, implying that a small but not insignificant fraction of the genome may be under selection and involved in adaptation of weedy sunflowers. However, there did not appear to be a substantial reduction in variation across the genome, suggesting that effective population sizes have remained very large during the recent evolution of these weedy populations. Additional analyses showed that weedy populations are more closely related to nearby wild populations than to each other, implying that weediness likely evolved multiple times within the species, although a single origin followed by gene flow with local populations cannot be ruled out. Together, our results point to the relative ease with which weedy forms of this species can evolve and persist despite the potentially high levels of geneflow with nearby wild populations. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aancestry 3aevolution 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation size 3astatistical analysis 3aweeds 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxgenetics 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHelianthusxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSpecies Specificity 0aUnited States 0alnRH 0aselective sweep1 aRieseberg, Loren H.0 tMolecular ecology.g2008 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.384-394dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03467.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02764naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110242006000130245008200190300001600272500002400288520149500312650000901807650003101816650002601847650002401873650003701897650001401934650001401948650002301962650002901985650000902014650000902023650001002032651001102042700001902053700002502072700002202097700002602119773013202145852000902277939003302286946001102319655001202330IND4382638120221120170905.0060807e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND438263812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro-Luna, I.10aN and K recovery efficiency of slow release fertilizers10aEficiencia de recuperacion de n y k de tres fertilizantes de lenta liberacion  ap. 277-282.  aSummary in English.  aThe cost of mineral fertilizers and the environmental pollution that they produce when used improperly, make it necessary to find new economic and more efficient fertilizers. The objective of this study was to compare the recovery efficiency and the physiological efficiency (FE) of N and K of three new fertilizers denominated AUK in wheat production under greenhouse conditions. Three fertilizers (AUK1, AUK2, and AUK3), with the same content of N and K2O (12 and 7.5% in weight), but with different intercalation of nutrients with the clay matrix, were compared with commercial fertilizers (Fc) urea and KCl. The fertilizers were applied at three rates equivalent to three times (as suggested for greenhouse tests) 60, 100, and 140% the commercial rate of N recommended for wheat in the area of Bajio, state of Guanajuato, Mexico, equivalent to 270 mg N and 40 mg P2O5 kg-1 soil. This test was conducted using a completely randomized block design. Recovery efficiency of N and K (ERN and ERK) was similar (P < 0.05) for the three AUK fertilizers and compared with Fc. ERN and ERK decreased with the increase of the rate of N and K, showing the following order: 60 > 100 > 140%, regardless of the type of fertilizer (from tasseling to physiological maturity). The same was observed for the recovery efficiency of K. FE of N decreased when the rate of applied N increased, becoming stabilized when AUK2 was applied at a rate equal to or greater than that necessary to obtain maximum yield. 3aclay 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouse production 3amineral fertilizers 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anutrients 3apollution 3apotassium chloride 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asoil 3aurea 3awheat 3aMexico1 aGavi-Reyes, F.1 aPena-Cabriales, J.J.1 aNunez-Escobar, R.1 aEtchevers-Barra, J.D.0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2006 , v. 24, no. 2 p.277-282x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20111102  aNon-US 7aarticle03238naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110242009300131245009900224300001600323500002400339520173700363650001602100650001102116650001202127650002602139650001802165650002502183650000902208650001902217650002402236650002602260650001702286650001602303650001002319650002102329650000702350650001202357650001702369650002402386650001002410651001102420700002602431700002602457700002602483700002602509773013202535852000902667939003302676946001102709655001202720IND4382638920221120170840.0060807e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND438263892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Silva, R.10aSoil organic carbon and humic fraction stocks in a Vertisol under non-tillage management10aReservas de carbono organico y de fracciones humicas en un Vertisol sometido a siembra directa  ap. 241-251.  aSummary in English.  aSince the decade of the nineties, direct sowing over crop residues or non-tillage management (NT) was intensified in the State of Guanajuato, Mexico, as a means to increase soil organic matter (SOM) and to improve its properties. With this idea, a field experiment with NT was established in 1994 and conducted to date, in Valle de Santiago (Guanajuato, Mexico). The present work was carried out during the fall-winter period of 2003; the main objective was to evaluate the effect of the NT management on soil organic carbon (SOC) and on SOM fraction stocks, referred to the ploughing layer of 0-15 cm and in a Typic haplustert profile (Vertisol). Treatments considered in this study were: a) non-tillage with maize residues on the soil (NTR); b) non-tillage with some of the non-packed crop residues on the soil (NTr); c) conventional tillage with straw burning (CT), and a non-cultivated soil (NCS) as a control. Treatments were established in a completely randomized block experimental design, with four replications. Parameters measured were soil clay content, soil bulk density, pH, SOM and total N content, C/N ratio, and soil stocks of SOC, fresh organic matter (FOM), fulvic acids (FA), humic acids (HA), and humin (Hn). The highest SOC and humic fraction stocks in the 0 to 15 cm layer were found in NCS; with no significant differences between SOC content of the NCS and NTr management. About 70% of the SOC was FA in NTR. NTr increased SOM with 1% in relation to CT. However, reserves of SOC, FOM, FA, HA, and FA+AH of the epipedon of the Vertisol decreased by 33, 57, 35, 47, and 38%, respectively, in relation to NCS; SOC content reduction represented 1.6% of SOM.

A computer simulation of the reconstruction of the sequence from ideal mass-spectrometer data is presented. The method requires first the random fragmentation of a protein, as by partial acid hydrolysis. Volatile derivatives of the fragments, still mixed together, must next be made. The mass measurements are performed on the mixture of volatile derivatives. All the required chemical treatments would be simple and of such nature that the whole analysis, beginning with a sample of purified protein and ending with the computer printout of the amino acid sequences, could be made rapidly. The required amount of volatile derivative protein sample is expected to be very small, of the order of 1 mg. This should make feasible various experiments, for example with single organisms which are impossible at present. 3aproteins 3aamino acid sequences 3acomputer software 3acomputer analysis 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aComputers 2aHydrolysis 2aInsulinxanalysis 2aMass Spectrometryxanalysis. 2aPeptidesxanalysis 2aProteinsxanalysis 2aSpectrum Analysis 0acomputer simulation 0aprotein fragments1 aEck, R.V.0 tComputers in biology and medicine.g1970 Aug., v. 1, no. 1 p.5-28x0010-48257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01138naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245010000130300001400230500002400244520014800268650001400416650001700430650001600447650001100463653007200474653007200546653002600618700002100644773008600665852000900751939003300760945000800793946001100801655001200812991609174360742620221120075721.0840703s1980    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840042402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErgens, R.10aTwo new species of Gyrodactylus (Monogenea) from Kirghizian Diptychus dybowskii (Cypriniformes)  ap. 89-91.  aSummary in Russian.  aGyrodactylus tokobaevi sp. n. and G. aksuensis sp. n. are described from the skin of Diptychus dybowskii from the River Aksu (Kirghiz.

The objective of this investigation was to analyze several characteristics involved in Xcc virulence in relation to strain aggressiveness. To achieve this, swarming motility, biofilm formation, resistance to H(2)O(2), and production of xanthan were evaluated considering 44 local strains causing citrus bacterial canker disease in Iran. All strains showed differential swarming motilities, biofilm formation abilities, and xanthan production. The most virulent strain, Xcc-KVXCC1, exhibited the greatest capability to form biofilm on solid surfaces, xanthan production, and pathogenicity on detached leaves of Citrus aurantifolia as well as positive chemotaxis toward C. aurantifolia extract. In this study, a total of 14 common and commercial citrus genotypes were evaluated for resistance to Xcc-KVXCC1. Genotypes were categorized into susceptible and resistant groups based on lesion number per inoculation site. Based on our results, C. aurantifolia was the most susceptible citrus cultivar to Xcc-KVXCC1. In contrast, C. aurantium, C. jumbhori, and C. reticulata cv. ponkan demonstrated high and moderately high resistance against Xcc-KVXCC1. 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3aXanthomonas citri subsp. citri 3abacterial canker 3abiofilm 3achemotaxis 3acitrus canker 3acultivars 3aplant pathology 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3axanthan gum 3aIran1 aAeini, Milad1 aTarighi, Saeed1 aGolmohammadi, Morteza0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2021 May, v. 103, no. 2 p.449-460dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42161-021-00760-140uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7526090  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011600127300001600243500016300259500002400422520147400446650002201920650001801942650002001960650001201980650002001992650001602012650001102028650002202039650001302061650001902074650001102093773014002104852000902244856008602253655001202339IND4459429920221120064110.0110628s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445942992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGent, M.P.N.10aComparison of diurnal variation of nitrate and sugars in lettuce and predictions of a model based on metabolism  ap. 739-746.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on High Technology for Greenhouse Systems - GreenSys2009, Volume 2, held June 14-19, 2009, Quebec City, Canada.  aIncludes references  aThe diurnal variation of nitrate and sugars may vary with plant size and the ability to take up, synthesize, and use metabolites. Three sequential plantings of Bibb lettuce germinated at 2-week intervals were grown in hydroponics to provide plants differing in size. These plants were sampled at 3-hour intervals from 600 to 2100 hours on 14 August 2007. Samples were frozen and freeze dried, and dried tissue was extracted and analyzed for soluble sugars and nitrate using LC chromatography. There was a greater increase during the day in dry/fresh weight ratio for small compared to large plants. On a fresh weight basis, tissue nitrate of small plants was only half that for larger plants. It did not vary with time. Soluble sugars were similar for all plant sizes early in the day, but increased two-fold more in the light for small compared to large plants. To model this behavior, plants were simulated as a ‘big-cell’ with simplified metabolic reactions and transport processes sensitive to internal metabolite concentrations. Photosynthesis and nitrate reductase were affected by irradiance and leaf area index. Amino acid, protein, and structure synthesis depended on concentrations of ammonium and sugars. Use of nitrate in leaves was affected both by nitrate reductase and availability of sugars. Sugars were produced by photosynthesis and consumed by respiration and processes related to growth. The strengths and weaknesses of this model are discussed. 3adiurnal variation 3afreeze drying 3aleaf area index 3alettuce 3alight intensity 3ametabolites 3amodels 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3aphotosynthesis 3asugars0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Apr., , no. 893 p.739-746dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/893/893_79.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02403naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002300144242004400167245004200211300001600253500002400269500001500293520127600308650001301584650001701597650002301614650002001637650001501657650002201672650002701694650004301721651001101764653002001775773013201795852000901927930003301936945002501969946001101994655001202005IND4366687520221120054551.0050118e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND436668752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The average water depletion of the aquifer is 0.82 m yr(-1), and 20.50 m accumulated over 25 years, measured in the static level. Water is the most important factor in the production of any crop in the region. Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine the optimum amount of water for industrial tomato under tape irrigation. This research was conducted during 1997 and 1998 in the Caborca Experimental Station, Sonora, Mexico. The tomato variety used was Hale, and the three treatments were 50, 60, and 100% evapotranspiration (ET) estimated in a pan evaporation Type A. A completely randomized block design was used with six replications. The coefficients (K) used during the growing season of tomato were 0.52, 0.70, 0.75, and 0.70, for April, May, June, and July, respectively. The evaluated variables were water applied, tomato diameter, and yield. Results indicated that the 50% ET treatment was the best in the use of applied water, but was the one with the least yield (52 t ha(-1)); furthermore, to get the highest yield (74.75 t ha(-1)) under trickle irrigation it is necessary to apply 100% ET with an application depth of 66.19 cm. 3atomatoes 3acrop quality 3aevapotranspiration 3amicroirrigation 3acrop yield 3airrigated farming 3airrigation requirement 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aMexico 0acrop production0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2004 , v. 22, no. 4 p.433-436x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03006naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245011700132300001600249500016300265500002400428500001500452520146900467650001501936650001001951650001601961650001201977650001701989650002702006650001602033650001102049650001202060650001602072650001202088650001602100650002002116650001202136650000902148653001602157700001502173700001202188700001602200700001802216700002202234700002102256773014002277852000902417856008602426655001202512IND4459428920221120054626.0110628s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445942892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuck-Sorlin, G.H.12aA functional-structural plant model for cut roses - new techniques for modelling manipulation of plant structure  ap. 705-711.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on High Technology for Greenhouse Systems - GreenSys2009, Volume 2, held June 14-19, 2009, Quebec City, Canada.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aExperience is the main guide for cut rose growers to make decisions on crop management and climate control. Because of continuous change in cultivar characteristics and technology there is a need for a general theory, capturing how the number of flower shoots produced and their quality depend on the main determinants: plant structure (as a product of the interaction of natural growth and development with manipulation by the grower), cultivar characteristics and greenhouse environment. ‘Virtual Rose’ is an interdisciplinary project working on the development of a 3D model that simulates and visualizes shoot production over time. 3D modelling, or rather functional-structural plant modelling, differs fundamentally from previously published rose crop models, the most striking aspect being the 3D simulation and visualization of plant structure. This paper introduces the basic modelling approach, i.e., the use of Relational Growth Grammars (RGG) and the modelling language eXtended L-Systems (XL). The final model needs to be able to use greenhouse climate data from practice as input, most importantly the light regime, consisting of light from the sun and additional assimilation lamps (SON-T). Furthermore, the model needs to be equipped with provisions that allow the model user to execute ‘virtual’ bending, harvesting, and pruning. In this paper, we will focus on new modelling techniques for simulating complex interventions in plant growth. 3aharvesting 3alamps 3acrop models 3agrowers 3aplant growth 3agrowth and development 3agreenhouses 3ashoots 3aflowers 3amethodology 3apruning 3aphotoperiod 3acrop management 3aclimate 3aRosa 0anew methods1 aBurema, B.1 aVos, J.1 aLieth, J.H.1 aHeuvelink, E.1 aVisser, P.H.B. de1 aMarcelis, L.F.M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Apr., , no. 893 p.705-711dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/893/893_75.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02273naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002500127242003300152245004300185300001600228500002400244500001500268520112600283650002601409650001601435650001901451650002101470650002301491650002001514653001701534653001901551653001801570700002401588700002101612700002001633773013201653852000901785930003301794945002501827946001101852655001201863IND4366688320221120042149.0050118e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aIND436668832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The color of the soil as well as the visual identification of soil horizons is frequently correlated with the form and composition of iron oxides and hydroxides. Iron content in soils is expressed in percent. Iron oxides are minerals of neo-formation produced by the alteration of rocks and soils. Because they are not united chemically or structurally to silicates, they occur in the form of free oxides. Iron oxides in soils are important because they can be found in variable proportions in every soil type. The knowledge of the structure, properties, and characteristics of iron oxides has increased in recent years and indicates their complex relationship with both the organic and inorganic components of the soil. Iron oxides present in soils, especially coating particle of other minerals or mixed with clayed aggregates, alter the electrical charge, modify the surface properties, and increase the buffer capacity of the soil. Furthermore, iron plays an important role in particle aggregation and in the formation of soil structure. 3aelectrical properties 3airon oxides 3asoil structure 3asoil aggregation 3abuffering capacity 3asoil aggregates 0aferric oxide 0asoil chemistry 0aferrous oxide1 aOrtiz-Hernandez, E.1 aCruz-Sanchez, M.1 aCruz-Chavez, E.0 tTerra : Organo Cientifico de la Sociedad Mexicana de la Ciencia del Suelo, A.C.g2004 , v. 22, no. 4 p.485-497x0187-57797nnas  aDNAL  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/02/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02112naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010900126300001600235500016300251500002400414520114100438650001601579650001601595650001201611773014001623852000901763856008601772655001201858IND4459428820221120042225.0110628s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445942882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeginer, I.10aCo-state variables as strategic set-points for environmental control of greenhouses: two state-variables  ap. 697-703.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on High Technology for Greenhouse Systems - GreenSys2009, Volume 2, held June 14-19, 2009, Quebec City, Canada.  aIncludes references  aCo-state variables are the marginal values of the state variables of a dynamic system. Given a suitable model of the system (here crop and greenhouse), a performance criterion (here profit) and the expected disturbances (here weather), the best values of the co-states can be determined. Since the cardinal co-states of a crop-greenhouse system are generally few, varying rather slowly, and activating several control fluxes each, they can play the role of strategic set-points. A greenhouse grower wishing to control processes such as growth, development and even certain disorders, may use the associated co-states to speed up or slow down the process of concern. In this study, simulations of simple cases are carried out to illustrate the concept as it applies to a crop with two state-variables (biomass and developmental stage). The focus is on the decision to be taken by a grower when the actual growth trajectory deviates from the desired one. It is shown that while the crop model may be inaccurate, a corrective course may be estimated based on the available information, by generating pairs of ‘equivalent’ trajectories. 3acrop models 3agreenhouses 3aweather0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Apr., , no. 893 p.697-703dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/893/893_74.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02551naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245004300186300001400229500002400243520091000267650001501177650001501192650002101207650000901228650001101237650001501248650002501263650001101288650000901299650004301308650001201351650002601363650003101389650004001420650000901460650007001469650001801539650006901557650002201626650001101648650001901659650002401678650002101702650002201723650001301745651001601758651001601774773011301790852000901903856008501912655001201997IND4459428120221120042131.0110628s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445942812DNAL7 a212294182pmid7 a10.1080/104083909030446362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmid, Alexandra14aThe Role of Meat Fat in the Human Diet  ap. 50-66.  aIncludes references  aFood fat plays an important role in the human diet. On the one hand, fats provide the body with energy, contribute to the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and act as structural elements of cell walls. On the other hand, a high fat intake is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and coronary heart disease. Animal fats, which contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, are often the focus of attention when it comes to reducing the share of fat in the diet. The present overview of the literature describes the amount of total fat and the percentage of individual fatty acid groups in meat and meat products, documents the contribution of meat and meat products to fat intake, and investigates the connection between meat fat and various diseases.

We have previously identified a HAP4 orthologue in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, called HpHAP4‐A, which, despite its very limited sequence conservation (a 16 amino acid N‐terminal motif), is fully functional in S. cerevisiae. Based on the same N‐terminal motif, a second gene has now been identified in the same organism. It was shown to contain an additional cis‐binding motif of the bZip type. We report on the cloning, heterologous expression and analysis in S. cerevisiae of this novel ScHAP4 orthologue. From these experiments we could conclude that, as with HpHAP4‐A, the novel orthologue, designated HpHAP4‐B, could functionally replace the S. cerevisiae gene but to a lesser extent. The relationship between the presence of the additional cis‐binding motif and the weaker potential as a HAP4 functional homologue is discussed. 3aHansenula polymorpha 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afermentation 3agenes 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCCAAT-Binding Factorxdeficiency 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPichiaxgenetics 2aProtein Binding 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aPetryk, N.1 aZhou, Y.‐F.1 aSibirny, A.1 aBolotin‐Fukuhara, M.0 tYeast.g2010 Nov., v. 27, no. 11 p.941-954dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1802 7aarticle02610naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011800167300001600285520124100301592002801542650001301570650002901583650001401612650001001626650001401636650001401650650001501664650001101679650002001690650002601710650001501736653004101751653001301792653002101805653001501826700001701841700001301858700001901871700001301890700002401903700001901927773010001946856008502046852000902131655001202140IND60546456120221119022604.0160903e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054645612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Caixia10aEffect of colloids on the occurrence, distribution and photolysis of emerging organic contaminants in wastewaters  ap. 241-248.  aThe effect of colloids on the occurrence, phase distribution and photolysis of twenty-seven emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) was studied in domestic and livestock wastewaters (DW and LW), respectively. Filtered water (<1μm) was separated into permeate (<1kDa) and retentate (1kDa-1μm) by cross flow ultrafiltration. Results indicated that total concentration of EOCs ranged from 1220ngL−1 in permeate of DW to 5065ngL−1 in retentate of LW. The average EOC fraction associated with colloids was 13.5% and 14.4% in DW and LW. Most of the EOCs exhibited pseudo-first-order degradation kinetics in all water samples. Control experiments using glass and quartz reactors showed that UV light was more effective on the photolysis of most EOCs. The EOCs photolysis in the three fractions of DW and LW could be accelerated or inhibited compared to ultrapure water with the enhancement factor ranging from −0.94 to 7.33. The impact of colloids on the photolysis of EOCs depended on the compound and the source of water. The photolysis of most EOCs in permeates and filtrates was generally accelerated, while inhibited in the retentates, which could be attributed to the relatively high dissolved organic carbon contents in retentates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3adissolved organic carbon 3afiltrates 3aglass 3alivestock 3apermeates 3aphotolysis 3aquartz 3aultrafiltration 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater 0aEmerging organic contaminants (EOCs) 0aColloids 0aUltraviolet (UV) 0aPhotolysis1 aNie, Minghua1 aYang, Yi1 aZhou, Junliang1 aLiu, Min1 aBaalousha, Mohammed1 aLead, Jamie R.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 299 p.241-248dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245022400165300001600389500001500405520173700420592002802157650001202185650001402197650002102211650001202232650001302244650000902257650001002266650001602276650002902292650001202321650001402333650001002347650001502357651002002372653004202392653002202434653001102456653003102467653001702498653002602515700001702541700001802558773012802576856007502704852000902779655001202788IND60481062320221119094854.0160201e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048106232DNAL7 a10.7882/AZ.2011.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Tsuyoshi10aAre the faecal pellets of kangaroos (Macropus spp.) a source of nutrients and carbon in an inland floodplain wetland during flooding?

The faecal pellets of kangaroos, most likely of Red Kangaroo (M. rufus), were found on the dry floodplain adjacent to Bora Channel (~30.6433°S/~ 147.5351 °E) at a density of 142±54 m-2 (mean±SE, n=3). Following artificial inundation, we monitored the release of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) five times over a six-day period from mesocosms deployed in situ.Three mesocosms contained faecal pellets and three mesocosms contained marsh floodplain sediments (top 5 cm of sediment consisting of soils and plant material) with faecal pellets removed. The concentrations (mean±SE, n=3) of TN, TP and DOC in the mesocosms containing the pellets were 0.037±0.0I7, 0.22±0.060 and 0.69±0.I4 g m-2> at day 6, while the mesocosms containing only the marsh floodplain sediments were I.03±0.23, 0.49±0.083 and 7.27± 1.02 g m-2>. On average, the kangaroo faecal pellets contributed ~6% of TN, ~3I% of TP and ~ 8% of DOC of the total amounts respectively released from the inundated floodplain over the six-day experiment. Nutrient and carbon depositions to floodplains in the form of faecal pellets from large terrestrial animals such as kangaroos are an important process of cycling these elements in inland floodplain wetlands, especially where large populations of these animals occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3amarshes 3asediments 3anitrogen content 3aanimals 3aMacropus 3asoil 3afeces 3afloodplains 3adissolved organic carbon 3apellets 3anutrients 3afauna 3aphosphorus 3aNew South Wales 0aautotrophic and heterotrophic sources 0aelemental cycling 0acarbon 0ainland floodplain wetlands 0aRed Kangaroo 0aEastern Grey Kangaroo1 aIles, Jordan1 aKnowles, Lisa0 tAustralian zoologist.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 35, no. 3 p.458-462dRoyal Zoological Society of NSWwJournal:19830x0067-22387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7882/AZ.2011.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245014800198300001800346500002000364520182900384592002802213596010402241650001302345650001102358650001302369650001102382650001002393650002002403650001702423650001802440650003402458650001102492650001002503650002502513650002402538650001402562650001702576650001102593700001902604700002402623700003002647700001902677700002002696700002002716700002502736773013402761856007302895852000902968655001202977IND60654143820221119135444.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065414382DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.134542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Kadili, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6223-679710aEvaluation of different hormonal treatments on oestral and ovarian responses in Moroccan Beni Arouss goats during anoestrus and breeding season  ap. 1003-1009.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe efficacy of eight combinations of fluorogestone acetate (FGA, 20 or 40 mg as intravaginal device during 11 days), equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, 300 or 500 UI injected 48 hr before FGA removal) and prostaglandin F₂α (cloprostenol, 0 or 50 μg injected 48 hr before FGA removal) aiming at induction and synchronization of oestrus and ovulation was evaluated during the anoestrus season in spring and during the breeding season in autumn in adult Beni Arouss goats. Oestrous behaviour was recorded between 12 and 60 hr after FGA removal. Blood samplings allowing to assess onset of the pre‐ovulatory LH surge and increase of progesterone as sign of an active corpus luteum were performed, respectively, between 20 and 60 hr and 3, 5, 8 and 15 days after FGA removal. No season‐related differences (spring vs. autumn) were observed for oestrous response (95% vs. 93%), pre‐ovulatory LH surge (94% vs. 84%) and luteal response after 3–8 and 11–15 days post‐treatment (respectively 92% vs. 66% and 92% vs. 98%). The onset of oestrus (21 [13–53] vs. 32 [12–54] hr) and LH surge (26 [20–60] vs. 38 [22–60] hr) occurred significantly later in autumn. FGA (40 vs. 20 mg) in autumn significantly delayed the onset of oestrus (36 [16–54] vs. 23 [12–47] hr) and LH surge (44 [26–58] vs. 33 [22–60] hr). Significant treatment‐related differences were recorded for onset of LH surge (earliest for 20 mg FGA, 300 IU eCG, 50 μg PGF₂α) and onset of luteal phase (latest for 40 mg FGA, 300 IU eCG, 50 μg PGF₂α). In conclusion, the hormone combinations tested appeared equally effective in terms of oestrous and ovulation rates. Season has influenced significantly the onset of oestrus and LH surge, and the high dose regimen of FGA delayed the ovarian response in autumn.  aPublisher supplied data  cBelgian Academy for Research and Higher Education‐ Development Cooperation Committee (ARES‐CCD) 3aacetates 3aadults 3aanestrus 3aautumn 3ablood 3abreeding season 3acloprostenol 3acorpus luteum 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3aestrus 3agoats 3aintravaginal devices 3aluteinizing hormone 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3aspring1 aRaes, Marianne1 aBister, Jean‐Loup1 aBeckers, Jean‐François1 aAmzati, Gaston1 aArcha, Bouchaib1 aChentouf, Mouad1 aKirschvink, Nathalie0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2019 July, v. 54, no. 7 p.1003-1009dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.134543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009600162300001800258520163900276592002801915650002001943650001201963650002701975650000902002650001602011650001202027650001402039650001802053650001402071650001002085650002402095700001202119700001202131700001702143700001702160700001502177700001602192773012502208856008102333852000902414655001202423IND60651612820221121211438.0190712e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065161282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-019-8175-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Guanyu10aImpacts of El Niño on the somatic condition of Humboldt squid based on the beak morphology  ap. 1440-1448.  aThe Humboldt squid Dosidicus gigas has a short life span, and environmental variability plays a significant role in regulating its population dynamics and distribution. An analysis of 1 096 samples of D. gigas collected by the Chinese commercial fishing vessels during 2013, 2014, and 2016 off the Peruvian Exclusive Economic Zone, was conducted to evaluate the impacts of El Niño events on the somatic condition of D. gigas. This study indicates that the slopes of all beak variables in relation to ML for females were greater than those of males during 2013, 2014, and 2016, and slopes of the upper crest length and the lower rostrum length significantly differed between females and males in 2013 (P <0.05). Variation in the slopes for beak variables among years was studied; no significant difference was observed (ANCOVA, P >0.05). The Fulton’s condition coefficients (K) of females and males in 2013 and 2014 were significantly greater than those in 2016 (P < 0.01). The K values of females were greater than those of males in 2013, 2014, and 2016, and K values significantly differed between females and males in 2013. In normal years, the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration showed an N-shaped variability from January to December. However, in the El Niño period, it tended to weaken the upwelling coupled with warm and low Chl a concentration waters. We suggest that the poor somatic condition of D. gigas during the El Niño year was resulted from the low Chl a concentration in the waters, and the abundance of D. gigas would decrease due to the unfavourable environment and the lack of prey items in the El Niño year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDosidicus gigas 3aEl Nino 3aanalysis of covariance 3abeak 3achlorophyll 3afemales 3afisheries 3afishing boats 3alongevity 3amales 3apopulation dynamics1 aYu, Wei1 aLi, Bai1 aHan, Dongyan1 aChen, Xinjun1 aChen, Yong1 aLi, Jianhua0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2019 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.1440-1448dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-019-8175-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245011200201300001600313500002000329520116200349592002801511596008601539596007001625596011501695650001401810650001301824650002801837650002501865650001301890650001401903650001701917700001201934700001901946700001501965700001701980773010901997856008002106852000902186655001202195IND60790326220221122030250.0220824e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079032622DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.126092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9975-156210aTargeting of CDKN1B by miR‐222‐3p may contribute to the development of intervertebral disc degeneration  ap. 728-735.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non‐coding RNAs that can negatively regulate the expression of their complementary mRNA targets, and have been implicated in various pathophysiological processes. In this study, we examined the effect of miR‐222‐3p on intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). We found that expression of miR‐222‐3p was significantly higher in IDD tissues than in normal intervertebral disc tissue, and report that overexpression of miR‐222‐3p remarkably increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. In addition, miR‐222‐3p promoted secretion of matrix metalloproteinase‐3, and decreased collagen type II and aggrecan production. Cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) was identified as a direct target of negative regulation by miR‐222‐3p in NP cells, and expression of miR‐222‐3p was found to be negatively correlated with that of CDKN1B in IDD tissue. Finally, we observed that transfection with miR‐222‐3p dramatically reduced CDKN1B expression in NP cells. In conclusion, miR‐222‐3p may be involved in IDD development, possibly through targeting CDKN1B.  aPublisher supplied data  aAB164 50003cGuangxi Scientific Research and Technological Development Foundation  aYCBZ2018034cThe Innovation Project of Guangxi Graduate Education  aRC20180107cYouth Science and Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Talent Cultivation Project of Nanning 3aapoptosis 3acollagen 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3aintervertebral disks 3amicroRNA 3asecretion 3atransfection1 aYu, Jia1 aJiang, Weiping1 aHe, Maolin1 aZhao, Jinmin0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.728-735dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.126093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245014200181300001400323520103200337592002801369650001501397650001201412650001201424650001101436650001501447650001201462650002001474650001501494650002501509650002501534650001801559650001101577650001601588653001201604653003501616653002701651653002301678700003201701700004401733700003001777700003601807700002601843773010501869856008701974852000902061655001202070IND50068138020221122135426.0190409e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006813802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.05.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuguihiro, Talita Mayumi13aAn electroanalytical approach for evaluation of biochar adsorption characteristics and its application for Lead and Cadmium determination  ap. 40-45.  aThis work describes for first time the use of electroanalytical techniques for evaluation of adsorptive proprieties of biochar using it as electrode modifier and its application for preconcentration and determination of Lead(II) and Cadmium(II) under differential pulse adsorptive voltammetric conditions (DPAdSV).

Herbicides present in these wastes are washed down, carried by rains and flood to nearby aquatic environment. Glyphosate is one of the most popular herbicides used by farmers in Kano because of its active reaction on killing weeds without affecting the crops. A toxicity test of glyphosate was conducted using concentrations of 0, 0.004, 0.005, 0.006, 0.007ml/l. The mortality rate of each concentration was determined and the physicochemical parameters (Dissolved oxygen and pH) were also determined. The result showed that high mortality occurs at 0.007ml/l and less mortality was found at 0.004ml/l. Hence, mortality is dose dependent. DO and pH decreases with increase in glyphosate concentration. Furthermore, the juveniles showed abnormal behaviour. The LC₅₀ value at 96h was 0.0072ml/l. There was significant difference between the initial and final pH value (p<0.05). On the other hand, the initial and final DO values showed no significant difference (p>0.05). However, correlation between DO and pH showed no significant difference (p>0.05). The findings of this study established that glyphosate has some level of toxicity on Clarias gariepinus juveniles. In addition, it was found that mortality, changes in behaviour, DO and pH are dose dependent. Therefore, it was suggested that an appropriate concentration that will not be detrimental to non-target organisms should be used by farmers. Alternatively, Biological method should be used as a substitute for chemical method of controlling weeds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClarias gariepinus 3aabnormal behavior 3aacute toxicity 3aagricultural wastes 3aaquatic environment 3adissolved oxygen 3adose response 3aglyphosate 3amortality 3apH 0aToxiciity 0aBioassay 0aHerbicide 0aConcentration1 aIdris, Muhammad Khadija0 tToxicology reports.g2016, v. 3 p.513-515dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2016.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007200161300001800233520203200251592002802283650001902311650003302330650000902363650001902372650001502391650000902406650001402415650001602429650001002445650001402455650001202469650001602481650001002497650001302507650001402520650001202534650001202546650001602558651001802574653001302592653001502605653002202620653000802642653001102650700001702661700001802678700001602696700001302712700001702725773009302742856008102835852000902916655001202925IND60516067820221117235338.0160323e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051606782DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311110025522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallo, A.10aMelamine in eggs, plasma and tissues of hens fed contaminated diets  ap. 1163-1169.  aA study was conducted to evaluate the excretion pattern of melamine from feed into eggs, plasma, kidney, liver and muscle of laying hens. In particular, 90 laying hens were randomly allocated to three dietary treatments and fed diets contaminated with melamine at a level of 2.5, 25 and 250 mg of melamine/kg of diet for T1, T2 and T3 groups, respectively. The diets were offered in six replicate boxes (five hens each) for 13 days. Eggs were collected from each group for melamine quantification on days 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 13. At the end of the experimental period, one hen per box was randomly selected and slaughtered to collect plasma, liver, kidney and muscle samples. During the experiment, feeding diets with increasing levels of melamine had no effect (P > 0.05) on weight gain, feed intake, egg production, egg weight and mortality of laying hens. The melamine in eggs increased from day 1 after melamine ingestion and reached a plateau between days 6 and 13 of melamine ingestion. At steady-state condition, the melamine egg concentrations increased (P < 0.01) with treatments, being 0.026, 0.352 and 4.631 mg/kg for T1, T2 and T3, respectively. Similarly, the carryover of melamine from feed to egg increased (P < 0.05) with the levels of melamine in the diets, varying from 0.50 to 0.70 and 0.84 for T1, T2 and T3, respectively. The melamine was detected in plasma of all tested groups, increasing (P < 0.01) with levels of melamine in the diets (0.030, 0.266 and 4.102 mg/l in T1, T2 and T3, respectively). Melamine was not detected in kidney, liver and muscle of hens fed T1. Except for kidney sampled in the T3, no melamine concentration higher than 2.5 mg/kg, representing the maximum allowable limit set by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Union for food and feeds, was measured. The melamine resulted higher in plasma and kidneys than in the liver and muscle both in T2 and T3. The results confirmed the presence of an excretion pattern of melamine from feed to eggs and tissues in laying hens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aFood and Drug Administration 3adiet 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aexcretion 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3aingestion 3akidneys 3alaying hens 3aliver 3amelamine 3amortality 3amuscles 3atissues 3aweight gain 3aUnited States 0amelamine 0alaying hen 0aexcretion pattern 0aegg 0atissue1 aBertuzzi, T.1 aBattaglia, M.1 aMasoero, F.1 aPiva, G.1 aMoschini, M.0 tAnimal.g2012 July, v. 6, no. 7 p.1163-1169dCambridge University Pressx1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311110025523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245008900130300001600219506002800235520126000263592002801523506003701551650001801588650001401606650001401620650001601634650002101650650002601671650001501697650001501712650002201727650002301749650002201772653002301794653001501817653001801832653001801850773014101868852000902009655001202018IND60773906620221207073732.0160915e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077390662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirnak, Halil12aA computer controlled irrigation of potted chrysanthemum grown at outdoor conditions  ap. 139-144.  aResource is Open Access  aA rapid and reliable method to estimate water requirements for chrysanthemum production with practical applications to commercial operations was developed to promote water conservation. A water-requirement prediction equation (R2 = 0.71) that used class A pan evaporation along with plant-canopy height and width as input variables was generated. Equation verification was carried out by comparing vegetative growth and quality of crops irrigated according to the generated water-requirement equation to crops irrigated based on demand and conservative fixed daily irrigation regimes. Vegetation growth of the plants irrigated with the generated equation was smaller than plants grown by demand irrigation, but plant quality was not significantly different. Applied water was significantly lower for plants irrigated with the generated equation than would normally be applied in a commercial operation using a conservative fixed daily irrigation rate. The study showed that there was a close relationship between chrysanthemum water requirements and the plant and evaporative data. A simplified ET equation involving plant characteristics and evaporative data could be used in the irrigation scheduling of chrysanthemum grown under restricted root volume.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChrysanthemum 3acomputers 3aequations 3aevaporation 3airrigation rates 3airrigation scheduling 3aprediction 3avegetation 3avegetative growth 3awater conservation 3awater requirement 0aEvapotrasnpiration 0aautomation 0apotted plants 0asoil moisture0 tCurrent Trends in Natural Sciences.g2016 July, v. 5, no. 9 p.139-144dEditura Universitatii din PitestiwJournal:27829x2284-953X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245008400184300001400268520106800282592002801350650001401378650002201392650001801414650001501432650001401447650001801461650002101479650001501500650006101515650002401576650002001600650004201620650002801662651001101690700001601701700001701717773011301734856004801847852000901895655001201904IND4465723620221121092652.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446572362DNAL7 a213809202pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-1945-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKao, Jehng-Jung10aOptimization models for siting water quality monitoring stations in a catchment  ap. 43-52.  aA water quality monitoring network (WQMN) must be designed so as to adequately protect the water quality in a catchment. Although a simulated annealing (SA) method was previously applied to design a WQMN, the SA method cannot ensure the solution it obtained is the global optimum. Therefore, two new linear optimization models are proposed in this study to minimize the deviation of the cost values expected to identify the possible pollution sources based on uniform cost (UC) and coverage elimination uniform cost (CEUC) schemes. The UC model determines the expected cost values by considering each sub-catchment being covered by which station, while the CEUC model determines the coverage of each station by eliminating the area covered by any upstream station. The proposed models are applied to the Derchi reservoir catchment in Taiwan. Results show that the global optimal WQMN can be effectively determined by using the UC or CEUC model, for which both results are better than those from the SA method, especially when the number of stations becomes large.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3ahydrologic models 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3apollution 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 3awatersheds 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxeconomicsxmethodsxstandards. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxstandards 2aWater Supplyxstandards 3aTaiwan1 aLi, Pei-Hao1 aHu, Wen-Shin0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Jan., v. 184, no. 1 p.43-52dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-1945-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008300160520152500243592002801768650001401796650001301810650001001823650001601833650001901849650002401868650001501892650003001907650001101937650001501948650002101963650001201984650001201996650001602008650001502024651001602039651001002055700002402065700002102089700003302110773012202143856007302265852000902338655001202347IND60702479120221120175059.0200718e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070247912DNAL7 a10.3390/d120602102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViterbi, Ramona 10aEffects of Temperature Rise on Multi-Taxa Distributions in Mountain Ecosystems  aMountain biodiversity is associated with rare and fragile biota that are highly sensitive to climate change. To estimate the vulnerability of biodiversity to temperature rise, long-term field data are crucial. Species distribution models are an essential tool, in particular for invertebrates, for which detailed information on spatial and temporal distributions is largely missing. We applied presence-only distribution models to field data obtained from a systematic survey of 5 taxa (birds, butterflies, carabids, spiders, staphylinids), monitored in the northwestern Italian Alps. We estimated the effects of a moderate temperature increase on the multi-taxa distributions. Only small changes in the overall biodiversity patterns emerged, but we observed significant differences between groups of species and along the altitudinal gradient. The effects of temperature increase could be more pronounced for spiders and butterflies, and particularly detrimental for high-altitude species. We observed significant changes in community composition and species richness, especially in the alpine belt, but a clear separation between vegetation levels was retained also in the warming scenarios. Our conservative approach suggests that even a moderate temperature increase (about 1 °C) could influence animal biodiversity in mountain ecosystems: only long-term field data can provide the information to improve quantitative predictions, allowing us to readily identify the most informative signals of forthcoming changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarabidae 3aaltitude 3abirds 3abutterflies 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3aprediction 3aspecies richness 3aspiders 3asurveys 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aAlps region 3aItaly1 aCerrato, Cristiana 1 aBionda, Radames 1 aProvenzale, A.q(Antonello),0 tDiversity.g2020 May 26, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d120602103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001900160245006000179300001600239500000900255520142100264592002801685650001501713650001801728650001501746650001301761650001201774650002201786650002101808650001501829650002001844650002701864650001901891650001301910650002001923650001301943650000701956650002001963650001901983650002302002650001702025650000902042650001902051700001802070700001902088773012102107852000902228856009702237655001202334IND8306280720221119003702.0191122e198305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND830628072DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1983.00021962007500030009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorello, W.

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of N carrier and mode of application on NH₃ volatilization from a Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) turf growing on an acidic (pH 6.4) Flanagan silt loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Aquic Argiudoll) soil. The NH₃ which volatilized after application of any of several sulfur-coated ureas (SCU), prilled urea, spray-applied solubilized urea, and two liquid N products was measured by passing the airstream from microecosystems, in which the treated turfs were growing, through an indicating boric acid solution to trap NH₃₋. Ammonia-N losses after sulfur-coated urea fertilization ranged from 0.2% of the applied N when the fertilization rate was 98 kg N/ha to 2.3% of the applied N when the fertilization rate was 293 kg N/ha. When prilled urea was applied at a rate of 293 kg N/ha, NH₃ losses averaged 10.3% of the applied N whereas 4.6 and 1.6% of the applied N was lost after turf was fertilized with 49 kg N/ha from spray-applied solubilized urea and prilled urea, respectively. Ammonia losses from turf treated with liquid N sources ranged from 3.2 to 4.5% of the applied N. The results of this research indicate that ammonia volatilization occurs to a limited extent in turfgrass stands growing on an acidic soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgiudolls 3aPoa pratensis 3aacid soils 3aair flow 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aapplication rate 3aboric acid 3adenitrification 3afertilizer application 3alawns and turf 3aleaching 3amontmorillonite 3anitrogen 3apH 3asilt loam soils 3asolubilization 3asulfur-coated urea 3aturf grasses 3aurea 3avolatilization1 aWehner, D.

A total of 24 bunches of two wine-grape varieties (cv. Pedro Ximénez and cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) were labelled and analysed directly on the vine using a commercially available handheld micro-electro-mechanical system spectrophotometer (1,600–2,400 nm). Principal component analysis was performed to study relationships between the various configurations (grape position and bunch orientation), ripening stages and spectral data. Results for the white-grape variety showed that grapes high on the bunch behaved differently during ripening from those in central or low positions and that east-facing bunches behaved differently from the rest. For both varieties, analysis of bunch spectral characteristics enabled three stages of ripening to be distinguished: early, middle and late. Subsequently, the ability of NIR technology to classify wine grapes as a function of reducing-sugar content, with a view to optimising harvest timing, was evaluated by partial least squares discriminant analysis: 88 % of white grapes and 88 % of red grapes were correctly classified while over 79 % of samples were correctly assigned to representative groups. These results confirmed that NIR technology in the spectral range 1,600–2,400 nm is an appropriate technique for on-vine monitoring of the ripening process, enabling selective harvesting depending on the type of wine to be made.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscriminant analysis 3aharvest date 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprincipal component analysis 3aripening 3aspectral analysis 3avines 3awine cultivars 3awine grapes 3awinemaking1 aSánchez Arrieta, María Teresa,1 aFernández-Novales, Juan1 aLópez, María Isabel,1 aPérez-Marín, Dolores0 tFood analytical methods.g2012 Dec., v. 5, no. 6 p.1377-1385dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-012-9389-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245011800162300001600280500002000296520147300316592002801789650001501817650002001832650002401852650001201876650002001888650001001908650001101918650002601929650001401955650001901969650001501988650001402003650002402017650000902041700002102050700001502071700001902086700001602105700001702121773010902138856008002247852000902327655001202336IND60790326520221122005228.0220824e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079032652DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.126022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXian, Junmin12aA prognostic signature based on three non‐coding RNAs for prediction of the overall survival of glioma patients  ap. 682-692.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent studies have identified certain non‐coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as biomarkers of disease progression. Glioma is the most common primary intracranial cancer, with high mortality. Here, we developed a prognostic signature for prediction of overall survival (OS) of glioma patients by analyzing ncRNA expression profiles. We downloaded gene expression profiles of glioma patients along with their clinical information from the Gene Expression Omnibus and extracted ncRNA expression profiles via a microarray annotation file. Correlations between ncRNAs and glioma patients’ OS were first evaluated through univariate Cox regression analysis and a permutation test, followed by random survival forest analysis for further screening of valuable ncRNA signatures. Prognostic signatures could be established as a risk score formula by including ncRNA signature expression values weighted by their estimated regression coefficients. Patients could be divided into high risk and low risk subgroups by using the median risk score as cutoff. As a result, glioma patients with a high risk score tended to have shorter OS than those with low risk scores, which was confirmed by analyzing another set of glioma patients in an independent dataset. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment of cancer development‐related biological processes and pathways. Our study may provide further insights into the evaluation of glioma patients’ prognosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adata collection 3adisease progression 3aforests 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglioma 3amicroarray technology 3amortality 3anon-coding RNA 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3aregression analysis 3arisk1 aZhang, Quanzhong1 aGuo, Xiwen1 aLiang, Xiankun1 aLiu, Xinhua1 aFeng, Yugong0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.682-692dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.126023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245006300163300001400226520166700240592002801907650001801935650001501953650001001968650002401978650001802002650003602020650003802056653000802094653000902102653000902111653000902120653001202129653000902141653000802150653000802158653001102166653001102177653001102188653000902199653000902208653000902217653000802226653000802234653000802242653001402250653003602264653002602300653001702326700001502343700001502358700001902373700001402392700002002406700001702426700001302443700001702456700001602473700001302489773013002502856008402632852000902716655001202725IND60601618220221120223808.0180706e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060161822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2014.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Han12aA potential wound healing-promoting peptide from frog skin  ap. 32-41.  aCutaneous wound healing is a dynamic, complex, and well-organized process that requires the orchestration of many different cell types and cellular processes. Transforming growth factor β1 is an important factor that plays a key role during wound healing. Amphibian skin has been proven to possess excellent wound healing ability, whilst no bioactive substrate related to it has ever been identified. Here, a potential wound healing-promoting peptide (AH90, ATAWDFGPHGLLPIRPIRIRPLCG) was identified from the frog skin of Odorrana grahami. It showed potential wound healing-promoting activity in a murine model with full thickness dermal wound. AH90 promoted release of transforming growth factor β1 through activation of nuclear factor-κB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways, while inhibitors of nuclear factor-κB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibited the process. In addition, the effects of AH90 on Smads family proteins, key regulators in transforming growth factor β1 signaling pathways, could also be inhibited by transforming growth factor β1 antibody. Altogether, this indicated that AH90 promoted wound healing by inducing the release of transforming growth factor β1. This current study may facilitate the understanding of effective factors involved in the wound repair of amphibians and the underlying mechanisms as well. Considering its favorable traits as a small peptide that greatly promoting generation of endogenous wound healing agents (transforming growth factor β1) without mitogenic effects, AH90 might be an excellent template for the future development of novel wound-healing agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3afrogs 3asignal transduction 3atissue repair 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aEGF 0aDPBS 0aDMEM 0aTBST 0aTGF-β1 0aMAPK 0aERK 0aJNK 0aNF-κB 0aα-SMA 0aTNF-α 0aPDTC 0aAP-1 0aTLR4 0aTRH 0aDAB 0aMTT 0aAmphibian 0aTransforming growth factor beta 0aAntimicrobial peptide 0aWound repair1 aMu, Lixian1 aTang, Jing1 aShen, Chuanbin1 aGao, Chen1 aRong, Mingqiang1 aZhang, Zhiye1 aLiu, Jie1 aWu, Xiaoyang1 aYu, Haining1 aLai, Ren0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2014 Apr., v. 49 p.32-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2014.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245015200157300001600309520094900325592002801274650001701302650001201319650001801331650002201349650001301371650001201384651002001396653001901416653001101435653001301446653001201459653001701471653002601488653001601514653001201530653002601542700001601568700002101584700001601605700002301621773012801644856007501772852000901847655001201856IND60481059220221119093029.0160201e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048105922DNAL7 a10.7882/AZ.2011.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSass, Steve10aDisjunct populations of spinifex-obligate reptiles revealed in a newly described vegetation community near Broken Hill, far-western New South Wales  ap. 781-787.  aRecent biodiversity surveys of the Barrier Ranges in far western New South Wales resulted in the discovery of an undescribed vegetation community dominated by spinifex grass growing on rocky ranges. Reptile surveys within this vegetation community revealed the presence of three reptile species not known to, or predicted to occur in the Broken Hill Complex Bioregion. These were the Spinifex Snake-lizard Delma butleri, Marble-headed Snake-lizard Delma australis and Southern Spinifex Slender Blue-tongue Cyclodomorphus melanops elongatus. The conservation value of these populations is regarded as regionally significant. All three species were detected by hand-searches of the spinifex grass highlighting the need to use experienced herpetologists when conducting reptile surveys in complex microhabitats. Their presence in the study area on a rocky substrate provides additional information on their habitat requirements in New South Wales.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3agrasses 3amicrohabitats 3aplant communities 3areptiles 3asurveys 3aNew South Wales 0aBarrier Ranges 0amallee 0aspinifex 0areptile 0a<i>Delma</i> 0a<i>Cyclodomorphus</i> 0awestern NSW 0ahabitat 0aBroken Hill Bioregion1 aSwan, Gerry1 aMarshall, Brooke1 aBrowne, Tim1 aGraham-Higgs, Nick0 tAustralian zoologist.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 35, no. 3 p.781-787dRoyal Zoological Society of NSWwJournal:19830x0067-22387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7882/AZ.2011.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009300162300001800255520135700273592002801630650001201658650001201670650001601682650001701698650003101715650001801746650002401764650001401788650001801802650002101820651001001841700002601851700001601877700001401893700001601907700001601923700001501939700001701954700001501971773012501986856008102111852000902192655001202201IND60651613120221121211421.0190712e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065161312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-019-8100-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Man10aSpatial distribution and filtering efficiency of Daphnia in a deep subtropical reservoir  ap. 1277-1288.  aStudies of Daphnia distribution and function could help people manage and protect water quality. We investigated how spatial distribution and filtering efficiency of Daphnia in the transition and lacustrine zones of the Nanwan Reservoir (China). Samplings were conducted seasonally for 2 years from six sites in the reservoir. Daphnia abundance and biomass were significantly higher in the lacustrine zone than in the transition zone. Similar composition and biomass of edible phytoplankton were found in the two zones, suggesting that food quantity could not explain high Daphnia distribution in the lacustrine zone. The variations of water velocity and food quality could help explaining Daphnia patchy distribution in the reservoir. On the one hand, rapid water velocity can cause the Daphnia decrement in the transition zone. On the other hand, the ratio of particulate organic carbon (POC) to chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration was significantly higher in the transition zone, indicating more allochthonous material constituted the food source for Daphnia. The lower quality food likely suppressed Daphnia development in the transition zone. A linear regression between Daphnia abundance and Secchi depth (SD) may suggest a cause-effect relationship where increased filtering efficiency was responsible for increased water clarity to some extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3afood quality 3aparticulate organic carbon 3aphytoplankton 3aregression analysis 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 3aChina1 aSmyth, Rebecca Ashley1 aZhu, Weixia1 aZhang, Li1 aLi, Yuncong1 aWang, Yifan1 aLi, Xuejun1 aGu, Qianhong1 aGao, Yunni0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2019 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.1277-1288dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-019-8100-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245007300197300001700270500002000287520168400307592002801991650001802019650001202037650001802049650001602067650001202083650002402095650001602119650001202135650001002147650001802157650001302175650001402188650002002202650001702222650001902239650001402258650001102272700001902283700001702302773013302319856007302452852000902525655001202534IND60654144220221119135541.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065414422DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.134532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeesters, Maya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9336-517X10aMacroscopic evaluation of the placenta of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos)  ap. 996-1002.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMacroscopic evaluation of the placenta is an essential post‐partum examination in the alpaca and can be of special interest in case of abortion, premature birth or stillbirth. Since there are not many reference values regarding macroscopic properties of normal alpaca placentas, a small descriptive study was conducted. Only placentae from normally foaling alpaca mares, giving birth to healthy crias, after a full‐term and uneventful gestation (±350 days; range 335–360 days) were taken into account (N = 11). Crias weighed (±SD) 7.7 ± 2.25 kg (range 5.5–10 kg), while the mean weight of the full‐term placentas was 0.8 ± 0.19 kg, that is 10% of the bodyweight of the crias. The weight of the allantoamnion and chorion was 0.2 ± 0.07 kg and 0.5 ± 0.13 kg, respectively. The umbilical cord length was 8.8 ± 2.84 cm, and the length of the pregnant and non‐pregnant uterine horns was 69.4 ± 12.77 cm and 54.5 ± 6.81 cm, respectively. The length of the corpus was 14.6 ± 4.68 cm, and the distance from the umbilicus to the corpus was 18.5 ± 6.13 cm. The tissue volume of the allantoamnion was 0.14 ± 0.079 L, and the chorionic volume was 0.37 ± 0.078 L. The surface area of the allantoamnion and the chorion was 87.6 ± 15.56 dm² and 72.3 ± 9.28 dm², respectively. All placentas had small calcifications either around the umbilical cord alone or around the umbilicus and blood vessels of the pregnant uterine horn. These measurements could be used to macroscopically evaluate alpaca placentas, although more research is needed to extend our knowledge of macroscopic evaluation of normal and abnormal placentas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicugna pacos 3aalpacas 3ablood vessels 3abody weight 3achorion 3adescriptive studies 3afetal death 3afoaling 3amares 3anormal values 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3apremature birth 3asurface area 3aumbilical cord 3aumbilicus 3auterus1 aOpsomer, Geert1 aGovaere, Jan0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2019 July, v. 54, no. 7 p.996-1002dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.134533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04080naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245008800185500001900273520221000292592002802502650001802530650002402548650001102572650002402583650002302607650001702630650001102647650002002658650001802678650002302696650001102719650002302730650002002753650002302773650001302796650001302809650003002822650002602852650002002878650001702898650001702915650002402932650001702956650001902973650001202992651001303004651001303017653003003030653002703060653002203087700002503109700003203134700002903166700002703195700002803222773009603250856008703346852000903433655001203442IND60723128420221122192108.0210312e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072312842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1149002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolanía-Hincapié, Karen L.10aSoil physical quality responses to silvopastoral implementation in Colombian Amazon  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCattle ranching is the main land use after deforestation in Amazon region of Colombia. Those poor-managed pasture system typically induces soil compaction, acidification, organic matter losses and soil erosion, leading to soil health degradation and ecosystem service losses. To mitigate this problem, alternative production systems such as silvopastoral systems, where trees, forage, and cattle are combined in an integrated and intensively managed system, have been established in the last years. Hence, we conducted a field study that aimed to assess soil physical quality changes due to the traditional management of livestock and the subsequent transition to a silvopastoral system in two sites in Caquetá state, northwestern Colombian Amazon. In each site, soil samplings were performed in a chronosequence conformed by three areas following the typical land-use change at the region: i) native vegetation, ii) traditional pasture and iii) silvopastoral system. The soil physical properties quantified were: soil bulk density, porosity, penetration resistance, visual evaluation of soil structure, aggregate stability as well as soil organic carbon. Compared to native vegetation, traditional pasture management causes a degradation in soil physical quality, with increases in soil bulk density in subsoil from 1.10 to 1.33 g cm⁻³ and penetration resistance, which reached values around 5 MPa, affecting the distribution of pores and soil structural quality. When pastures were replaced by silvopastoral systems, we observed a recovery in the physical soil attributes with bulk density reaching values of 1.09 g cm⁻³ and penetration resistance of 3.77 MPa. Those improvements as well as the enhacement in visual evaluation soil structure could be associated with increases in soil C content since diversified and greater above and belowground biomass production are expected, as well as improved animal/pasture management. Thus, the implementation of silvopastoral systems is highlighted as an efficient strategy to restore soil physical quality of degraded pastures, contributing to increase pastureland productivity, and indirectly decrease deforestation pressure in the Amazon Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aaggregate stability 3abasins 3abelowground biomass 3abiomass production 3abulk density 3acattle 3achronosequences 3adeforestation 3aecosystem services 3aforage 3aindigenous species 3aland use change 3apasture management 3apastures 3aporosity 3aresistance to penetration 3asilvopastoral systems 3asoil compaction 3asoil density 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asoil structure 3asubsoil 3aAmazonia 3aColombia 0aIntegrated farming system 0aVisual soil evaluation 0aLivestock systems1 aOlaya-Montes, Andres1 aCherubin, Maurício Roberto1 aHerrera-Valencia, Wilmer1 aOrtiz-Morea, Fausto A.1 aSilva-Olaya, Adriana M.0 tGeoderma.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 386 p.114900-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1149003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009800174300001400272520120400286592002801490650000801518650001501526650002501541650001401566650002101580650001501601650001701616650002901633653001401662653001501676653001501691653001401706653001701720653000701737653000701744653000701751653000701758653000801765653000801773653000901781653000801790653000701798653000801805653000701813653000801820653000801828653000901836653000801845653000901853653000801862653000901870653000801879653000901887653000701896653000701903653000901910653000801919700001901927773013001946856008402076852000902160655001202169IND60601618320221120223817.0180706e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060161832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2014.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavelle, Christophe10aChromatin structure and radiation-induced DNA damage: From structural biology to radiobiology  ap. 84-97.  aGenomic DNA in eukaryotic cells is basically divided into chromosomes, each consisting of a single huge nucleosomal fiber. It is now clear that chromatin structure and dynamics play a critical role in all processes involved in DNA metabolism, e.g. replication, transcription, repair and recombination. Radiation is a useful tool to study the biological effects of chromatin alterations. Conversely, radiotherapy and radiodiagnosis raise questions about the influence of chromatin integrity on clinical features and secondary effects. This review focuses on the link between DNA damage and chromatin structure at different scales, showing how a comprehensive multiscale vision is required to understand better the effect of radiations on DNA. Clinical aspects related to high- and low-dose of radiation and chromosomal instability will be discussed. At the same time, we will show that the analysis of the radiation-induced DNA damage distribution provides good insight on chromatin structure. Hence, we argue that chromatin “structuralists” and radiobiological “clinicians” would each benefit from more collaboration with the other. We hope that this focused review will help in this regard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3abioactive properties 3achromatin 3aeukaryotic cells 3ametabolism 3aradiotherapy 3atranscription (genetics) 0aChromatin 0aNucleosome 0aDNA damage 0aRadiation 0aRadiobiology 0aAR 0aBD 0abp 0aCT 0aDDR 0aDSB 0aFISH 0aHDC 0aHR 0aHRS 0aIR 0aIRR 0aLET 0aLINE 0aLNT 0aLORD 0aNCP 0aNHEJ 0aNLT 0aPFGE 0aSF 0aSB 0aSINE 0aSSB1 aForay, Nicolas0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2014 Apr., v. 49 p.84-97dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2014.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011100174300001600285500001400301520172000315592002802035650001802063650001302081650002002094650001602114650001602130650000902146650001802155650002002173650001602193650001302209650001202222650001402234650001002248650001002258650001902268650002302287650002002310650001802330650001302348650001602361653001402377653001902391653002202410653001702432700002002449773012702469856008602596852000902682655001202691IND60678766220221123034933.0200708e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067876622DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2019.15841062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazarizadeh, Hasan10aEvaluation of three mycotoxin binders to prevent the adverse effects of aflatoxin B₁ in growing broilers  ap. 135-139.  aNAL-light  aAflatoxins are a major problem in poultry production and are significant economic and public health burdens worldwide. Three commercial mycotoxin binders (TXB) were used to determine their efficacy in preventing the toxic effects of Aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) on broiler productivity, biochemical and hematological parameters, and liver function. A total of 600 day-old broilers were randomly allotted to 12 treatments in a 3 × 4 factorial arrangement with 3 levels of AFB₁ (0, 2, and 4 µg/g) and 4 TXB (no toxin binder, 1.0 g/kg Mycosorb, 1.0 g/kg Formycin, and 20.0 g/kg Anzymit) with 5 replicates of 10 chicks each per treatment. Results indicated that AFB₁, in comparison with the control, caused a significant decrease in feed intake, weight gain, feed efficiency, and hematological values. Serum proteins (globulin, albumin, and total protein) and serum Ca and P concentrations followed the same pattern. Relative weights of the heart, gizzard and liver, and AST activity in serum were increased in a dose-dependent manner, but ALT activity was not statistically affected by AFB₁. Adding TXB to the AFB₁ contaminated diet increased weight gain, feed efficiency, hematological values and serum proteins. The commercial mycotoxin binders decreased AST and ALT activities, but did not have a significant effect on the relative organs weight and serum Ca and P concentrations. Neither AFB₁ nor commercial toxin binders affected total cholesterol, LDL, or HDL in this study. It was concluded that the addition of the commercial toxin binders to the AFB₁ containing diets reduced the adverse effects of AFB₁ and could be helpful as a solution to the aflatoxicosis problem in young broiler chicks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxicosis 3aalbumins 3aanimal research 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adiet 3adose response 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aformycin 3agizzard 3aglobulins 3aheart 3aliver 3aliver function 3apoultry production 3aprotein content 3apublic health 3atoxicity 3aweight gain 0aAflatoxin 0abroiler chicks 0ahematology status 0atoxin binder1 aPourreza, Javad0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 47, no. 1 p.135-139dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2019.15841063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245018000169300001600349500001400365520150600379592002801885650002001913650001201933650001301945650002401958650002401982650002002006650003302026650000902059650001702068650001502085650002302100650001202123650001302135650001402148650000702162650002202169650001702191650001602208653000902224653000802233653003602241653000802277700002002285700003002305700002002335773012702355856008602482852000902568655001202577IND60678766420221123034846.0200708e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067876642DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2019.15902052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Doaa10aCreatine or guanidinoacetic acid?

Mulard ducklings (n = 250) were randomly assigned to control (without additives), or control plus CREA, GAA, GAA + 0.2%Met (GAAMet0.2) or GAA + 0.4%Met (GAAMet0.4) groups in a completely random experimental design. Dietary supplementation of CREA or GAA significantly increased (P < 0.05) overall weight gain and improved feed:gain ratio. Supplementation of GAA (especially GAAMet0.4 group) significantly increased (P < 0.05) carcass and breast yield. Meat pH values were higher (P < 0.05) with dietary GAA + Met or CREA. Providing of dietary GAA + Met led to higher levels of plasma CREA than dietary CREA itself. The molecular investigation indicated that dietary CREA or GAA with Met enhanced the gene expression of hepatic insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone and muscle myogenin. Finally, dietary GAA + Met was superior to CREA in improving duck’s performance based on molecular markers related to growth (IGF-1 and growth hormone) and myogenesis (upregulating myogenin and downregulating myostatin). Although, dietary GAA + Met enhanced muscle’s CREA loading than CREA, the long-term GAA supplementation in ducks may induce methyl-groups shortage for protein synthesis, this was resolved with Met addition in our study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3abreasts 3acreatine 3adietary supplements 3aexperimental design 3agene expression 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ameat 3ameat quality 3amethionine 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3amyogenin 3amyostatin 3apH 3aprotein synthesis 3asomatotropin 3aweight gain 0aCREA 0aGAA 0aguanidinoacetic acid metabolism 0aIGF1 aEl Sayed, Rania1 aAbdelfattah-Hassan, Ahmed1 aMorshedy, A.

Characterization revealed that bulk–embedded Ag nanoparticles inhibited anatase-to-rutile phase transformation and a decrease in band gap from 3.2 down to 2.8eV with increase in the Ag content. The photocatalytic activity of 0.5at.% Ag–TiO2 nanofibers toward phenol degradation was the greatest, outperforming both unmodified TiO2 nanofibers and commercially available TiO2 Aeroxide® P25 by a factor of ∼3. The high reactivity of the low content Ag–TiO2 nanofibers can be attributed to the addition of electron traps, which provide efficient carrier separation and, therefore, decreased recombination. However, further increase in Ag content led to lower photoreactivity, most likely due to the growth of the Ag nanoparticles, which suggests an optimal size of 2 to 3nm for the Ag nanoparticles at 0.5at.% provided the greatest photoreactivity. Ag–TiO2 nanofibers show great promise as innovative and highly performing nanomaterials for future nanotechnology-based treatment systems, particularly when the photoreactivity demonstrate herein is used in synergy with the established antimicrobial activity of nano-Ag.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aanti-infective properties 3acrystal structure 3ananofibers 3ananosilver 3aphase transition 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3atitanium dioxide 0aAdvanced oxidation processes (AOPs) 0aElectrospinning 0aPhotocatalysis 0aWater and wastewater treatment 0aNanotechnology 0aNanoparticle synthesis1 aZhang, Miluo1 aSanchez, Joel1 aKim, Seil1 aChoa, Yong-Ho1 aCwiertny, David M.1 aMyung, Nosang V.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 299 p.141-148dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.05.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245013400169300001600303520116700319592002801486650002401514650001201538650001601550650001301566650001701579651001001596700002701606700002901633700002301662773017201685856007301857852000901930655001201939IND60408891820221119231058.0150923e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040889182DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.121942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonou Hounsode, Marcel T.10aEfficiency of inventory plot patterns for the estimation of woody vegetation recruit density in a tropical dense forest in Bénin  ap. 355-361.  aThis study assessed the effectiveness of plot patterns for estimating recruit density of woody species in the dense forest of Lama Reserve (Bénin). The experimental design consisted of thirty 0.04 ha plots randomly settled in the forest and each subdivided into four hundred 1‐m² quadrats. Within each quadrat, recruits (dbh ≤10 cm) were counted and saplings (h ≥ 2 m and 2 cm ≤ dbh < 7 cm) and young trees (h ≥ 2 m and 7 cm ≤ dbh < 10 cm) were measured in dbh. In each 0.04 ha plot, seven different plot shapes and sizes were considered by grouping adjacent 1‐m² quadrats. Relationship between mean square error of the estimation of the density of recruitments and the plot sizes was modelled using the Smith law. Results obtained showed an average value of density of recruitments of 10.7 plants/m² with Green index value of 0.01. Shape and size of plots highly influenced the estimation of the density of recruitments. Rectangular plots of length/width = 2 and size of 72 m² (12 m × 6 m) were most efficient for the estimation of the density of recruitments in tropical dense forest with standard error of 0.79 plants/m².  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperimental design 3aforests 3ainventories 3asaplings 3awoody plants 3aBenin1 aKakaï, Romain Glélé1 aAzihou, Akomian Fortuné1 aOuédraogo, Amadé0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2015 Sept., v. 53, no. 3 p.355-361dPublished for the East African Wild Life Society by Blackwell Scientific Publicationsx0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.121943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245020600172300001400378520110600392592002801498650001501526650002801541650002701569650001301596650001801609650002101627650002001648650002701668650002801695650000901723650001401732650001901746650002501765650001201790653002801802653001601830653001601846653002701862653002001889700002301909700002301932773012901955856008402084852000902168655001202177IND60601618620221120223910.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060161862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2014.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModi, Kruti Mehta10aFtsZDr, a tubulin homologue in radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is characterized as a GTPase exhibiting polymerization/depolymerization dynamics in vitro and FtsZ ring formation in vivo  ap. 38-46.  aThe GTPase-dependent polymerization/depolymerization dynamics of FtsZ regulate bacterial cell division in vivo. Deinococcus radiodurans is better known for its extraordinary radioresistance and therefore, the characterization of FtsZ of this bacterium (FtsZDr) would be required to understand the mechanisms underlying regulation of cell division in response to DNA damage. Recombinant FtsZDr bound to GTP and showed GTPase activity. It produced bundles of protofilaments in the presence of either GTP or Mg²⁺ ions. But the formation of the higher size ordered structures required both GTP and Mg²⁺in vitro. It showed polymerization/depolymerization dynamics as a function of GTP and Mg²⁺. Interestingly, ATP interacted with FtsZDr and stimulated its GTPase activity by ∼2-fold possibly by increasing both substrate affinity and rate of reaction. FtsZDr-GFP expressing in D. radiodurans produced typical Z ring perpendicular to the plane of first cell division. These results suggested that FtsZDr is a GTPase in vitro and produces typical Z ring at the mid cell position in D. radiodurans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDeinococcus radiodurans 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abacteria 3acell division 3adepolymerization 3aenzyme activity 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aions 3amagnesium 3apolymerization 3aradiation resistance 3atubulin 0aBacterial cell division 0aDeinococcus 0aFtsZ-GTPase 0aProtein polymerization 0aRadioresistance1 aTewari, Raghvendra1 aMisra, Hari Sharan0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2014 May, v. 50 p.38-46dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2014.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006600169300001600235520127800251592002801529650001101557650001201568650001301580650001601593650001601609650001201625650001801637650002301655650001401678650001001692650002201702653001201724653001301736653002201749653001801771700001601789700001801805700005501823773012101878856008101999852000902080655001202089IND60531762320221116140109.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053176232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProtonotariou, S.10aEffect of jet milled whole wheat flour in biscuits properties  ap. 106-113.  aThere is a great interest of improving the quality of whole wheat products. In our study whole wheat flour (WWF) was micronized substituting biscuit flour (BF) at different levels. Four micronized flours (JMWWF), of particle sizes ranged from d50:53.49 μm to d50:17.02 μm, were produced in different milling conditions. The water holding capacity (WHC) of the fine whole flour increased up to 9%. However, the viscosity of the produced batter was up to 8 fold greater than that of the control, negatively correlated with the particle size of JMWWF. Consequently, the produced biscuits became very hard as flour particle size decreased and substitution level increased, suggesting that the intense milling resulted in detachment of wheat compounds and enhancement of the interactions among different ingredients in baking process. Biscuits' snap force was further positively correlated with moisture, but negatively to spread factor (SF) and lightness. Biscuits prepared with WWF showed the strongest decrease (23%) in SF when substitution level increased from 18.5 to 100%. A reduced SF and a high density was noticed in all samples at 80% and 100% substitution level. Biscuits with 50% JMWWF had good sensory attributes. Higher substitution levels are not recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaking 3abatters 3abiscuits 3acorrelation 3aingredients 3amilling 3aparticle size 3asensory properties 3aviscosity 3awheat 3awhole wheat flour 0aBiscuit 0aJet mill 0aWhole wheat flour 0aParticle size1 aBatzaki, C.1 aYanniotis, S.1 aMandala, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2828-13290 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Dec., v. 74 p.106-113dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04651naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003800151245011800189520270600307592002803013650001503041650001703056650002003073650003003093650001203123650001903135650002303154650002503177650001803202650001303220650001103233650002003244650002503264651001103289653000803300653000703308653000703315653001003322653001003332653000803342653000803350653000803358653000803366653000703374653000803381653000703389653000703396653000603403653000903409653000703418653001203425653000703437653001103444653000903455653000903464653000703473653000903480653000703489653002403496653001703520653002003537653002303557653002403580653001003604700002803614700003903642773011703681856008603798852000903884655001203893IND60791383720221120064105.0220920e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079138372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1155382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlorêncio, Gabriel Wilson Lorena10aClimate change on Eucalyptus plantations and adaptive measures for sustainable forestry development across Brazil  aThe main challenges facing the Eucalyptus plantation industry are employing sustainable projects in suitable areas, and using safer forestry strategies, given climate variability and climate change. Brazil is the world’s largest Eucalyptus producer, and more areas have been allocated for Eucalyptus plantations, even in areas that are considered persistent climate change hotspots. Researchers can combine adequate agroclimatic zoning methods with Earth System Model (ESMs) outputs to analyze changes to climate variables, to map suitable areas, and to outline adaptive measures for Eucalyptus plantations. Despite these facts, studies on the Eucalyptus species are still scarce. This study analyzed the impacts of climate change to suitable areas for planting Eucalyptus in Brazil, using proper Agroclimatic Zoning (AZ) method, and outlining effective adaptive measures for sustainable Eucalyptus cultivation under future climate scenarios. Daily precipitation, air temperature (mean and maximum), and global solar radiation data were used from a set of simulations and projections of nine ESMs, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), in two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). The AZ method was simulated for the current climate (1980–2005), and projected for the near (2021–2050), and far future (2071–2100) climates, in two RCPs. Given intense and persistent changes to precipitation, air temperature, evapotranspiration, and water deficits, i.e., prolonged and continued changes to climate variables resulting from climate change, Eucalyptus plantations will be restricted and economically unfeasible for industrial purposes for about 15 % (RCP 4.5), to 47 % (RCP 8.5), of Brazil in the far future, covering a large part of the North, the north of the Center-West, and the northwestern part of the Northeast, including the new Brazilian agroforestry frontier (MATOPIBA). Only ∼12 % of Brazil, encompassing small areas of the South, the South-Southeast, and a small portion in the Northwest region of the North, will be suitable for Eucalyptus plantations, since these regions are less vulnerable to climate change. As for the rest of Brazil (between ∼42 % and ∼80 %), regular suitability is projected, and the future of Eucalyptus plantations in these places will depend on adopting ‘effective adaptive measures’ and making ‘safe silvicultural decisions’ in order to deal with projected temperature increases and water deficits, including genotypes selection, improvements in hybridization techniques or breeding programs, planting in wider spacings (or lower stockings), and thinning and pruning at shorter intervals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aagroforestry 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3aforestry development 3ahybridization 3aindustry 3amodels 3asolar radiation 3asustainable forestry 3aBrazil 0aAWC 0aAZ 0aCC 0aCMIP5 0aCMIP6 0aCWB 0aESM 0aETc 0aETo 0aFF 0aGWD 0aKc 0aNF 0aP 0aRCPs 0aRs 0aRuBisCo 0aSP 0aSPTemp 0aSPWD 0aSWHC 0aTm 0aTmax 0aWD 0aEarth System models 0aWater stress 0aAir temperature 0aEvapotranspiration 0aSuitability classes 0aCMIP51 aMartins, Fabrina Bolzan1 aFagundes, Flávia Fernanda Azevedo0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 188 p.115538-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1155383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015100173300001600324520132100340592002801661650001501689650002501704650001701729650001201746650001601758650001001774650002401784650001401808650001801822650001301840650001101853650002001864650001101884650002001895650002301915650003301938650000901971650001501980650001101995650001402006650001602020650002102036653002102057653002002078653001402098653003302112653002502145700002202170700005802192773012102250856008102371852000902452655001202461IND60531762420221116140406.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053176242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, Mohammed Shafiq10aOptimization of the extrusion process for development of high fibre soybean-rice ready-to-eat snacks using carrot pomace and cauliflower trimmings  ap. 135-144.  aReady-to-eat low-cost and nutritious extruded snack was developed from composite flour comprising rice, defatted soybean flour, carrot pomace powder and cauliflower trimmings powder. Experimental design was carried out using Box Behnken design of response surface methodology. Experimental variables included die temperature (125–175 °C), screw speed (300–500 rpm) and cauliflower trimmings and carrot pomace powder (7.5–17.5 g/100 g), pulse powder (7.5–17.5 g/100 g) in rice flour (65–85 g/100 g). Extrudate properties were assessed by analyzing bulk density, expansion ratio, water absorption index, water solubility index, hardness, color change, overall acceptability, protein content and fibre content. Analysis of variance revealed that die temperature had the most significant impact among all variables followed by rice flour. The optimum extrusion conditions were 164 °C die temperature, 313 rpm screw speed and 85 g/100 g rice flour with a desirability value of 76.0%. Results showed that optimum composite flour blends 15 percent of defatted soybean flour, carrot pomace powder and cauliflower trimmings powder in rice flour. The blend proportions under optimum extrusion conditions had improved nutritional quality with 10.25 g/100 g protein and 0.84 g/100 g of fibre content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanalysis of variance 3abulk density 3acarrots 3acauliflower 3acolor 3aexperimental design 3aextrusion 3afiber content 3ahardness 3amixing 3anutritive value 3apomace 3aprotein content 3aready-to-eat foods 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice 3arice flour 3asnacks 3asoy flour 3atemperature 3awater solubility 0aNutritious snack 0aComposite flour 0aExtrusion 0aCauliflower trimmings powder 0aCarrot pomace powder1 aPathania, Shivani1 aSharma, Anjali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4111-99940 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Dec., v. 74 p.135-144dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245010200163300001600265500002000281520108200301592002801383596005901411596005901470596005901529596005901588596008001647650001901727650001601746650002001762650001301782650001101795650002301806650001301829650001301842650001801855650003001873700001501903700001801918700001601936700001901952700001401971700001701985700001202002773010902014856008002123852000902203655001202212IND60790327120221121043443.0220824e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079032712DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.126002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Beichen10aAnalysis of the role of mutations in the KMT2D histone lysine methyltransferase in bladder cancer  ap. 693-706.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHistone lysine methyltransferases (HMT) comprise a subclass of epigenetic regulators; dysregulation of these enzymes affects gene expression, which may lead to tumorigenesis. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of 50 HMTs in bladder cancer and found intrinsic links between copy number alterations, mutations, gene expression levels, and clinical outcomes. Through integrative analysis, we identified six HMT genes (PRDM9, ASH1L, SETD3, SETD5, WHSC1L1, and KMT2D) that may play a key role in the development and progression of bladder cancer. Of these six HMTs, histone lysine N‐methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) exhibited the highest mutation rate in bladder cancer. Our comparison of the mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of mutated and wild‐type KMT2D suggested that two signaling pathways (FOX1–miR‐1224‐5p–DLK1 and HIF/GATA5–miR‐133a‐3p–DRD5) may mediate the tumor suppressive effect of the KMT2D mutation. In summary, our findings indicate that mutations in HMT genes, especially KMT2D mutation, may play a role in the development of bladder cancer.  aPublisher supplied data  a81370805cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81470935cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81602236cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81670645cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2014AA020607cNational High Technology Research and Development Program 863 3acarcinogenesis 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3ahistones 3alysine 3amethyltransferases 3amicroRNA 3amutation 3amutation rate 3aurinary bladder neoplasms1 aYan, Libin1 aZhang, Yucong1 aWang, Zhize1 aZhang, Yangjun1 aXia, Ding1 aYe, Zhangqun1 aXu, Hua0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.693-706dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.126003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011500177300001600292500001400308520138400322592002801706650002801734650002201762650002001784650001301804650002301817650001001840650001301850650000901863650001901872650001401891650001301905650001101918650001201929650001201941650001601953653002501969653001201994653001302006653006202019700002902081700001602110700003802126700003602164700002902200700002602229700002902255700002902284773012702313856008602440852000902526655001202535IND60678766820221123035010.0200708e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067876682DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2019.15984202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnyema, Ifeanyichukwu10aLesions of velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease virus infection were more severe in broilers than pullets  ap. 189-194.  aNAL-light  aThis study compared the pathologic effects of velogenic Newcastle disease (ND) virus in broilers and pullets using the normal pathogenic dose of the virus following an earlier report that challenge of the two types of chickens with a low dose of the virus caused mortalities in broilers but none in pullets. One hundred and twenty chickens (10 weeks old) were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 30 each): inoculated intramuscularly with velogenic viscerotropic ND virus (vvNDV) pullets – IP, uninfected pullets – UP, infected broilers – IB and uninfected broilers – UB. Anorexia, depression, ruffled feathers, green diarrhoea, tucking of the head under their wings, droopy wings and prostration were observed on days 2 and 3 post inoculation (PI) in groups IP and IB respectively. Mortality in IP and IB was 100%. Weight loss was significant (P < 0.05) by day 4 PI in both IP and IB when compared with their controls. Percentage weight loss in IP and IB were 20.26% and 38.66%, respectively. Proventricular, intestinal and caecal tonsil haemorrhages were significantly (p < 0.05) more severe in group IB than IP. Histopathology showed more severe necrosis and depletion of the lymphocytes in the bursa of Fabricius, thymus and spleen of group IB than IP. The above observations show that the lesions of vvNDV infection may be more severe in IB than IP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aNewcastle disease 3aanimal research 3aanorexia 3abursa of Fabricius 3acecum 3adiarrhea 3ahead 3ahistopathology 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aspleen 3atonsils 3aviruses 3aweight loss 0aBreed susceptibility 0alesions 0achickens 0avelogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease virus infection1 aEze, Didacus Chukwuemeka1 aAbba, Yusuf1 aEmennaa, Paulinus Ekenedilichukwu1 aShoyinka, Shodeinde Vincent Olu1 aOkwor, Emmanuel Chukwudi1 aEzema, Wilfred Sunday1 aIhedioha, John Ikechukwu1 aOkoye, John Osita Arinze0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 47, no. 1 p.189-194dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2019.15984203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012500166300001600291520170500307592002802012650000802040650001302048650001902061650002002080650001502100650002602115650002902141650000902170650001702179650002502196650001102221650002602232650001602258650002102274653001702295653002202312653002902334653003002363700001902393700001602412773009902428856008502527852000902612655001202621IND60678589520221118225635.0200330e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067858952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2019.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorooah, R.10aInvestigations into the performance of single chamber sanitary napkin incinerators with emphasis on CO and CO2 emissions  ap. 667-676.  aThis paper investigates the performance of two commercially available sanitary napkin incinerators. On detailed preliminary investigations both the incinerators were found to have shortcomings to meet emission norms as per Indian standards for MSW incinerators. Parameters for the comparison were combustion efficiency and emissions, basically CO and CO₂, to assess the quality of combustion.Carefully designed experiments, to improve the performance, revealed the need to evaluate the stochiometric air flow requirement and a need to modify. To enable better combustion inside the combustion chamber, it was established that airflow distribution, and mixing was necessary. The paper analyses the performance of the incinerators towards optimizing the air flow location and the air flow rate in the combustion chamber. Based on these studies it was evident that the commercially available designs are not suitable for five-napkin batches, as claimed by the manufacturers. A higher starting temperature (>600 °C) is essential for quick heating, and optimum an air supply (~10 LPM) is necessary for reducing environmentally sensitive emissions. Results indicated higher combustion efficiency, and a need for meeting the emissions norms as per Indian standards for MSW incinerators.Based on the performance of the devices and arriving at an optimal specification for the design, an alternative method of incineration using LPG gas torch retrofitted over the grate, was tested. The paper also discusses the preliminary results from the new design. The conducive environment in the combustion chamber resulted in higher combustion efficiencies and emissions which conform to Indian emission standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3acombustion efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3aincinerators 3aliquid petroleum gas 3amixing 3amunicipal solid waste 3atemperature 3awaste management 0aIncineration 0aPollution control 0aSanitary napkin disposal 0aCarbon monoxide reduction1 aChanakya, H.N.1 aDasappa, S.0 tWaste management.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 102 p.667-676dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.11.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245011000158300001600268520118300284592002801467650002301495650001501518650001201533650001501545650001001560650002201570650000901592650001901601650001101620650001501631651002301646653003001669653002401699653002801723653001501751653002401766700002101790700001601811773012801827856007501955852000902030655001202039IND60481060020221119092813.0160201e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048106002DNAL7 a10.7882/AZ.2011.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLetnic, Mike10aProblem crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in the freshwater, Katherine River, Northern Territory, Australia  ap. 858-863.  aCrocodylus porosus is a species that is potentially dangerous to humans and there are numerous records of fatal attacks by this species on humans. Since the Northern Territory population of C. porosus was declared a protected species in 1971, their populations have risen markedly, increasing the potential for conflict between people and crocodiles. In 1994 C. porosus was observed in the freshwater Katherine River for the first time in over twenty years. To reduce the risk of crocodile attacks, the Parks and Wildlife Service of the Northern Territory has operated a program to remove C. porosus from the Katherine River since 1995. Between 1994 and 2004, 53 males and 1 female were captured. The mean size of captured crocodiles was 313.9 cm total length. Crocodiles were captured in all months between March and November. The month with the highest rate of crocodile captures was June. The greatest number of crocodile captures were made in the years with the highest wet season rainfall. The results of this study indicate that removal programs need to be conducted throughout the year and highlight the necessity to collect quantitative data on crocodile capture effort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocodylus porosus 3acrocodiles 3afemales 3afreshwater 3amales 3aprotected species 3arain 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3awet season 3aNorthern Territory 0a<i>Crocodylus porosus</i> 0awildlife management 0ahuman wildlife conflict 0afreshwater 0asaltwater crocodile1 aCarmody, Patrick1 aBurke, John0 tAustralian zoologist.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 35, no. 3 p.858-863dRoyal Zoological Society of NSWwJournal:19830x0067-22387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7882/AZ.2011.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245010900166300001600275500002000291520105800311592002801369596005301397596005801450650001501508650001701523650001301540650003001553650001201583650005301595650001201648700002201660700001801682700002101700700002201721773010901743856008001852852000901932655001201941IND60790327320221121043258.0220824e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079032732DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.126192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kyeong-Won,10aFGF11 influences 3T3‐L1 preadipocyte differentiation by modulating the expression of PPARγ regulators  ap. 769-780.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11) is a member of the intracellular fibroblast growth factor superfamily. Here, we identified FGF11 as a novel mediator of adipogenesis. During 3T3‐L1 adipocyte differentiation, the expression of FGF11 decreased at the mitotic clonal expansion stage and increased at the terminal differentiation stage. FGF11 knockdown reduced the expression of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a master regulator of adipogenesis, resulting in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. Treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone restored the inhibition of adipogenesis caused by FGF11 knockdown. We also report that the expression of the PPARγ regulators CCAAT/enhancer‐binding protein α, sterol regulatory element‐binding protein 1, KLF9, KLF2, GATA binding factor 2, and GATA binding factor 3 was influenced by FGF11. These results suggest that FGF11 indirectly controls the expression of PPARγ through modifying the expression of multiple PPARγ regulators, thereby mediating adipogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data  aPE99722cMinistry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea  cKorea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST) 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aagonists 3afibroblast growth factors 3amitosis 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3asterols1 aJeong, Jae‐Yeon1 aAn, Young Jun1 aLee, Jung‐Hyun1 aYim, Hyung‐Soon0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.769-780dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.126193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245020900164300001800373520203500391592002802426650001302454650001902467650001602486650001202502650000902514650002302523650001202546650001002558650001402568650001402582650001302596650001702609650001202626650002802638653001102666653002502677653001602702653001502718700001602733700001602749700001802765700001602783773009302799856008102892852000902973655001202982IND60516068720221117235301.0160323e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051606872DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311110026922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArchbold, H.10aInfluence of age, body weight and body condition score before mating start date on the pubertal rate of maiden Holstein–Friesian heifers and implications for subsequent cow performance and profitability  ap. 1143-1151.  aThe aim of this study was to assess the influence of age, body weight (BW) and body condition score (BCS) of maiden Holstein–Friesian heifers before mating start date (MSD) on the rate of puberty, subsequent production and longevity and their implications with regard to farm profitability. Data were available on 871 Holstein–Friesian heifers from 48 herds. BW was recorded electronically and BCS was recorded by a single operator on a scale of 1 to 5. Heifer age was calculated as the number of days from birth to the day of visit. All of the independent variables of interest were grouped into three or four categories. Three age categories (thirtiles), four BW categories (quartiles) and four BCS categories (⩽2.75, 3.00, 3.25 and ⩾3.50) were formed. Heifers with an identifiable corpus lutuem (CL) in the presence or absence of large follicles and peri-ovulatory signs and with a plasma progesterone (P4) concentration ⩾1 ng/ml were classified as pubertal. In addition, heifers without an identifiable CL in the presence or absence of large follicles and peri-ovulatory signs but with a P4 concentration ⩾1 ng/ml were also classified as pubertal. Age, BW and BCS at MSD were all found to be significantly associated with pubertal rate (P < 0.05). Age was shown to have no practical implications on subsequent cow performance. BW at MSD was favourably associated with subsequent calving date (P < 0.05), subsequent cow BW (P < 0.001) and potential (305 days) milk fat plus protein yield (P < 0.001). BCS at MSD was found to be favourably associated with milk fat plus protein yield potential (P < 0.05) and BCS (P < 0.001) during lactation. The economic analysis undertaken indicated that larger, well-grown heifers will be more profitable because of superior production potential, all else being equal. However, because of the finding of poorer reproductive efficiency in heifers grown to more than 343 kg at MSD, heifers at ∼330 kg at MSD are deemed optimal. This will correspond to mature cow BW of ∼550 kg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abody condition 3abody weight 3acalving 3acows 3afarm profitability 3aheifers 3aherds 3alactation 3alongevity 3amilk fat 3aprogesterone 3apuberty 3areproductive efficiency 0aheifer 0abody condition score 0abody weight 0amilk yield1 aShalloo, L.1 aKennedy, E.1 aPierce, K.

The R ² values for Gompertz, Logistic, von Bertalanffy, Richards and Weibull-type were >0.99, while the exponential (<0.90) had the lowest. What’s more, the Gompertz, Logistic, Richards and Weibull-type models best described the data because of lower MSE (mean square error), AIC(Akaike’s information criteria) and BIC(Schwarz Bayesian information criterion), higher adj. R ²(Adjusted coefficient of determination) and r(the correlation coefficient between measured body weight and estimated body weight) and there was not an autocorrelation between the residual values.

Herein, a TiO2/carbon/Al2O3 membrane was designed and constructed through sequentially depositing graphitic carbon layer with good electro-conductivity and TiO2 nanoparticles layer with photocatalytic activity on Al2O3 membrane support. When light irradiated on the membrane with a voltage supply, the photogenerated electrons could be drained from photocatalytic layer and separated with holes efficiently, thus endowing the membrane with photoelectrocatalytic function. Membrane performance tests indicated that the photoelectrocatalytic membrane filtration (PECM) showed improved removal of natural organic matters (NOMs) and permeate flux with increasing voltage supply. For PECM process at 1.0V, its NOMs removal was 1.2 or 1.7 times higher than that of filtration with UV irradiation or filtration alone, and its stable permeate flux was 1.3 or 3 times higher than that of filtration with UV irradiation or filtration alone. Moreover, the PECM process exhibited special advantage in removing organic chemicals (e.g., Rhodamine B), which displayed 1.3 or 3 times higher removal than that of filtration with UV irradiation or filtration alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3aelectrons 3afiltration 3ananoparticles 3aorganic compounds 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater treatment 0aPhotoelectrocatalysis 0aMembrane 0aTiO2 0aCarbon 0aWater treatment1 aChen, Shuo1 aYu, Hongtao1 aQuan, Xie0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 299 p.27-34dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03570naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001900160245009500179300001600274500000900290520206800299592002802367650001602395650002502411650001902436650002402455650002302479650002002502650002502522650002102547650002302568650001202591650002102603650001602624650001802640650002802658650001102686650002202697650001702719650002202736650001302758650001602771650002002787651001102807700001802818773012202836852000902958856009702967655001203064IND8308880120221119003253.0191122e198307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND830888012DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1983.00021962007500040004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnett, F.

During 1976–1979, we evaluated several grass−legume mixtures in a field study in eastern Kansas. Grasses were: commercial smooth brome, Bromus inermis Leyss.; ‘Regar’ Turkish brome, B. biebersteinii Roem. &Schult.; ‘Kentucky 31’ tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Scbreb.; and ‘Ioreed’ reed canarygrass, Phalaris arundinacea L. Legumes were: ‘Kanza’ alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.; ‘Kenstar’ red clover, Trifolium pratense L.; ‘Dawn’ birdsfoot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus L.; and ‘Emerald’ crownvetch, Coronilla varia L. Each grass was grown in a two−species mixture with each legume, and in a pure stand with 0 and 90 kg N ha−¹ as NH₄NO₃. Mixtures were obtained by alternating all−grass and all−legume drill rows. Legumes were grown in pure stands in an adjacent planting. Both plantings were on a Woodson silt loam of the fine, mixed, thermic family in the Abruptic Argiaquolls subgroup of the Mollisols. Dry matter (DM) yields were obtained from all plots. Proportion of grass in mixtures was determined from hand−harvested samples. Dry matter yield of the grass component of each mixture was computed as the product of the DM yield of the whole stand and the proportion of grass in the mixture. Crude protein (CP) contents of whole stands and grass components of mixtures were computed as 6.25 times N. Although comparisons varied across years, mixtures averaged as much grass DM (3.21 Mg ha−¹) as unfertilized all−grass stands (3.07 Mg ha−¹) during the 4−year period. Crude−protein contents of grass components of mixtures consistently ranked above those of unfertilized all−grass stands; differences usually were significant (P < 0.05) but varied in magnitude with year and type of stand.

In this context, the problem of sea levels on global and regional scales have been analyzed in a number of studies based on tide gauges observations and satellite altimetry measurements. This study focuses on trend estimates from 18 high-quality tide gauge stations along the Mediterranean Sea coast. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test was run at a 5% significance level for each of the 18 stations for the period of 1993–2015 (satellite altimetry era). The results of this test indicate that the trends for 17 stations were statistically significant and showed an increase (no significant trend was observed only at one station). The rates of sea level change for the 17 stations that exhibit significant trends, estimated using seasonal Sen’s approach, range after correction for Vertical Land Motion (VLM) from 1.48 to 8.72 mm/a for the period 1993–2015. Furthermore, the magnitude of change at the location of each tide gauge station was estimated using the satellite altimetry measurements. Thus, the results obtained agree with those from the tide-gauge data analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3agauges 3aremote sensing 3asatellite altimetry 3asea level 3aMediterranean Sea1 aHaddad, Mahdi0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2019 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.1176-1185dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-019-8164-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245019300170300001400363520092600377592002801303650001301331650001201344650001501356650001301371650001501384650001101399650000901410650000901419650001401428650001801442650001101460650001901471650001101490650003101501650001701532650001001549650001101559650000901570653002201579653001601601653001101617653001501628700002801643700002501671773009801696856008501794852000901879655001201888IND60546454520221119022737.0160903e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054645452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarwowska, Ewa14aThe influence of metal speciation in combustion waste on the efficiency of Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni and Cr bioleaching in a mixed culture of sulfur-oxidizing and biosurfactant-producing bacteria  ap. 35-41.  aMetal leachability from ash and combustion slag is related to the physico-chemical properties, including their speciation in the waste. Metals speciation is an important factor that influences the efficiency of metal bioleaching from combustion wastes in a mixed culture of acidophilic and biosurfactant-producing bacteria. It was observed that individual metals tended to occur in different fractions, which reflects their susceptibility to bioleaching. Cr and Ni were readily removed from wastes when present with a high fraction bound to carbonates. Cd and Pb where not effectively bioleached when present in high amounts in a fraction bound to organic matter. The best bioleaching results were obtained for power plant slag, which had a high metal content in the exchangeable, bound to carbonates and bound to Fe and Mg oxides fractions– the metal recovery percentage for Zn, Cu and Ni from this waste exceeded 90%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3acadmium 3acarbonates 3achromium 3acombustion 3acopper 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amixed culture 3anickel 3aorganic matter 3aoxides 3aphysicochemical properties 3apower plants 3aslags 3awastes 3azinc 0aCombustion wastes 0aBioleaching 0aMetals 0aSpeciation1 aWojtkowska, Małgorzata1 aAndrzejewska, Dorota0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 299 p.35-41dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002200092024001900114024002700133040001800160100001500178245013800193300002000331506007600351520084400427592002801271506003701299650004101336650002501377650004301402650002201445650003301467650005001500650003701550650002701587650003101614650003101645650002401676650003301700650001701733653002101750653001901771653003001790653003301820653003301853653003001886700001701916700001401933700001401947700001701961700001901978700002301997773013502020852000902155856007502164655001202239IND4464826020221207125329.0160905e20121205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446482602DNAL7 aPMC35347442pmcid7 a231508952pmid7 a10.1021/jf303415d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Boyan10aDifferentiating Organic from Conventional Peppermints Using Chromatographic and Flow Injection Mass Spectrometric (FIMS) Fingerprints  ap. 11987-11994.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and flow injection mass spectrometric (FIMS) fingerprinting techniques were tested for their potential in differentiating organic and conventional peppermint samples.

FIMS fingerprinting provided a rapid test to differentiate organic and conventional peppermints in 1 min of analysis and has potential for high-throughput applications. On the other hand, HPLC fingerprints provide more information about the chemical composition of the samples, but take a longer time to differentiate organic and conventional peppermint samples.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3achemical composition 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aprincipal component analysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFlow Injection Analysisxmethods 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMentha piperitaxchemistry 2aOrganic Agriculture 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aTime Factors 0aHPLC fingerprint 0aflow injection 0amass spectral fingerprint 0aprincipal component analysis 0apeppermint (Mentha piperita) 0akaempferol 7-O-rutinoside1 aLu, Yingjian1 aQin, Fang1 aChen, Pei1 aShi, Haiming1 aCharles, Denys1 aYu, Liangli (Lucy)0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Dec. 05, v. 60, no. 48 p.11987-11994dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf303415d3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04105naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245008300216500002200299520208700321592002802408650002002436650001302456650001302469650001202482650002802494650001202522650001302534650001102547650002002558650001402578650001402592650001802606650001502624650001302639650000902652650000902661650001402670650001402684650001102698650001102709650001802720650001802738650001602756650000902772650002002781650001402801650001102815650001902826650001702845650002502862650002102887650001602908650001302924650000902937651001002946653003102956653002202987653003503009653002303044700001703067700001503084700001603099700001803115700002203133700001803155773007803173856008703251852000903338655001203347IND60570925120221120103129.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057092512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbuquerque, M.T.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8782-613310aDeveloping a new Bayesian Risk Index for risk evaluation of soil contamination  aPre-press version  aIndustrial and agricultural activities heavily constrain soil quality. Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) are a threat to public health and the environment alike. In this regard, the identification of areas that require remediation is crucial. In the herein research a geochemical dataset (230 samples) comprising 14 elements (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Ni, Mn, Fe, As, Cd, V, Cr, Ti, Al and S) was gathered throughout eight different zones distinguished by their main activity, namely, recreational, agriculture/livestock and heavy industry in the Avilés Estuary (North of Spain). Then a stratified systematic sampling method was used at short, medium, and long distances from each zone to obtain a representative picture of the total variability of the selected attributes. The information was then combined in four risk classes (Low, Moderate, High, Remediation) following reference values from several sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). A Bayesian analysis, inferred for each zone, allowed the characterization of PTEs correlations, the unsupervised learning network technique proving to be the best fit. Based on the Bayesian network structure obtained, Pb, As and Mn were selected as key contamination parameters. For these 3 elements, the conditional probability obtained was allocated to each observed point, and a simple, direct index (Bayesian Risk Index-BRI) was constructed as a linear rating of the pre-defined risk classes weighted by the previously obtained probability. Finally, the BRI underwent geostatistical modeling. One hundred Sequential Gaussian Simulations (SGS) were computed. The Mean Image and the Standard Deviation maps were obtained, allowing the definition of High/Low risk clusters (Local G clustering) and the computation of spatial uncertainty. High-risk clusters are mainly distributed within the area with the highest altitude (agriculture/livestock) showing an associated low spatial uncertainty, clearly indicating the need for remediation. Atmospheric emissions, mainly derived from the metallurgical industry, contribute to soil contamination by PTEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aaltitude 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3aartificial intelligence 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adata collection 3aemissions 3aestuaries 3ageostatistics 3aguidelines 3aindustry 3airon 3alead 3alivestock 3amanganese 3amodels 3anickel 3anormal values 3apublic health 3aremediation 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asediments 3asilver 3asoil pollution 3asoil quality 3astatistical analysis 3atoxic substances 3auncertainty 3avanadium 3azinc 3aSpain 0aPotentially toxic elements 0aBayesian networks 0aSequential Gaussian simulation 0aLocal G clustering1 aGerassis, S.1 aSierra, C.1 aTaboada, J.1 aMartín, J.E.1 aAntunes, I.M.H.R.1 aGallego, J.R.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.06.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245012400159300001600283520176700299592002802066650002702094650001902121650001102140650002102151650001202172650001602184650002402200650001402224650002502238650001302263650001302276650001402289650001102303651002002314653001502334653003402349653001302383653001202396653001902408653001902427700002402446700001502470773012802485856007502613852000902688655001202697IND60481060620221119094815.0160201e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048106062DNAL7 a10.7882/AZ.2011.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDivljan, Anja10aDeaths and injuries to Grey-headed Flying-foxes, Pteropus poliocephalus shot at an orchard near Sydney, New South Wales  ap. 698-710.  aFor several years, animal welfare concerns have been raised over the practice of shooting Grey-headed Flying-foxes (GHFF) in commercial fruit orchards in Australia, and the role of government agencies in licensing the kill. In NSW the practice is poorly monitored and insufficient evidence has been available to assess welfare concerns. This study reports the first systematically acquired data on flying-foxes shot under licence in NSW. In the 2006/07 season the average number of GHFFs licensed to be harmed was <40 individuals per licence. Despite this, a total of 164 dead or injured flying-foxes were collected (n = 146) or observed (n = 18) from an orchard in western Sydney over two weeks in spring 2007, after shooting had occurred at the orchard to protect fruit crops. Detailed information, including sex, reproductive state, age and description of injuries, was compiled on 136 collected bats. The sex ratio was strongly skewed towards females (1:1.73), of which 54 (65%) were lactating at the time.Thirteen of these were shot while carrying their dependent young, while 41 neonates would have been left behind in the camp to die. Hence, the total estimate of flying-foxes that died due to shooting in the orchard over the two-week period was 205. Collected bats suffered from various injuries, and at least 30% (44% including the neonates left in the camp) were alive and unattended more than 8.5 hours after shooting. This is in contravention of the definition of ‘humane killing’ and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979. Importantly, the GHFF is vulnerable under NSW and Federal legislations and the killing of reproducing females in crops contributes to its declining numbers, making Sydney Basin an ecological trap for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteropus poliocephalus 3aanimal welfare 3abasins 3aecological traps 3afemales 3afruit crops 3agovernment agencies 3alactation 3alaws and regulations 3aneonates 3aorchards 3asex ratio 3aspring 3aNew South Wales 0aFlying-fox 0a<i>Pteropus poliocephalus</i> 0ashooting 0aorchard 0ahumane killing 0aanimal welfare1 aParry-Jones, Kerryn1 aEby, Peggy0 tAustralian zoologist.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 35, no. 3 p.698-710dRoyal Zoological Society of NSWwJournal:19830x0067-22387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7882/AZ.2011.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002800156245010900184300002000293520105100313592002801364650002001392650001601412650001501428650001601443650002301459650001401482650001801496650002201514650004601536650002901582650002701611650003701638650001801675650001601693650004801709653002101757653001601778653001801794653001101812653001101823653001701834700001801851700002501869700002601894700002101920700002301941773013501964852000902099856007502108655001202183IND4464826120160905000000.0160905e20121205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446482612DNAL7 a231577172pmid7 a10.1021/jf303502h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoelants, Katlijn
R. N.10aRelation between Particle Size and Carotenoid Bioaccessibility in Carrot- and Tomato-Derived Suspensions  ap. 11995-12003.  aTo study the effect of particle size on the relative all-E-β-carotene and all-E-lycopene bioaccessibility in carrot- and tomato-derived suspensions, respectively, an in vitro digestion approach including oil was used. Adding olive oil (2%) during digestion, especially as an oil-in-water emulsion, resulted in a substantial increase in carotenoid uptake in the micellar phase. Carotenoid bioaccessibility decreased with average particle size. Only particles smaller than an individual cell resulted in high bioaccessibility values, pointing out the importance of the cell wall as the main barrier for carotenoid uptake. The relation obtained between particle size and bioaccessibility was used to predict the carotenoid bioaccessibility in carrot- and tomato-derived purées. These predictions indicated that carotenoid bioaccessibility in plant-based food suspensions is not only determined by the cell wall integrity (related with particle size) but is also affected by interactions between the structural compounds of the complex food matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acarotenoids 3acell walls 3afood matrix 3ain vitro digestion 3aolive oil 3aparticle size 3aplant-based foods 2aCarotenoidsxchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 2aDaucus carotaxchemistry 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aSolanum lycopersicumxchemistry. 2aParticle Size 2aSuspensions 2abeta Carotenexchemistryxpharmacokinetics. 0abioaccessibility 0acarotenoids 0aparticle size 0acarrot 0atomato 0aoil emulsion1 aLemmens, Lien1 aVandebroeck, Marijke1 aVan Buggenhout, Sandy1 aVan Loey, Ann M.1 aHendrickx, Marc E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Dec. 05, v. 60, no. 48 p.11995-12003dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf303502h3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02761naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245007600213300001400289500001500303506007600318520124200394592002801636506003701664650001301701650001101714650001401725650001101739650002901750650002501779650001401804650001901818650001501837650000801852653001501860700002001875700002701895700002001922700002001942700001601962700001801978700002001996700002102016773012702037856008202164852000902246655001202255IND60089638520221207073924.0141102e20120914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008963852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.1442doi7 aPMC34457562pmcid7 a229025372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee-Soety, Julia Y.10aYeast hnRNP-related proteins contribute to the maintenance of telomeres  ap. 12-17.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTelomeres protect the ends of linear chromosomes, which if eroded to a critical length can become uncapped and lead to replicative senescence. Telomerase maintains telomere length in some cells, but inappropriate expression facilitates the immortality of cancer cells. Recently, proteins involved in RNA processing and ribosome assembly, such as hnRNP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein) A1, have been found to participate in telomere maintenance in mammals. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Npl3 shares significant amino acid sequence similarities with hnRNP A1. We found that deleting NPL3 accelerated the senescence of telomerase null cells. The highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRM) in Npl3 appear to be important for preventing faster senescence. Npl3 preferentially binds telomere sequences in vitro, suggesting that Npl3 may affect telomeres directly. Despite similarities between the two proteins, human hnRNP A1 is unable to complement the lack of Npl3 to rescue accelerated senescence in tlc1 npl3 cells. Deletion of CBC2, which encodes another hnRNP-related protein that associates with Npl3, also accelerates senescence. Potential mechanisms by which hnRNP-related proteins maintain telomeres are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aproteins 3ahumans 3atelomeres 3ayeasts 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3aribosomes 3aneoplasm cells 3atelomerase 3aRNA 0asenescence1 aJones, Jennifer1 aMacGibeny, Margaret A.1 aRemaly, Erin C.1 aDaniels, Lynsey1 aIto, Andrea1 aJean, Jessica1 aRadecki, Hannah1 aSpencer, Shannon0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Sept. 14, v. 426, no. 1 p.12-17dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144242016300166245017400329300001600503520137300519592002801892650002601920650001301946650001201959650002201971650002201993650001502015650001802030650000902048650002002057650001302077650001502090650003802105650001102143650001802154650002002172650002202192653001202214653002002226653001802246653001602264653002302280700001602303700002602319700002202345700002202367700002002389700001802409700001702427700002302444773009902467856007802566852000902644655001202653IND60690018820221119003901.0200424e20200421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069001882DNAL7 a10.2478/boku-2019-00192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGichana, Zipporah10aAuswirkungen aerober und anaerober Biofilter auf die Wasserqualität in einer kleindimensionierten Kreislaufanlage für Niltilapien (Oreochromis niloticus L.)10aEffects of aerated and non-aerated biofilters on effluent water treatment from a small-scale recirculating aquaculture system for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.)  ap. 209-219.  aMost recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) use aerated biofilters to maintain suitable water quality for fish production. However, application of non-aerated biofilters may provide opportunities to lower aeration costs, water usage and concentration of all nitrogenous wastes in the effluent water. Our study aimed at comparing the biofiltration performance characteristics of two biofilters: a conventional aerated biofilter and a non-aerated biofilter receiving the same effluent water from a small-scale RAS. The two biofilters were evaluated in triplicate and tested concurrently for seven months. Water quality parameters were monitored at the biofilter inlets and outlets and in the fish tanks. At the beginning of the experiment, the concentration of ammonia at the two biofilter outlets were not significantly different. However, the concentrations decreased with time reaching mean values of 1.33 ± 0.02 mg L⁻¹ and 1.23 ± 0.21 mg L⁻¹ N-NH₄ in the aerated and non-aerated biofilters, respectively. Whereas phosphorus and nitrate levels were significantly high in the aerated biofilter. There was no significant difference in the growth of fish between the aerated and non-aerated biofilters. The results suggest that non-aerated biofilters can be as effective as aerated biofilters in maintaining suitable water quality for O. niloticus production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaeration 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquaculture tanks 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3afish 3afish production 3anitrates 3aphosphorus 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3awastes 3awater quality 3awater treatment 3awater utilization 0aAerated 0adenitrification 0anitrification 0anon-aerated 0aremoval efficiency1 aLiti, David1 aDrexler, Silke-Silvia1 aZollitsch, Werner1 aMeulenbroek, Paul1 aWakibia, Joseph1 aOgello, Erick1 aAkoll, Peter1 aWaidbacher, Herwig0 pDie Bodenkulturg2020 Apr. 21, v. 70, no. 4 p.209-219dSciendowJournal:14415x0006-54717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/boku-2019-00193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245007200168300001400240500000900254500001500263520159700278592002801875650001101903650002301914650002301937650002301960650001401983650001601997650001502013650002802028650002302056650001802079650002002097650001902117651001302136653001402149700001502163773013202178852000902310856008302319655001202402IND4417912720221120154640.0191122e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441791272DNAL7 a10.3198/jpr2008.07.0429crg2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourland, Fred M.10aRegistration of Arkot 9623 and Arkot 9625 Germplasm Lines of Cotton  ap. 69-72.  aepub  a2019-12-06  aArkot 9623 (Reg. No. GP-908, PI 651858) and Arkot 9625 (Reg. No. GP-909, PI 651859) are noncommercial breeding lines of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) released by the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station in January 2008. Both lines were derived from 1996 crosses using one common parent, Arkot 8712. The second parent of Arkot 9623 was DES 119 N Sm ne. The other parent of Arkot 9625 was ST 474. The lines were evaluated in 16 replicated tests in Arkansas from 2003 to 2006. Lint yields, lint percentage, and seed produced per area for each line were equal to two check cultivars. Both lines are early maturing, with Arkot 9625 significantly earlier than Arkot 9623 and the short-season cultivar SG 105, and Arkot 9623 equal to SG 105. Yield components of Arkot 9623 were similar to the checks, but Arkot 9625 produced larger seed with more lint per seed. Compared with check cultivars, Arkot 9623 fiber length was shorter and strength of both lines was weaker. Leaf pubescence and bract trichome density of the two lines were intermediate between the smooth-leaf and hairy-leaf check cultivars. Compared with the checks, both lines expressed improved resistance to bacterial blight [caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum (Smith) Dye], Fusarium wilt [caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schlect. F. sp. vasinfectum (Atk.) Snyd. & Hans.], root-knot nematode [Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White, 1919) Chitwood, 1949], and a seedling disease pathogen. The relative yield, maturity, and line-specific host plant resistance traits make these lines valuable to cotton breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3agermplasm releases 3agenetic resistance 3aGossypium hirsutum 3atrichomes 3afiber crops 3acrop yield 3aplant genetic resources 3adisease resistance 3afiber quality 3apest resistance 3abreeding lines 3aArkansas 0agermplasm1 aJones, Don0 tJournal of plant registrations.g2009 Jan., v. 3, no. 1 p.69-72dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:6195x1940-34967nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3198/jpr2008.07.0429crg3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02566naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008000166300001600246520139600262592002801658650001501686650002001701650001001721650001301731650001801744650001101762650001701773650000901790653002101799653002001820653002001840653001401860653000901874653001901883700001601902700001601918700001601934773009901950856008602049852000902135655001202144IND60659389920221122221550.0200412e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065938992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2018.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmid, J.10aTechnical note - Thermal exposure of wood in standard fire resistance tests  ap. 179-185.  aRecently, standard fire resistance testing has been questioned for combustible products. A part of the comments address the thermal boundary conditions and the different thermal exposure of combustible products in comparison to incombustibles. These comments are evaluated in this technical note.To compare heat flux measurements of combustibles and incombustible products when tested in a furnace, furnace tests were performed. The furnace was controlled by plate thermometers to follow the EN 1363/ISO 834 standard temperature-time curve. It could be proven that (a) the heat flux measurements at the specimens surface behind the plate thermometer (PT) are not higher than in front of the PT. The reason for this is most likely that no flaming combustion is possible near the surface due to the low oxygen content typically for a furnace. It could be further shown (b) that the heat flux measurements when combustibles are tested follow the trend reported in literature for incombustibles. Further, (c) that the lower burner fuel used in furnaces is due to the contribution of the specimen (ca. 30% in the presented tests) and due to the lower thermal inertia (ca. 20% in the presented tests). Finally it can be concluded that the thermal exposure of combustibles and incombustibles is equivalent in furnaces simulating a ventilation controlled fire development for a pre-defined duration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3afire resistance 3afuels 3afurnaces 3aheat transfer 3aoxygen 3athermometers 3awood 0aThermal exposure 0aFire resistance 0aFurnace testing 0aHeat flux 0aWood 0aCombustibility1 aBrandon, D.1 aWerther, N.1 aKlippel, M.0 tFire safety journal.g2019 July, v. 107 p.179-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2018.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245010600200300002000306506007600326520167700402592002802079506003702107650003202144650002202176650001602198650001702214650001702231650002402248650001102272650001102283650002302294650002002317650001402337650002702351700001902378700002302397700002402420700001802444773014902462856007502611852000902686655001202695IND60538584820221207085958.0160815e20120704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053858482DNAL7 a10.1021/ja303286e2doi7 aPMC34062922pmcid7 a226799252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeriole, Xavier10aStructural Determinants of the Supramolecular Organization of G Protein-Coupled Receptors in Bilayers  ap. 10959-10965.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin self-assembles into supramolecular structures in native bilayers, but the structural determinants of receptor oligomerization are not known. We carried out multiple self-assembly coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations of model membranes containing up to 64 molecules of the visual receptor rhodopsin over time scales reaching 100 μs. The simulations show strong preferential interaction modes between receptors. Two primary modes of receptor–receptor interactions are consistent with umbrella sampling/potential of mean force (PMF) calculations as a function of the distance between a pair of receptors. The preferential interfaces, involving helices (H) 1/8, 4/5 and 5, present no energy barrier to forming a very stable receptor dimer. Most notably, the PMFs show that the preferred rhodopsin dimer exists in a tail-to-tail conformation, with the interface comprising transmembrane H1/H2 and amphipathic H8 at the extracellular and cytoplasmic surfaces, respectively. This dimer orientation is in line with earlier electron microscopy, X-ray, and cross-linking experiments of rhodopsin and other GPCRs. Less stable interfaces, involving H4 and H6, have a free energy barrier for desolvation (delipidation) of the interfaces and appear to be designed to stabilize “lubricated” (i.e., lipid-coated) dimers. The overall CGMD strategy used here is general and can be applied to study the homo- and heterodimerization of GPCRs and other transmembrane proteins. Systematic extension of the work will deepen our understanding of the forces involved in the membrane organization of integral membrane proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aGibbs free energy 3aX-radiation 3acrosslinking 3adimerization 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aoligomerization 3arhodopsin 3atransmembrane proteins1 aKnepp, Adam M.1 aSakmar, Thomas P.,1 aMarrink, Siewert J.1 aHuber, Thomas0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 July 04, v. 134, no. 26 p.10959-10965dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja303286e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245012400173300002000297520171600317592002802033650002302061650001302084650001702097650001502114650001702129653002702146653002202173653001202195653000902207653003002216653002202246653002002268700001602288700006102304700005302365700001902418700006002437700005602497773014302553856007802696852000902774655001202783IND60751120220220217000000.0210922e20210913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075112022DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c116762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez Álvarez, Sol10aCharge Carrier Diffusion Dynamics in Multisized Quaternary Alkylammonium-Capped CsPbBr₃ Perovskite Nanocrystal Solids  ap. 44742-44750.  aCsPbBr₃ quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for optoelectronic devices. The substitution of oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA) capping agents with a quaternary alkylammonium such as di-dodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) has shown an increase in external quantum efficiency (EQE) from 0.19% (OA/OLA) to 13.4% (DDAB) in LED devices. The device performance significantly depends on both the diffusion length and the mobility of photoexcited charge carriers in QD solids. Therefore, we investigated the charge carrier transport dynamics in DDAB-capped CsPbBr₃ QD solids by constructing a bi-sized QD mixture film. Charge carrier diffusion can be monitored by quantitatively varying the ratio between two sizes of QDs, which varies the mean free path of the carriers in each QD cluster. Excited-state dynamics of the QD solids obtained from ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that the photogenerated electrons and holes are difficult to diffuse among small-sized QDs (4 nm) due to the strong quantum confinement. On the other hand, both photoinduced electrons and holes in large-sized QDs (10 nm) would diffuse toward the interface with the small-sized QDs, followed by a recombination process. Combining the carrier diffusion study with a Monte Carlo simulation on the QD assembly in the mixture films, we can calculate the diffusion lengths of charge carriers to be ∼239 ± 16 nm in 10 nm CsPbBr₃ QDs and the mobility values of electrons and holes to be 2.1 (± 0.1) and 0.69 (± 0.03) cm²/V s, respectively. Both parameters indicate an efficient charge carrier transport in DDAB-capped QD films, which rationalized the perfect performance of their LED device application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aammonium 3ananocrystals 3aoleic acid 3aspectroscopy 0aultrafast spectroscopy 0adiffusion lengths 0aCsPbBr3 0aDDAB 0aquantum dot photovoltaics 0acarrier transport 0acharge transfer1 aLin, Weihua1 aAbdellah, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6875-58861 aMeng, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3813-52211 aŽídek, Karel1 aPullerits, Tõnu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1428-55641 aZheng, Kaibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7236-10700 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Sept. 13, v. 13, no. 37 p.44742-44750dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c116763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100002700182245012400209506007600333520133900409592002801748506003701776650002201813650001301835650001501848650001301863650001201876650001601888650002801904650002801932650001001960650001201970650001901982650001502001650002602016650002202042650002102064650002902085650001702114650002202131650001802153650001402171700002302185700004002208700002602248700001702274700002602291710005702317710007702374710005802451773006802509856007502577852000902652655001202661IND60530353820221207144030.0160721s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053035382DNAL7 a10.1155/2012/2489832doi7 aPMC35442652pmcid7 a233657232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitcosque, Gabriela L.10aProduction of Biomass-Degrading Multienzyme Complexes under Solid-State Fermentation of Soybean Meal Using a Bioreactor  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiomass-degrading enzymes are one of the most costly inputs affecting the economic viability of the biochemical route for biomass conversion into biofuels. This work evaluates the effects of operational conditions on biomass-degrading multienzyme production by a selected strain of Aspergillus niger . The fungus was cultivated under solid-state fermentation (SSF) of soybean meal, using an instrumented lab-scale bioreactor equipped with an on-line automated monitoring and control system. The effects of air flow rate, inlet air relative humidity, and initial substrate moisture content on multienzyme (FPase, endoglucanase, and xylanase) production were evaluated using a statistical design methodology. Highest production of FPase (0.55 IU/g), endoglucanase (35.1 IU/g), and xylanase (47.7 IU/g) was achieved using an initial substrate moisture content of 84%, an inlet air humidity of 70%, and a flow rate of 24 mL/min. The enzymatic complex was then used to hydrolyze a lignocellulosic biomass, releasing 4.4 g/L of glucose after 36 hours of saccharification of 50 g/L pretreated sugar cane bagasse. These results demonstrate the potential application of enzymes produced under SSF, thus contributing to generate the necessary technological advances to increase the efficiency of the use of biomass as a renewable energy source.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus niger 3aair flow 3aautomation 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3aeconomic sustainability 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afungi 3aglucose 3alignocellulose 3amonitoring 3amultienzyme complexes 3arelative humidity 3asaccharification 3asolid state fermentation 3asoybean meal 3asugarcane bagasse 3awater content 3axylanases1 aFonseca, Rafael F.1 aRodríguez-Zúñiga, Ursula Fabiola1 aBertucci Neto, Victor1 aCouri, Sonia1 aFarinas, Cristiane S.2 aFinanciadora de Estudos e Projetos (Brazil),eFunder2 aConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico,eFunder2 aEmpresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária,eFunder0 tEnzyme research.g2012, v. 2012wJournal:23313x2090-04147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/2489833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002000175245011900195300001400314520114000328592002801468650002001496650001901516650001901535650001901554650001301573650001101586650001401597650001901611650002001630650001501650650001101665650001501676650002601691650001201717650000901729650001401738650002301752650001501775650002301790700002501813700003001838700001801868700001701886700002001903700002801923700002301951700002401974700002101998773014902019856006802168856010102236990002302337852000902360655001202369IND60643283920221119111724.0190510e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064328392DNAL7 a10.3791/26052doi7 aPMC31970322pmcid7 a216736332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConradi, Lenard10aBioluminescence imaging for assessment of immune responses following implantation of engineered heart tissue (eht)  ap. e2605.  aVarious techniques of cardiac tissue engineering have been pursued in the past decades including scaffolding strategies using either native or bioartificial scaffold materials, entrapment of cardiac myocytes in hydrogels such as fibrin or collagen and stacking of myocyte monolayers 1. These concepts aim at restoration of compromised cardiac function (e.g. after myocardial infarction) or as experimental models (e.g. predictive toxicology and substance screening or disease modelling). Precise monitoring of cell survival after implantation of engineered heart tissue (EHT) has now become possible using in-vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) techniques 2. Here we describe the generation of fibrin-based EHT from a transgenic rat strain with ubiquitous expression of firefly luciferase (ROSA/luciferase-LEW Tg; 3). Implantation is performed into the greater omentum of different rat strains to assess immune responses of the recipient organism following EHT implantation. Comparison of results generated by BLI and the Enzyme Linked Immuno Spot Technique (ELISPOT) confirm the usability of BLI for the assessment of immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioluminescence 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3acell viability 3acollagen 3afibrin 3ahydrogels 3aimage analysis 3aimmune response 3aluciferase 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amyocardial infarction 3aomentum 3arats 3ascreening 3atissue engineering 3atoxicology 3atransgenic animals1 aPahrmann, Christiane1 aSchmidt, S.q(Stephanie),1 aDeuse, Tobias1 aHansen, Arne1 aEder, Alexandra1 aReichenspurner, Hermann1 aRobbins, Robert C.1 aEschenhagen, Thomas1 aSchrepfer, Sonja0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2011 June 01, , no. 52 p.e2605-e2605dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/26053Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2605/bioluminescence-imaging-for-assessment-immune-responses-following  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245005800207300001400265506007600279520056700355592002800922506003700950650002200987650001901009650001101028650001001039650001701049650003101066650001301097650001901110650001301129653001701142653002001159653002201179653001801201653002201219700002101241700002001262700001701282700002001299700002201319773010801341856008301449852000901532655001201541IND60551058520221207070823.0190416e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055105852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mmcr.2015.12.0042doi7 aPMC47066222pmcid7 a268624762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagel, Stefan10aVentriculitis due to infection with Rhizopus arrhizus  ap. 18-20.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA 52-year-old heart–lung transplant patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset of neurologic symptoms.

Herein, an SPR sensor is combined with a novel smart material, namely, MoS₂ nanoflowers (MNFs), to demonstrate programmable adsorption/desorption of small bipolar molecules, i.e., amino acids. The MNFs overcoated on the plasmonic gold layer increase the sensitivity by 25% compared to an unmodified SPR sensor, because of the electric field enhancement at the gold surface. Furthermore, as the MNFs have rich edge sites and negatively charged surfaces, the MNF–SPR sensors exhibit not only much higher bipolar-molecule adsorption capability, but also efficient desorption of these molecules. It is demonstrated that the MNF-SPR sensors enable controllable detection of amino acids by adjusting solution pH according to their isoelectric points. In addition, the MNFs decorated on the plasmonic interface can be as nanostructure frameworks and modified with antibody, which allows for specific detection of proteins. This novel SPR sensor provides a new simple strategy for pre-screening of amino acid disorders in blood plasma and a universal high-sensitive platform for immunoassay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3ablood plasma 3adesorption 3aelectric field 3agold 3aimmunoassays 3ananoflowers 3apH 3asmart materials 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aSmart material 0aMoS2 nanoflower 0aBipolar molecule1 aChen, Yaofei1 aShi, Weicheng1 aHu, Shiqi1 aHuang, Qizhang1 aLiu, Gui-Shi1 aShi, Jifu1 aChen, Lei1 aAzeman, Nur Hidayah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5799-143X1 aAshrif A Bakar, Ahmad1 aLuo, Yunhan1 aChen, Zhe0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 198 p.113787-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1137873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245015000163300001600313520167500329592002802004650002502032650001902057650001802076650001502094650001002109650003802119650001902157650001102176650001202187650001802199650001902217650002502236650001402261650002102275650001402296650002002310650001802330700002202348700001902370700002202389700002002411700002002431700001602451700001602467700002302483773010302506856007702609852000902686655001202695IND60691126320221120074943.0200427e20100701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069112632DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.7.4.127442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhigna, Claudia10aPro-metastatic splicing of Ron proto-oncogene mRNA can be reversed: Therapeutic potential of bifunctional oligonucleotides and indole derivatives  ap. 495-503.  aAlternative splicing is a key molecular mechanism for increasing the complexity of the human transcriptome. Nearly all human genes are regulated by alternative splicing and the deregulation of this process has a causative role in various human diseases, including cancer. The discovery that alternatively spliced isoforms of several genes are expressed selectively in tumor cells opened the exciting possibility that pharmacological treatment of aberrant splicing could lead to new anti-cancer therapeutic approaches. An alternatively spliced isoform of a scatter factor receptor and proto-oncogene, Ron, accumulates during tumor progression of epithelial tissues and is able to confer an invasive phenotype to the expressing cells. This isoform, called ΔRon, originates from skipping of exon 11, and this specific splicing event is controlled by the expression level of the splicing factor and proto-oncogene SF2/ASF. Over-expression of SF2/ASF, which occurs frequently in various human tumors, induces the production of ΔRon and activates the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to increased cell motility. In this paper, we have used targeted oligonucleotide enhancers of splicing (TOES) to recruit positive splicing factors to Ron exon 11 and thereby stimulate its inclusion. As an alternative approach, we have used selected indole derivatives that target ASF/SF2 splicing activity. Both treatments correct aberrant ΔRon splicing, restoring the incorporation of Ron exon 11. Notably, indole derivatives are also able to affect the invasive phenotype of the cells. Thus, these treatments may have therapeutic applications for anti-cancer purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative splicing 3acancer therapy 3acell movement 3aepithelium 3aexons 3ahepatocyte growth factor receptor 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aindoles 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3aphenotype 3aproto-oncogenes 3atranscriptome1 aDe Toledo, Marion1 aBonomi, Serena1 aValacca, Cristina1 aGallo, Stefania1 aApicella, Maria1 aEperon, Ian1 aTazi, Jamal1 aBiamonti, Giuseppe0 tRNA biology.g2010 July 1, v. 7, no. 4 p.495-503dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.7.4.127443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245017600170520169400346592002802040650002102068650004402089650003202133650002302165650002102188650001302209650001502222650001602237650002402253650001902277650002002296650001502316650003702331650003802368650001302406650001902419650001802438650000702456650001302463650003902476650002702515650001602542650001602558650001602574653002702590653001202617653001602629653001802645653002102663700006302684700001702747700005602764773011202820856008302932852000903015655001203024IND60759124020221119140649.0220103e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075912402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1138372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, Akanksha10aElectroactive reduced graphene oxide for highly sensitive detection of secretory non-structural 1 protein: A potential diagnostic biomarker for Japanese encephalitis virus  aFluorine Doped Tin Oxide (FTO) electrode was fabricated with reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) for sensitive detection of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) non-structural 1 (NS1) protein.

Further characterisation of all binding events such as rGO synthesis, and its conjugation with NS1 Ab, and NS1 Ag were confirmed through Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman Spectroscopy, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV). The fabricated FTO electrode was optimised for various parameters such as pH, response time, temperature, concentration, and scan rate. The detection of JEV NS1 Ag was performed in buffer (LOD- 0.92 fM) as well in spiked serum (LOD- 1.3 fM) samples. The JEV NS1 Ab showed negligible cross-reactivity with other flaviviral NS1 Ag, provided a rapid response within 5 s, and remained stable up to 4 weeks. Furthermore, the fabricated immunosensor may be a potential candidate for further miniaturisation for accurate and early diagnosis of JEV in clinical samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aJapanese encephalitis virus 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aWestern blotting 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acomputer simulation 3across reaction 3aearly diagnosis 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorine 3agraphene oxide 3aimmunosensors 3apH 3aplasmids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atemperature 3atin dioxide 3avoltammetry 0aNon-structural antigen 0aCloning 0aDiagnostics 0aImmunosensing 0aElectrochemistry1 aKesarwani, Veerbhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5778-68311 aGupta, Rupal1 aGandhi, Sonu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0960-27800 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 198 p.113837-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1138373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245006800181300001600249520098200265592002801247650001301275650001001288650001401298650002201312650001401334650001801348650001001366650001201376651001101388700001801399700002001417700001901437700001801456773012601474856008101600852000901681655001201690IND60654952620221120032832.0190727e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065495262DNAL7 a264117472pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X150007842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, J.L.10aSurvey of nematodes associated with terrestrial slugs in Norway  ap. 583-587.  aA survey of nematodes associated with terrestrial slugs was conducted for the first time in Norway. A total of 611 terrestrial slugs were collected from 32 sample sites. Slugs were identified by means of morphological examination, dissection of genitalia and molecular analysis using mitochondrial DNA. Twelve slug species were identified, representing four different slug families. Internal nematodes were identiﬁed by means of morphological analysis and the sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene. Of the sample sites studied, 62.5% were found to be positive for nematode parasites, with 18.7% of all slugs discovered being infected. Five nematode species were identified in this study: Alloionema appendiculatum, Agfa flexilis, Angiostoma limacis, Angiostoma sp. and Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita. Of these species, only one nematode was previously undescribed (Angiostoma sp.). This is the first record of the presence of A. appendiculatum, A. flexilis and A. limacis in Norway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3agenes 3agenitalia 3amitochondrial DNA 3aparasites 3aribosomal RNA 3aslugs 3asurveys 3aNorway1 aIvanova, E.S.1 aHatteland, B.A.1 aBrurberg, M.B.1 aHaukeland, S.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2016 Sept., v. 90, no. 5 p.583-587dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X150007843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100001300182245011500195506007600310520076000386592002801146506003701174650000901211650003101220650001201251650002201263650002301285650001901308650001201327650002101339650001401360650000701374650001201381650002201393650001001415650001401425651001001439700002201449710002701471710007601498773006801574856007501642852000901717655001201726IND60530354220221207144016.0160721s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053035422DNAL7 a10.1155/2012/3753092doi7 aPMC33352882pmcid7 a225452052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Rong10aStudies on Acetone Powder and Purified Rhus Laccase Immobilized on Zirconium Chloride for Oxidation of Phenols  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRhus laccase was isolated and purified from acetone powder obtained from the exudates of Chinese lacquer trees (Rhus vernicifera) from the Jianshi region, Hubei province of China.

However, their application in optical imaging was severely restricted because of the lack of fluorescence in them. Here, we present a real-time in situ giant fluorescence enhancement, at least an order of magnitude higher in self-assembled SPIONs in comparison to a single SPION at the single-particle level under the applied magnetic field (MF). The single-particle tracking video provides the direct observation of the self-assembly and disassembly and the associated fluorescence change in SPIONs in the presence and absence of the applied MF. A theoretical model was applied to calculate the dipole–dipole interaction energy, drag coefficient, and quantified the dynamics of this aggregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrag coefficient 3aenergy 3aengineering 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3ananoparticles 3aphysical chemistry 3atheoretical models1 aVerma, Navneet C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8142-02901 aRandhawa, Jaspreet K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9441-69091 aNandi, Chayan K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4584-07380 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Oct. 25, v. 123, no. 45 p.27759-27764dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b072613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03825naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245012400208300001400332520193300346592002802279650002902307650002402336650001302360650001702373650001202390650002402402650002102426650002802447650001602475650002102491650001802512650002202530650001002552650001302562650001302575650002102588650001102609650000702620650001802627650002302645650002002668650001802688650001802706650002202724650001502746651001002761653001802771653001802789653002302807653001802830653001302848700005902861700002002920700001602940700001702956773011702973856008803090852000903178655001203187IND60628223520221119073144.0190516e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062822352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.3292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Fang.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2690-171510aPhysicochemical parameters and phytoplankton as indicators of the aquatic environment in karstic springs of South China  ap. 74-83.  aAs the concentrated discharge outlet of an aquifer or groundwater system, a karst spring is partly independent from the aquifer, due to its formation of a pool or lake after outcropping onto the surface. Understanding how to evaluate the unique and sensitive environment of the karst spring is essential for water resource protection. Five karst springs in South China were investigated by analyzing their hydrodynamic conditions, variations in physicochemical parameters, and phytoplankton community structures. Dominated by regional or local groundwater flow, these springs had different catchment area characteristics and hydrogeological conditions. The results showed that, although they had similar water quality, their physicochemical parameters needed to be distinguished and evaluated in different ways in order to determine the cause of the observed degradation in spring water quality. Ca2+, HCO3−, and specific electrical conductivity were the major parameters reflecting the impact of regional flow from the aquifer; pH, dissolved oxygen, and water temperature indicated the local environment in and around the springs; while nitrogen and CODMn both related to the aquifer and local environment, depending on seasonal variation and human activities. The comparison of long-term nitrate data revealed that environmental pressure has increased over time. Water deterioration of Lingshui Spring was attributed to the strong interaction of surface water and groundwater. High nutrient concentrations did not correspond with the highest phytoplankton abundance or the most species. The phytoplankton community structures in the karst springs varied from place to place, depending on the hydrogeological conditions and the surrounding environment. The water environment status, as reflected by the combination of water quality indices and biological indicators, could more comprehensively represent overall water health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic environment 3aaquifers 3abicarbonates 3acalcium 3acommunity structure 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrical conductivity 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrodynamics 3aindicator species 3alakes 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3aseasonal variation 3asprings (water) 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aWater quality 0aPhytoplankton 0aGroundwater health 0aKarst aquifer 0aLingshui1 aJiang, Guanghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2958-84961 aZhao, Hongliang1 aPolk, Jason1 aLiu, Shaohua0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 659 p.74-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.3293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245016200169520134500331592002801676650001001704650001201714650002001726650001501746650002101761650001701782650000901799650001201808650001601820653001301836653001701849653003001866653001201896653000801908653000801916653000801924653001601932700001801948700002501966700002801991700002702019773012502046856008302171852000902254655001202263IND60773167120221122061959.0220515e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077316712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1045642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Luiz R.G.12aA simple and reliable electroanalytical method employing a disposable commercial electrode for simultaneous determination of lead(II) and mercury(II) in beer  aTrace metals such as lead and mercury can be present in beverages by contamination during production and storage processes, or by the use of hops and brewing grains that may be contaminated with trace metals. Since these metals are harmful to human health, their presence is strictly controlled by regulatory agencies. In this aspect, the present work presents the development of a new procedure for direct determination of lead(II) and mercury(II) in beer samples using square wave voltammetry (SWV) and a pre-concentration step at a miniaturized boron-doped diamond screen-printed electrode modified with bismuth-film (SPE-BDD/BiF). The bismuth concentration was optimized (160 µg L⁻¹) and the deposition step and SWV operational parameters were optimized using multivariate experiments. The proposed method presented a linear range from 31.3 to 2000 µg L⁻¹, limit of quantification of 22 and 25 µg L⁻¹, and limit of detection of 6.7 and 7.5 µg L⁻¹, for lead(II) and mercury(II), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method showed good selectivity for determining the metals of interest, with recovery values ranging from 94% to 106%, indicating that there are no significant matrix effects. Such results reinforce the possibility of applying the proposed method in situ in a practical, reliable, and quick way.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeers 3abismuth 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3afood composition 3ahuman health 3alead 3amercury 3avoltammetry 0aBeverage 0aTrace metals 0aElectrochemical detection 0aSPE-BDD 0aBiF 0aSWV 0aSWV 0aSPE-BDD/BiF1 aMutz, Yhan S.1 aStefano, Jéssica S.1 aConte-Junior, Carlos A.1 aFerreira, Rafael de Q.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 July, v. 110 p.104564-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1045643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245016500207300001600372506007600388520235400464592002802818506003702846650002202883650001302905650001602918650001602934650001002950650002402960650001302984700002702997700001903024700001703043700002503060700002103085700002203106773012903128856008203257852000903339655001203348IND60089639320221207073752.0141102e20120921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008963932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.0732doi7 aPMC34593262pmcid7 a229354202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRestivo, Mark10aActivation of εPKC reduces reperfusion arrhythmias and improves recovery from ischemia: Optical mapping of activation patterns in the isolated guinea-pig heart  ap. 237-241.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPervious biochemical and hemodynamic studies have highlighted the important role of εPKC in cardioprotection during ischemic preconditioning. However, little is known about the electrophysiological consequences of εPKC modulation in ischemic hearts. Membrane permeable peptide εPKC selective activator and inhibitor were used to investigate the role of εPKC modulation in reperfusion arrhythmias. Methods: Protein transduction domain from HIV-TAT was used as a carrier for peptide delivery into intact Langendorff perfused guinea pig hearts. Action potentials were imaged and mapped (124 sites) using optical techniques and surface ECG was continuously recorded. Hearts were exposed to 30min stabilization period, 15min of no-flow ischemia, followed by 20min reperfusion. Peptides (0.5μM) were infused as follows: (a) control (vehicle-TAT peptide; TAT-scrambled ψεRACK peptide); (b) εPKC agonist (TAT-ψεRACK); (c) εPKC antagonist (TAT-εV1). Results: Hearts treated with εPKC agonist ψεRACK had reduced incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT, 64%) and fibrillation (VF, 50%) compared to control (VT, 80%, P<0.05) and (VF, 70%, P<0.05). However, the highest incidence of VT (100%, P<0.05) and VF (80%) occurred in hearts treated with εPKC antagonist peptide εV1 compared to control and to εPKC agonist ψεRACK. Interestingly, at 20min reperfusion, 100% of hearts treated with εPKC agonist ψεRACK exhibited complete recovery of action potentials compared to 40% (P<0.05) of hearts treated with εPKC antagonist peptide, εV1 and 65% (P<0.5) of hearts in control. At 20min reperfusion, maps of action potential duration from εPKC agonist ψεRACK showed minimal dispersion (48.2±9ms) compared to exacerbated dispersion (115.4±42ms, P<0.05) in εPKC antagonist and control (67±20ms, P<0.05). VT/VF and dispersion from hearts treated with scrambled agonist or antagonist peptides were similar to control. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that εPKC activation by ψεRACK peptide protects intact hearts from reperfusion arrhythmias and affords better recovery. On the other hand, inhibition of εPKC increased the incidence of arrhythmias and worsened recovery compared to controls. The results carry significant therapeutic implications for the treatment of acute ischemic heart disease by preconditioning-mimicking agents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaction potentials 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3aguinea pigs 3aheart 3amyocardial ischemia 3apeptides1 aKozhevnikov, Dmitry O.1 aQu, Yongxia S.1 aYue, Yuankun1 aMochly-Rosen, Daria,1 aEl-Sherif, Nabil1 aBoutjdir, Mohamed0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Sept. 21, v. 426, no. 2 p.237-241dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245009900178520128700277592002801564650001601592650001501608650001601623650002101639650002001660650001901680650002101699650001901720650001801739650001801757650002101775650001801796653002901814653003001843653001201873653001201885700005701897700001701954700002301971773011201994856008302106852000902189655001202198IND60759124220221119140654.0220110e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075912422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1138472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOndevilla, Neil Adrian P.13aAn AC electrokinetics-based electrochemical aptasensor for the rapid detection of microRNA-155  aTraditional immunosensors are often limited by low sensitivity and long detection times, for they usually depend on passive diffusion-dominated transport of target analytes for the binding reaction with a bio-recognition element such as enzymes, antibodies, and aptamers. Numerous studies rely on electric field manipulation by using alternating current (AC) electrokinetics to enhance the hybridization rate and reduce the hybridization time for faster and more efficient detection. This study demonstrated a rapid electrochemical aptasensor integrated with an AC electroosmotic (ACEO) flow phenomenon for the enhanced target hybridization of microRNA-155 (miR-155). Optimization of the electrokinetic conditions for target collection resulted in a saturation point after 75 s miR-155 was detected within the range of 1 aM–10 pM with a detection limit of 1 aM, which is 100 times lower and about 50 times faster compared with the conventional diffusion-dependent detection done for 1 h. The detection was also done in spiked serum samples, and a concentration range within the required detection range was obtained. The highly sensitive and specific results allow for the rapid and real-time sensing of target biomarkers, which can be used for the early detection of infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaptasensors 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectroosmosis 3ahybridization 3aimmunosensors 3aoligonucleotides 3arapid methods 0aAC electroosmosis (ACEO) 0aElectrochemical biosensor 0aAptamer 0amiR-1551 aWong, Tak-Wah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0131-73391 aLee, Nan-Yao1 aChang, Hsien-Chang0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 199 p.113847-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1138473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001600189245006600205300001400271506007600285520056200361592002800923506003700951650001800988650002001006650001701026650000901043650001001052650001601062650001801078650001301096650002201109650001301131650001301144653001101157653001801168653003401186653002401220700001701244700002101261700001601282700001401298700002001312700001801332773010801350856008301458852000901541655001201550IND60551058820221207070835.0190416e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055105882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mmcr.2016.01.0022doi7 aPMC47696062pmcid7 a269373382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Emily10aDisseminated Chrysosporium infection in a German shepherd dog  ap. 29-33.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDisseminated Chrysosporium spp. infection was diagnosed in a German shepherd dog based on a positive fungal culture and cytological findings of intralesional fungi associated with granulomatous splenitis and neutrophilic lymphadenitis.

Members of this group of species differ from each other in the morphology of their hard parts, which can be misleading and subject to differing interpretation among scientists. Therefore, the main objective of present study was to identify Mizelleus worms by morphological methods and molecular analysis on the basis of 18S ribosomal DNA to clarify their phylogenetic status. In this study, specimens were isolated from the gill filaments of Wallago attu (Siluriformes) and studied morphologically. In accordance with morphological characters, the specimens were found to be Mizelleus indicus and Mizelleus longicirrus. Partial sequences of nuclear 18S rDNA of these two species were amplified. The results confirm the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic validation of M. indicus and M. longicirrus in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylogyridae 3aWallago attu 3aanimal morphology 3afreshwater 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3arivers 3asharks 3aIndia1 aChaudhary, A.1 aSingh, H.S.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2016 Sept., v. 90, no. 5 p.596-606dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X150008143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100006500182245011200247506007600359520103800435592002801473506003701501650002701538650001901565650001901584650002001603650001001623650002801633650002101661650002701682650001901709650003901728700006601767700006601833700006401899700006101963700002502024710002702049710005102076773006802127856007502195852000902270655001202279IND60530354420221207144018.0160721s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053035442DNAL7 a10.1155/2014/1598092doi7 aPMC41901212pmcid7 a253286842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanagiotidou, Elpiniki1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1375-297912aA Simple Route for Purifying Extracellular Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)-depolymerase from Penicillium pinophilum  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis work proposes the purification of an active and efficient enzyme, extracellular poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB)-depolymerase, suitable for industrial applications. This is achieved by the application of an easy, fast, and cheap route, skipping the chromatography step. Chromatography with one or two columns is a common step in the purification procedure, which however renders the isolation of the enzyme a time consuming and an expensive process. A strain of the fungus Penicillium pinophilum (ATCC 9644) is used for the isolation of extracellular PHB-depolymerase. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme is about 35 kDa and is estimated by gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 12% polyacrylamide). The enzymatic activity of the isolated enzyme is determined to be 3.56-fold similar to that found by other researchers that have used chromatography for the isolation. The as-isolated enzyme disintegrates the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) films successfully, as it is demonstrated by the biodegradation test results provided here.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTalaromyces pinophilus 3abiodegradation 3achromatography 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3aindustrial applications 3amolecular weight 3apoly-3-hydroxybutyrate 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1 aKonidaris, Constantinos1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4462-50721 aBaklavaridis, Apostolos1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5642-18491 aZuburtikudis, Ioannis1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5969-84881 aAchilias, Dimitris1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2872-84261 aMitlianga, Paraskevi2 aEuropean UnioneFunder2 aNational Strategic Reference FrameworkeFunder0 tEnzyme research.g2014, v. 2014wJournal:23313x2090-04147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/1598093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245019200158300002000350520179700370592002802167650002002195650001402215650001002229650002302239650001602262650001002278650000902288650001302297650001902310650001402329650001802343650002302361650001702384650001102401650001502412650001302427653003302440653003802473653003102511653007002542700001302612700001902625700001402644700001302658700001502671700001702686700001802703700001302721700001802734700005702752773014302809856007802952852000903030655001203039IND60751120920221120154209.0210922e20210908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075112092DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c119472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xian10aVirus-Inspired Gold Nanorod-Mesoporous Silica Core–Shell Nanoparticles Integrated with tTF-EG3287 for Synergetic Tumor Photothermal Therapy and Selective Therapy for Vascular Thrombosis  ap. 44013-44027.  aSynergetic therapy includes the combination of two or more conventional therapeutic approaches and can be used for tumor treatment by combining the advantages and avoiding the drawbacks of each type of treatment. In the present study, truncated tissue factor (tTF)-EG3287 fusion protein-encapsulated gold nanorod (GNR)-virus-inspired mesoporous silica core–shell nanoparticles (vinyl hybrid silica nanoparticles; VSNP) (GNR@VSNP-tTF-EG3287) were synthesized to achieve synergetic therapy by utilizing selective vascular thrombosis therapy (SVTT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). By integrating the targeted coagulation activity of tTF-EG3287 and the high tumor ablation effect of GNR@VSNP, local hyperthermia could induce a high percentage of apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells by using near-infrared light. This provided additional phospholipid sites for tTF-EG3287 and enhanced its procoagulant activity in vitro. In addition, the nanoparticles, which had unique topological viral structures, exhibited superior cellular uptake properties leading to significant antitumor efficacy. The in vivo antitumor results further demonstrated an interaction between SVTT and PTT, whereas the synergetic therapy (SVTT and PTT) achieved an enhanced effect, which was superior to the respective treatment efficacy of each modality or the additive effect of their individual efficacies. In summary, the synthesized GNR@VSNP-tTF-EG3287 exerted synergetic effects and enhanced the antitumor efficiency by avoiding multiple injections and suboptimal administration. These effects simultaneously affected both tumor blood supply and cancer cell proliferation. The data suggested that the integration of SVTT induced by tTF-EG3287 and PTT could provide potential strategies for synergetic tumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3aapoptosis 3ablood 3acell proliferation 3acoagulation 3afever 3agold 3ananorods 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphospholipids 3aphotothermotherapy 3aporous media 3asilica 3athrombosis 3atopology 0avirus-inspired nanoparticles 0atargeting procoagulant tTF-EG3287 0avascular endothelial cells 0asynergetic photothermal and selective vascular thrombosis therapy1 aXie, Jun1 aZhou, Zonglang1 aMa, Sihan1 aWang, Li1 aLi, Mengqi1 aLiu, Jiajing1 aWang, Peiyuan1 aLi, Yang1 aLuo, Fanghong1 aYan, Jianghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4504-89320 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Sept. 08, v. 13, no. 37 p.44013-44027dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c119473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009100158300002000249520180300269592002802072650001902100650001402119650002102133650002102154650001002175650002002185650000902205650001502214650001102229650001002240700002102250700002602271700002202297700002102319700002102340773012702361856007502488852000902563655001202572IND60534449020221119060754.0160802e20121120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053444902DNAL7 a10.1021/es302371f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, M. Yusuf10aGreenhouse Gas and Criteria Emission Benefits through Reduction of Vessel Speed at Sea  ap. 12600-12607.  aReducing emissions from ocean-going vessels (OGVs) as they sail near populated areas is a widely recognized goal, and Vessel Speed Reduction (VSR) is one of several strategies that is being adopted by regulators and port authorities. The goal of this research was to measure the emission benefits associated with greenhouse gas and criteria pollutants by operating OGVs at reduced speed. Emissions were measured from one Panamax and one post-Panamax class container vessels as their vessel speed was reduced from cruise to 15 knots or below. VSR to 12 knots yielded carbon dioxide (CO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) emissions reductions (in kg/nautical mile (kg/nmi)) of approximately 61% and 56%, respectively, as compared to vessel cruise speed. The mass emission rate (kg/nmi) of PM₂.₅ was reduced by 69% with VSR to 12 knots alone and by ∼97% when coupled with the use of the marine gas oil (MGO) with 0.00065% sulfur content. Emissions data from vessels while operating at sea are scarce and measurements from this research demonstrated that tidal current is a significant parameter affecting emission factors (EFs) at lower engine loads. Emissions factors at ≤20% loads calculated by methodology adopted by regulatory agencies were found to underestimate PM₂.₅ and NOₓ by 72% and 51%, respectively, when compared to EFs measured in this study. Total pollutant emitted (TPE) in the emission control area (ECA) was calculated, and emission benefits were estimated as the VSR zone increased from 24 to 200 nmi. TPECO₂ and TPEPM₂.₅ estimated for large container vessels showed benefits for CO₂ (2–26%) and PM₂.₅ (4–57%) on reducing speeds from 15 to 12 knots, whereas TPECO₂ and TPEPM₂.₅ for small and medium container vessels were similar at 15 and 12 knots.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3agreenhouse gases 3aknots 3anitrogen oxides 3aoils 3apollutants 3asulfur 3atides1 aAgrawal, Harshit1 aRanganathan, Sindhuja1 aWelch, William

We report a new approach to alkene arylation using diaryliodonium salts and Cu catalysis. Using a range of simple alkenes, we have shown that the product outcomes differ significantly from those commonly obtained by the Heck reaction. We have used these insights to develop a number of new tandem and cascade reactions that transform readily available alkenes into complex arylated products that may have broad applications in chemical synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3afeedstocks 3asalts1 aMcMurray, Lindsay1 aRitter, Stefanie1 aDuong, Hung A.1 aGaunt, Matthew J.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 July 04, v. 134, no. 26 p.10773-10776dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja30398073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04093naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015400158300001800312500001100330520249100341592002802832650002302860650002502883650002602908650001902934650003602953650001902989650002103008650001503029650001603044650001103060650001903071650001503090650001603105650002603121650002503147650001403172650001703186650001803203650002203221650001503243650001003258650001903268650001203287650001203299650001203311700002303323773012303346856007303469852000903542655001203551IND60589981320221119020400.0180312e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058998132DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.139232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuseela, Vidya10aDecoupling the direct and indirect effects of climate on plant litter decomposition: Accounting for stress‐induced modifications in plant chemistry  ap. 1428-1451.  aREVIEW  aDecomposition of plant litter is a fundamental ecosystem process that can act as a feedback to climate change by simultaneously influencing both the productivity of ecosystems and the flux of carbon dioxide from the soil. The influence of climate on decomposition from a postsenescence perspective is relatively well known; in particular, climate is known to regulate the rate of litter decomposition via its direct influence on the reaction kinetics and microbial physiology on processes downstream of tissue senescence. Climate can alter plant metabolism during the formative stage of tissues and could shape the final chemical composition of plant litter that is available for decomposition, and thus indirectly influence decomposition; however, these indirect effects are relatively poorly understood. Climatic stress disrupts cellular homeostasis in plants and results in the reprogramming of primary and secondary metabolic pathways, which leads to changes in the quantity, composition, and organization of small molecules and recalcitrant heteropolymers, including lignins, tannins, suberins, and cuticle within the plant tissue matrix. Furthermore, by regulating metabolism during tissue senescence, climate influences the resorption of nutrients from senescing tissues. Thus, the final chemical composition of plant litter that forms the substrate of decomposition is a combined product of presenescence physiological processes through the production and resorption of metabolites. The changes in quantity, composition, and localization of the molecular construct of the litter could enhance or hinder tissue decomposition and soil nutrient cycling by altering the recalcitrance of the lignocellulose matrix, the composition of microbial communities, and the activity of microbial exo‐enzymes via various complexation reactions. Also, the climate‐induced changes in the molecular composition of litter could differentially influence litter decomposition and soil nutrient cycling. Compared with temperate ecosystems, the indirect effects of climate on litter decomposition in the tropics are not well understood, which underscores the need to conduct additional studies in tropical biomes. We also emphasize the need to focus on how climatic stress affects the root chemistry as roots contribute significantly to biogeochemical cycling, and on utilizing more robust analytical approaches to capture the molecular composition of tissue matrix that fuel microbial metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abiochemical pathways 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical constituents of plants 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3ahomeostasis 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial physiology 3anutrients 3aplant litter 3aplant tissues 3areaction kinetics 3aresorption 3aroots 3asoil nutrients 3asuberin 3atannins 3atropics1 aTharayil, Nishanth0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.1428-1451dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.139233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245015900182300001600341520115300357592002801510650002901538650002701567650002901594650001101623650000901634650002301643650001001666650002101676650000901697650001001706650003301716650001001749650001801759650002201777650001901799650001401818650001301832650001701845651001201862700001501874700001301889700001501902700001401917700001301931773012501944856008102069852000902150655001202159IND60654953020221121055416.0190727e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065495302DNAL7 a263885602pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X150008382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoanh, P.N.10aMolecular identification of the trematode Paragonimus in faecal samples from the wild cat Prionailurus bengalensis in the Da Krong Nature Reserve, Vietnam  ap. 658-662.  aConventional identification of Paragonimus species and their natural definitive hosts is based on the morphological features of adult parasites isolated from the lungs of wild mammalian hosts. However, wild animals are protected by strict regulations and sampling is not always possible. Recently, molecular techniques have been developed to identify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of Paragonimus eggs in faeces/sputum of human patients. Also, mammalian hosts can be identified using the D-loop sequence of mitochondrial DNA in faecal samples. In this study, we used molecular techniques on faeces from wild animals collected in Da Krong Nature Reserve, Quang Tri province, central Vietnam, where Paragonimus metacercariae are highly prevalent in mountain crabs, to identify Paragonimus species and their natural definitive hosts. The results indicated that wild cats, Prionailurus bengalensis, were infected with at least three different Paragonimus species, P. westermani, P. skrjabini and P. heterotremus. Because all of these species can infect humans in Asian countries, human paragonimiasis should be considered in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParagonimus heterotremus 3aParagonimus westermani 3aPrionailurus bengalensis 3aadults 3acats 3aconservation areas 3acrabs 3adefinitive hosts 3aeggs 3afeces 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alungs 3ametacercariae 3amitochondrial DNA 3aparagonimiasis 3aparasites 3apatients 3awild animals 3aVietnam1 aHien, H.V.1 aTu, L.A.1 aNonaka, N.1 aHorii, Y.1 aNawa, Y.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2016 Nov., v. 90, no. 6 p.658-662dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X150008383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012600161300002000287520140300307592002801710650001801738650001301756650001601769650001401785650001301799650001101812650001901823650003101842650002501873650002901898650002101927650001201948650001401960651001801974700001801992700001902010700002102029773012702050856007502177852000902252655001202261IND60534449120221119060829.0160802e20121120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053444912DNAL7 a10.1021/es302420z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, Jennifer B.10aImpact of Recycling on Cradle-to-Gate Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Automotive Lithium-Ion Batteries  ap. 12704-12710.  aThis paper addresses the environmental burdens (energy consumption and air emissions, including greenhouse gases, GHGs) of the material production, assembly, and recycling of automotive lithium-ion batteries in hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and battery electric vehicles (BEV) that use LiMn₂O₄ cathode material. In this analysis, we calculated the energy consumed and air emissions generated when recovering LiMn₂O₄, aluminum, and copper in three recycling processes (hydrometallurgical, intermediate physical, and direct physical recycling) and examined the effect(s) of closed-loop recycling on environmental impacts of battery production. We aimed to develop a U.S.-specific analysis of lithium-ion battery production and in particular sought to resolve literature discrepancies concerning energy consumed during battery assembly. Our analysis takes a process-level (versus a top-down) approach. For a battery used in a BEV, we estimated cradle-to-gate energy and GHG emissions of 75 MJ/kg battery and 5.1 kg CO₂e/kg battery, respectively. Battery assembly consumes only 6% of this total energy. These results are significantly less than reported in studies that take a top-down approach. We further estimate that direct physical recycling of LiMn₂O₄, aluminum, and copper in a closed-loop scenario can reduce energy consumption during material production by up to 48%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aaluminum 3aautomobiles 3abatteries 3acathodes 3acopper 3acradle-to-gate 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3alithium 3arecycling 3aUnited States1 aGaines, Linda1 aSullivan, John1 aWang, Michael Q.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 Nov. 20, v. 46, no. 22 p.12704-12710dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes302420z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002700189245011200216300001600328506007600344520220300420592002802623506003702651650000802688650001702696650001302713650002702726650002502753650001502778650002102793650001002814650001602824650000902840650002602849650001602875650002102891650001302912650001702925650001802942650001702960650000902977700001502986700001903001700002203020700002303042700001803065773012903083856008203212852000903294655001203303IND60089639620221207073738.0141102e20120921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008963962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.0762doi7 aPMC34953292pmcid7 a229354142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThimmulappa, Rajesh K.10aOxidized phospholipids impair pulmonary antibacterial defenses: Evidence in mice exposed to cigarette smoke  ap. 253-259.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPatients with COPD are associated with poor pulmonary anti-bacterial innate defenses, which increase the risk for frequent acute exacerbations caused by bacterial infection. Despite elevated numbers of phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils), airways of patients with COPD show stable bacterial colonization. A defect in the phagocytic ability of alveolar macrophages (AMs) is one of the primary reasons for failure to clear the invading bacteria in airways of smokers and COPD patients and also in mice exposed to cigarette smoke (CS). Oxidative stress, as a result of CS exposure is implicated; however, the factors or mediators that inhibit phagocytic activity of AMs in lungs of smokers remain unclear. In the current study, we provide evidence that accumulation of oxidized phospholipids (Ox-PLs) mediate inhibition of phagocytic function of AMs in CS-exposed mice. Mice exposed to 6months of CS showed impaired bacterial phagocytosis and clearance by AMs and elevated levels of Ox-PLs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), compared to mice exposed to room air. Intratracheal instillation of oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OX-PAPC) inhibited phagocytic activity of AMs and impaired pulmonary bacterial clearance in mice. In vitro studies demonstrated that exposure of J774 macrophages to OX-PAPC inhibited bacterial phagocytosis and clearance. However, pre-treatment of OX-PAPC with the monoclonal antibody EO6, which specifically binds to oxidized phospholipid but not native phospholipid, abolished OX-PAPC induced inhibition of bacterial phagocytosis and clearance. Incubation of BALF retrieved from CS-exposed mice impaired bacterial phagocytosis by J774 macrophages, which was abolished by pre-treatment of BALF with the EO6 antibody. In conclusion, our study shows that Ox-PLs generated following chronic CS exposure could play a crucial role in inhibiting phagocytic function of AMs and thus impair pulmonary anti-bacterial innate defenses in CS-exposed mice. Therapeutic approaches that augment pulmonary antioxidant defenses could be beneficial in reducing oxidative stress-driven impairment of phagocytosis by AMs in smokers and COPD patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3abacterial colonization 3abacterial infections 3acigarettes 3ain vitro studies 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneutrophils 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aphagocytosis 3aphospholipids 3apretreatment 3arisk1 aGang, Xing1 aKim, Jung-Hyun1 aSussan, Thomas E.1 aWitztum, Joseph L.1 aBiswal, Shyam0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Sept. 21, v. 426, no. 2 p.253-259dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011200170520126600282592002801548650001901576650002301595650001701618650001701635650001001652650001701662650002101679650003101700650004301731650001701774650001401791650000901805650002101814650001301835650000901848650001101857650001101868651000901879653001701888653000901905653002701914653002701941653001801968653002101986700001902007700002402026700002102050700002602071700002002097700001602117773012502133856008302258852000902341655001202350IND60773167520221122053345.0220515e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077316752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1045682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasninia, Dariush10aHuman health risk assessment of aflatoxin M1 in raw and pasteurized milk from the Kermanshah province, Iran  aThe principal purpose of this study was to investigate the amount and human health risk assessment by Monte Carlo simulation for aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk in Kermanshah province, Iran. For this purpose, a total of 108 composite samples were analyzed for AFM1 levels using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). Based on AFM1 in milk, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in animal feed, exposure, and human health risk were evaluated. The results showed that the total mean of AFM1 in raw milk in summer and winter was 49 ± 2 and 14 ± 1 ng/L, respectively, while in pasteurized milk was 6 ± 1 and 10 ± 1 ng/L, respectively, and in general, the mean amount of AFM1 in both raw and pasteurized milk is significantly different between summer and winter. Based on the results, it was found that 16.7% of all samples had AFM1 higher than the European Union (EU) limit (50 ng/L). Accordingly, the AFM1 level of raw milk in summer had health risks for all age groups of men and women. In conclusion, in Kermanshah province, AFM1 concentrations in milk produced by livestock should be reduced, especially during the summer seasons; basic procedures should be implemented to reduce AFB1 concentrations in lactating animals' foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aMonte Carlo method 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin M1 3afeeds 3afluorescence 3afood composition 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3alivestock 3amilk 3apasteurized milk 3araw milk 3arisk 3asummer 3awinter 3aIran 0aAflatoxin M1 0aMilk 0aHealth Risk Assessment 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aFood Analysis 0aFood Composition1 aSalimi, Ghobad1 aBahrami, Gholamreza1 aSharafi, Kiomars1 aOmer, Abdullah Khalid1 aRezaie, Mansour1 aKiani, Amir0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2022 July, v. 110 p.104568-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2022.1045683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245012300212300001400335506007600349520042500425592002800850506003700878650002100915650001200936650001900948650001000967650001500977650001700992650001301009650001001022650001501032650001301047650001301060650001701073650001401090653001501104653001201119653003501131653001501166653002901181700001701210700002201227700002301249700002301272700001901295700002301314700002101337700002301358773010801381856008301489852000901572655001201581IND60551059120221207070833.0190416e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055105912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mmcr.2016.08.0022doi7 aPMC50182022pmcid7 a276425622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMpakosi, Alexandra10aSuccessful therapy of Candida pulcherrima fungemia in a premature newborn with liposomal amphotericin B and micafungin  ap. 24-27.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNew Candida species may cause bloodstream infections challenging current therapeutic approaches because of unpredictable susceptibility and virulence.

Electron localization function (ELF) characterizes DFAY as a carbenoid species participating in cb-type 32CA reactions. The supernucleophilic character of DFAY and the strong electrophilic character of the ynal cause this polar 32CA reaction to have an unappreciable barrier; the reaction, which is highly exothermic, presents total chemo- and regioselectivity. ELF topological analysis of the bonding changes along the reaction establishes its non-concerted two-stage one-step mechanism, in which the nucleophilic attack of the carbenoid carbon of DFAY on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ynal characterizes the cb-type reactivity of this three-atom component (TAC). The presence of two fluorines at DFAY modifies the pseudodiradical structure and reactivity of the simplest azomethine ylide to that of a carbenoid TAC participating in cb-type 32CA reactions toward electrophilic ethylenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3acarbon 3acycloaddition reactions 3aheat production 3aorganic chemistry 3aregioselectivity 3atopology1 aKula, Karolina1 aRíos-Gutiérrez, Mar1 aJasiński, Radomir0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 86, no. 18 p.12644-12653dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c011263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002400175245003500199300001400234520147500248592002801723650001001751650001501761650000901776650001501785650002001800650001901820650001701839773014901856856006802005856006602073990002302139852000902162655001202171IND60643284320221119111620.0190510e20130602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064328432DNAL7 a10.3791/26102doi7 aPMC37256662pmcid7 a237706432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeacon, Robert M.J.10aMeasuring the strength of mice  ap. e2610.  aKondziela7 devised the inverted screen test and published it in 1964. It is a test of muscle strength using all four limbs. Most normal mice easily score maximum on this task; it is a quick but insensitive gross screen, and the weights test described in this article will provide a finer measure of muscular strength. There are also several strain gauge-based pieces of apparatus available commercially that will provide more graded data than the inverted screen test, but their cost may put them beyond the reach of many laboratories which do not specialize in strength testing. Hence in 2000 a cheap and simple apparatus was devised by the author. It consists of a series of chain links of increasing length, attached to a "fur collector" a ball of fine wire mesh sold for preventing limescale build up in hard water areas. An accidental observation revealed that mice could grip these very tightly, so they proved ideal as a grip point for a weight-lifting apparatus. A common fault with commercial strength meters is that the bar or other grip feature is not thin enough for mice to exert a maximum grip. As a general rule, the thinner the wire or bar, the better a mouse can grip with its small claws. This is a pure test of strength, although as for any test motivational factors could potentially play a role. The use of scale collectors, however, seems to minimize motivational problems as the motivation appears to be very high for most normal young adult mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclaws 3acollectors 3amice 3amotivation 3amuscle strength 3awater hardness 3ayoung adults0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2013 June 02, , no. 76 p.e2610-e2610dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/26103Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2610/measuring-the-strength-of-mice  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245005400166300001600220520138100236592002801617650002701645650001801672650001501690650001701705650002101722650001401743650001701757650001701774650001401791650001501805700001901820773010401839856007701943852000902020655001202029IND60691126920221120074932.0200427e20100901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069112692DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.7.5.126862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaierlein, Claudia10aTranslation termination: New factors and insights  ap. 548-550.  aIn eukaryotes, translation termination requires two eukaryotic release factors, eRF1 and eRF3. eRF1 is required for recognition of the stop codon and eRF3 supports the polypeptide chain release in a GTP dependent manner. Recently, several new players in translation termination have been identified. The DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5 has been shown to support eRF1 in stop codon recognition, possibly by proper placement of the release factor on the termination codon. Upon its dissociation from eRF1, Dbp5 allows the entry of the second termination factor eRF3 into the complex. Further, the Dbp5 interacting protein Gle1 and its co-factor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP₆) have been shown to participate in the termination process. Dbp5 and Gle1 are well known for their function in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Most interestingly, also the ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein Rli1, which requires the mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis machineries for its assembly, has recently been shown to function in translation termination and recycling of the ribosomes. Rli1 physically and genetically interacts with both, eRF1 and eRF3. Together, all of these novel termination factors modulate in association with the release factors more accurate stop codon recognition and these findings broaden our knowledge about the final steps in translation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDEAD-box RNA helicases 3aRNA transport 3abiogenesis 3adissociation 3aeukaryotic cells 3ainositols 3amitochondria 3apolypeptides 3aribosomes 3astop codon1 aKrebber, Heike0 tRNA biology.g2010 Sept. 1, v. 7, no. 5 p.548-550dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.7.5.126863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01925naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010800160300002000268520090300288592002801191650000801219650002101227650001501248650000901263650001401272650001801286650002101304650001401325650001101339700001901350773013401369856007501503852000901578655001201587IND60538585720221123021151.0160815e20120704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053858572DNAL7 a10.1021/ja304074f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Seong

The previously developed technique of electrochemical current amplification for detection of single nanoparticle (NP) collisions at an ultramicroelectrode (UME) has been employed to determine DNA. The Pt NP/Au UME/hydrazine oxidation reaction was employed, and individual NP collision events were monitored. The Pt NP was modified with a 20-base oligonucleotide with a C6 spacer thiol (detection probe), and the Au UME was modified with a 16-base oligonucleotide with a C6 spacer thiol (capture probe). The presence of a target oligonucleotide (31 base) that hybridized with both capture and detection probes brought a Pt NP on the electrode surface, where the resulting electrochemical oxidation of hydrazine resulted in a current response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahydrazine 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxidation 3athiols1 aBard, Allen J.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 July 04, v. 134, no. 26 p.10777-10779dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja304074f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010300164300002000267520140400287592002801691650001101719650002201730650002201752650002301774650002201797650001901819700001801838700006101856700002101917700002101938700005701959700005802016773013802074856008002212852000902292655001202301IND60676331620200108000000.0191114e20191022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067633162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b075112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWirsing, Sara10aExcited-State Dynamics in Perylene-Based Organic Semiconductor Thin Films: Theory Meets Experiment  ap. 27561-27572.  aPerylene-based organic semiconductors are widely used in organic electronic devices. Here, we studied the ultrafast excited-state dynamics in diindenoperylene (DIP) and dicyanoperylene-bis(dicarboximide) (PDIR-CN₂) thin films, respectively, after optical excitation using femtosecond (fs) time-resolved second harmonic generation in combination with large scale quantum chemical calculations. In DIP, the initial optical excitation leads to the formation of delocalized excitons, which localize on dimers on a ultrafast time scale of <50–150 fs depending on the excitation energy. In contrast, in PDIR-CN₂, the optical excitation directly generates localized excitons on monomers or dimers. In both DIP and PDIR-CN₂, localized excitons decay within hundreds of fs into Frenkel-like trap sites. The relaxation to the ground state occurs in DIP on a time scale of 600 ± 110 ps. In PDIR-CN₂, this relaxation time is 1 order of magnitude faster (62 ± 1.8 ps). The differences in the exciton formation and decay dynamics in DIP and PDIR-CN₂ are attributed to differences in the aggregation as well as to the respective structural and energetic disorder within the materials. Our study provides important insights into the exciton formation and decay dynamics in perylene-based organic compounds, which is essential for the understanding of the photophysics of these molecules in thin films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3aorganic compounds 3aphysical chemistry 3aquantum mechanics 3asemiconductors1 aHänsel, Marc1 aBelova, Valentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8142-20901 aSchreiber, Frank1 aBroch, Katharina1 aEngels, Bernd1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3057-389X1 aTegeder, Petra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5071-93850 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Oct. 22, v. 123, no. 45 p.27561-27572dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b075113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245008600163300001800249500002000267520168000287592002801967650002301995650001402018650001402032650002302046650000902069650001302078650001302091650002202104650001902126650001102145650001502156650001102171650000902182650001702191700002402208700001902232700002202251773012302273856007302396852000902469655001202478IND60589981620221119023109.0180312e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058998162DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.139962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPutland, Rosalyn L.10aVessel noise cuts down communication space for vocalizing fish and marine mammals  ap. 1708-1721.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnthropogenic noise across the world's oceans threatens the ability of vocalizing marine species to communicate. Some species vocalize at key life stages or whilst foraging, and disruption to the acoustic habitat at these times could lead to adverse consequences at the population level. To investigate the risk of these impacts, we investigated the effect of vessel noise on the communication space of the Bryde's whale Balaenoptera edeni, an endangered species which vocalizes at low frequencies, and bigeye Pempheris adspersa, a nocturnal fish species which uses contact calls to maintain group cohesion while foraging. By combining long‐term acoustic monitoring data with AIS vessel‐tracking data and acoustic propagation modelling, the impact of vessel noise on their communication space was determined. Routine vessel passages cut down communication space by up to 61.5% for bigeyes and 87.4% for Bryde's whales. This influence of vessel noise on communication space exceeded natural variability for between 3.9 and 18.9% of the monitoring period. Additionally, during the closest point of approach of a large commercial vessel, <10 km from the listening station, the communication space of both species was reduced by a maximum of 99% compared to the ambient soundscape. These results suggest that vessel noise reduces communication space beyond the evolutionary context of these species and may have chronic effects on these populations. To combat this risk, we propose the application or extension of ship speed restrictions in ecologically significant areas, since our results indicate a reduction in sound source levels for vessels transiting at lower speeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalaenoptera edeni 3aPempheris 3aacoustics 3aendangered species 3afish 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3along term effects 3amarine mammals 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoceans 3arisk 3avocalization1 aMerchant, Nathan D.1 aFarcas, Adrian1 aRadford, Craig A.0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.1708-1721dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.139963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245011900183300001600302520166900318592002801987650002002015650003402035650002402069650002402093650001402117650002302131650003102154650001802185650003102203650001402234650001402248700001802262700001602280773012602296856008102422852000902503655001202512IND60654953320221121055413.0190727e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065495332DNAL7 a264844812pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X150008872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdendaal, D.10aEntomopathogenic nematodes for the control of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.) in field and laboratory trials  ap. 615-623.  aThree commercially available entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) strains (Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Hb1 and Hb2) and two local species (S. jeffreyense and S. yirgalemense) were evaluated for the control of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella). In field spray trials, the use of S. jeffreyense resulted in the most effective control (67%), followed by H. bacteriophora (Hb1) (42%) and S. yirgalemense (41%). Laboratory bioassays using spray application in simulated field conditions indicate S. feltiae to be the most virulent (67%), followed by S. yirgalemense (58%). A laboratory comparison of the infection and penetration rate of the different strains showed that, at 14°C, all EPN strains resulted in slower codling moth mortality than they did at 25°C. After 48 h, < 15% mortality was recorded for all species, whereas, at the warmer temperature, >98% mortality was recorded for all species involved. However, the washed codling moth larvae, cool-treated (at 14°C) with S. feltiae or S. yirgalemense, resulted in 100% mortality 24 h later at room temperature, whereas codling moth larvae treated with the two H. bacteriophora strains resulted in 68% and 54% control, respectively. At 14°C, S. feltiae had the highest average penetration rate of 20 IJs/larva, followed by S. yirgalemense, with 14 IJs/larva. At 25°C, S. yirgalemense had the highest penetration rate, with 39 IJs/larva, followed by S. feltiae, with 9 IJs/larva. This study highlights the biocontrol potential of S. jeffreyense, as well as confirming that S. feltiae is a cold-active nematode, whereas the other three EPN isolates tested prefer warmer temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCydia pomonella 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aSteinernema feltiae 3aambient temperature 3abioassays 3abiological control 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3ainsect larvae 3alaboratory experimentation 3amortality 3avirulence1 aAddison, M.F.1 aMalan, A.P.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2016 Sept., v. 90, no. 5 p.615-623dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X150008873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245014000200300002000340520154600360592002801906650002301934650001101957650001401968650001101982650002101993650001102014650001102025653001602036653001602052653002002068653002502088653002902113700001802142700001802160700001702178700001502195700001702210700001802227700001302245700001802258700001102276700001302287700005302300700005702353700005602410773014302466856007802609852000902687655001202696IND60751121420221120154216.0210922e20210910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075112142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c121712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiang-Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9820-237710aSoft-Carbon-Coated, Free-Standing, Low-Defect, Hard-Carbon Anode To Achieve a 94% Initial Coulombic Efficiency for Sodium-Ion Batteries  ap. 44358-44368.  aDeveloping hard carbon with a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and very good cycling stability is of great importance for practical sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Defects and oxygen-containing groups grown along either the carbon edges or the layers, however, are inevitable in hard carbon and can cause a tremendous density of irreversible Na⁺ sites, decreasing the efficiency and therefore causing failure of the battery. Thus, eliminating these unexpected defect structures is significant for enhancing the battery performance. Herein, we develop a strategy of applying a soft-carbon coating onto free-standing hard-carbon electrodes, which greatly hinders the formation of defects and oxygen-containing groups on hard carbon. The electrochemical results show that the soft-carbon-coated, free-standing hard-carbon electrodes can achieve an ultrahigh ICE of 94.1% and long cycling performance (99% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 20 mA g–¹), demonstrating their great potential in practical sodium storage systems. The sodium storage mechanism was also investigated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Our sodium storage mechanism extends the “adsorption–intercalation–pore filling–deposition” model. We propose that the pore filling in the plateau area might be divided into two parts: (1) sodium could fill in the pores near the inner wall of the carbon layer; (2) when the sodium in the inner wall pores is close to saturation, the sodium could be further deposited onto the existing sodium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3amodels 3asodium 0ahard carbon 0asoft carbon 0aspatial coating 0asodium-ion batteries 0asodium storage mechanism1 aZhao, Jia-Hua1 aLai, Wei-Hong1 aLi, Rongrong1 aYang, Zhuo1 aXu, Chun-mei1 aDai, Yingying1 aGao, Yun1 aLiu, Xiao-Hao1 aLi, Li1 aXu, Gang1 aQiao, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5214-48801 aChou, Shu-Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1155-60821 aWu, Minghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9776-671X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 13, no. 37 p.44358-44368dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c121713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007000158300001800228500002000246520191500266592002802181650001202209650001102221650001502232650002002247650001802267650001202285650002302297650002202320650002502342650001302367650001902380650001902399650001702418650001502435650002202450650002402472650002002496650001202516700001902528773012302547856007302670852000902743655001202752IND60589981820221119023114.0180312e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058998182DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.139802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAverill, Colin10aNitrogen limitation of decomposition and decay: How can it occur?  ap. 1417-1427.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe availability of nitrogen (N) is a critical control on the cycling and storage of soil carbon (C). Yet, there are conflicting conceptual models to explain how N availability influences the decomposition of organic matter by soil microbial communities. Several lines of evidence suggest that N availability limits decomposition; the earliest stages of leaf litter decay are associated with a net import of N from the soil environment, and both observations and models show that high N organic matter decomposes more rapidly. In direct contrast to these findings, experimental additions of inorganic N to soils broadly show a suppression of microbial activity, which is inconsistent with N limitation of decomposition. Resolving this apparent contradiction is critical to representing nutrient dynamics in predictive ecosystem models under a multitude of global change factors that alter soil N availability. Here, we propose a new conceptual framework, the Carbon, Acidity, and Mineral Protection hypothesis, to understand the effects of N availability on soil C cycling and storage and explore the predictions of this framework with a mathematical model. Our model simulations demonstrate that N addition can have opposing effects on separate soil C pools (particulate and mineral‐protected carbon) because they are differentially affected by microbial biomass growth. Moreover, changes in N availability are frequently linked to shifts in soil pH or osmotic stress, which can independently affect microbial biomass dynamics and mask N stimulation of microbial activity. Thus, the net effect of N addition on soil C is dependent upon interactions among microbial physiology, soil mineralogy, and soil acidity. We believe that our synthesis provides a broadly applicable conceptual framework to understand and predict the effect of changes in soil N availability on ecosystem C cycling under global change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3aglobal change 3aimports 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial physiology 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aosmotic stress 3aplant litter 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil mineralogy 3asoil pH1 aWaring, Bonnie0 tGlobal change biology.g2018 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.1417-1427dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.139803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245015800171300001600329520133100345592002801676650002001704650002001724650001001744650002901754650001301783650001101796650001801807650002101825650002901846650002601875700002201901700002201923700002201945700002201967700001801989700002102007700002102028700002002049773012902069856008202198852000902280655001202289IND60089640020221118145213.0141102e20120921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008964002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Boussac, Hugues10aStimulus-induced expression of the ABCG2 multidrug transporter in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma model cells involves the ERK1/2 cascade and alternative promoters  ap. 172-176.  aThe ATP-binding cassette G subfamily member ABCG2 protein is involved in drug resistance of various types of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The transcriptional regulation of the ABCG2 gene was shown to depend on various transcription factors, and three alternative promoters were described. Here we aimed to decipher the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the related kinase cascades on the expression of ABCG2 and the role of the different promoters in this process in the HepG2 human HCC cell line. We observed that HGF treatment increased the amount of ABCG2 on the cell surface in parallel with an increased ABCG2 transcription. ABCG2 mRNA expression was also increased by EGF, oxidative stress or activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, while decreased by TGFb. Treatment with U0126, a specific inhibitor of the ERK1/2 cascade, prevented the HGF and the oxidative stress induced ABCG2 upregulation. We also show that the regulation of ABCG2 by various modulators involve specific alternative promoters. In conclusion, we demonstrate a unique role of the ERK1/2 cascade on ABCG2 modulation in HepG2, and the differential use of the alternative ABCG2 promoters in this cell line. This study reveals the molecular participants of ABCG2 overexpression as new potential treatment targets in HCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug resistance 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3aoxidative stress 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aOrbán, Tamás I.1 aVárady, György,1 aTihanyi, Borbála1 aBacquet, Caroline1 aBrózik, Anna1 aVáradi, András1 aSarkadi, Balázs1 aArányi, Tamás0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Sept. 21, v. 426, no. 2 p.172-176dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01374naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008300165300002000248520038500268592002800653650002400681650001400705650002200719700001600741700001800757700001700775700005500792773013700847856007900984852000901063655001201072IND60750727220221119113753.0210917e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075072722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c011972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jia-Yuan10aMetal-Free Transformation of Sulfonyl Oxime Ethers with Amines to Oxime Ethers  ap. 12676-12682.  aSulfonyl oxime ethers undergo facile radical substitutions with various amines to yield the corresponding oxime ethers.

To examine associations between obesity and occupational injury. Methods. Participants consisted of a representative sample of 7,678 adult Canadian workers. Participants were placed into normal weight, overweight, and obese categories based on their body mass index. Different injury types, location, and external causes were measured. Logistic regression was used to estimate relationships. Results. By comparison to normal weight workers, obese workers were more likely to report any occupational injuries (odds ratio (OR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98–1.99) and serious occupational injuries (1.49, 0.99–2.26). These relationships were more pronounced for sprains and strains (1.80, 1.04–3.11), injuries to the lower limbs (2.14, 1.12–4.11) or torso (2.36, 1.13–4.93), and injuries due to falls (2.10, 0.86–5.10) or overexertion (2.08, 0.96–4.50). Female workers, workers ≥40 years, and workers employed in sedentary occupations were particularly vulnerable. Increased risks were not identified for overweight workers. Conclusions. Obese workers experienced 40–49% higher risks for occupational injury.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abody mass index 3aconfidence interval 3afemales 3alabor force 3aobesity 3aoccupations 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atorso1 aBacon, Eric1 aPickett, William2 aCanadian Institutes of Health ResearcheFunder2 aMinistry of Research and InnovationeFunder0 tJournal of obesity.g2011, v. 2011dHindawi Pub.

Hedging is important because it allows for mitigation of the risk of adverse price changes in the spot market. We examine the hedging efficiency of three types of hedging strategies; unhedged, fully hedged and hedging using optimal hedging ratios. To find the optimal hedge ratio we use an estimated constant hedge ratio, optimal hedge ratios estimated with rolling 20-week and 52-week windows, and bivariate GARCH models. The results provide evidence that hedging using futures contracts listed on Fish Pool reduces risk for producers of farmed Atlantic salmon. The best hedging efficiency is achieved with a simple one-to-one hedge, closely followed by the bivariate GARCH approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3afish 3afutures trading 3amodels 3aprices 3arisk 0aAtlantic salmon markets 0aforward prices 0arisk premium1 aAsche, Frank0 tAquaculture economics & management.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 20, no. 4 p.368-381dTaylor & Francisx1551-86637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13657305.2016.12121233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100006900181245015600250300001800406500002000424506007600444520184800520592002802368506003702396650001602433650000902449650002402458650002302482650001302505650002402518650000902542650001702551650001602568650002802584650001802612650001302630650001302643650001102656700002502667700002102692773014202713856007402855852000902929655001202938IND60654142120221207100633.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065414212DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.155532doi7 aPMC66395312pmcid7 a312685782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhittemore, Jacqueline C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2624-226210aRandomized, controlled, crossover trial of prevention of antibiotic‐induced gastrointestinal signs using a synbiotic mixture in healthy research dogs  ap. 1619-1626.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Synbiotics decrease antibiotic‐associated gastrointestinal signs (AAGS) in cats, but data supporting synbiotic use to ameliorate AAGS in dogs are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine if administration of synbiotics mitigates AAGS in dogs. ANIMALS: Twenty‐two healthy research dogs. METHODS: Randomized, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled, 2‐way, 2‐period, crossover study with an 8‐week washout period. Each period included a 1‐week baseline and 3‐week treatment phase. Dogs received enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO q24h) and metronidazole (12.5 mg/kg PO q12h), followed 1 hour later by a bacterial/yeast synbiotic combination or placebo. Food intake, vomiting, and fecal score were compared using repeated‐measures crossover analyses, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: Hyporexia, vomiting, and diarrhea occurred in 41% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21‐64), 77% (95% CI, 55‐92), and 100% (95% CI, 85‐100) of dogs, respectively, during the first treatment period. Derangements in food intake were smaller in both periods for dogs receiving synbiotics (F‐value, 5.1; P = .04) with treatment‐by‐period interactions (F‐value, 6.0; P = .02). Days of vomiting differed over time (F‐value, 4.7; P = .006). Fecal scores increased over time (F‐value, 33.5; P < .001), were lower during period 2 (F‐value, 14.5; P = .001), and had treatment‐by‐period effects (F‐value, 4.8; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Enrofloxacin/metronidazole administration is associated with a high frequency of AAGS. Synbiotic administration decreases food intake derangements. The presence of milder AAGS in period 2 suggests that clinical effects of synbiotics persist >9 weeks after discontinuation, mitigating AAGS in dogs being treated with antibiotics followed by placebo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibiotics 3acats 3aconfidence interval 3across-over studies 3adiarrhea 3adietary supplements 3adogs 3aenrofloxacin 3afood intake 3agastrointestinal system 3ametronidazole 3aplacebos 3avomiting 3ayeasts1 aMoyers, Tamberlyn D.1 aPrice, Joshua M.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2019 July, v. 33, no. 4 p.1619-1626dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.155533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008500183300001400268520130200282592002801584650001801612650002001630650002801650650001101678650001901689650001001708650001901718650001301737650003801750650001301788650002901801650001701830650005301847650004601900650002901946650002501975650002302000650001702023650003102040650007202071650006102143650006302204650001002267650005502277650003802332650006102370773010002431856004802531852000902579655001202588IND4481857320221118080019.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448185732DNAL7 a213595512pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-010-9608-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, G. Dean10aInorganic carbon transporters of the cyanobacterial CO2 concentrating mechanism   ap. 47-57.  aCyanobacteria possess an environmental adaptation known as a CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) that evolved to improve photosynthetic performance, particularly under CO2-limiting conditions. The CCM functions to actively transport dissolved inorganic carbon species (Ci; HCO3 − and CO2) resulting in accumulation of a pool of HCO3 − within the cell that is then utilised to provide an elevated CO2 concentration around the primary CO2 fixing enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco). Rubisco is encapsulated in unique micro-compartments known as carboxysomes and also provides the location for elevated CO2 levels in the cell. Five distinct transport systems for active Ci uptake are known, including two types of Na+-dependent HCO3 − transporters (BicA and SbtA), one traffic ATPase (BCT1) for HCO3 − uptake and two CO2 uptake systems based on modified NADPH dehydrogenase complexes (NDH-I3 and NDH-I4). The genes for a number of these transporters are genetically induced under Ci limitation via transcriptional regulatory processes. The in-membrane topology structures of the BicA and SbtA HCO3 − transporters are now known and this may aid in determining processes related to transporter activation during dark to light transitions or under severe Ci limitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3agenes 3aphotosynthesis 3aribulose 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atopology 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransporters 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBicarbonatesxmetabolism 2aBiological Transport 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Cycle 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCyanobacteriaxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxradiation effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxradiation effects 2aLight 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhotosynthesisxradiation effects 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism.0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2011 Sept., v. 109, no. 1-3 p.47-57dSpringer-Verlagx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-010-9608-y  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009500172300001600267500001500283520077700298592002801075650001601103650001401119650001301133650001201146650002401158650003101182650001201213650002401225651001201249653002601261653003601287653002001323653001701343773011201360856008501472852000901557655001201566IND60559137520221121154307.0161126e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055913752DNAL7 a10.1080/13657305.2016.12121252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBronnmann, Julia14aThe German whitefish market: An application of the LA/AIDS model using retail-scanner-data  ap. 330-341.  a2019-12-06  aWhitefish is one of the largest segments in the global seafood market. The whitefish market includes traditional wild-caught species; cod, pollock and Alaska pollock, and the more recent introduction of aquaculture species; pangasius and tilapia. This study specifically addresses price elasticity estimates for wild and aquacultured whitefish on the German market. For demand estimation, the general form of the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) with linear approximation (LA) is used. The demand for whitefish on the German market is found to be relatively elastic. The uncompensated cross-price elasticities indicate substantial substitution between pangasius and the three wild species, yet tilapia does not seem to be a part of the larger whitefish market in Germany.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3aPangasius 3aseafoods 3apollock 3ademand elasticities 3aAlmost Ideal Demand System 3amarkets 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3aGermany 0aTheragra chalcogramma 0aprice elasticity seafood demand 0aconsumer demand 0ascanner data0 tAquaculture economics & management.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 20, no. 4 p.330-341dTaylor & Francisx1551-86637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13657305.2016.12121253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03831naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245010900195300001600304520223400320592002802554650002902582650000802611650001602619650002802635650001902663650001402682650001202696650001402708650001002722650001002732650001502742650001702757650002202774650001002796650001602806650001102822650003602833650001202869650003802881650001002919650001302929650001402942650003302956650001002989650001602999700002203015700002203037700003203059773011703091856004803208852000903256655001203265IND4465555520221118080037.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446555552DNAL7 a213600412pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-1921-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapanastasiou, Dimitris K.10aMonitoring particulate matter levels and climate conditions in a Greek sheep and goat livestock building  ap. 285-296.  aAtmospheric pollutants from livestock operations influence air quality inside livestock buildings and the air exhausted from them. The climate that prevails inside the building affects human and animal health and welfare, as well as productivity, while emissions from the building contribute to environmental pollution. The aim of this study was to examine the variation of two climatic parameters (namely temperature and relative humidity) and the levels of particulate matter of different sizes (PM10–PM2.5–PM1), as well as the relationships between them, inside a typical Greek naturally ventilated livestock building that hosts mainly sheep. The concentration of particles was recorded during a 45-day period (27/11–10/1), while temperature and relative humidity were observed during an almost 1-year period. The analysis revealed that the variation of outdoor weather conditions significantly influenced the indoor environment, as temperature and relative humidity inside the building varied in accordance to the outside climate conditions. Temperature remained higher indoors than outdoors during the winter and extremely low values were not recorded inside the building. However, the tolerable relative humidity levels recommended by the International Commission of Agricultural Engineering (CIGR) were fulfilled only in 47% of the hours during the almost 1-year period that was examined. This fact indicates that although temperature was satisfactorily controlled, the control of relative humidity was deficient. The concentration of particulate matter was increased during the cold winter days due to poor ventilation. The maximum daily average value of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentration equaled to 363, 61 and 30 μg/m3 respectively. The concentration of the coarse particles was strongly influenced by the farming activities that were daily taking place in the building, the dust resuspension being considered as the dominant source. A significant part of the fine particles were secondary, which the production of could be attributed to an increase in relative humidity levels. It is concluded that measures have to be adopted in order to achieve sufficient ventilation and to reduce particulate matter levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural engineering 3aair 3aair quality 3aanimal and human health 3aanimal welfare 3abuildings 3aclimate 3aemissions 3agoats 3ahosts 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3arelative humidity 3asheep 3atemperature 3awinter 2aAir Pollution, Indoorxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGoats 2aHumidity 2aLivestock 2aParticulate Matterxanalysis 2aSheep 2aTemperature1 aFidaros, Dimitris1 aBartzanas, Thomas1 aKittas, C.q(Constantinos),0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2011 Dec., v. 183, no. 1-4 p.285-296dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-1921-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245008200184300001300266506002800279520177000307592002802077506003702105650002502142650001302167650001402180650001602194650001002210650001802220650002302238650001002261650001402271650000902285653001502294653001702309653002002326653002302346700002102369700002502390700002102415700002002436773013302456856008802589852000902677655001202686IND60773904220221207074816.0220322e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077390422DNAL7 a10.48077/scihor.24(5).2021.9-182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUğurbaş, Martina Vidová10aStimulation of the Liver Regeneration with Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells  ap. 9-18.  aResource is Open Access  aThe main objective of our experiment was to prove the effect of mesenchymal stem cells of bone marrow (MSCs) on the stimulation of liver regeneration. The attention has been paid to adaptation of stem cells to the new environment and their transfer to anatomical structures. The experiment included 40 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aged 10 to 12 weeks. Biomodels were divided into five groups in the same number (n=8). Group 1 consisted of a control sample of eight healthy rats. Group 2 consisted of eight rats after liver resection without application of MSCs. Group 3 was after liver resection and application of MSCs. Group 4 after liver injury induce with Thioacetamide (TAA), without transplantation of MSCs. Group 5 was after chemical damage to the liver by TAA administration and MSCs transplantation. The process of stimulation of the liver was observed based on the laboratory values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin and bilirubin. The weight of the rats in each group was also compared. Animals were sacrificed after 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days. In our experiment we found a statistically significant decrease in ALT (P≤0.001) and bilirubin (P≤0.001) was observed in the groups 3 and 5 (treated with MSCs) compared to the groups without MSCs (Groups 2 and 4). The increase in the albumin levels in the groups 3 and 5 was statistically significant. The results of our experiment led us to the conclusion, the transplantation of MSCs has important effect for the treatment and stimulation of liver regeneration following injury. MSCs administration may be extremely useful in a number of clinical applications in the treatment of liver tumors. It will allow us to perform extensive resection of the liver without risk of liver failure  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3abilirubin 3abone marrow 3aliver 3aliver failure 3aliver regeneration 3amales 3aresection 3arisk 0astem cells 0athioacetamid 0aliver resection 0aliver regeneration1 aKatuchova, Jana,1 aPetrášová, Darina1 aŠpaková, Timea1 aRadoňak, Jozef0 tNaukovì gorizonti.g2021 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.9-18dZhytomyr National Agroecological UniversitywJournal:27917x2663-21447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.48077/scihor.24(5).2021.9-183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008200169300001600251520092900267592002801196650001501224650001201239650002601251650002601277650001101303650001001314700002201324700002601346700002101372773013701393856008101530852000901611655001201620IND60579865520221121231815.0170902e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057986552DNAL7 a10.1007/s13253-017-0296-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, James C.10aModeling Collective Animal Movement Through Interactions in Behavioral States  ap. 313-334.  aAnimal movement often exhibits changing behavior because animals often alternate between exploring, resting, feeding, or other potential states. Changes in these behavioral states are often driven by environmental conditions or the behavior of nearby individuals. We propose a model for dependence among individuals’ behavioral states. We couple this state switching with complex discrete-time animal movement models to analyze a large variety of animal movement types. To demonstrate this method of capturing dependence, we study the movements of ants in a nest. The behavioral interaction structure is combined with a spatially varying stochastic differential equation model to allow for spatially and temporally heterogeneous collective movement of all ants within the nest. Our results reveal behavioral tendencies that are related to nearby individuals, particularly the queen, and to different locations in the nest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aanimals 3adifferential equation 3aenvironmental factors 3amodels 3anests1 aHanks, Ephraim M.1 aModlmeier, Andreas P.1 aHughes, David P.0 tJournal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics.g2017 Sept., v. 22, no. 3 p.313-334dSpringer USx1085-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13253-017-0296-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015300169300001600322520143600338592002801774650002201802650000901824650001301833650001801846650001101864650000701875650003501882653003501917653003401952653001601986653001802002653001302020700001802033700001202051700001902063700001802082700001502100700001802115700001502133700001502148773010002163856008502263852000902348655001202357IND60546451920221119022140.0160903e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054645192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zongtang10aDebromination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers by attapulgite-supported Fe/Ni bimetallic nanoparticles: Influencing factors, kinetics and mechanism  ap. 328-337.  aTo enhance the removal efficiency of 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenylether (BDE47) in aqueous solutions, novel attapulgite-supported Fe/Ni bimetallic nanoparticles (A-Fe/Ni), which were characterized by a core–shell nanoparticle structure and with an average diameter of 20–40nm, were synthesized for use in BDE47 degradation. The presence of attapulgite in bimetallic systems could reduce Fe/Ni nanoparticle aggregation and enhance their reactivity. BDE47 was degraded with a significant improvement in removal efficiency of at least 96% by A-Fe/Ni that played a reductive role in the reaction. The degradation kinetics of BDE47 by A-Fe/Ni complied with pseudo-first-order characteristics. To better understand the removal mechanism, detailed analyses were performed for several influential parameters. The improved dosage of A-Fe/Ni was found to be beneficial, and higher values of initial concentration, pH, and methanol/water ratio hindered the degradation rate, which, for example, decreased significantly in mixtures with a methanol proportion higher than 50%. The identification of BDE47 degradation products revealed a stepwise debromination from n-bromo-DE to (n-1)-bromo-DE as a possible pathway, wherein the para-Br was more easily eliminated than ortho-Br. Our findings provide insight into the removal mechanism and evidence for polybrominated diphenyl ether debromination by clay–Fe/Ni bimetallic nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3airon 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3apH 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 0aPolybrominated diphenyl ethers 0aSupported Fe/Ni nanoparticles 0aAttapulgite 0aDebromination 0aKinetics1 aGu, Chenggang1 aYe, Mao1 aBian, Yongrong1 aCheng, Yinwen1 aWang, Fang1 aYang, Xinglun1 aSong, Yang1 aJiang, Xin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 298 p.328-337dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011700164300001600281520182700297592002802124650001602152650001302168650000902181650001602190650002302206650002002229650003302249650002102282650001902303650002202322650001802344650001402362650001402376650002702390650001602417650001202433650001702445650003202462650001202494650001802506653001202524653003102536653001102567653001102578653001202589700001502601700001802616700001902634700001602653700001602669700001702685700002202702700001702724773009102741856008102832852000902913655001202922IND60516066720221117235316.0160323e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051606672DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311110024732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuperchi, P.10aEffects of dietary nucleotide supplementation on growth performance and hormonal and immune responses of piglets  ap. 902-908.  aThe effects of dietary nucleotide supplementation from 9 days of age until the end of post-weaning on piglets hormonal and immune responses and on growth performance were investigated. During lactation (days 9 to 21) and post-weaning (days 22 to 55) 10 [HBI Fomeva11 × (Large White × Landrace)] litters (n = 108 piglets) had ad libitum access to two standard diets, both supplemented with 0% (T0 group) or 0.1% (T1 group) of yeast extract nucleotides. BW of piglets at days 21 (P < 0.10), 35 and 55 (P < 0.05) was greater in T1 compared with T0. Feed intake was not different between groups (P > 0.05). Cortisol content was lower in T1 than in T0 at days 28 and 35 (P < 0.05), whereas growth hormone was lower at day 35 (P < 0.05). Levels of IGF-1 were similar across groups (P > 0.05). Nucleotide-supplemented diets increased lymphocyte subpopulation CD4−CD8+ʰⁱᵍʰ at days 21 and 35 (P < 0.05), whereas CD4+CD8− cells were higher in T1 than in T0 at day 21 (P < 0.05). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells cytokine expression was influenced by dietary nucleotide supplementation. At weaning, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β expression was lower (P < 0.05) in T1 compared with T0, whereas the expression of interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-10 was higher (P < 0.05). At day 28, piglets in T1 showed higher values of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression than T0 and lower values of IL-10 expression (P < 0.05). Dietary nucleotide supplementation had a suppressive effect on IL-6 and IL-10 expression (P < 0.05) at day 35. On the contrary, the expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-1β was enhanced (P < 0.05). In conclusion, these results suggest that starting a dietary nucleotide supplementation before weaning can improve the adaptive capabilities of weaned piglets to the stressors, enhancing the growth performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3acortisol 3adiet 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aimmune response 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alactation 3alandraces 3amononuclear leukocytes 3anucleotides 3apiglets 3asomatotropin 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aweaning 3ayeast extract 0apiglets 0anucleotide supplementation 0agrowth 0aimmune 0ahormone1 aSaleri, R.1 aBorghetti, P.1 aDe Angelis, E.1 aFerrari, L.1 aCavalli, V.1 aAmicucci, P.1 aOssiprandi, M.

Image identification of the fish head and tail is proposed by examining the gray level appearance features. A simplified posture of fish was calculated from its head and centroid. Multiple individual tracking was developed by incorporating the fish posture and global nearest neighbor. The proposed tracking scheme was tested with 2–5 individual Zebra fish (Cyprinidae, Danio rerio) under laboratory conditions. The experimental results confirmed the stability of the identification of a fish head and tail and a robust tracking performance was achieved. The proposed method could accurately record the movement trajectories and posture information of each individual. The tracking errors were only 0.278%–1.572% for 2–5 individual fish while the posture measurement error rates were less than 0.16%. Furthermore, the movement patterns of the fish, e.g., angular variations and distribution of the movement angle, were investigated from the behavioral data, which revealed the advantages of the proposed posture measurement for behavioral studies. The aggregation behavior of multiple fish was also analyzed to reveal the interaction patterns of the individuals in response to the spatial formation of the neighbors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aaggregation behavior 3afish 3ahead 3amonitoring 3aposture 3atail 0aFish pose measurement 0aHead and tail identification 0aMovement patterns 0aFish aggregation 0aBehavioral analysis 0aBehavioral sensing1 aChon, Tae Soo,1 aLiu, Yuedan1 aChi, Jing1 aLee, Jangmyung,0 tEcological informatics.g2016 Nov., v. 36 p.190-198dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2016.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010700158300001800265520099700283592002801280650002501308650001901333650002301352650001301375650001301388650001301401700001901414700002201433773013601455856007301591852000901664655001201673IND60559137920221121192025.0161127e20140619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055913792DNAL7 a10.1021/jp407900c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagarajan, Anu14aThe Effects of Flanking Sequences in the Interaction of Polyglutamine Peptides with a Membrane Bilayer  ap. 6368-6379.  aHuntington’s disease (HD) is caused by the presence of an extended polyglutamine (polyQ) region at the N-terminus of the huntingtin (htt) protein. The presence of flanking sequences adjacent to the polyQ region has been reported to modulate the effects of potentially toxic protein–membrane interactions. In this study, we consider four peptide systems with various combinations of flanking sequences (KKQ35KK, KKQ35P11KK, N17Q35KK, N17Q35P11KK) and use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions with a DOPC lipid bilayer. We observe significant membrane thinning, disorderliness of lipid molecules, and compensation effects between the top and the bottom leaflets of the bilayer depending on the presence of particular flanking sequences. Overall, we find that the presence of the N-17 flanking sequence is crucial for membrane interactions. Polyproline decreases the interaction with the membrane in the absence of N-17, but enhances it when present along N-17.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3alipid bilayers 3amolecular dynamics 3apeptides 3aproteins 3atoxicity1 aJawahery, Sudi1 aMatysiak, Silvina0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 June 19, v. 118, no. 24 p.6368-6379dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-61067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp407900c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001600160245006600176300001600242500000900258520184700267592002802114650002702142650001602169650001202185650001302197650002702210650001102237650001202248650001402260650001302274650002502287650002502312650001902337650001402356650002602370650001302396650002002409650001102429650001102440650001102451650001402462650001602476650001402492700001602506700001802522773012202540852000902662856009702671655001202768IND8304860220221119005519.0191122e198303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND830486022DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1983.00021962007500020020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarn, J.

This study was initiated to determine what factors were involved in these metabolic problems. Forage samples were obtained from small plots established in an existing 10-year-old stand of Russian wildrye, growing on Temvik silt loam (flne-silty, mixed Typic Haploborolls) soils. The objective of the experiment was to examine the effect of sampling dates and N, P, and K fertilization on the chemical composition and subsequent nutritional adequacy of this forage for grazing cattle. Levels of N, P, K, and in vitro digestible organic matter (IVDOM) in Russian wildrye declined consistently between weekly sampling dates both years. Forage Ca and Mg levels increased (P < 0.05) between initial and final sample dates, but weekly changes were not consistent between years. The tetany hazard to cattle grazing Russian wildrye appeared greater when evaluated by the ratio of forage K/(Ca + Mg) than when evaluated by estimated blood serum Mg data. Regrowth forage, although morphologically similar to early cut forage, appeared quite different chemically. Nitrogen fertilization increased (P < 0.05) forage N and K and consequently the K/(Ca + Mg) ratio. Nitrogen fertilization decreased (P < 0.05) forage P, but the decrease was not progressive with higher N levels. Fertilization with P increased (P < 0.05) forage P, but effects on other parameters were inconsistent. Potassium fertilizer had little effect on any parameters measured. The data indicated substantial differences in forage chemical composition as affected by year, season, and fertility, but the results did not suggest a cause of the severe scours, excessive urination and depressed weight gains which had been exhibited by yearling steers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsathyrostachys juncea 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3adiarrhea 3afertilizer application 3aforage 3agrazing 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutritional adequacy 3aorganic matter 3apotassium 3apotassium fertilizers 3aregrowth 3asilt loam soils 3aspring 3asteers 3asummer 3aurination 3aweight gain 3ayearlings1 aHofmann, L.1 aLorenz, R.

This proof of concept study investigated whether plate colour could be utilised as a strategy to reduce intake of high energy density (HED) snacks and increase intake of low energy density (LED) snacks in pre-school children. In a between and within-subjects design, children were randomly assigned to either a control group (no colour message) or intervention group (received a colour message: red = stop, green = go) and were provided a snack at nursery on three occasions on differently coloured plates (red, green, white), for each snack type (HED, LED). Snack intake, colour preference, colour association, and anthropometrics were recorded for each child. The results showed that there was no effect of group (control vs intervention) on HED (p = 0.540) and LED intake (p = 0.575). No effect of plate colour on HED (p = 0.147) or LED snack intake (p = 0.505) was evident. Combining red and green plates for a chromatic versus achromatic comparison showed that there was no significant effect of chromatic plate on HED (p = 0.0503) and LED (p = 0.347) intakes. Despite receiving a brief learning intervention, the use of plate colour was found in the present study to be an ineffective strategy to control snack food intake in pre-school aged children. Rather, we suggest that food intake in young children may best be predicted by portion size, energy density and eating behaviour traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanthropometric measurements 3acolor 3aeating habits 3aenergy density 3alearning 3aportion size 3apreschool children 3asnack foods 3asnacks 0aColour 0aFood intake 0aChildren 0aVisual cue 0aDishware1 aCaton, Samantha J.1 aHetherington, Marion M.1 aRolls, Barbara J.1 aCecil, Joanne E.0 tFood quality and preference.g2020 July, v. 83 p.103862-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.1038623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011000165300001800275520131300293592002801606650001101634650001001645650001501655650001101670650003401681700003101715700001901746700002001765773011001785856008101895852000901976655001201985IND60119179520221119140436.0141206e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011917952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-014-1030-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinzet, Rıza10aPollen morphology and systematical contribution of some Onosma (Boraginaceae) taxa distribution in Turkey  ap. 2135-2146.  aIn this study, the palynological characteristics and its taxonomic implications of 30 different Onosma L. taxa, which belong to sections Protonosma M. Popov., Podonosma (Boiss.) Gurke. and subsections Haplotricha (Boiss.) Gurke., and Asterotricha (Boiss.) Gurke. of section Onosma were investigated under Light Microscope (LM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and pollen of four taxa with Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Pollen grains are mostly heteropolar and trisyncolporate rarely isopolar and tricolporate (O. rostellata and O. orientale), subprolate or prolate to spheroidal and exine tectate-perforate (O. rostellata, O. sericea and O. auriculata) and tectate-imperforate (O. bracteosa). In the conclusion of the study it has been determined that investigated Onosma species have shown three different types of ornamentation, namely scabrate (O. sericea type, O. auriculata type and O. orientale type), rugulate (O. rostellata type) and scabrate–rugulate (O. bracteosa type). It was pointed out that these different types of ornamentation can be used to separate the sections and similar taxa from each other. Pollen grains of O. lycaonica Hub.-Mor., O. bracteosa Hausskn. & Bornm., O. caerulescens Boiss. and O. taurica Willd. var. taurica from subsection Asterotricha have an operculum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOnosma 3aexine 3apalynology 3apollen 3ascanning electron microscopes1 aPotoğlu Erkara, İsmühan1 aÖzler, Hülya1 aPehlivan, Sevil0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2014 Dec., v. 300, no. 10 p.2135-2146dSpringer-Verlagx0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-014-1030-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100002000163245015700183300001800340520142500358592002801783650001301811650002101824650001101845650001901856650003101875650002101906650001301927650002301940700001301963700002101976700001301997773010102010856004502111852000902156655001202165IND50090290720221117194228.0140612e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009029072DNAL7 a247235682pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2014000922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Jin‐Shan10aPurification of supercoiled plasmid DNA from clarified bacterial lysate by arginine‐affinity chromatography: Effects of spacer arms and ligand density  ap. 1386-1395.  aEfficient loading on a chromatographic column is the dilemma of the process development faced by engineers in plasmid DNA purification. In this research, novel arginine‐affinity chromatographic beads were prepared to investigate the effect of spacer arm and ligand density to their chromatographic performance for the purification of plasmid. The result indicated that dynamic binding capacity for plasmid increased with an increasing ligand density and carbon number of spacer arm, and the highest binding capacity for plasmid of 6.32 mg/mL bead was observed in the column of arginine bead with a ligand density of 47 mmol/L and 10‐atom carbon spacer. Furthermore, this arginine bead exhibited better selectivity to supercoiled (sc) plasmid. The evidence of a linear gradient elution suggested further that the binding of plasmid on arginine beads was driven by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. Hence, sc plasmid could successfully be purified from clarified lysate by two‐stepwise elution of salt concentration. By the refinement of the elution scheme and loading volume of clarified lysate, the column of arginine bead with a ligand density of 47 mmol/L exhibited the highest recovery yield and a much higher productivity among arginine‐affinity columns. Therefore, reshaped arginine beads provided more feasible and practical application in the preparation of sc plasmid from clarified lysate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3abinding capacity 3acarbon 3achromatography 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3aplasmids 3asalt concentration1 aBai, Shu1 aShi, Qing‐Hong1 aSun, Yan0 tJournal of separation science.g2014 June, v. 37, no. 12 p.1386-1395dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.201400092  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015400166300002000320520157500340592002801915596005901943596013802002596006002140650001302200650001702213650001602230650001102246650001902257650000902276650001402285650001702299650001302316650001402329650001302343650000902356650001902365650002302384650001902407650001602426651001002442700001902452700001702471700003102488700001902519773015502538856008202693852000902775655001202784IND60746992320221118113431.0210811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074699232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13576-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhihao10aEffects of the natural environment and human activities on iron and manganese content in groundwater: a case study of Changchun city, Northeast China  ap. 41109-41119.  aExcessive Fe and Mn in groundwater of the Songnen Plain, northeast China, pose a threat to water security. Human activities over recent decades have had significant effects on the water quantity and quality of the Songnen Plain. By adopting the large city of Changchun in the Songnen Plain as a research area, this study analyzed the effects of the natural environment (including characteristics of soil and aquifer, climate, and groundwater level) and human activities (including groundwater salinization, groundwater exploitation, and nitrate effects) on groundwater Fe and Mn using statistical and spatial analysis methods. The results showed that the characteristics of soil and aquifer determine the source of groundwater Fe and Mn. The correlations between Fe and Mn with TDS (total dissolved solids) increased with increasing TDS from southeast to northwest in different microclimate regions. The salinization of groundwater caused by human activities will also lead to the increase of Fe content. The decrease in groundwater Fe and Mn was attributed to an increase in groundwater [Formula: see text], through the use of chemical fertilizers. The variation of Fe concentration in groundwater corresponded well with that of groundwater depth, but the excessive exploitation will lead to the continuous decrease in groundwater level and a corresponding decrease in the concentration of groundwater Fe. This study provides a reference for understanding the influence of human activities and the natural environment on groundwater hydrochemistry in the Songnen Plain.  aPublisher supplied data  a41572216cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a[2019]DD20190340-W09cChina Geological Survey Shenyang Geological Survey Center “Hydrogeological Survey of Songnen Plain” project  a2018-13cGeological Survey Foundation of Jilin Province 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3ahydrochemistry 3airon 3amanganese 3amicroclimate 3anitrates 3apollution 3aresearch 3asoil 3awater quantity 3awater salinization 3awater security 3awater table 3aChina1 aXiao, Changlai1 aYang, Weifei1 aAdeyeye, Oluwafemi Adewole1 aLiang, Xiujuan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 30 p.41109-41119dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13576-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014200164300002000306520148000326592002801806596010001834596010201934650004402036650002102080650001502101650001502116650003502131650001402166650003702180650001702217650001302234650001102247650001302258650000702271650001502278650001402293650001302307650002302320650001602343650001502359650001402374700001802388700001402406700001302420700002002433700001802453700001602471700001802487773015502505856008202660852000902742655001202751IND60746992420221118113422.0210811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074699242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-09271-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jianmin14aThe adsorption properties of functionalization vetiver grass-based activated carbon: the simultaneous adsorption of phosphate and nitrate  ap. 40544-40554.  aIn this work, zirconium chloride octahydrate/CTAB/vetiver grass-activated carbon (ZR/CTAB/VGAC) was prepared from vetiver grass-activated carbon (VGAC), using zirconium chloride octahydrate (ZR) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as modifiers. The optimized conditions of the simultaneous phosphate and nitrate removal by ZR/CTAB/VGAC were discussed, including amount of adsorbent, initial concentration, pH, contact time, and temperature. The simultaneous removal efficiency of phosphate and nitrate was 96.50% and 51.17% under optimized conditions. The structural and morphology of ZR/CTAB/VGAC was investigated by using automatic volumetric adsorption analyzer (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It was found that the removal efficiencies of phosphate and nitrate were enhanced dramatically because ZR and CTAB were introduced on the surface of VGAC after modification. Moreover, the adsorption data fitted significantly well with Freundlich isotherm model. It was described well by pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Phosphate and nitrate adsorbed via chemisorption (ion exchange) by ZR, CTAB, and functional groups of the surface of ZR/CTAB/VGAC. Electrostatic adsorption of AC in ZR/CTAB/VGAC also played an important role in the adsorption process. ZR/CTAB/VGAC is an excellent adsorbent, which could be applied to remove nitrate and phosphate from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020J0329cthe Science Research Fund Projects of Department of Education of Yunnan Province  a2020J0327cthe Science Research Fund Projects of Department of Education of Yunnan Province 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3achlorides 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aion exchange 3akinetics 3amodels 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphates 3apollution 3aresearch 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastewater 3azirconium1 aFang, Xiuying1 aYang, Min1 aTan, Wei1 aZhang, Haocheng1 aZhang, Yanyan1 aLi, Guizhen1 aWang, Hongbin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 30 p.40544-40554dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09271-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245005800166300001400224520162600238592002801864650001701892650002201909650002201931650002101953650001901974650001601993650001602009650001502025650001502040650002402055650000902079650001502088650002602103650001902129650001702148650001002165651001502175653000902190653001002199653002602209653003002235700002202265700002002287700001802307700001902325773024002344856008402584852000902668655001202677IND60527935320221120031622.0190416e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052793532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.iswcr.2015.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatt, Rajan10aSustainability issues on rice–wheat cropping system  ap. 64-74.  aRice–wheat cropping system (RWCS) of the South Asia is labour-, water-, capital- and energy-intensive, and become less profitable as the availability of these resources diminished. This could be further aggravated with deterioration of soil structure, declining underground water and lesser land and water productivity which ultimately are threat in front of sustainable and profitable RWCS in the region. For improving the profits, production and sustainability of this sequence - a paradigm shift is required. Scientists recommended different resource-conserving technologies (RCTs) viz. zero tillage, laser levelling, irrigation based on soil matric potential, bed planting, direct seeding, mechanical transplanting of rice and crop diversification for this purpose. These technologies are site specific and before selecting any particular RCT for a particular region, soil texture and agro-climatic conditions must be considered. A solitary approach/RCT might not be effective to solve the upcoming issue of producing more food grains with inadequate available water and land. Therefore, an integrated approach is required. But before implementing any approach, different issues relating to RWCS must be discovered, considered and addressed in a holistic manner.In this review, an attempt was made to highlight different issues resulted from the practise of intensive rice–wheat cropping sequence of the region, which must be considered while framing and implementing any integrated approach/project such as conservation agriculture for improving the productions, profits and sustainability of RWCS in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aTriticum aestivum 3acropping sequence 3acropping systems 3adirect seeding 3afood grains 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3ano-tillage 3aprofits and margins 3arice 3ascientists 3asoil matric potential 3asoil structure 3asoil texture 3awheat 3aSouth Asia 0aRice 0aWheat 0aSustainability issues 0aClimate smart agriculture1 aKukal, Surinder S1 aBusari, Mutiu A1 aArora, Sanjay1 aYadav, Mathura0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2016 Mar., v. 4, no. 1 p.64-74dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iswcr.2015.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005100151245014100202300001800343520140400361592002801765650002501793650001701818650003501835650003801870650001401908650002101922650002101943650001501964650000901979650001801988650002402006650001302030650001302043650001502056650002602071650004302097650001102140650001702151650001002168650002102178653001602199653001502215653002102230653003602251700002002287700001502307700002402322700002202346700001302368773013302381856008502514852000902599655001202608IND60639753820190612000000.0190503e20190416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063975382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b007642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8333-006910aTandem Mass Tag Based Quantitative Proteomics of Developing Sea Buckthorn Berries Reveals Candidate Proteins Related to Lipid Metabolism  ap. 1958-1969.  aSea buckthorn (Hippophae L.) is an economically important shrub or small tree distributed in Eurasia. Most of its well-recognized medicinal and nutraceutical products are derived from its berry oil, which is rich in monounsaturated omega-7 (C16:1) fatty acid and polyunsaturated omega-6 (C18:2) and omega-3 (C18:3) fatty acids. In this study, tandem mass tags (TMT)-based quantitative analysis was used to investigate protein profiles of lipid metabolism in sea buckthorn berries harvested 30, 50, and 70 days after flowering. In total, 8626 proteins were identified, 6170 of which were quantified. Deep analysis results for the proteins identified and related pathways revealed initial fatty acid accumulation during whole-berry development. The abundance of most key enzymes involved in fatty acid and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis peaked at 50 days after flowering, but TAG synthesis through the PDAT (phospholipid: diacylglycerol acyltransferase) pathway mostly occurred early in berry development. In addition, the patterns of proteins involved in lipid metabolism were confirmed by combined quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and parallel reaction monitoring analyses. Our data on the proteomic spectrum of sea buckthorn berries provide a scientific basic for understanding lipid metabolism and related pathways in the developing berries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3abiosynthesis 3adiacylglycerol acyltransferase 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflowering 3afunctional foods 3alipid metabolism 3amonitoring 3aoils 3aphospholipids 3aprotein composition 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ashrubs 3asmall fruits 3atrees 3atriacylglycerols 0aHippophae L 0aproteomics 0alipid metabolism 0aTMT-based quantitative analysis1 aXiong, Chao-Wei1 aDing, Jian1 aNybom, H.q(Hilde),1 aRuan, Cheng-Jiang1 aGuo, Hai0 tJournal of proteome research.g2019 Apr. 16, v. 18, no. 5 p.1958-1969dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b007643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011700165300001400282520066700296592002800963650002400991650001101015650001601026650001101042650002501053650001801078650002501096650001101121650001901132650001801151650001701169651001501186653002001201653001301221653003401234653001801268653001801286700001801304700001601322700001601338700001801354700001601372700001701388773009401405856008501499852000901584655001201593IND60628738320221119205538.0190415e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062873832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2018.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xixi10aComplete genome sequence of marine Bacillus sp.

These studies have, however, produced mixed results; but due to the importance of reducing elasmobranch bycatch in fisheries and/or directed shark capture in beach nets, future research on electrosensory repellents is imperative. At the same time, understanding the potential influence of these materials on other marine animals is equally important so that the techniques may be selectively applied to achieve conservation goals while having little impact on non-target species. In the present study, both bait and barrier experiments were conducted in the Bahamas to assess how barium-ferrite (BaFe12O19) permanent magnets might influence teleost and elasmobranch behavior. For both the bait and barrier experiments, teleost species exhibited no significant associations between behavior and treatment type. Furthermore, elasmobranchs exhibited significant behavioral variation towards magnetically-treated baits, in comparison to baited controls and procedural controls. However, during the barrier experiment blacknose sharks (Carcharhinus acronotus) and southern stingrays (Dasyatis americana) exhibited no significant behavioral changes to magnetically-treated barrier regions, whereas Caribbean reef (Carcharhinus perezi) and nurse (Ginglymostoma cirratum) sharks did. This study is the first large-scale analysis of teleost behavior around magnetically-treated baits and barriers, and provides further support to the hypothesis suggesting that electrosensory repellents target and observably alter the behavior of aquatic organisms containing electroreceptors. In addition, the species-specificity of elasmobranch responses which occurred during the barrier experiment provides valuable information for future conservation engineering applications in fishing gears and beach nets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarcharhinus 3aDasyatis americana 3aGinglymostoma cirratum 3aRajidae 3aaquacultural and fisheries equipment 3abaits 3abehavior change 3abycatch 3amagnetic materials 3ametals 3anontarget organisms 3arepellents 3asharks 3aBahamas 3aCaribbean1 aHe, P.0 tOcean & coastal management.g2014 Aug., v. 96 p.130-137dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100003000162245013800192300001800330520141800348592002801766650002201794650003501816650001101851650002301862650001601885650002301901650001001924650001501934650001001949650001301959650001401972650002601986650001902012650002802031650001602059650001002075650002702085650002302112650003302135650003302168650002202201650002702223650004902250650004602299650005102345700001602396773015502412852000902567856007902576655001202655IND4462426420221120145224.0160905e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446242642DNAL7 a217707672pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-05-11-01072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchweizer, P.q(Patrick),10aLarge-Scale Data Integration Reveals Colocalization of Gene Functional Groups with Meta-QTL for Multiple Disease Resistance in Barley  ap. 1492-1501.  aRace-nonspecific and durable resistance of plant genotypes to major pathogens is highly relevant for yield stability and sustainable crop production but difficult to handle in practice due to its polygenic inheritance by quantitative trait loci (QTL). As far as the underlying genes are concerned, very little is currently known in the most important crop plants such as the cereals. Here, we integrated publicly available data for barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare) in order to detect the most important genomic regions for QTL-mediated resistance to a number of fungal pathogens and localize specific functional groups of genes within these regions. This identified 20 meta-QTL, including eight hot spots for resistance to multiple diseases that were distributed over all chromosomes. At least one meta-QTL region for resistance to the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis was found to be co-linear between barley and wheat, suggesting partial evolutionary conservation. Large-scale genetic mapping revealed that functional groups of barley genes involved in secretory processes and cell-wall reinforcement were significantly over-represented within QTL for resistance to powdery mildew. Overall, the results demonstrate added value resulting from large-scale genetic and genomic data integration and may inform genomic-selection procedures for race-nonspecific and durable disease resistance in barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlumeria graminis 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare 3abarley 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3adisease resistance 3afungi 3agene banks 3agenes 3agenotype 3apathogens 3apolygenic inheritance 3apowdery mildew 3aquantitative trait loci 3avalue added 3awheat 2aAscomycotaxphysiology 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aDisease Resistancexgenetics 2aFungixphysiology 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aHordeumxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgeneticsximmunology.1 aStein, Nils0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Dec., v. 24, no. 12 p.1492-1501dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-05-11-01073Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03737naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100002400195245013800219506007600357506003100433520191500464592002802379596004702407506003702454650004302491650001102534650001702545650003102562650001002593650002102603650001802624650002102642650001702663650001602680653004102696653004002737653002702777653001902804700005602823700001402879700005502893700002202948700001702970700002302987700001803010773009503028856008703123852000903210655001203219IND60679716320221207095244.0200330e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067971632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1070442chorus7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1070442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Frias, J.

However, only a handful of studies have evaluated the effect of repeated door openings on product temperatures and energy consumption with contrasting reports. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of two frequencies (doors opened every 5 or 15 min) and four durations (doors held ajar for 5, 15, 30 or 60 s) on product simulator temperatures in a display case installed in our research supermarket. At ambient conditions (19.6–20.9 °C, 63% RH), with a case thermostat setting of 0.6 °C and a daily 30-min defrost cycle, the only statistically significant fluctuation in product simulator temperatures was found for the most aggressive opening schedule where the door was opened every 5 min for 60 s at each opening. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated that this treatment resulted in product simulator temperatures (up to 6.6 °C during defrost cycle) that were significantly higher (p < 0.001) or somewhat significantly higher (p < 0.03) compared to product exposed to all other combinations. Product exposed to all other treatment combination resulted in temperatures that either never exceeded 5 °C or briefly exceeded it only during the single 30-min defrost cycle. As a result, we selected an average opening sequence (every 10 min for 12 s) to perform an energy consumption assessment of the case. Energy consumption was determined to be 66% lower than that compared to an open-retail display case (same model, mark, size, operating schedule and thermostat setting). Even with the most extreme schedule where three of the six doors remained open continuously, there was still a measured 45% reduction in energy consumption as compared to that of the open-retail display case.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFood and Drug Administration Food Code 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenergy use and consumption 3aglass 3aperishable foods 3arefrigeration 3aretail marketing 3asupermarkets 3atemperature 0aRefrigerated display case with doors 0aDoor opening frequency and duration 0aTemperature uniformity 0aEnergy savings1 aLuo, Yaguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6164-43181 aZhou, Bin1 aZhang, Boce1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2095-10951 aIngram, David.

Then, a 4-factor-three-level experimental scheme designed by the Box-Benhnken Design was applied on the basis of a single experiment to determine the extraction yield and the antioxidant property. Finally, the extraction process was optimized through response surface methodology (RSM) and the genetic neural network (GNN), respectively. The use of betaine-lactic acid as an extractant displayed significant advantages in the screening process. The optimum extraction parameters provided by GNN were as follows: water content 25% (v/v), liquid to material ratio 190 mg/ml, extraction time 37 min, and extraction temperature 63 °C. Under this condition, the average experimental comprehensive evaluation values of the extraction yield and antioxidant properties were 3.12 mg/g and 86.27%, and the relative deviations to the predicted values were 0.30% and 1.44%, respectively. In addition, the experimental results of GNN were better than those of RSM (p < 0.01). We found the application of GNN to be effective and credible for bi-objective optimization of extraction yields and antioxidant activity in this study. Moreover, our results provide a reference and a theoretical basis for experimental and future industrial extraction for multi-objective situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acomparative study 3aformononetin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliquids 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3awater content 0aNatural deep eutectic solvents 0aYangyin Yiqi Huoxue prescription 0aGenetic neural network 0aResponse surface methodology 0abi-objective optimization 0aGNN 0aNaDESs 0aRSM 0aYYHP1 aJin, Weifeng1 aZhang, Yangyang1 aXu, Shouchao1 aWan, Haitong1 aHe, Yu1 aYu, Li0 tPhytomedicine.g2022 July 20, v. 102 p.154156-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1541563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245011400196300001500310520108000325592002801405650002801433650001101461650001001472650001201482650001101494650001501505650001501520650001101535650001201546650001301558650001901571650001401590650001601604700001901620700001801639773015101657856006901808856009901877990002301976852000901999655001202008IND60643578620221118030301.0190511e20141004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064357862DNAL7 a10.3791/519812doi7 aPMC46924102pmcid7 a253502942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZenger, Beatrix10aAcquisition of high-quality digital video of Drosophila larval and adult behaviors from a lateral perspective  ap. e51981.  aDrosophila melanogaster is a powerful experimental model system for studying the function of the nervous system. Gene mutations that cause dysfunction of the nervous system often produce viable larvae and adults that have locomotion defective phenotypes that are difficult to adequately describe with text or completely represent with a single photographic image. Current modes of scientific publishing, however, support the submission of digital video media as supplemental material to accompany a manuscript. Here we describe a simple and widely accessible microscopy technique for acquiring high-quality digital video of both Drosophila larval and adult phenotypes from a lateral perspective. Video of larval and adult locomotion from a side-view is advantageous because it allows the observation and analysis of subtle distinctions and variations in aberrant locomotive behaviors. We have successfully used the technique to visualize and quantify aberrant crawling behaviors in third instar larvae, in addition to adult mutant phenotypes and behaviors including grooming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aadults 3agenes 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alocomotion 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3anervous system 3aphenotype 3aphotographs1 aWetzel, Sabine1 aDuncan, Jason0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Oct. 04, , no. 92 p.e51981-e51981dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/519813Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51981/acquisition-high-quality-digital-video-drosophila-larval-adult  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007800167300001600245500001400261520098200275592002801257650002601285650001201311650001201323650002101335650001401356650001901370650001001389650001301399650000701412650001501419650001401434650001301448650000901461650001101470650001101481650003001492650001801522650001601540651001001556653001201566653002101578653002201599700001701621700001501638773014801653856008201801852000901883655001201892IND60710230120221118081555.0200908s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071023012DNAL7 a10.6088/ijes.201203013103x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanakiraman, A10aImpact of domestic sewage pollution on rotifer abundance in Adyar estuary  ap. 689-696.  aNAL-light  aThe zooplankton and physico-chemical parameters of Adyar estuary were studied from (July-2010 to June 2011) in order to evaluate seasonal trend in rotifer diversity and abundance in relation to water quality and impact of sand bar at mouth of Adyar estuary, Chennai. The minimum and maximum values of atmospheric and surface water temperature (°C), pH, salinity (‰) and dissolved oxygen (mg/l) were: 27.33–30.00; 28.66–31.33; 7.067.86; 15.66–25.66 and 1.81–5.76 respectively.

Periwinkle leaf yellowing (PLY) phytoplasma and peanut witches'-broom (PnWB) phytoplasma caused different degrees of floral abnormalities on infected periwinkle plants. The PLY phytoplasma-infected plants exhibited floral discoloration, virescence, small flowers, and only occasionally full floral reversion. In contrast, PnWB phytoplasma frequently induced complete floral reversion and resulted in a witches'-broom symptom from the floral reversion. Although different degrees of floral symptoms were induced by these two phytoplasmas, the morphological disorders were similar to those of other plants carrying SEPALLATA mutations or gene silencing. Here, we compared expression levels of organ-identity-related genes and pigmentation genes during floral symptom development. Accumulation of phytoplasmas in malformed flowers and their closely surrounding leaves was also compared. In infected plants, transcript abundance of all examined organ identity genes and pigmentation genes was suppressed. Indeed, CrSEP3, a SEPALLALA3 ortholog, showed the greatest suppression among genes examined. Of the pigmentation genes, transcript reduction of chalcone synthase was most highly correlated with the loss in floral pigmentation. Floral symptom severities were associated with the accumulation of either phytoplasmas. Interestingly, both phytoplasmas accumulated to higher levels in malformed flowers than in their surrounding leaves. Many plant pathogens manipulate host plant development to their advantage. It is intriguing to see whether phytoplasmas alter floral development to increase their population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aPeanut witches'-broom phytoplasma 3adiscoloration 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene silencing 3agenes 3ahost plants 3aleaves 3amutation 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3apigmentation 3aplant pathogens 3apopulation growth 3awitches' broom 2aBase Sequence 2aCatharanthusxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPhytoplasmaxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aChen, Jen-Chih1 aLin, Chan-Pin0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Dec., v. 24, no. 12 p.1502-1512dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-06-11-01763Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02575naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011900158300001800277520116800295592002801463650001601491650002401507650002101531650001701552650001301569650002001582650001901602650001301621700002401634700002301658700002001681700002301701700001401724700002501738700002501763700002301788700002001811700002701831700002101858700002001879700002301899773009901922856007502021852000902096655001202105IND60577056820171220000000.0170806e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057705682DNAL7 a10.1021/la404026w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Mariya
D.10aFacile Directed Assembly of Hollow Polymer Nanocapsules within Spontaneously Formed Catanionic Surfactant Vesicles  ap. 7061-7069.  aSurfactant vesicles containing monomers in the interior of the bilayer were used to template hollow polymer nanocapsules. This study investigated the formation of surfactant/monomer assemblies by two loading methods, concurrent loading and diffusion loading. The assembly process and the resulting aggregates were investigated with dynamic light scattering, small angle neutron scattering, and small-angle X-ray scattering. Acrylic monomers formed vesicles with a mixture of cationic and anionic surfactants in a broad range of surfactant ratios. Regions with predominant formation of vesicles were broader for compositions containing acrylic monomers compared with blank surfactants. This observation supports the stabilization of the vesicular structure by acrylic monomers. Diffusion loading produced monomer-loaded vesicles unless vesicles were composed from surfactants at the ratios close to the boundary of a vesicular phase region on a phase diagram. Both concurrent-loaded and diffusion-loaded surfactant/monomer vesicles produced hollow polymer nanocapsules upon the polymerization of monomers in the bilayer followed by removal of surfactant scaffolds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aanionic surfactants 3alight scattering 3ananocapsules 3aneutrons 3aphysical phases 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aDergunov, Sergey A.1 aRichter, Andrew G.1 aDurbin, Jeffrey1 aShmakov, Sergey N.1 aJia, Ying1 aKenbeilova, Saltanat1 aOrazbekuly, Yerbolat1 aKengpeiil, Aigerim1 aLindner, Ernő,1 aPingali, Sai Venkatesh1 aUrban, Volker S.1 aWeigand, Steven1 aPinkhassik, Eugene0 tLangmuir.g2014 June 24, v. 30, no. 24 p.7061-7069dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla404026w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245017800213520184000391592002802231650003402259650001202293650001302305650001902318650001602337650001702353650002602370650002002396650001302416653002102429653002002450653002102470653002202491653002502513653001302538653001502551653001502566653000802581653000902589653000802598653000802606653000902614653000802623653000902631653000902640653000702649653000702656653001302663653000602676700006402682700003102746700002702777700003102804700006602835773009802901856008502999852000903084655001203093IND60776670420221120170805.0220614e20220720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077667042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1541572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantharos, Patchaya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2690-212010aUtilization of UPLC-PDA and GC–MS/MS coupled with metabolomics analysis to identify bioactive metabolites in medicinal turmeric at different ages for the quality assurance  aAvailable monographs often suggest measurement of curcumin or curcuminoids for quality control of turmeric-based medicines/products. However, one compound is not enough to indicate the quality of traditional herbal medicines due to the holistic approach. Furthermore, to ensure high quality of such products, good harvesting practice plays an important role in the quality control of turmeric raw materials. This study aimed to indicate quality markers of turmeric and to suggest optimum harvesting times for turmeric used for medicinal purposes by integration of Thai traditional medicine knowledge. Turmeric rhizomes at 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 months old were analyzed. UPLC-PDA was used for quantitation of curcumin. GC–MS/MS was used to obtain chemical profiles of turmeric volatile oil. PCA, Volcano plot, and HCA were performed to identify similarities or differences of the data. Turmeric aged between 6 and 10 months old contained > 5%w/w of curcumin, which complied with Thai Herbal Pharmacopoeia 2021. GC–MS/MS analysis suggested suitable chemical markers, namely Ar-turmerone, turmerone, curlone, and zingiberene, because they exhibited pharmacological activities related to the traditional uses of turmeric. Eucalyptol, santalene, β-caryophyllene, cis-β-farnesene, α-caryophyllene, curcumene, β-bisabolene, β-sesquiphellandrene, and cis-sesquisabinene hydrate were also tentatively identified. Later, the multivariate analysis revealed that turmeric aged between 6 and 10 months old showed similar metabolite profiles. Based on curcumin content and chemical profiles, turmeric aged between 6 and 10 months old are appropriate for uses in Thai traditional medicine. Our study suggests additional information in the quality control of turmeric to assure its efficacy, especially for uses in traditional medicines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3acineole 3acurcumin 3aessential oils 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amultivariate analysis 3aquality control 3aturmeric 0aTurmeric rhizome 0aHarvesting time 0aCurcumin content 0aChemical Profiles 0aTraditional Medicine 0aAR grade 0aBEH column 0aGC–MS/MS 0aHCA 0aHPLC 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aNIST 0aPCA 0aPTFE 0a%RSD 0aR2 0aSD 0aUPLC-PDA 0aX1 aSukcharoen, Panisara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0293-78471 aPhadungrakwittaya, Rattana1 aAkarasereenont, Pravit1 aBooranasubkajorn, Suksalin1 aLumlerdkij, Natchagorn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5142-85070 tPhytomedicine.g2022 July 20, v. 102 p.154157-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1541573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245003600212300001100248506007600259520198400335592002802319506003702347650002002384650001502404650001402419650001002433650000902443650000902452650002302461650001202484650000902496650001402505650001602519650001302535650001402548650002402562650001002586650002002596650002902616650002102645650002302666651001802689700002102707700001702728700006102745773011902806856008202925852000903007655001203016IND60603144420221207123413.0200530e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060314442DNAL7 a299969082pmid7 aPMC60424272pmcid7 a10.1186/s13028-018-0398-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaneczek, Agnieszka10aMarijuana intoxication in a cat  ap. 44.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cannabis from hemp (Cannabis sativa and C. indica) is one of the most common illegal drugs used by drug abusers. Indian cannabis contains around 70 alkaloids, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) is the most psychoactive substance. Animal intoxications occur rarely and are mostly accidental. According to the US Animal Poison Control Center, cannabis intoxication mostly affects dogs (96%). The most common cause of such intoxication is unintentional ingestion of a cannabis product, but it may also occur after the exposure to marijuana smoke. CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-year-old Persian cat was brought to the veterinary clinic due to strong psychomotor agitation turning into aggression. During hospitalisation for 14 days, the cat behaved normally and had no further attacks of unwanted behaviour. It was returned to its home but shortly after it developed neurological signs again and was re-hospitalised. On presentation, the patient showed no neurological abnormalities except for symmetric mydriasis and scleral congestion. During the examination, the behaviour of the cat changed dramatically. It developed alternate states of agitation and apathy, each lasting several minutes. On interview it turned out that the cat had been exposed to marijuana smoke. Blood toxicology tests by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry revealed the presence of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at 5.5 ng/mL, 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC at 1.2 ng/mL, and 11-carboxy-delta-9-THC at 13.8 ng/mL. The cat was given an isotonic solution of NaCl 2.5 and 2.5% glucose at a dose of 40 mL/kg/day parenterally and was hospitalised. After complete recovery, the cat was returned to it’s owner and future isolation of the animal from marijuana smoke was advised. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of a delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol intoxication in a cat with both description of the clinical findings and the blood concentration of delta-9-THC and its main metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCannabis sativa 3aaggression 3aalkaloids 3ablood 3acats 3adogs 3agas chromatography 3aglucose 3ahemp 3aingestion 3ametabolites 3apatients 3apoisoning 3apsychotropic agents 3asmoke 3asodium chloride 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity testing 3aveterinary clinics 3aUnited States1 aZawadzki, Marcin1 aSzpot, Pawel1 aNiedzwiedz, Artur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8925-48530 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2018 Dec., v. 60, no. 1 p.44-44dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-018-0398-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013500164300002000299520150500319592002801824596005901852596005901911596005501970596005402025650005002079650002002129650001302149650002402162650001402186650001702200650001302217650001402230650002402244650001302268650003102281650001502312650001102327651001002338700001402348700001302362700001902375700001702394700001902411700001802430700005002448773015402498856008302652852000902735655001202744IND60765614720221119105149.0220130e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076561472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16539-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Jie-Qi10aIndividual exposure to ambient PM2.5 and hospital admissions for COPD in 110 hospitals: a case-crossover study in Guangzhou, China  ap. 11699-11706.  aFew studies have evaluated the short-term association between hospital admissions and individual exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM₂.₅). Particularly, no studies focused on hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at the individual level. We assessed the short-term effects of PM₂.₅ on hospitalization admissions for COPD in Guangzhou, China, during 2014–2015, based on satellite-derived estimates of ambient PM₂.₅ concentrations at a 1-km resolution near the residential address as individual-level exposure for each patient. Around 40,002 patients with COPD admitted to 110 hospitals were included in this study. A time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression models was applied to assess the effects of PM₂.₅ based on a 1-km grid data of aerosol optical depth provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on hospital admissions for COPD. Further, we performed stratified analyses by individual demographic characteristics and season of hospital admission. Around 10 μg/m³ increase in individual-level PM₂.₅ was associated with an increase of 1.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6%, 2.7%) in hospitalization for COPD at a lag of 0–5 days. The impact of PM₂.₅ on hospitalization for COPD was greater significantly in males and patients admitted in summer. Our study strengthened the evidence for the adverse effect of PM₂.₅ based on satellite-based individual-level exposure data.  aPublisher supplied data  a81573249cnational natural science foundation of china  a82003555cnational natural science foundation of china  a2020M672744cchina postdoctoral science foundation  a2020TQ0135cchina postdoctoral science foundation 3aNational Aeronautics and Space Administration 3aadverse effects 3aaerosols 3aconfidence interval 3ahospitals 3aparticulates 3apatients 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asatellites 3asummer 3aChina1 aHan, Dong1 aTian, Qi1 aChen, Zhao-Yue1 aYe, Yun-Shao1 aLin, Qiao-Xuan1 aOu, Chun-Quan1 aLi, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4802-86890 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 8 p.11699-11706dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16539-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011600165520140400281592002801685650001901713650001701732650001101749650001701760650002601777650002101803650001101824650001101835650002501846650000901871650001401880650001501894650002301909650001601932650002401948650001901972650001501991650001502006650002102021700001902042700002102061700002002082700002202102700002302124700001902147773013002166856007402296852000902370655001202379IND60672364120221123044834.0191016e20190926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067236412DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111922412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLassalle, Guillaume 10aToward Quantifying Oil Contamination in Vegetated Areas Using Very High Spatial and Spectral Resolution Imagery  aRecent remote sensing studies have suggested exploiting vegetation optical properties for assessing oil contamination, especially total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in vegetated areas. Methods based on the tracking of alterations in leaf biochemistry have been proposed for detecting and quantifying TPH under controlled and field conditions. In this study, we expand their use to airborne imagery, in order to monitor oil contamination at a larger scale. Airborne hyperspectral images with very high spatial and spectral resolutions were acquired over an industrial site with oil-contamination (mud pits) and control sites both colonized by Rubus fruticosus L. The method of oil detection exploiting 14 vegetation indices succeeded in classifying the sites in the case of high TPH contamination (overall accuracy &ge; 91.8%). Two methods, based on either the PROSAIL (PROSPECT + SAIL) radiative transfer model or elastic net multiple regression, were also developed for quantifying TPH. Both methods were tested on reflectance measurements in the field, at leaf and canopy scales, and on the image, and achieved accurate predictions of TPH concentrations (RMSE &le; 3.28 g/kg&minus;1 and RPD &ge; 1.90). The methods were validated on additional sites and open up promising perspectives of operational application for oil and gas companies, with the emergence of new hyperspectral satellite sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRubus plicatus 3abiochemistry 3acanopy 3ahydrocarbons 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aindustrial sites 3aleaves 3amodels 3aoil and gas industry 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aprediction 3aradiative transfer 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3avegetation 3avegetation index1 aElger, Arnaud 1 aCredoz, Anthony 1 aHédacq, Rémy 1 aBertoni, Georges 1 aDubucq, Dominique 1 aFabre, Sophie 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Sept. 26, v. 11, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111922413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013000163300001800293520142200311592002801733650002501761650001701786650001901803650001401822650004301836650001101879650001301890650001501903650003301918650001201951650001301963650002501976650003502001650001602036650001102052650001302063700001602076700002102092773010502113856004802218852000902266655001202275IND4468363820221122225003.0120616e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446836382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-010-0404-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarena, A. S.10aOptimization of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Extraction of Xanthones from Mangosteen Pericarp by Response Surface Methodology  ap. 1181-1188.  aMangosteen fruit pericarp is one of the important sources of bioactive compound xanthone. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction was employed to extract xanthones from mangosteen fruit pericarp at three different levels of pressure (200–300 bar), temperature (40–60 °C) and solvent to material ratio (100–300 kg/kg). The optimal conditions for the total xanthone yield and the influence of parameters were determined by response surface methodology (RSM) using Box–Behnken design. In our study, the increase in total xanthone yield in SC-CO2 fluid extraction depends more on the solute’s vapor effect. From response surface plots, pressure, temperature and solvent to material ratio exhibited independent and interactive effects on the extraction of xanthones. A regression equation for predicting the total xanthone yield was derived by statistical analysis, and a model with predictive ability of 0.99 was obtained. Maximum xanthone yield of 8.01% was predicted by RSM at 60 °C, 300 bar and a solvent to material ratio of 300 kg/kg while experimentally a yield of 7.56% was achieved. HPLC analysis was carried out for the optimum conditions for the identification and quantification of the xanthones. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were investigated by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and the results showed that the extracts were enriched with antioxidant compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarbon dioxide 3aequations 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3apericarp 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolutes 3asolvents 3astatistical analysis 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atemperature 3avapors 3axanthone1 aManohar, B.1 aUdaya Sankar, K.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2012 May, v. 5, no. 4 p.1181-1188dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-010-0404-7  aDNAL 7aarticle01566naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245008700177300001500264500001400279520057200293592002800865650001200893650001100905650001400916650001600930651001300946653001500959653001100974653001000985653001600995700002001011773009401031856008201125852000901207655001201216IND60699118820221116230358.0210116e20181108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069911882DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.795.276192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReboleira, Ana Sofia P.S.10aFirst continental troglobiont Cylindroiulus millipede (Diplopoda, Julida, Julidae)  ap. 93-103.  aNAL-light  aThe new species of millipede Cylindroiulus villumi is described from a cave in the Estremenho karst massif in central Portugal.

The concentration of 20 allergenic fungal spore types was measured using a 7-day volumetric spore trap. The relationship between investigated fungal spore genera and selected meteorological parameters (maximum, minimum, mean and dew point temperatures, rainfall, relative humidity, air pressure, wind direction) was examined using an ordination method (redundancy analysis) to determine which environmental factors favoured their most abundance in the air and whether it would be possible to detect similarities between different genera in their distribution pattern. Redundancy analysis provided additional information about the biology of the studied fungi through the results of the Spearman’s rank correlation. Application of the variance inflation factor in canonical correspondence analysis indicated which explanatory variables were auto-correlated and needed to be excluded from further analyses. Obtained information will be consequently implemented in the selection of factors that will be a foundation for forecasting models for allergenic fungal spores in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aallergenicity 3aatmospheric pressure 3acorrespondence analysis 3adew 3aenvironmental factors 3afungal spores 3afungi 3amodels 3arain 3arelative humidity 3aspore traps 3asurveys 3atemperature 3avariance 3awind direction 3aEngland1 aStrzelczak, Agnieszka1 aGrinn-Gofroń, Agnieszka1 aKennedy, Roy0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2015 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.25-36dSpringer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-014-0818-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01866naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007900166300001600245500001400261520052700275592002800802650001500830650001500845650000900860650001600869650001300885650001400898650001700912650001100929650002600940650002200966650001500988650000701003650002201010650001601032650002101048650001001069653001801079653002101097700002001118700001901138773014801157856008201305852000901387655001201396IND60710230420221118081634.0200908s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071023042DNAL7 a10.6088/ijes.20120301310702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Rakesh10aBiosorption of heavy metal ions by using modified waste tree bark material  ap. 720-726.  aNAL-light  aDue to rapid industrialization and increased population it was found to increase the effluents and waste water into the aquatic system.

For the present study, global database data were used. The ability of the penalized regression (RR) approaches (including Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict EF indices in the G-20 countries over the past two decades (1999–2018) was illustrated and compared. For this purpose, 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the predictive performance and determine the penalty parameter for PR models. According to the results, the predictive performance compared to linear regression improved somewhat using the penalized methods. Using the elastic net model, more global macro indices were selected than Lasso. Although Lasso selected only a few indicators, it had better predictive performance among PR ns models. In addition to relative improvement in the predictive performance of PR methods, their interest in selecting a subset of indicators by shrinking coefficients and creating a parsimonious model was evident and significant. As a result, PR methods would be preferred, using variable selection and interpretive considerations to predictive performance alone. On the other hand, ANN models with higher determination coefficients (R²) and lower RMSE values performed significantly better than PR and OLS and showed that they were more accurate in predicting EF. Therefore, ANN could provide considerable and appropriate predictions for EF indicators in the G-20 countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adatabases 3aecological footprint 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3aneural networks 3apollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch1 aMofidi, Abbas0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 8 p.11736-11755dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16515-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245009900214300001600313506007600329520171500405592002802120506003702148650001702185650002302202650001002225650002502235650002002260650001002280650002202290650001302312650001902325650000902344650001102353650002002364650000902384700002502393773009602418856008302514852000902597655001202606IND60633581220221207090254.0190502e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063358122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.0152doi7 aPMC64329482pmcid7 a309015382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSullivan, Patrick F.10aDefining the Genetic, Genomic, Cellular, and Diagnostic Architectures of Psychiatric Disorders  ap. 162-183.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStudies of the genetics of psychiatric disorders have become one of the most exciting and fast-moving areas in human genetics. A decade ago, there were few reproducible findings, and now there are hundreds. In this review, we focus on the findings that have illuminated the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders and the challenges of using these findings to inform our understanding of pathophysiology. The evidence is now overwhelming that psychiatric disorders are “polygenic”—that many genetic loci contribute to risk. With the exception of a subset of those with ASD, few individuals with a psychiatric disorder have a single, deterministic genetic cause; rather, developing a psychiatric disorder is influenced by hundreds of different genetic variants, consistent with a polygenic model. As progressively larger studies have uncovered more about their genetic architecture, the need to elucidate additional architectures has become clear. Even if we were to have complete knowledge of the genetic architecture of a psychiatric disorder, full understanding requires deep knowledge of the functional genomic architecture—the implicated loci impact regulatory processes that influence gene expression and the functional coordination of genes that control biological processes. Following from this is cellular architecture: of all brain regions, cell types, and developmental stages, where and when are the functional architectures operative? Given that the genetic architectures of different psychiatric disorders often strongly overlap, we are challenged to re-evaluate and refine the diagnostic architectures of psychiatric disorders using fundamental genetic and neurobiological data.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarchitecture 3abehavior disorders 3abrain 3adevelopmental stages 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahuman genetics 3aloci 3amodels 3apathophysiology 3arisk1 aGeschwind, Daniel H.0 tCell.g2019 Mar. 21, v. 177, no. 1 p.162-183dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011400165300001600279500001400295520097800309592002801287650001701315650001601332650001301348650001901361650001301380650000701393650001901400650001901419650001301438650001501451650002101466650002601487650001501513650001001528653002401538653001201562653001601574700001301590700001701603773014801620856008201768852000901850655001201859IND60710230720221118081023.0200908s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071023072DNAL7 a10.6088/ijes.20120301320012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Anoop10aPhotocatalytic degradability of insecticide Chlorpyrifos over UV irradiated Titanium dioxide in aqueous phase  ap. 743-755.  aNAL-light  aPhotocatalytic degradation of Chlorpyrifos in aqueous phase by using photocatalyst TiO₂ in the presence of artificial UV-light and sunlight was reported.

The effect of catalyst loading, pH, addition of oxidant on the reaction rate was ascertained and optimum conditions for maximum degradation were determined. In this case catalyst concentration was optimized at 4.0 gL⁻¹, pH 6.5 and oxidant concentration at 3.0 gL⁻¹, where 90% degradation of the insecticide was observed. Treatment under natural solar conditions showed better results as compared with UV treatment. The effect of sonication on the catalyst slurry was also studied for the better dispersion of the catalyst.

We also examined the characteristics of SGS and EGS timing in deciduous broadleaf and needleleaf forests along vertical and horizontal gradients and then evaluated the relationship between their timing and daily mean air temperature. We found that for the timing of SGS and EGS, changes along the vertical gradient in deciduous broadleaf forest tended to be larger than those in deciduous needleleaf forest. For both forest types, changes along the vertical and horizontal gradients in the timing of EGS tended to be smaller than those of SGS. Finally, in both forest types, the sensitivity of the timing of EGS to air temperature was much less than that of SGS. These results suggest that the spatio-temporal variability in the timing of SGS and EGS detected by satellite data, which may be correlated with leaf traits, photosynthetic capacity, and environment conditions, provide useful ground-truthing information along vertical and horizontal gradients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aforest types 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aJapan1 aSaitoh, Taku M.1 aNasahara, Kenlo Nishida1 aSuzuki, Rikie0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2015 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.47-54dSpringer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-014-0822-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245020600212300002000418520178600438592002802224650003002252650002502282650001502307650001302322650001102335650002802346650002002374650002302394650001402417650001302431650002002444650002502464650001602489651001202505700002102517700002002538700002402558773015402582856008302736852000902819655001202828IND60765615120221119105218.0220130e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076561512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16046-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEL Mourabit, Youssef1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9504-061910aAssessment of the marine ecotoxic state in the Moroccan coastal area Anza-Taghazout following the installation of two wastewater treatment plants: a multibiomarker study using Mytilus galloprovincialis  ap. 11718-11729.  aThe aim of the present study is the first to evaluate the ecotoxic state of the marine environment in Anza-Taghazout coasts (Morocco) after installation of two wastewater treatment plants using a natural population of marine bivalves Mytilus galloprovincialis. These coasts are exposed to many discharges generating, thus, different sources of pollutants. These pollutants can modulate the physiological responses of marine bivalves to environmental stress. In this context, a multibiomarker approach consisting of a battery of biomarker evaluation was used to assess the response of these species to stress. In the whole soft tissues of M. galloprovincialis, four biomarkers were evaluated as follows: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (Cat), and malondialdehyde activity (MDA). In parallel, physico-chemical parameters were measured in the marine water of Anza-Taghazout within three selected sites: S₁ considered as “hotspot” located at Anza city; S₂ located near of Aourir city; and the third site, S₃ “reference” located in Imouran beach. Our results showed that activities of both glutathione S-transferase and catalase were higher in M. galloprovincialis collected from site S₁, but high values of malondialdehyde and acetylcholinesterase activities were observed successively at S₃ and S₂. Application of integrated biomarker response (IBR) index was suitable for classifying the stress response in the M. galloprovincialis but did not allow to evaluate the level of the xenobiotic exposure in the studied sites. The statistical results did not show any significant differences between the three studied sites, and therefore, S₁ has recently become clean due to the installation of two wastewater treatment plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3acoasts 3aglutathione transferase 3amalondialdehyde 3amarine environment 3apollution 3aresearch 3astress response 3awastewater treatment 3axenobiotics 3aMorocco1 aAgnaou, Mustapha1 aAit Alla, Aicha1 aMoukrim, Abdellatif0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 8 p.11718-11729dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16046-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015900158520203700317592002802354650002802382650002202410650001202432650002002444650001902464650002002483650001902503700001702522700002002539700001902559700001302578700001802591700001902609700002002628700002102648700001802669773013002687856007402817852000902891655001202900IND60672364420221123044758.0191016e20190926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067236442DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111922432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Weiquan 10aAE-GAN-Net: Learning Invariant Feature Descriptor to Match Ground Camera Images and a Large-Scale 3D Image-Based Point Cloud for Outdoor Augmented Reality  aEstablishing the spatial relationship between 2D images captured by real cameras and 3D models of the environment (2D and 3D space) is one way to achieve the virtual&ndash;real registration for Augmented Reality (AR) in outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose to match the 2D images captured by real cameras and the rendered images from the 3D image-based point cloud to indirectly establish the spatial relationship between 2D and 3D space. We call these two kinds of images as cross-domain images, because their imaging mechanisms and nature are quite different. However, unlike real camera images, the rendered images from the 3D image-based point cloud are inevitably contaminated with image distortion, blurred resolution, and obstructions, which makes image matching with the handcrafted descriptors or existing feature learning neural networks very challenging. Thus, we first propose a novel end-to-end network, AE-GAN-Net, consisting of two AutoEncoders (AEs) with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) embedding, to learn invariant feature descriptors for cross-domain image matching. Second, a domain-consistent loss function, which balances image content and consistency of feature descriptors for cross-domain image pairs, is introduced to optimize AE-GAN-Net. AE-GAN-Net effectively captures domain-specific information, which is embedded into the learned feature descriptors, thus making the learned feature descriptors robust against image distortion, variations in viewpoints, spatial resolutions, rotation, and scaling. Experimental results show that AE-GAN-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance for image patch retrieval with the cross-domain image patch dataset, which is built from real camera images and the rendered images from 3D image-based point cloud. Finally, by evaluating virtual&ndash;real registration for AR on a campus by using the cross-domain image matching results, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed virtual&ndash;real registration to AR in outdoor environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aaugmented reality 3acameras 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing1 aWang, Cheng 1 aBian, Xuesheng 1 aChen, Shuting 1 aLi, Wei 1 aLin, Xiuhong 1 aLi, Yongchuan 1 aWeng, Dongdong 1 aLai, Shang-Hong 1 aLi, Jonathan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Sept. 26, v. 11, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111922433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011700156300001600273520161200289592002801901650001201929650001201941650001201953650002101965650002401986650002302010650001202033650001202045650001402057650001102071650001702082650002002099650001502119650002402134650001402158653001702172653003702189653003602226653002202262700001602284700002002300700001402320700001602334773010702350856007402457852000902531655001202540IND60543973020221122042652.0190415e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054397302DNAL7 a10.1093/mp/sst1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Liming12aA Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase Interacts with and Activates A Calcium Channel to Regulate Pollen Tube Growth  ap. 369-376.  aCalcium, as a ubiquitous second messenger, plays essential roles in tip-growing cells, such as animal neurons, plant pollen tubes, and root hairs. However, little is known concerning the regulatory mechanisms that code and decode Ca2+ signals in plants. The evidence presented here indicates that a calcium-dependent protein kinase, CPK32, controls polar growth of pollen tubes. Overexpression of CPK32 disrupted the polar growth along with excessive Ca2+ accumulation in the tip. A search of downstream effector molecules for CPK32 led to identification of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, CNGC18, as an interacting partner for CPK32. Co-expression of CPK32 and CNGC18 resulted in activation of CNGC18 in Xenopus oocytes where expression of CNGC18 alone did not exhibit significant calcium channel activity. Overexpression of CNGC18 produced a growth arrest phenotype coupled with accumulation of calcium in the tip, similar to that induced by CPK32 overexpression. Co-expression of CPK32 and CNGC18 had a synergistic effect leading to more severe depolarization of pollen tube growth. These results provide a potential feed-forward mechanism in which calcium-activated CPK32 activates CNGC18, further promoting calcium entry during the elevation phase of Ca2+ oscillations in the polar growth of pollen tubes.This study identified a molecular link between calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK32) and Ca2+-permeable channel (CNGC18) in control of pollen tube tip growth, implicating a feed-forward mechanism in the formation of the tip-focused Ca2+ gradient through the CPK32–CNGC18 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus 3aanimals 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3agene overexpression 3alinkage (genetics) 3aneurons 3aoocytes 3aphenotype 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3aprotein kinases 3aroot hairs 3asignal transduction 3asynergism 0apollen tubes 0acalcium-dependent protein kinase 0acyclic nucleotide-gated channel 0aCa2+ oscillations1 aLan, Wenzhi1 aJiang, Yuanqing1 aFang, Wei1 aLuan, Sheng0 tMolecular plant.g2014 Feb., v. 7, no. 2 p.369-376dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mp/sst1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006400166300001600230520100900246592002801255650002301283650002601306650001401332650002201346650002201368650001901390650001101409650000901420650001701429650001401446700002101460700002201481700001901503700002001522700002001542700002701562700002101589700001801610700002901628700002701657700002201684700002101706700001801727700002001745700002101765773009601786856008301882852000901965655001201974IND60633581420221122161142.0190502e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063358142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProhaska, Ana10aHuman Disease Variation in the Light of Population Genomics  ap. 115-131.  aIdentifying the causes of similarities and differences in genetic disease prevalence among humans is central to understanding disease etiology. While present-day humans are not strongly differentiated, vast amounts of genomic data now make it possible to study subtle patterns of genetic variation. This allows us to trace our genomic history thousands of years into the past and its implications for the distribution of disease-associated variants today. Genomic analyses have shown that demographic processes shaped the distribution and frequency of disease-associated variants over time. Furthermore, local adaptation to new environmental conditions—including pathogens—has generated strong patterns of differentiation at particular loci. Researchers are also beginning to uncover the genetic architecture of complex diseases, affected by many variants of small effect. The field of population genomics thus holds great potential for providing further insights into the evolution of human disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease prevalence 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3agenetic disorders 3agenetic variation 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aloci 3ametagenomics 3apathogens1 aRacimo, Fernando1 aSchork, Andrew J.1 aSikora, Martin1 aStern, Aaron J.1 aIlardo, Melissa1 aAllentoft, Morten Erik1 aFolkersen, Lasse1 aBuil, Alfonso1 aMoreno-Mayar, J.

In recent years, to mitigate this the design and construction of new buildings has emphasized &ldquo;smart&rdquo; methods and materials for individual buildings rather than landscape-level planning and evaluation of new developments. Remote Sensing potentially offers a cost-effective means to monitor effectiveness of landscape-level urban design and guide developers to improve thermal regimes. This paper focuses on satellite monitoring of thermal variation in the area of London most affected by construction in 2010&ndash;2015. Split-window Land Surface Temperature (LST) models were applied to ASTER and Landsat 8 satellite imagery, requiring separate investigation of thermal trends due to temporal inconsistency. Getis-Ord-Gi* cluster analysis of the ASTER image identified three main thermal hot spots: Eastern, Stratford railway/underground station, and Stratford High Street. It is assumed that increased thermal stress within these areas is mainly from anthropogenic heat. However, local thermal variations for Eastern Olympic Village are attributed to changing meteorological conditions, facade materials, canyon morphology and orientation, or insufficient shading and ventilation. Future development of a new cultural hub at this location will significantly affect distribution of green spaces and influence their cooling ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aLandsat 3abuildings 3aclimate change 3acluster analysis 3acooling 3acost effectiveness 3agreen infrastructure 3aheat 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3amonitoring 3arailroads 3aremote sensing 3ashade 3asurface temperature 3athermal stress 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3avillages1 aWilliams, Meredith 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Sept. 26, v. 11, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111922443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04228naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001900162245015300181300001800334520159000352592002801942650002201970650001801992650005002010650002702060650002902087650001602116650002602132650002302158650003002181650001702211650001702228650001702245650001002262650001102272650001402283650001102297650001702308650001102325650001602336650001202352650002002364650001902384650003002403650003702433650006702470650001502537650005802552650006402610650003202674650005802706650002402764650001302788650006802801650006202869650002902931650005602960650003103016650008003047700001803127700003003145700002603175700002403201700003003225773013703255852000903392856008103401655001203482IND4462427120221120155029.0160905e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446242712DNAL7 a220669022pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-06-11-01622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeriouh, Houda14aThe Iturin-like Lipopeptides Are Essential Components in the Biological Control Arsenal of Bacillus subtilis Against Bacterial Diseases of Cucurbits  ap. 1540-1552.  aThe antibacterial potential of four strains of Bacillus subtilis, UMAF6614, UMAF6619, UMAF6639, and UMAF8561, previously selected on the basis of their antifungal activity and efficacy against cucurbit powdery mildew, was examined. Among these strains, UMAF6614 and UMAF6639 showed the highest antibacterial activity in vitro, especially against Xanthomonas campestris pv. cucurbitae and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. These strains produced the three families of lipopeptide antibiotics known in Bacillus spp.: surfactins, iturins, and fengycins. Using thin-layer chromatography analysis and direct bioautography, the antibacterial activity could be associated with iturin lipopeptides. This result was confirmed by mutagenesis analysis using lipopeptide-defective mutants. The antibacterial activity was practically abolished in iturin-deficient mutants, whereas the fengycin mutants retained certain inhibitory capabilities. Analyses by fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy revealed the cytotoxic effect of these compounds at the bacterial plasma membrane level. Finally, biological control assays on detached melon leaves demonstrated the ability of UMAF6614 and UMAF6639 to suppress bacterial leaf spot and soft rot; accordingly, the biocontrol activity was practically abolished in mutants deficient in iturin biosynthesis. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of these B. subtilis strains as biocontrol agents against fungal and bacterial diseases of cucurbits and the versatility of iturins as antifungal and antibacterial compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCucurbitaceae 3aPectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum 3aXanthomonas cucurbitae 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aantifungal properties 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abiosynthesis 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3afungi 3aiturin 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3alipopeptides 3amelons 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aplasma membrane 3apowdery mildew 3athin layer chromatography 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aAntibiosis 2aBacillus subtilisxchemistryxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCucurbitaceaexmicrobiology 2aLipopeptidesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMutation 2aPectobacterium carotovorumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPeptides, Cyclicxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aXanthomonas campestrisxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure.1 aRomero, Diego1 aGarcía-Gutiérrez, Laura1 aCazorla, Francisco M.1 ade Vicente, Antonio1 aPérez-García, Alejandro0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Dec., v. 24, no. 12 p.1540-1552dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-06-11-01623Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03271naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245018100168300001800349520179200367592002802159650001502187650001902202650001602221650001002237650001102247650002102258650002402279650001902303650001302322650001902335650002002354650001902374653002602393653002302419653002302442653004002465653002402505700001902529700006102548700001902609773009202628856008402720852000902804655001202813IND60542036520221120094720.0161020e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054203652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2015.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoša, Mihalj10aMicellization parameters (number average, aggregation number and critical micellar concentration) of bile salt 3 and 7 ethylidene derivatives: Role of the steroidal skeleton II  ap. 1345-1353.  aBile salts are steroidal biosurfactants. Micellar systems of bile salts are not only important for solubilization of cholesterol, but they also interact with certain drugs thus changing their bioavailability.The number-average aggregation numbers (n¯) are determined using the Moroi–Matsuoka–Sugioka thermodynamic method. Critical micellar concentrations were determined by spectrofluorometric method using pyren and by surface tension measurements.Micelles of ethylidene derivatives possess the following values for n¯: 7-Eth-D (n¯=11 (50mM)–n¯=14.8 (100mM)); 12-Ox-7-Eth-L (n¯≈8.8, without concentration dependence) and 7,12-diOx-3-Eth-Ch (n¯≈2.9, without concentration dependence). In the planes n¯–ln k and ln CMC–ln k derivative 7-Eth-D is outlier in respect to hydrophobic linear congeneric groups.Gibbs energy of formation for 7-Eth-D anion micelles in addition to the Gibbs energy of hydrophobic interactions consists excess Gibbs energy (GE) from hydrogen bond formation between building blocks of micelles. Gibbs energy of formation for 7,12-diOx-3-Eth-Ch and 12-Ox-7-Eth-L anion micelle is determined by the Gibbs energy of hydrophobic interactions. Relative increase in hydrophobicity and aggregation number for ethylidene derivatives is larger when ethylidene group is introduced from the C7 lateral side of steroidal skeleton then it is when ethylidene group is on C3 carbon.Position of outlier towards hydrophobic congeneric groups from n¯–ln k and ln CMC–ln k planes indicates the existence of excess Gibbs energy (GE) which is not of hydrophobic nature (formation of hydrogen bonds). For the bile salt micelles to have GE (formation of secondary micelles) it is necessary that steroidal skeleton possesses C3-α-(e)-OH and C12-α-(a)-OH groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile salts 3abiosurfactants 3acholesterol 3adrugs 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3asolubilization 3asurface tension 3athermodynamics 0aMicelle of bile salts 0aAggregation number 0aSteroidal skeleton 0aHydrophobic linear congeneric group 0aExcess Gibbs energy1 aBjedov, Srđan1 aŠkorić, Dušan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3683-02551 aSakač, Marija0 tBBA - General Subjects.g2015 July, v. 1850 p.1345-1353dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2015.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001700188245009900205300001200304506007600316520185200392592002802244506003702272650002002309650002002329650001302349650001702362650001002379650001002389650002602399650001302425650002002438650002802458650001802486650001102504650001402515650001402529650003002543650004502573650001802618650002202636650003102658651001002689700002302699700001802722700002102740700001802761700001802779700001602797700001602813773011302829856008202942852000903024655001203033IND60603144820221207123413.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060314482DNAL7 a299969032pmid7 aPMC60423802pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-018-2981-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaguib, Doaa10aMolecular characterization of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis in children in Egypt  ap. 403.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis into humans varies according to species/genotypes of the pathogens. Although infections with both parasites are recorded in Egypt, few data are available on the distribution of Cryptosporidium species and G. duodenalis genotypes. The present study assessed the occurrence and genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis in Egyptian children. METHODS: In the present study, 585 fecal specimens were collected from children eight years old and younger in three provinces (El-Dakahlia, El-Gharbia and Damietta) during March 2015 to April 2016. PCR-RFLP analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene and sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein gene were used to detect and subtype Cryptosporidium spp., respectively, whereas PCR and sequence analyses of the triose phosphate isomerase, glutamate dehydrogenase and β-giardin genes were used to detect and genotype Giardia duodenalis. RESULTS: The overall infection rates of Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis were 1.4% and 11.3%, respectively. The Cryptosporidium species identified included C. hominis and C. parvum, each with three subtype families. The C. hominis subtypes were IbA6G3 (n = 2), IdA17 (n = 1), IdA24 (n = 1) and IfA14G1R5 (n = 1), while C. parvum subtypes were IIdA20G1 (n = 1), IIaA15G2R1 (n = 1), and IIcA5G3a (n = 1). The G. duodenalis identified included both assemblages A (n = 31) and B (n = 34). All G. duodenalis assemblage A belonged to the anthroponotic sub-assemblage AII, while a high genetic heterogeneity was seen within assemblage B. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study are useful in our understanding of the genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis in Egypt and the potential importance of anthroponotic transmission in the epidemiology of both pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCryptosporidium 3aGiardia lamblia 3achildren 3aepidemiology 3afeces 3agenes 3agenetic heterogeneity 3agenotype 3agiardin protein 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3atriose-phosphate isomerase 3aEgypt1 aEl-Gohary, Adel H.1 aRoellig, Dawn1 aMohamed, Amro A.1 aArafat, Nagah1 aWang, Yuanfei1 aFeng, Yaoyu1 aXiao, Lihua0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.403-403dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2981-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011400157300001600271520154900287592002801836650001601864650001501880650001401895650001101909650000901920650001201929650001301941650001601954650002101970650001901991650002402010650001802034650002002052650002902072650002602101653001602127653000802143653000702151653001902158653000702177653001602184700001702200700001802217700002202235700001702257700001902274773010702293856007402400852000902474655001202483IND60543973120221122042725.0190415e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054397312DNAL7 a10.1093/mp/sst1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Jae Yong14aThe Arabidopsis Floral Repressor BFT Delays Flowering by Competing with FT for FD Binding under High Salinity  ap. 377-387.  aSoil salinity is one of the most serious agricultural problems that significantly reduce crop yields in the arid and semi-arid regions. It influences various phases of plant growth and developmental processes, such as seed germination, leaf and stem growth, and reproductive propagation. Salt stress delays the onset of flowering in many plant species. We have previously reported that the Arabidopsis BROTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (BFT) acts as a floral repressor under salt stress. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the BFT function in the salt regulation of flowering induction is unknown. In this work, we found that BFT delays flowering under high salinity by competing with FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) for binding to the FD transcription factor. The flowering time of FD-deficient fd-2 mutant was insensitive to high salinity. BFT interacts with FD in the nucleus via the C-terminal domain of FD, which is also required for the interaction of FD with FT, and interferes with the FT–FD interaction. These observations indicate that BFT constitutes a distinct salt stress signaling pathway that modulates the function of the FT–FD module and possibly provides an adaptation strategy that fine-tunes photoperiodic flowering under high salinity.Under high salinity, the floral repressor BFT competes with FT for FD binding and thus interferes with the FT–FD function, resulting in delayed flowering. The BFT-mediated salt stress signaling scheme provides an adaptation strategy by fine-tuning photoperiodic flowering under high salinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acrop yield 3aflowering 3aleaves 3aloci 3amutants 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseed germination 3asemiarid zones 3asignal transduction 3asoil salinity 3astem elongation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aArabidopsis 0aBFT 0aFD 0aflowering time 0aFT 0asalt stress1 aLee, Hyo-Jun1 aSeo, Pil Joon1 aChŏng, Chae-hun,1 aAhn, Ji Hoon1 aPark, Chung-Mo0 tMolecular plant.g2014 Feb., v. 7, no. 2 p.377-387dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mp/sst1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245017200189300001400361520156500375592002801940650002101968650002201989650001502011650001002026650001602036650001302052650001402065650001402079650001602093700001902109700002702128700002302155773011202178856008102290852000902371655001202380IND60119667120221120033138.0141222e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011966712DNAL7 a247482342pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-014-0826-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinkalu, Victor O.10aAmeliorative effects of melatonin administration and photoperiods on diurnal fluctuations in cloacal temperature of Marshall broiler chickens during the hot dry season  ap. 79-87.  aExperiments were performed with the aim of determining the effect of melatonin administration on diurnal fluctuations in cloacal temperature (CT) of Marshall broiler chickens during the hot dry season. Birds in group I (12L:12D cycle) were raised under natural photoperiod of 12-h light and 12-h darkness, without melatonin supplementation, while those in group II (LL) were kept under 24-h continuous lighting, without melatonin administration. Broiler chickens in group III (LL + melatonin) were raised under 24-h continuous lighting, with melatonin supplementation at 0.5 mg/kg per os. The cloacal temperatures of 15 labeled broiler chickens from each group were measured at 6:00, 13:00, and 19:00 h, 7 days apart, from days 14–42. Temperature-humidity index was highest at day 14 of the study, with the value of 36.72 ± 0.82 °C but lowest at day 28 with the value of 30.91 ± 0.80 °C (P < 0.0001). The overall mean hourly cloacal temperature value of 41.51 ± 0.03 °C obtained in the 12L:12D cycle birds was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the value of 41.16 ± 0.03 °C recorded in the melatonin-treated group but lower than that of 41.65 ± 0.03 °C obtained in the LL birds. Mortality due to hyperthermia commenced at day 28 in both 12L:12D cycle and LL broiler chickens but was delayed till day 42 in LL + MEL broiler chickens. In conclusion, melatonin administration alleviated the deleterious effects of heat stress on broiler chickens by maintaining their cloacal temperature at relatively low values.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3adiurnal variation 3adry season 3afever 3aheat stress 3alighting 3amelatonin 3amortality 3aphotoperiod1 aAyo, Joseph O.1 aAdelaiye, Alexander B.1 aHambolu, Joseph O.0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2015 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.79-87dSpringer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-014-0826-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01153naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007600170300001400246500001400260520033600274592002800610650001800638650003200656650001400688773009400702856008200796852000900878655001200887IND60699119320221116230450.0210116e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069911932DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.796.207612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenard, Katrina L.10aCatching the bug: the influence of Thomas Henry on a young entomologist  ap. 29-31.  aNAL-light  aWhen I was asked to write an appreciation of Tom Henry, I was a little bit overwhelmed.

Small academic institutions with limited resources find it virtually impossible to build and maintain typical rodent facilities for research. Zebrafish research has been demonstrated to be a valuable alternative for in vivo research in pharmacology, physiology, development and genetic studies. This article demonstrates that a functional zebrafish facility can be built in an easy and affordable manner. We demonstrate that such a facility could be built in about one working day with minimal tools and expertise. The cost of the 27 1.8 L fish tank zebrafish facility constructed in this study was approximately $1,500. We estimate that the maintenance of an initial working 150 fish colony for 3 months is $1,000. This project involved students, who were introduced to aquaculturing of zebrafish for research proposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3abiomedical research 3aeducational institutions 3afish 3apharmacology 3aphysiology 3arodents 3astudents1 aHill, Bailey1 aCanterbury, Joseph1 aSweitzer, Sarah1 aRomero-Sandoval, E.

The problem of predicting protein-binding sites in RNA has received much less attention than the problem of predicting RNA-binding sites in protein. The data presented in this paper are related to the article entitled “PRIdictor: Protein-RNA Interaction predictor” (Tuvshinjargal et al. 2016) [1]. PRIdictor can predict protein-binding sites in RNA as well as RNA-binding sites in protein at the nucleotide- and residue-levels. This paper presents four datasets that were used to test four prediction models of PRIdictor: (1) model RP for predicting protein-binding sites in RNA from protein and RNA sequences, (2) model RaP for predicting protein-binding sites in RNA from RNA sequence alone, (3) model PR for predicting RNA-binding sites in protein from protein and RNA sequences, and (4) model PaR for predicting RNA-binding sites in protein from protein sequence alone. The datasets supplied in this article can be used as a valuable resource to evaluate and compare different methods for predicting protein-RNA binding sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aamino acid sequences 3adata collection 3anucleotide sequences 3aprediction 3aprotein binding 0aProtein-RNA interactions 0aBinding sites1 aPark, Byungkyu1 aChoi, Daesik1 aHan, Kyungsook0 tData in Brief.g2017 Feb., v. 10 p.561-563dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2016.12.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010000160300001800260520120600278592002801484650001201512650001701524650002101541650001501562650000901577650001301586650001101599700002001610773009901630856007501729852000901804655001201813IND60577057720221117103801.0170806e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057705772DNAL7 a10.1021/la50093472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasuya, Motohiro10aCharacterization of Ferrocene-Modified Electrode Using Electrochemical Surface Forces Apparatus  ap. 7093-7097.  aA electrochemical surface forces apparatus (EC-SFA) was employed to measure the interactions between gold electrodes modified with self-assembled monolayers of ferrocene alkyl thiol (Fc-SAM) and oxidized ferrocene (ferrocenium cation, Fc⁺-SAM) in a 1 mM aqueous electrolyte. The double-layer repulsion in both cases of the Fc-SAM and Fc⁺-SAM electrodes was observed. The surface charge density (σ) evaluated from the double-layer repulsions between the Fc⁺-SAM electrodes in 1 mM aqueous KClO₄ was 0.0027 C/m², which was 2.5 times greater than that of the Fc-SAM, at 0.0011 C/m². The σ values of the Fc⁺-SAM were evaluated for various counteranions using the same method, which were 0.0048, 0.0040, and 0.0104 C/m² for NO₃–, SO₄²–, and CF₃SO₃–, respectively. The degrees of dissociation (αd) between the ferrocenium cation and these counteranions were obtained from σ and the density of the ferrocenium on the electrode. The αd value of CF₃SO₃–, 4.1%, was the highest, followed in the order, SO₄²– > NO₃– > ClO₄–, indicating that most of the positive charges of the ferrocenium cation were compensated by formation of an ion pair with counteranions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3adissociation 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3anitrates 3athiols1 aKurihara, Kazue0 tLangmuir.g2014 June 24, v. 30, no. 24 p.7093-7097dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla50093473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015400165300001600319506010400335506007600439520126100515592002801776506003701804650001301841650001101854650000901865650002501874650002101899653002501920653001801945653002501963653002401988653001802012700001802030700001702048700001502065700001702080700001902097773009802116856008502214852000902299655001202308IND60776671420221207124644.0220929e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077667142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoinig, G.10aInfluence of reflective materials, emitter intensity and foil thickness on the variability of near-infrared spectra of 2D plastic packaging materials  ap. 543-551.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMost two-dimensional plastic packaging materials are thermally recovered, which does not add to the recycling quota of 50 % required by EU legislation for all lightweight packaging until 2025. Furthermore, the separation processes for 2D materials cannot reach the same level of accuracy, which is possible in the sorting of rigid plastic packaging. This study proposes new adaptations to existing sorting aggregates to increase the near-infrared spectral quality of two-dimensional materials. It aims to improve the spectral quality, which was defined by the deviation of the spectra from a reference spectrum and the variability of the recorded spectra, which can be achieved by installing reflectors behind the material made up of copper or aluminium. This setup enables detection in transflection rather than reflection mode. The variability could be reduced by a factor of 6 through the use of a reflective background. Meanwhile, the spectral fidelity to the reference spectrum could be enhanced, in some cases decreasing the deviation from the reference spectrum by 30 %, which means enhancing a spectrum from unrecognisable to useable. Apart from using reflective materials, the effects of emitter intensity, material and thickness were evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaluminum 3acopper 3afoil 3alaws and regulations 3awaste management 0a2D plastic packaging 0aNear-infrared 0aSensor-based sorting 0aBackground material 0aTransflection1 aFriedrich, K.1 aRutrecht, B.1 aOreski, G.1 aBarretta, C.1 aVollprecht, D.0 tWaste management.g2022 May 01, v. 144 p.543-551dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245005900212300001400271506007600285520099000361592002801351506003701379650002301416650001901439650001101458650001301469650001501482650001501497650001901512650001901531650001101550650001501561650002201576700002401598700001901622700001701641773009401658856008301752852000901835655001201844IND60633581920221207080925.0190502e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063358192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.0322doi7 aPMC65320682pmcid7 a309015502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLappalainen, Tuuli10aGenomic Analysis in the Age of Human Genome Sequencing  ap. 70-84.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAffordable genome sequencing technologies promise to revolutionize the field of human genetics by enabling comprehensive studies that interrogate all classes of genome variation, genome-wide, across the entire allele frequency spectrum. Ongoing projects worldwide are sequencing many thousands—and soon millions—of human genomes as part of various gene mapping studies, biobanking efforts, and clinical programs. However, while genome sequencing data production has become routine, genome analysis and interpretation remain challenging endeavors with many limitations and caveats. Here, we review the current state of technologies for genetic variant discovery, genotyping, and functional interpretation and discuss the prospects for future advances. We focus on germline variants discovered by whole-genome sequencing, genome-wide functional genomic approaches for predicting and measuring variant functional effects, and implications for studies of common and rare human disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromosome mapping 3agene frequency 3agenome 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3agerm cells 3ahuman diseases 3ahuman genetics 3ahumans 3aprediction 3asequence analysis1 aScott, Alexandra J.1 aBrandt, Margot1 aHall, Ira M.0 tCell.g2019 Mar. 21, v. 177, no. 1 p.70-84dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013000172300001600302500001400318520171000332592002802042650002202070650001502092650001602107650002302123650002602146650001402172650001502186650001802201650001402219650001302233650000902246650001802255650000902273650001502282650002302297650001302320650001202333650001602345653001902361653003602380653004202416700001602458700002302474700001902497773014802516856008202664852000902746655001202755IND60710231720221118080949.0200908s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071023172DNAL7 a10.6088/ijes.20120301320112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, R.q(Rachna),10aIsolation and characterization of monocrotophos degrading activity of soil fungal isolate Aspergillus NigerMCP1 (ITCC7782.10)  ap. 841-850.  aNAL-light  aMonocrotophos (MCP) is both a systemic and control pesticide useful for the protection of various cash crops. The use of pesticide degrading microbial system for the removal of pesticide residue and other products from contaminated systems requires an understanding of the growth requirements of degrading organisms. Monocrotophos (MCP) degrading fungal strain was isolated from soil by enrichment culture. The fungal strain was identified by colony morphology, staining and 18S rDNA analysis as Aspergillus niger (MCP1) (ITCC 7782.10) GenBank accession no JQ660373. Monocrotophos degrading ability of the MCP 1 was characterized as assessment of two parameters i.e growth kinetics of fungal strains in the presence of monocrotophos by dry mass estimation method and degradation kinetics of monocrotophos by spectrophotometric method of estimation at 254nm. Growth kinetics revealed that monocrotophos had induced the growth of MCP 1 to approximately 2 folds. Culture conditions for the growth of MCP 1 were optimized by growing it under different physical and chemical parameters. Optimum conditions for growth were found to be pH-8, Temperature 25–30°C and monocrotophos concentration 150 mg L⁻¹. Aspergillus niger is capable of degrading 90% monocrotophos under optimized conditions in 10 days. Degradation kinetics of monocrotophos followed straight line equation and half life was thus calculated. Constant of degradation Kdeg was 0.009212 and the half life of monocrotophos was 75.87 hrs. In our study it is the first report showing the potential of Aspergillus niger as a potential degrader of monocrotophos and can be used as a candidate for removal of monocrotophos from agricultural sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3acash crops 3adegradation 3aenrichment culture 3aenvironmental science 3aequations 3aestimation 3agrowth models 3ahalf life 3akinetics 3amass 3amonocrotophos 3asoil 3asoil fungi 3aspectrophotometers 3astaining 3astrains 3atemperature 0aBiodegradation 0aAspergillus niger (ITCC 7782.10 0aNCBI GenBank Accession No. JQ 660373)1 aGarg, Veena1 aSingh, Karn Pratap1 aGupta, Sheetal0 tInternational journal of environmental sciences.g2012, v. 3, no. 2 p.841-850dIntegrated Publishing AssociationwJournal:6151x0976-44027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.6088/ijes.20120301320113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245014300176300001800319520158200337592002801919650001301947650002201960650001701982650001101999650001302010650001502023650000902038650002502047700001902072700002202091700001602113700002902129700001902158773012002177856005502297852000902352655001202361IND4510618420221123043120.0150730e20011015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451061842DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02460.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrunat, SÃ©verine10aHomocysteineâinduced decrease in endothelinâ1 production is initiated at the extracellular level and involves oxidative products  ap. 5287-5294.  aThe increased cardiovascular risk associated with hyperhomocysteinemia has been partly related to homocysteine (Hcy)âinduced endothelial cell dysfunction. However, the intra or extracellular starting point of the interaction between Hcy and endothelial cells, leading to cellular dysfunction, has not yet been identified. We investigated the effects of both intracellular and extracellular Hcy accumulation on endothelinâ1 (ETâ1) synthesis by cultured human endothelial cells. Incubation of cultures with methionine (1.0âmmolÂ·Lâ1) for 2âh induced a slight increase in cellular Hcy content but no change in ETâ1 production. Incubation of cells with Hcy (0.2âmmolÂ·Lâ1) led to a significant fall in ETâ1 generation, accompanied by a significant increase in cellular Hcy content. Addition of the aminoâacid transport system L substrate 2âaminoâ2ânorbornane carboxylic acid had no effect on the Hcyâinduced decrease in ETâ1 production but significantly inhibited the Hcyâinduced increase in the cellular Hcy content. Incubation of cells with a lower Hcy concentration (0.05âmmolÂ·Lâ1) also reduced ETâ1 production without increasing the cellular Hcy content. Coâincubation with extracellular freeâradical inhibitors (superoxide dismutase, catalase and mannitol) markedly reduced the effect of Hcy on ETâ1 production. Thus, it is extracellular Hcy accumulation that triggers the decrease in ETâ1 production by endothelial cells through oxidative products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalase 3aendothelial cells 3ahomocysteine 3ahumans 3amannitol 3amethionine 3arisk 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aMoatti, Nicole1 aPaul, Jean-Louis,1 aCogny, Anne1 aBenoit, MarieâOdile1 aDemuth, Karine0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 Oct. 15, v. 268, no. 20 p.5287-5294dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02460.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04311naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014600162300001100308520253100319592002802850650001302878650002402891650001302915650002102928650002702949650001202976650002202988650002803010650001203038650000903050650002403059650001203083650002003095650002603115650002303141650001503164650002303179650002203202650001403224650002003238650001503258650001103273650001303284650001803297650001503315650001703330650001003347650001103357650001103368650001503379650001003394651001603404700001503420700001403435773014503449856008203594852000903676655001203685IND60603145420221120034255.0190128e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060314542DNAL7 a10.1186/s40490-018-0115-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarden, M.10aRoot system attributes of 12 juvenile indigenous early colonising shrub and tree species with potential for mitigating erosion in New Zealand  ap. 11.  aBACKGROUND: Restoring erosion-prone land with indigenous species, whether by managed reforestation (planting) or by passive natural reversion, is reliant on knowing which species mix is likely to provide the quickest and most effective mitigation against shallow landslides. In turn, this requires knowledge of differences in growth metrics among plant species, particularly during their formative years. This study presents data on the root development and architecture of 12 of New Zealand’s commonest early colonising indigenous shrub and tree species. These data are crucial to the development of guidelines and policy for land use conversion and future land management options where unmitigated erosion is of increasing concern. METHODS: In a plot-based field trial, the growth performance of Coprosma robusta (karamū), Plagianthus regius (ribbonwood), Sophora tetraptera (kōwhai), Pittosporum eugenioides (lemonwood), Pittosporum tenuifolium (kōhūhū), Hoheria populnea (lacebark), Myrsine australis (māpou), Pseudopanax arboreus (fivefinger), Cordyline australis (cabbage tree), Knightia excelsa (rewarewa), Leptospermum scoparium (mānuka), and Coriaria arborea (tutu) was measured annually over five consecutive years. RESULTS: Eleven species developed a heart-shaped root system and Cordyline australis, a tap-rooted system. By year 5, the root/shoot ratio ranged between 0.24 and 0.44, > 99.5% of the total root mass and root length of all species was confined to within 0.5 m of the ground surface and > 73% within 1 radial metre of the root bole. Regressions between root collar diameter (RCD over bark) and root length were highly significant (P < 0.001) (r² values 0.55–0.92), as were regressions for root biomass (r² values 0.31–0.97). RCD fitted best for below-ground biomass (r² values 0.67–0.94). CONCLUSIONS: The species with the greatest potential for mitigating shallow forms of erosion were Pittosporum eugenioides, Plagianthus regius, Coriaria arborea, Pittosporum tenuifolium, Hoheria populnea, Sophora tetraptera, and Cordyline australis. New data on differences in root metrics between species have improved our understanding of their strengths and limitations, alone or as mixed plantings, and of the time (years after planting) and density of plantings required to achieve a successful erosion control outcome. Modelling root-soil reinforcement and the role of root systems in mitigating the initiation of shallow slope failures should include roots > 1 mm in diameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoprosma 3aCordyline australis 3aCoriaria 3aKnightia excelsa 3aLeptospermum scoparium 3aMyrsine 3aNeopanax arboreus 3aPittosporum tenuifolium 3aSophora 3abark 3abelowground biomass 3acabbage 3aerosion control 3afield experimentation 3agrowth performance 3aguidelines 3aindigenous species 3aissues and policy 3ajuveniles 3aland use change 3alandslides 3amodels 3aplanting 3areforestation 3aroot crown 3aroot systems 3aroots 3ashoots 3ashrubs 3atree trunk 3atrees 3aNew Zealand1 aLambie, S.1 aRowan, D.0 tNew Zealand journal of forestry science.g2018 Dec., v. 48, no. 1 p.11-11dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:23354x1179-53957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40490-018-0115-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013300169300001600302520061700318592002800935650001100963650002000974650001900994700002101013700001901034773009401053856008101147852000901228655001201237IND60724802120221119230913.0210124e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072480212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.12.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahlqvist, Martin10aDataset on the structure and thermodynamic and dynamic stability of Mo2ScAlC2 from experiments and first-principles calculations  ap. 576-582.  aThe data presented in this paper are related to the research article entitled “Theoretical stability and materials synthesis of a chemically ordered MAX phase, Mo₂ScAlC₂, and its two-dimensional derivate Mo₂ScC” (Meshkian et al. 2017) [1].

When the culture was grown in the presence of endosulfan or endosulfan sulphate as the sole source of sulphur, more than 70% of endosulfan and 90% of endosulfan sulphate degradation was observed. The culture was found to consist of strains of Pseudomonas putida, differing in their 16srRNA sequence. An increase in biomass up to 1.8g/L and 2.2g/L was observed in the presence of endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate respectively. Metabolites of endosulfan degradation like endosulfan diol, endosulfan lactone and endosulfan sulphate were detected in the cultures. The culture showed higher degradation under aerated conditions compared to static conditions. With the ability to tolerate high concentrations of endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate, this culture has the potential for use as a bioremediating agent for contaminated soil and water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3aarea 3abacterial culture 3abiomass 3adegradation 3aendosulfan lactone 3aendosulfan sulfate 3aenvironmental science 3ametabolites 3apaper 3apolluted soils 3asole 3astrains 3asulfur 3awater 0aPersistence 0abioremediation1 aMurthy, V.

Block polymer Pluronic F127 was used as a dual-function template to form a hierarchically porous silica monolith with both macropores and mesopores. The surface of the silica monolithic column bed was modified in situ by the C18 reagent, and was then evaluated by the μ-HPLC method. 30 000–40 000 theoretical plates per m were observed indicating that the new synthesis method creates a monolithic material that can act as an efficient chromatographically stationary phase. The method also makes the fabrication of silica monolithic columns (especially capillary columns) much simpler.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3acorrosion 3amacropores 3apolymers 3asilica 3asynthesis1 aGao, Dong1 aGuo, Jianyu1 aTang, Yihong1 aZhang, Suxia1 aTao, Jianwei0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 Aug. 21, v. 6, no. 18 p.7436-7441dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ay00927d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01687naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015400161300001600315520056300331592002800894650002800922650002000950650003100970650001101001650001801012650001301030700001601043700001401059700001701073700001701090700001601107700001801123773009401141856008101235852000901316655001201325IND60724802320221119230857.0210124e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072480232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.12.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Guoxi10aDataset on differential gene expression analysis for splenic transcriptome profiling and the transcripts related to six immune pathways in grass carp  ap. 598-600.  aThe data presented in this paper are related to the research article entitled “Transcriptome profiling of developing spleen tissue and discovery of immune-related genes in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella)” (Li et al. 2016) [1].

Herein, maleoyl-modified CN (MaCN) was simply prepared via a dehydration reaction between CN and maleic acid, and exhibits enhanced charge separation, optical absorption, and thus photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, relative to the bulk CN. The surface modification causes variation of the band structure, suggesting the difference of band levels between the surface layer with maleoyl-modification and the inside without any modification in MaCN, and the surface layer and the inside with matched band levels form type-II core-shell homojunction to enhance the charge separation. This work expounds a conceptual framework of core-shell homojunction in surface-modified CN photocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon nitride 3aenergy 3ahydrogen production 3amaleic acid 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apolymers 0aCarbon nitride 0aPhotocatalysis 0aHomojunction 0aHydrogen evolution 0aSurface modification1 aBa, Guiming1 aWang, Zhen1 aLi, Haiping0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 July 15, v. 594 p.64-72dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010500167300002000272500001100292520101600303592002801319650002301347650005201370650004001422650001801462650001201480650001401492650001401506650001301520650001701533650001501550700001701565700003101582700002901613700006001642700001701702773015501719856008201874852000901956655001201965IND60746988720221118114012.0210811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074698872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12200-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Rajnish10aHydroxychloroquine in COVID-19: therapeutic promises, current status, and environmental implications  ap. 40431-40444.  aReview  aThe outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected the entire world with its infectious spread and mortality rate. The severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are characterized by hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the absence of any specific treatment, just the preventive and supportive care options are available. Therefore, much focus is given to assess the available therapeutic options not only to avoid acute respiratory failure and hypoxia but also to reduce the viral load to control the severity of the disease. The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is among the much-discussed drugs for the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients. This article reviews the therapeutic potential of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 based on the available in vitro and clinical evidence, current status of registered HCQ-based clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for COVID-19, and environmental implications of HCQ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aacute respiratory distress syndrome 3aantimalarials 3ahypoxia 3amortality 3apollution 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3aviral load1 aSharma, Anju1 aSrivastava, Janmejai Kumar1 aSiddiqui, Mohammed Haris1 aUddin, Md.

We conclude that cyclobutyne is a transition state in its singlet ground state, based on new coupled cluster and multireference computations presented in this research. This is substantially different from other theoretical studies proposing the existence of singlet cyclobutyne as a minimum. The singlet cyclobutyne transition state (C₂ᵥ) exhibits a ring puckering imaginary vibrational mode, leading to two equivalent minima, cyclopropylidenemethylenes in Cₛ symmetry, with a barrier height of ∼23 kcal/mol. In contrast with previous studies, singlet cyclopropylidenemethylene in C₂ᵥ symmetry was predicted to be a transition state, not a minimum. Triplet cyclobutyne is a genuine minimum and higher-lying than the lowest singlet state by ∼15 kcal/mol. New computations give the total ring strain of the singlet cyclobutyne to be 101 kcal/mol, with an in-plane π-bond strain of 71 kcal/mol.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds1 aSchaefer, Henry F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0252-20830 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Apr. 05, v. 84, no. 9 p.5548-5553dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b005023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010500162300001600267520110800283592002801391650001501419650001101434650001901445650001901464650002301483650001901506650002301525650001101548650001501559650001601574650001101590650002501601650001901626650001001645651001401655700001301669773009701682856008101779852000901860655001201869IND60119176920221119140358.0141205e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011917692DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-014-0248-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiveyro, S10aTaxonomic and Functional Structure of Phytophagous Insect Communities Associated with Grain Amaranth  ap. 532-540.  aAmaranthus are worldwide attacked mainly by leaf chewers and sucker insects. Stem borers and leaf miners follow in importance, while minor herbivores are leaf rollers, folders, and rasping-sucking insects. The herbivorous community observed on Amaranthus spp. in Argentina was consistent with the information reported worldwide both in guild composition and order proportion. Amaranth plants had a higher number of phytophagous species in their native rather than in its introduced range. Occurrence of insect guilds differed in space and time. The highest density of leaf chewers was observed shortly after the emergence of plants, while higher density of borer and sucker insects coincided with reproductive stages of the crop. The sucking guild was observed mainly at panicles, while the insects within the leaf chewer group were registered in both leaves (92.6%, n = 746 adults) and inflorescences (7.4%). The borer guild was also recorded in stems and inflorescences; however, the density of larvae in stems was about four times as high as the density observed in panicles (n = 137 larvae).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus 3aadults 3aamaranth grain 3aboring insects 3aindigenous species 3ainflorescences 3ainsect communities 3alarvae 3aleafminers 3aleafrollers 3aleaves 3aphytophagous insects 3aspace and time 3astems 3aArgentina1 aSalvo, A0 tNeotropical entomology.g2014 Dec., v. 43, no. 6 p.532-540dSpringer-Verlagx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-014-0248-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245012200187300001600309520136500325536011201690592002801802596011801830650002101948650002501969650001601994650001802010650002402028650001102052650002602063650001802089650001202107650001902119650001302138650001902151653001802170653001602188653001902204653002002223653002102243700002002264700002202284700002102306700002002327773013802347856008502485852000902570655001202579IND60643886720221121043651.0190514e20190528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064388672DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2019.16031752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurlan, Valcenir Júnior Mendes10aConditions for the Production of Carotenoids by Thraustochytrium sp. ATCC 26185 and Aurantiochytrium sp. ATCC PRA-276  ap. 465-477.  aThere is an intensive search for alternative sources of bioactive molecules, including carotenoids, due to their potent antioxidant activities. Some aquatic microorganisms, such as thraustochytrids, have the ability to synthesize large amounts of carotenoids. The objective of this investigation was to study the effect of growth conditions (carbon: total nitrogen ratio and cultivation system) on the production of carotenoids by Thraustochytrium sp. and Aurantiochytrium sp. For Thraustochytrium sp. culture, carotenoid production was lowered by increasing the initial glucose concentration or continuous supply of glucose and nitrogen. For Aurantiochytrium sp. culture, restraining nitrogen supply or especially using a continuous supply of glucose and total nitrogen decreased total carotenoid productivity. The highest total carotenoid production (2.22 mg/L, w/v) was obtained after 192 h of cultivation of Thraustochytrium sp. using initial concentrations of 30 g/L glucose and 2.4 g/L total nitrogen (batch system). The highest production of astaxanthin was achieved in the fed-batch system with a C/N ratio of 6.2 for Thraustochytrium sp. and 40 for Aurantiochytrium sp. Therefore, it was found that the carotenoid profile can be changed by modifying the growth conditions, which can be useful for the food industry and biotechnological applications.  aThis work was supported by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior [6906/10-9].  aPublisher supplied data  a6906/10-9cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322 3aThraustochytrium 3aantioxidant activity 3aastaxanthin 3abatch systems 3abioactive compounds 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3afood industry 3aglucose 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3atotal nitrogen 0aCarbon source 0acarotenoids 0aculture system 0anitrogen source 0aThraustochytrids1 aBatista, Irineu1 aBandarra, Narcisa1 aMendes, Rogério1 aCardoso, Carlos0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2019 May 28, v. 28, no. 5 p.465-477dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2019.16031753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001800295520138700313592002801700650001401728650001001742650001301752650001301765650001301778650001501791650001201806650002501818650001901843650001801862650001501880650001201895700002401907700002301931700001901954700001801973700002001991700002102011773013302032856008102165852000902246655001202255IND60575509520221118231340.0170728e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057550952DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590161001132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOparin, M. L.10aStructural dynamics of the breeding population of larks (Alaudidae, Aves) in the semidesert of the Saratov Trans-Volga region  ap. 1377-1388.  aAccording to our data on the density of breeding pairs of five lark species obtained from route censuses, the dynamics of their population in the Mezhuzenskii and Uzensko-Dyurinskii landscapes of the semidesert in the Caspian lowland is considered. Our five-year census work was carried out on key sites 25 km² in area, with mapping and description of the soils and vegetation using remote sensing techniques. Our comprehensive studies of these key areas have revealed the dynamics of the individual lark species characteristic of the northwestern part of the Trans-Volga region of the Caspian lowland and the changes in the level of vegetation of the plant component of individual landscape tracts depending on the moisture level in certain years. It is shown that, in the monotonous plain conditions, an important role in the distribution of the specific population of larks is played by the meso- and micro-relief, which determines the soil salinity, and the distribution of moisture and vegetation groups (which predetermine the features of bird habitats). The interannual variability of the population structure of larks is shown, which, in the modern conditions of consistently low anthropogenic pressure, is determined by the weather in specific years, which determines the level of vegetation and, therefore, changes in the nesting conditions of birds in specific habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlaudidae 3abirds 3abreeding 3acensuses 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3anesting 3apopulation structure 3aremote sensing 3asoil salinity 3avegetation 3aweather1 aKondratenkov, I.

The fabrics studied include those produced from wool and polyester fibers and also wool/polyester blends. The effect of annealing variables (temperature, time, and regain) on the fabric visco-elastic performance has been analyzed using the free volume concept. The fabric stress relaxation curves for any given annealing conditions can be predicted from two time shift factors, one depending on annealing temperature and the other on annealing time, and the knowledge of the fabric stress relaxation spectrum. The time shift factors are used to construct a series of master stress relaxation curves, thus providing a convenient means of describing the ageing and annealing behavior of textile materials. The relationship between ageing and annealing performance has also been examined for wool fabrics. The results indicate that the ageing and annealing processes can both be considered in terms of similar mechanisms, and the annealing process may be regarded as an accelerated ageing phenomenon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3apolyesters 3astress relaxation 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3aviscoelasticity 3awool 3awoolen fabric1 aDhingra, R.1 aPostle, R.1 aTao, Xiaoming0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 58, no. 9 p.543-551dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517588058009093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03821naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010200209300001600311520184500327592002802172650001402200650001602214650001602230650001602246650001202262650002802274650002602302650001302328650001902341650002202360650001102382650000702393650001702400650001502417650002502432650003002457650002402487650001602511650001802527650001102545650001902556650003002575653001702605653000802622653000802630653002602638653003002664653000702694653000802701653000802709653000702717653000902724653000702733653000702740653000702747653000702754653000702761653001002768653000702778653000802785653000902793700006502802773014002867856008303007852000903090655001203099IND60730648420221119230739.0210506e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073064842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilin, Vitalii I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9301-816X10apH dependent electrical properties of the inner- and outer- leaflets of biomimetic cell membranes  ap. 279-289.  aComposition and asymmetry of lipid membranes provide a means for regulation of trans-membrane permeability of ions and small molecules. The pH dependence of these processes plays an important role in the functioning and survival of cells. In this work, we study the pH dependence of membrane electrical resistance and capacitance using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and neutron reflectometry (NR) measurements of biomimetic tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs). tBLMs were prepared with single-component phospholipid compositions, as well as mixtures of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin and cholesterol) that mimic the inner- and outer- leaflets of plasma cell membranes. We found that all studied tBLMs have a resistance maximum at pHs near the pKₐs of the phospholipids. SPR and NR indicated that surface concentration of phospholipids and the thickness of the hydrophobic part of the membrane did not change versus pH. We postulate that these maxima are the result of protonation of the phosphate oxygen of the phospholipids and that hydronium ions play a major role in the conductance at pHs < pKₐs while sodium ions play the major role at pHs > pKₐs. An additional sharp resistance maximum of the PE tBLMs found at pH 5.9 and most likely represents the phosphatidylethanolamine’s isoelectric point. The data show the key roles of the characteristic parts of phospholipid molecules: terminal group (choline, carboxyl, amine), phosphate, glycerol and ester oxygens on the permeability and selectivity of ions through the membrane. The interactions between these groups lead to significant differences in the electrical properties of biomimetic models of inner- and outer- leaflets of the plasma cell membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3abiomimetics 3acapacitance 3acholesterol 3acholine 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrical resistance 3aglycerol 3ahydrophobicity 3aisoelectric point 3aoxygen 3apH 3apermeability 3aphosphates 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphosphatidylserines 3aprotonation 3areflectometry 3asodium 3asphingomyelins 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aBiomembranes 0aEIS 0aSPR 0aNeutron reflectometry 0aPhospholipid interactions 0apH 0aSPR 0aEIS 0aPL 0atBLM 0aNR 0aPC 0aPG 0aPS 0aPE 0aDOTAP 0aSM 0aePC 0aChol1 aHoogerheide, David P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2918-14690 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 July 15, v. 594 p.279-289dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014300169300001600312520136100328592002801689650002801717650001401745650002901759650001801788650001901806650001101825650001601836650002001852650003001872650001001902650003301912650002401945650002701969650003001996650001802026650001002044650001202054651001002066653001402076653001602090653000802106653002302114653002802137700002002165700001602185700001602201700002002217700001802237700002002255773016402275856008602439852000902525655001202534IND60527932220221120063951.0190416e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052793222DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61177-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXU, Cheng-nan10aSpecies-specific PCR-based assays for identification and detection of Botryosphaeriaceae species causing stem blight on blueberry in China  ap. 573-579.  aBotryosphaeriaceae species are important causal agents of blueberry stem blight worldwide. Blueberry stem blight has become an important disease, potentially affecting the quality and production of blueberries in China. It is difficult and time-consuming to identify at the species level using morphological methods. The aim of this study was to develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the diagnosis and early detection of latent infections of blueberry stems by Botryosphaeria spp. Species-specific primers, based on the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region and β-tubulin gene, were designed and selected for use in PCR assays. Three primer pairs, Lt347-F/R for Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Np304-F/R for Neofusicoccum parvum and FaF/Bt2b for Botryosphaeria dothidea, successfully amplified specific PCR fragments of different sizes on pure cultures or from blueberry stems inoculated and naturally infected blueberry plants with three pathogens, respectively. These primers did not amplify any PCR fragments from other blueberry stem disease-associated pathogens, such as Phomopsis spp. and Pestalotiopsis spp. This PCR protocol could detect as low as 100 pg to 1 ng of purified fungal DNA. This PCR-based protocol could be used for the diagnosis and detection of these pathogens from pure cultures or from infected blueberry plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryosphaeria dothidea 3aDiaporthe 3aLasiodiplodia theobromae 3aNeofusicoccum 3aPestalotiopsis 3ablight 3ablueberries 3aearly diagnosis 3afungal diseases of plants 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrobial detection 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3astems 3atubulin 3aChina 0ablueberry 0astem blight 0aPCR 0aBotryosphaeriaceae 0aspecies-specific primer1 aZHANG, Hong-jun1 aCHI, Fu-mei1 aJI, Zhi-rui1 aDONG, Qing-long1 aCAO, Ke-qiang1 aZHOU, Zong-shan0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2016 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.573-579dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61177-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04290naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245008000171300001800251500001900269500002000288520247200308592002802780596004702808596005202855596005202907596004102959596003203000596004703032596004703079596004703126596002303173650002103196650001403217650001203231650001203243650001303255650001103268650001003279650002503289650001603314650001603330650001803346650001103364700002203375700002203397700002103419700002003440700006603460773012203526856007903648852000903727655001203736IND60707201620221116173024.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070720162DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.134322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurdon, Rosalie C. F.10aScented nectar and the challenge of measuring honest signals in pollination  ap. 2132-2144.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNectar scents are thought to function as honest signals of reward used by pollinators, but this hypothesis has rarely been tested. Using Penstemon digitalis, we examined honest signalling of the nectar volatile (S)‐(+)‐linalool and pollinator responses to linalool in both field and laboratory settings. Because our previous work showed that linalool emission was associated with higher female fitness and that nectar is scented with linalool, we hypothesized that linalool was an honest signal of nectar reward. To assess honesty, we measured linalool–nectar associations including nectar volume, sugar amount, concentration and production rate for inflorescences and flowers in several populations. We also assessed whether Bombus impatiens, the main pollinator of P. digitalis at our sites, can use linalool as a foraging signal. We supplemented real or artificial flowers in the field and laboratory with varying linalool–nectar combinations to measure pollinator behavioural responses. We found that an inflorescence's linalool emissions could be used to predict nectar rewards in P. digitalis, but this was driven by indirect associations with display size rather than directly advertising more profitable flowers. For flowers within inflorescences there was also no evidence for an association between signal and reward. Field tests of bumblebee behaviour were inconclusive. However, in laboratory assays, bumblebees generally used variation in linalool emissions to choose more profitable flowers, demonstrating they can detect differences in linalool emitted by P. digitalis and associate them with reward profitability. These results suggest experiments that decouple display size, scent and reward are necessary to assess whether (and when) bees prefer higher linalool emissions. Bees preferred nectars with lower linalool concentrations when linalool flavoured the nectar solution, suggesting the potential for conflicting pressures on scent emission in the field. Synthesis. Our results highlight the challenges of assessing function for traits important to fitness and suggest that the perception of floral signalling honesty may depend on whether pollinators use inflorescences or flowers within inflorescences when making foraging decisions. We conclude that future research on honest signalling in flowering plants, as well as its connection to phenotypic selection, should explicitly define honesty, in theoretical and experimental contexts.  aPublisher supplied data  cBertil Lundmans Fund for Botanical Studies  aFOA11H‐317cRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences  aFOA13H‐190cRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences  cRegnell Botanical Travel Scholarship  cNew York Floral Association  aDEB‐0746106cNational Science Foundation  aDEB‐1342792cNational Science Foundation  aIOS‐0950225cNational Science Foundation  cUppsala University 3aBombus impatiens 3aPenstemon 3aecology 3afemales 3alinalool 3anectar 3aodors 3aphenotypic selection 3apollination 3apollinators 3aprofitability 3asugars1 aRaguso, Robert A.1 aGegear, Robert J.1 aPierce, Ellen C.1 aKessler, André1 aParachnowitsch, Amy L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9668-65930 tjournal of ecology.g2020 Sept., v. 108, no. 5 p.2132-2144dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.134323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01846naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013500164300001800299520083600317592002801153650001801181650001001199650000901209650001201218650001201230650001101242650001101253650001201264700002101276773013301297856008101430852000901511655001201520IND60575509620221118231356.0170728e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057550962DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590161000342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBykov, A.

This is due to the fact that reduction of ravine forests and steppe shrubs (which began in the 18th century) has extremely affected the forest and dendrophilous animals. The artificial afforestation, especially intense since the middle of the 20th century, provided surrogate “forest” sites in the region by the end of the 1970s. This helped to restore the missing species and raise the abundance and dispersal of forest and dendrophilous animals. By the beginning of the 21st century, afforestation had stopped in the region and the plantation areas had begun to shrink. Some trends in the populations of mammals and birds can be already noticed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3abirds 3aclay 3aforests 3amammals 3arivers 3ashrubs 3asteppes1 aBukhareva, O.

Low vitamin D status arises due to limited, if any, dermal synthesis during the winter months at latitudes above 40°N, putting increased importance on dietary supply of the vitamin. However, dietary intakes by most populations are low due to the limited supply of vitamin D-rich foods in the food chain. Thus strategies that effectively address this public health issue are urgently required. It has been emphasized and re-emphasized that there are only a limited number of public health strategies available to correct low dietary vitamin D intake: 1 improving intake of naturally occurring vitamin D-rich foods, 2 vitamin D fortification (mandatory or voluntarily) of food, and 3 vitamin D supplementation. Recent evidence suggests that the levels of vitamin D added to food would need to be high so as to ensure dietary requirements are met and health outcomes optimized. In addition, knowledge of the most effective forms of vitamin D to use in some of these preventative approaches is important. There is still uncertainty in relation to the relative efficacy of vitamin D₂ versus D₃, the two main food derived forms and those used in vitamin D supplements. The major metabolite of vitamin D with biological activity is 1,25(OH)₂D; however, this is usually used for pharmacological purposes and is not typically used in normal, healthy people. The other major metabolite, 25(OH)D, which has also been used for pharmacological purposes is present in certain foods such as meat and meat products (particularly offal) as well as eggs. This metabolite may have the potential to boost vitamin D status up to five times more effectively that native vitamin D₃ in foods. However, the exact bioactivity of this compound needs to be established.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acholecalciferol 3aeggs 3aergocalciferol 3afood chain 3afood intake 3alatitude 3ameat 3ametabolites 3anutrient requirements 3apublic health 3auncertainty 3avitamin D deficiency 3avitamin status 3avitamin supplements 3awinter 3aEurope 0avitamers 0ametabolites of vitamin D 0afortification0 tFood & nutrition research.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 56, no. 1 p.5383-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:6165x1654-661X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3402/fnr.v56i0.53833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011200168300001600280500001500296520152600311592002801837650002301865650001401888650003001902650002201932650001101954650001601965650000801981650001201989650001202001650001202013650001102025650002102036650001102057650001602068650000902084650002402093650002102117650001202138650002402150650002302174650001302197653002102210653001002231653005402241653003502295653001902330700001702349700001702366700001902383700001302402700001702415700001502432700001302447773016402460856008602624852000902710655001202719IND60527932420221120053037.0190416e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052793242DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61180-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jiao,10aAmplification and function analysis of N6-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase gene in Nilaparvata lugens  ap. 591-599.  a2019-12-06  aMethylation of the N6 position of adenine, termed N6-methyladenine, protects DNA from restriction endonucleases via the host-specific restriction-modification system. N6-methyladenine was discovered and has been well studied in bacteria. N6-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase (N6AMT) is the main enzyme catalyzing the methylation of the adenine base and knowledge of this enzyme was mainly derived from work in prokaryotic models. However, large-scale gene discovery at the genome level in many model organisms indicated that the N6AMT gene also exists in eukaryotes, such as humans, mice, fruit flies and plants. Here, we cloned a N6AMT gene from Nilaparvata lugens (Nlu-N6AMT) and amplified its full-length transcript. Then, we carried out a systematic investigation of N6AMT in 33 publically available insect genomes, indicating that all studied insects had N6AMT. Genomic structure analysis showed that insect N6AMT has short introns compared with the mammalian homologs. Domain and phylogenetic analysis indicated that insect N6AMT had a conserved N6-adenineMlase domain that is specific to catalyze the adenine methylation. Nlu-N6AMT was highly expressed in the adult female. We knocked down Nlu-N6AMT by feeding dsRNA from the second instar nymph to adult female, inducing retard development of adult female. In all, we provide the first genome-wide analysis of N6AMT in insects and presented the experimental evidence that N6AMT might have important functions in reproductive development and ovary maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aphylogeny 3arestriction endonucleases 3aadult development 3aadults 3amethylation 3aDNA 3aintrons 3afemales 3aadenine 3ahumans 3aeukaryotic cells 3amodels 3afruit flies 3amice 3adouble-stranded RNA 3ahost specificity 3ainstars 3aovarian development 3amethyltransferases 3abacteria 0aRNA interference 0agenes 0aN6-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase (N6AMT) 0aNilaparvata lugens, expression 0agene structure1 aXING, Yan-ru1 aHOU, Bo-feng1 aYUAN, Zhu-ting1 aLi, Yao,1 aJIE, Wen-cai1 aSun, Yang,1 aLi, Fei,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2016 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.591-599dElsevier B.V.aChinese Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21573x2095-31197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61180-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015600157300002000313520113300333592002801466650001101494650001601505650002001521650002201541653001601563653003201579653002001611653001701631653002601648700001801674773012701692856007501819852000901894655001201903IND60527714520221122044844.0160715e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052771452DNAL7 a10.1021/am502848c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Mounggon10aEngineering of Interconnect Position of Bicarbazole for High External Quantum Efficiency in Green and Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light-Emitting Diodes  ap. 14874-14880.  aThree bicarbazole based host materials with different interconnect positions between carbazole units, 3,3′-(9,9′-[3,3′-bicarbazole]-9,9′-diyl)dibenzonitrile (3CN33BCz), 3,3′-(9,9′-[3,4′-bicarbazole]-9,9′-diyl)dibenzonitrile (3CN34BCz), and 3,3′-(9,9′-[4,4′-bicarbazole]-9,9′-diyl)dibenzonitrile (3CN44BCz), were developed and their synthesis, material characterization, and device characterization were reported. Two carbazole units were connected via 3,3′-, 3,4′-, and 4,4′-positions to correlate the interconnect positions with photophysical properties and device performances. The linkage via 4,4′-position increased triplet energy and thermal stability of the host materials, while the linkage via 3,3′-position enhanced current density. All bicarbazole host materials showed good device performances and high quantum efficiency above 25% was attained using the biscarbazole derivatives for green and blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes.

Among these interactions, the effects of seed‐dispersing granivores (synzoochory) are especially interesting because the benefits and costs are so striking. Here, we respond to a commentary by C. M. Moore and J. W. Dittel (‘On mutualism, models, and masting: the effects of seed‐dispersing animals on the plants they disperse’). We focus on the points that were most thought‐provoking to us, specifically the notions that (a) synzoochory is widespread, and therefore ought to be beneficial for plants, (b) dispersal should reduce negative density dependence and (c) plant life spans are at least an order of magnitude longer than typical study lengths. We argue that (a) widespread occurrence of an interaction cannot serve as an argument that this interaction is mutualistic, (b) dispersal effects on density dependence are variable and need to be tested for every particular species pair and (c) Short‐term studies can be used to gain mechanistic understanding of interactions even without risky long‐term extrapolations. Synthesis. Evaluating the costs and benefits of synzoochory for plant populations under different ecological contexts will help to understand the ecological principles of the interaction but also allows to move the interaction towards each end of the antagonism–mutualism continuum in nature management and conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015/17/N/NZ8/01565cNarodowe Centrum Nauki  a2018/30/M/NZ8/00052cNarodowe Centrum Nauki 3agranivores 3amasting 3amutualism1 aBogdziewicz, Michał1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6777-90341 aCrone, Elizabeth E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5287-221X0 tjournal of ecology.g2020 Sept., v. 108, no. 5 p.1784-1788dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.134633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009500165300001600260520168200276592002801958650001201986650000901998650002602007650001402033650001202047650002102059650001102080650001402091650001602105700001702121700001802138773009702156856008102253852000902334655001202343IND60119177220221119140502.0141205e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011917722DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-014-0239-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, D M10aNiche Overlap and Network Specialization of Flower-Visiting Bees in an Agricultural System  ap. 489-499.  aDifferent resource use strategies manifest as differences in the realized niches of species. Niche segregation may involve several dimensions of the niche, such as diet, space, and time. We measured the level of redundancy and complementarity of a bee–plant interaction network in an agricultural system. Because flower resource diversity is high and resource abundance associated with flowering phenology varies throughout the year, we hypothesized that trophic overlap in the community would be low (i.e., high niche complementarity). In contrast, we expected a combination of physiological constraints and exploitation competition to create high temporal overlap, leading to high redundancy in the time of use of floral resources. Dietary overlap was low (NOᵢₕ = 0.18): niches of 88% of species pairs had less than 30% overlap. In contrast, temporal overlap was intermediate (NOᵢₕ = 0.49): niches of 65% of species pairs had 30% to 60% overlap. Network analysis showed that bees separated their dietary niches and had intermediate complementary specialization (H₂′ = 0.46). In terms of their temporal niches (H₂′ = 0.12), bees were generalists, with high temporal redundancy. Temperature was not a key factor in the determination of niche overlap, suggesting that environmental factors do not likely have a primary role in determining high redundancy in the temporal use of floral resources. Rather, temporal overlap is likely associated with the timing of nectar production by flowers. Our results suggest that bees partition a wide variety of available floral resources, resulting in low dietary overlap and intermediate temporal overlap.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3aflowers 3anectar secretion 3aniches 3aphenology 3atemperature1 aPresley, S J1 aSantos, G M M0 tNeotropical entomology.g2014 Dec., v. 43, no. 6 p.489-499dSpringer-Verlagx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-014-0239-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100006900185245010700254300002000361506007600381520143400457592002801891506003701919650002401956650002201980650001302002650002202015650002602037650001102063650002602074653002102100653002302121653001502144653002202159653001602181653001602197653001602213653003002229700003302259700002202292700002402314700001802338773014202356856007802498852000902576655001202585IND60677919020221207142056.0191213e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067791902DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b144142doi7 aPMC69092532pmcid7 a317298602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrasekaran, Anirudhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3763-142310aNanoscale Transition Metal Thin Films: Growth Characteristics and Scaling Law for Interlayer Formation  ap. 46311-46326.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA comprehensive study on the growth of nanoscale transition metal-on-transition metal (TM-on-TM) systems is presented. The near room-temperature intermixing and segregation phenomena during growth are studied in vacuo using high-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering. The investigated TM-on-TM systems are classified into four types according to the observed intermixing and segregation behavior. Empirical rules are suggested to qualitatively predict the growth characteristics of any TM-on-TM system based on the atomic size difference, surface-energy difference, and enthalpy of mixing between the film and substrate atoms. An exponential trend is observed in the effective interface width as a function of the surface-energy difference between the film and substrate layers, with a subtrend based on the crystal structure of the TM layers. A semiempirical model that accurately describes the experimental data is presented. It serves as a scaling law to predict the effective interface width and the minimum film thickness required for full film coverage in TM-on-TM systems in general. The ability to predict the growth characteristics as well as the interface width for any TM-on-TM system significantly contributes to the process of finding the best material combination for a specific application, where layer growth characteristics are implicitly considered when selecting materials based on their functional properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aambient temperature 3acrystal structure 3aenthalpy 3afilms (materials) 3afunctional properties 3amixing 3asemi-empirical models 0athin film growth 0asputter deposition 0ainterfaces 0atransition metals 0aintermixing 0asegregation 0ascaling law 0alow energy ion scattering1 avan de Kruijs, Robbert W.

Sequencing the Tribolium castaneum genome provides an opportunity to investigate the structure, function, and evolution of GSTs on a genome-wide scale. Thirty-six putative cytosolic GSTs and 5 microsomal GSTs have been identified in T. castaneum. Furthermore, 40, 35, 13, 23, and 32 GSTs have been discovered the other insects, Drosophila, Anopheles, Apis, Bombyx, and Acyrthosiphon, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that insect-specific GSTs, Epsilon and Delta, are the largest species-specific expanded GSTs. In T. castaneum, most GSTs are tandemly arranged in three chromosomes. Particularly, Epsilon GSTs have an inverted long-fragment duplication in the genome. Other four widely distributed classes are highly conserved in all species. Given that GSTs specially expanded in Tribolium castaneum, these genes might help to resist poisonous chemical environments and produce resistance to kinds of different insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon 3aAnopheles 3aApis 3aBombyx 3aDrosophila 3aTribolium castaneum 3achromosomes 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3aphylogeny 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aAphidsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aBeesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBombyxxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDrosophila melanogasterxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Components 2aGlutathione Transferasexgenetics 2aInsecticide Resistancexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTriboliumxenzymologyxgenetics.1 aPei, Lianghong1 aGu, Shasha1 aZhu, Shicheng1 aWang, Yanyun1 aZhang, Yi1 aLi, Bin0 tGenomics.g2012 Nov., v. 100, no. 5 p.327-335dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01576naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100015600140245007400296300001600370520041000386592002800796650000800824650002000832650002700852650001300879650001600892650001200908650002100920650001600941700002200957700001800979700001500997773013101012856007401143852000901217655001201226IND60659987920221117181124.0190823e20131210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065998792DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc45917a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohannsenCurrent address: Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Chemistry Research Laboratory, 12 Mansfield Rd, Oxford, OX1 3TA, UK., Marie W.10aTriplex-mediated analysis of cytosine methylation at CpA sites in DNA  ap. 551-553.  aModified triplex-forming oligonucleotides distinguish 5-methyl cytosine from unmethylated cytosine in DNA duplexes by differences in triplex melting temperatures.

However the molecular mechanisms through which SMND-309 affords this protection are unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms associated with the protective activities of SMND-309 in a cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury rat model. In this study, we used AG490, a specific inhibitor of the signaling pathway involving the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling molecules and suramin, a potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), to investigate the mechanisms of SMND-309. The cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury model was induced by performing middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rats. SMND-309 mitigated the effects of ischemia and reperfusion injury on brain by decreasing the infract volume, improving neurological function, increasing the survival of neurons and promoting angiogenesis by increasing the levels of erythropoietin (EPO), erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), phosphorylated JAK2 (P-JAK2), phosphorylated STAT3 (P-STAT3), VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1) in the brain. Our results suggest that SMND-309 provides significant neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury. The mechanisms of this protection may be attributed to the increased VEGF expression occurring from the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, activated by the increased EPO/EPOR expression in the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal models 3abrain 3aerythropoietin 3aischemia 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3arats 3asalvianolic acid 3asignal transduction 3asuramin 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptors 3avascular endothelial growth factors 2aAnimals 2aPlatelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1xmetabolism. 2aAxonsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aBenzofuransxchemistry 2aBrainxblood supplyxdrug effectsxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aBrain Ischemiaxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aCaffeic Acidsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCerebral Infarctionxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aDendritesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aErythropoietinxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aInfarction, Middle Cerebral Arteryxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aJanus Kinase 2xmetabolism 2aMale 2aNeovascularization, Physiologicxdrug effects 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPhosphoproteinsxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Erythropoietinxmetabolism 2aRecovery of Functionxdrug effects 2aReperfusion Injuryxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aSTAT3 Transcription Factorxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aSurvival Analysis 2aVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Axmetabolism 2aVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2xmetabolism 2aWaterxmetabolism1 aZou, Libo1 aTian, Jingwei1 aDu, Guangying1 aGao, Yubai0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 714, no. 1-3 p.23-31dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.05.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245017400171300002000345520135600365592002801721596006701749650004401816650002401860650001201884650001201896650001101908650001401919650001201933650001801945650002201963650001301985650001401998650001302012650001302025650001002038650001602048700002202064700001702086700002202103773015502125856008202280852000902362655001202371IND60746989520221118113339.0210811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074698952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13567-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmoren, Saviour A.10aDate palm leaves extract as a green and sustainable corrosion inhibitor for low carbon steel in 15 wt.% HCl solution: the role of extraction solvent on inhibition effect  ap. 40879-40894.  aDate palm leaves (DPL) was extracted using acetone (ACE), ethanol (ETH), aqueous (AE), butanol (BUT), methanol (METH), isopropanol (ISO), and ethyl acetate (EHY ACT). The extracts were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The various solvent DPL extracts were screened for anticorrosion property against low carbon steel in 15 wt.% HCl solution at 25 °C. ACE, AE, and ETH DPL extracts are found to promote the corrosion of the low carbon steel while BUT, ISO, METH, and EHY ACT DPL extracts exhibit anticorrosion property. However, BUT DPL extract shows the best anticorrosion property with 400 ppm protecting the low carbon steel by 82%. Based on the results from the screening experiments, BUT extract was selected for a comprehensive corrosion inhibition study. Inhibition effectiveness of BUT DPL extract is found to increase with increasing concentration with 1000 ppm affording 97% protection at 25 °C. The inhibition performance increases up to 40 °C but slightly decreases as the temperature was raised to 50 °C and 60 °C. However, BUT DPL extract could afford 86% protection at 60 °C. Scanning electron microscope and atomic force spectroscopy results confirm that BUT DPL extract is indeed an effective inhibitor for X60 carbon steel in 15 wt.% HCl solution.  aPublisher supplied data  a14-ADV2452-04.cKing Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aacetone 3abutanol 3acarbon 3acorrosion 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amethanol 3apollution 3aresearch 3asolvents 3asteel 3atemperature1 aSolomon, Moses M.1 aObot, Ime B.1 aSuleiman, Rami K.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 30 p.40879-40894dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13567-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012700166300001600293520134000309592002801649650002701677650000801704650002001712650001601732650001301748650001201761650001301773650002201786650001201808650002301820650001701843650002401860650003401884650001901918650001801937653001701955653001701972653001301989653002002002653001202022700002202034700001802056700002902074700002102103773013802124856008502262852000902347655001202356IND60643887120221120154434.0190514e20190528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064388712DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2019.16045972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurali, S.10aDrying Kinetics and Quality Characteristics of Indian Mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) in Solar–Electrical Hybrid Dryer  ap. 541-554.  aThe aim of the study was to investigate the drying kinetics and quality characteristics of Indian mackerel dried under solar–electrical hybrid dryer (S-EHD). Fresh Indian mackerel fishes (Rastrelliger kanagurta) were cleaned, cut into butterfly fillets, and salted overnight using a dry salting method (salt-to-fish ratio, 1:3). The salted mackerel was dried in a S-EHD at the air temperature of 45–55°C, relative humidity of 47–62%, and air velocity of 0.60–0.80 m/s. Open sun drying (OSD) of salted Indian mackerel was conducted to compare with S-EHD. The moisture content of the salted mackerel (61.5% w.b.) was reduced to 31.8% (w.b.) under S-EHD and 30.25% (w.b) under OSD in 8 and 32 h, respectively. The drying rate curve showed that mackerel drying occurred under falling-rate drying period in both the drying methods. A drying efficiency of 23.81% was observed for salted Indian mackerel drying under S-EHD. Diffusion approach and two-term models were selected to accurately predict the drying behavior of mackerel under S-EHD and OSD, respectively. Total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), trimethylamine, and thiobarbituric acid analysis of dried samples revealed that the mackerel dried under S-EHD was better than OSD. In the sensory analysis, samples dried under S-EHD recorded highest overall acceptability score.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRastrelliger kanagurta 3aair 3aair temperature 3abutterflies 3acleaning 3afillets 3amackerel 3arelative humidity 3asalting 3asensory evaluation 3asolar drying 3athiobarbituric acid 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3atrimethylamine 3awater content 0aSolar energy 0ahybrid dryer 0amodeling 0adrying kinetics 0aquality1 aSathish Kumar, K.1 aAlfiya, P.

A comparison between this driving section and a directly adjacent non-driving section of the beach reveals a significant difference in the ratio of storm run-up (Rhigh) to the elevation of the dune toe (Dlow), suggesting that the foredunes within the driving section are more susceptible to scarping and blowout development. Where driving is permitted, blowouts are located in areas where Rhigh/Dlow ratio is locally large, suggesting that the location of blowouts depends on the alongshore variation in storm surge. Results of a cluster analysis reveal two distinct blowout types, in which the relatively small blowouts of Cluster 1 are characterized by a small throat and limited expansion beyond the foredune. The large and more active blowouts of Cluster 2 tend to be found closer to the access road, where driving on the beach is more concentrated and the larger Rhigh/Dlow suggests a greater potential for scarping during relatively small storms. The development of these blowouts feeds back on the height of the foredune, making it susceptible to scarping and washover during tropical storms and hurricanes. It is argued that historical overgrazing and recent beach driving have significantly altered this landscape and represents a long-term threat to island resilience and have the potential to hasten island transgression with sea level rise.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3aevolution 3ahurricanes 3alandscapes 3aovergrazing 3asea level 3aTexas1 aHouser, Chris1 aTrimble, Sarah0 tOcean & coastal management.g2014 July, v. 95 p.156-164dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245016000183300001600343520146600359592002801825650002101853650001301874650001201887650001601899650002401915650001001939650001301949650002601962650002901988650001402017650001502031650004302046650001102089650002202100650001602122651001202138651001002150653002802160653003302188653001602221653001302237653002702250700002302277700007202300700002902372700003302401773009102434856009002525852000902615655001202624IND60593373120221119142511.0220328e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059337312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz-Palazon, Barbara10aPollutants degradation performance and microbial community structure of aerobic granular sludge systems using inoculums adapted at mild and low temperature  ap. 431-441.  aThree aerobic granular sequencing batch reactors were inoculated using different inocula from Finland, Spain and a mix of both in order to investigate the effect over the degradation performance and the microbial community structure. The Finnish inoculum achieved a faster granulation and a higher depollution performance within the first two month of operation. However, after 90 days of operation, similar physico-chemical values were observed. On the other hand, the Real-time PCR showed that Archaea diminished from inoculum to granular biomass, while Bacteria and Fungi numbers remained stable. All granular biomass massive parallel sequencing studies were similar regardless of the inocula from which they formed, as confirmed by singular value decomposition principal coordinates analysis, expected effect size of OTUs, and β-diversity analyses. Thermoproteaceae, Meganema and a Trischosporonaceae members were the dominant phylotypes for the three domains studied. The analysis of oligotype distribution demonstrated that a fungal oligotype was ubiquitous. The dominant OTUs of Bacteria were correlated with bioreactors performance. The results obtained determined that the microbial community structure of aerobic granular sludge was similar regardless of their inocula, showing that the granulation of biomass is related to several phylotypes. This will be of future importance for the implementation of aerobic granular sludge to full-scale systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermoproteaceae 3abacteria 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acommunity structure 3afungi 3ainoculum 3amicrobial communities 3amultidimensional scaling 3aphylotype 3apollutants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asludge 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aFinland 3aSpain 0aAerobic granular sludge 0aMicrobial community dynamics 0aGranulation 0aInoculum 0aTemperature adaptation1 aPesciaroli, Chiara1 aRodriguez-Sanchez, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6647-49441 aGonzalez-López, Jesús,1 aGonzalez-Martinez, Alejandro0 tChemosphere.g2018 Aug., v. 204 p.431-441dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001600281520195700297592002802254650001002282650001702292650001902309650001002328650001402338650002002352650002702372650001202399650002202411650000902433650002302442650002302465650002502488650001402513650001202527650001402539650001302553650001102566650001502577650001102592650001902603650002302622650001602645650001002661650001502671650001502686651000902701700001902710700001802729700002302747700002502770700001902795773010002814856008102914852000902995655001203004IND60575510020221118235349.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057551002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-016-9933-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanogo, Kapoury10aFarmers’ perceptions of climate change impacts on ecosystem services delivery of parklands in southern Mali  ap. 345-361.  aAgroforestry parklands in the Sahel provide a number of ecosystem services that help farmers cope better with climate change effects and thus reducing their vulnerability. However, parklands are threatened due to the decline in densities of species that are sensitive to drought and that might compromise the delivery of the above mentioned ecosystem services to farmers. Therefore, data were collected by interviewing 400 smallholder farmers to elucidate farmers’ perceptions of climate change in southern Mali and potential consequences on the delivery of ecosystem services from the parklands. Descriptive statistics and multinomial logit model were used to analyse the data collected and identify the indictors as well as the determinants of farmers’ perception of climate change. The findings revealed increases in the frequency of strong wind, dust, drought, high temperatures and number of hot days as the main climate change-related indicators. Furthermore, an early cessation of the rainy season, frequent drought and wind were found to be the factors impeding a better delivery of the ecosystem services from the parklands. Early cessation of rains and frequent drought might affect the water availability which in turn affects the flowering and fruiting phases of the trees. The occurrence of strong wind causes the shedding of the flowers thus reducing the fruit production. Age, educational level, farm size and gender are key factors influencing farmer’s perception of climate change. The strategies adopted by these farmers to cope with climate shocks include use of improved drought-tolerant crop varieties, diversification of crops, off-farm activities and seasonal migration. Based on these findings, we therefore suggest the development of conducive environment that can help create agricultural related off-farm income earning activities that could protect active households from the impacts of climate change and variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3aagroforestry 3aclimate change 3acrops 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adescriptive statistics 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3adust 3aecosystem services 3aeducational status 3aenvironmental impact 3afarm size 3afarmers 3aflowering 3afruiting 3agender 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3alogit analysis 3amigratory behavior 3atemperature 3atrees 3awet season 3awind speed 3aMali1 aBinam, Joachim1 aBayala, Jules1 aVillamor, Grace B.1 aKalinganire, Antoine1 aDodiomon, Soro0 tAgroforestry systems.g2017 Apr., v. 91, no. 2 p.345-361dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-016-9933-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245014300184300001400327520156600341592002801907650001601935650001601951650002001967650002101987650001402008650001202022650001802034650002902052650001202081650002002093650002002113650001302133650001302146650002102159650000902180653002602189653002002215653002502235653001902260653000902279653001202288653001902300653002002319700006802339700002102407773008902428856009002517852000902607655001202616IND60593373220221119142414.0201125e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059337322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.04.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-García, Alejandra10aImplications in studies of environmental risk assessments: Does culture medium influence the results of toxicity tests of marine bacteria?  ap. 24-30.  aTwo marine bacterial populations (Roseobacter sp. and Pseudomonas litoralis) were exposed to different concentrations of zinc (300, 625, 1250, 2000, 2500 and 5000 mg L⁻¹) and cadmium (75, 250, 340, 500 and 1000 mg L⁻¹) using two culture media (full nutrient Marine Broth 2216 “MB” and 1:10 (vol/vol) dilution with seawater of Marine Broth 2216 “MBSW”), in order to assess population responses depending on the culture medium and also potential adverse effects associated with these two metals. Different responses were found depending on the culture medium (Bacterial abundance (cells·mL⁻¹), growth rates (μ, hours⁻¹), and production of Extracellular Polysaccharides Substances (EPS) (μg glucose·cells⁻¹). Results showed negative effects in both strains after the exposure to Zn treatments. Both strains showed highest metal sensitivity at low concentrations using both culture media. However, different results were found when exposing the bacterial populations to Cd treatments depending on the culture medium. Highest toxicity was observed using MB at low levels of Cd concentrations, whereas MBSW showed toxicity to bacteria at higher concentrations of Cd. Results not only showed adverse effects on Roseobacter sp. and Pseudomonas litoralis associated with the concentration of Zn and Cd, but also confirm that depending on the culture medium results can differ. This work suggests MBSW as an adequate culture medium to study metal toxicity bioassays in order to predict realistic effects on marine bacterial populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3aRoseobacter 3aadverse effects 3aaquatic bacteria 3abioassays 3acadmium 3aculture media 3aenvironmental assessment 3aglucose 3apolysaccharides 3arisk assessment 3aseawater 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3azinc 0aPseudomonas litoralis 0aRoseobacter sp. 0aBacterial population 0aMetal toxicity 0aZinc 0aCadmium 0aCulture medium 0aRisk assessment1 aBorrero-Santiago, Ana R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8976-46341 aRiba, Inmaculada0 tChemosphere.g2018 Aug., v. 205 p.24-30dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.04.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002800132040001800160100003100178245012400209300001800333500001500351506017300366520142400539650002501963650002301988650002402011650002502035650002502060650002202085650001502107650001502122650002002137650001202157650001702169650001902186650001102205650001402216650002202230653001102252700002902263700002102292773010902313856011202422856007402534956014802608961000902756852000902765655001202774IND60006172620221214230843.0151207e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000617262DNAL7 a3115842aris7 a10113/617262hdl7 a10.1093/jee/tov0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavallieratos, Nickolas G.10aEfficacy of deltamethrin against stored-product beetles at short exposure intervals or on a partially treated rice mass  ap. 1416-1412.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aStored-product insects can potentially be exposed to grain protectants for variable time periods. Adults of three species, the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae), the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) were exposed for 1, 4, 8, and 24 h on brown rice treated with the pyrethroid deltamethrin at the label rate of 0.5 ppm, then removed and placed on untreated rice. Adults of these same species plus the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and the warehouse beetle, Trogoderma variabile Ballion (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) were exposed on treated brown rice mixed with varying amounts of untreated rice to assess progeny production. Immediate and delayed mortality of exposed adults did not exceed 7% for any exposure interval, but progeny production for T. castaneum was generally lower in comparison with that for the other species. Increasing the amount of treated rice decreased progeny production of R. dominica but not for any Sitophilus species. Mixed results were obtained for T. castaneum and T. variabile. Results show that long exposure times and treatment of an entire rice mass may be necessary to give complete control of stored-product beetles. 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aSitophilus zeamais 3aTribolium castaneum 3aSitophilus granarius 3aTrogoderma variabile 3aexposure duration 3apyrethrins 3abrown rice 3astorage insects 3aprogeny 3adeltamethrin 3ainsect control 3aimagos 3amortality 3aSitophilus oryzae 0aadults1 aAthanassiou, Christos G.1 aArthur, Frank H.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2015 June, v. 108, no. 3 p.1416-1412wJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/617263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov0603Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/JEE%20%202015%20%20108-3%20%201416-1421%20%20Kavallieratos%20et%20al.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006200144245020700206300002000413520156900433592002802002650000802030650002102038650002702059650001602086650001702102650002502119650001602144650001702160650002802177650001302205650001902218650001302237650000902250650001602259650001502275650002402290650001402314650002202328650001102350650001602361650003702377653001702414653004502431700001802476700002302494700002402517700002002541700002302561700007102584700001602655773014202671856007802813852000902891655001202900IND60677919420221118073940.0191213e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067791942DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b144872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamsipur, Mojtaba1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6560-481510aAptamer-Based Fluorescent Biosensing of Adenosine Triphosphate and Cytochrome c via Aggregation-Induced Emission Enhancement on Novel Label-Free DNA-Capped Silver Nanoclusters/Graphene Oxide Nanohybrids  ap. 46077-46089.  aFour fluorescent DNA-stabilized fluorescent silver nanoclusters (DNA–AgNCs) were designed and synthesized with differences in lengths of cytosine-rich DNA strand (as the stabilizing agent) and target-specific strand DNA aptamers for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and cytochrome c (Cyt c). After their nanohybrid formation with graphene oxide (GO), it was unexpectedly found that, depending on the composition of the base and length of the strand DNA aptamer, the fluorescence intensity of three of the nanohybrids significantly enhanced. Our experimental observations and quantum mechanical calculations provided an insight into the mechanisms underlying the behavior of DNA–AgNCs/GO nanohybrids. The enhanced fluorescence was found to be attributed to the aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIE) characteristic of the DNA–AgNCs adsorbed on the GO surface, as confirmed evidently by both fluorescence and transmission electron microscopies. The AIE is a result of hardness and oxidation properties of GO, which lead to enhanced argenophilic interaction and thus to increased Ag(I)–DNA complex shell aggregation. Consequently, two of the DNA–AgNCs/GO nanohybrids were successfully extended to construct highly selective, sensitive, label-free, and simple aptasensors for biosensing of ATP (LOD = 0.42 nM) and Cyt c (LOD = 2.3 nM) in lysed Escherichia coli DH5 α cells and mouse embryonic stem cells, respectively. These fundamental findings are expected to significantly influence the designing and engineering of new AgNCs/GO-based AIE biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaptasensors 3acytochrome c 3aembryonic stem cells 3aengineering 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahardness 3amice 3ananohybrids 3ananosilver 3anucleotide aptamers 3aoxidation 3aquantum mechanics 3asilver 3astabilizers 3atransmission electron microscopy 0ananoclusters 0aaggregation-induced emission enhancement1 aMolaei, Karam1 aMolaabasi, Fatemeh1 aHosseinkhani, Saman1 aTaherpour, Avat1 aSarparast, Morteza1 aMoosavifard, Seyyed Ebrahim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9706-25601 aBarati, Ali0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 11, no. 49 p.46077-46089dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b144873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01345naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245007900171300001800250520034500268592002800613650001300641650001100654650001100665650002300676650002700699650002300726650001100749700002000760700002100780773013500801856007400936852000901010655001201019IND60659988320221117181123.0190823e20130926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065998832DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc45930f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Salas, José A.10aFacile and efficient KOH-catalysed reduction of esters and tertiary amides  ap. 9758-9760.  aEsters and tertiary amides were efficiently reduced to their corresponding alcohols and amines in high yields under mild and environmentally friendly conditions.

Specifically at the beaches, predictions on sea-level rise, storms and flood risk from the North Sea have led to several big coastal defence projects. Management of sandy beaches is therefore a multi-faceted and complex endeavour, where the interests of several stakeholders need to be combined and where biodiversity should be taken into account.In this study, the biological value of the shallow Belgian coastal zone was derived based on a detailed and integrated dataset (1995–2011) of all available ecological information on macrobenthos, epibenthos, hyperbenthos and birds. The 67 km Belgian coastline was divided into an across-shore intertidal and shallow subtidal subzone, and into along-shore subzones of 250 m for benthic components and 3 km for birds. The intrinsic biological value of each subzone was then calculated using the biological valuation method, and the pertained score, ranging from very low to very high, was plotted accordingly in order to obtain a marine biological valuation map.Following trends were detected: (1) a strong mosaic pattern of biological value along the coastline; (2) a clear lack of (benthic) data at the eastern part of the Belgian coast; (3) a rather high biological value in around 70% of the shallow subtidal subzones, compared to the intertidal part; and (4) a high/very high biological value in intertidal zones located immediately to the east of the harbours of Nieuwpoort, Oostende and Zeebrugge.A detailed analysis of protected areas and areas under coastal flood risk indicated that biological valuation maps are very promising management tools for local decision-makers as they allow for an early integration of ‘natural/ecological values’ in policy implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3adata collection 3aecological value 3aissues and policy 3alittoral zone 3aplanning 3aprediction 3arisk 3asea level 3astakeholders 3astorms 3aNorth Sea1 aLaporta, Lia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4178-45371 aDeneudt, Klaas1 aStienen, Eric1 aDerous, Sofie1 aDegraer, Steven1 aVincx, Magda0 tOcean & coastal management.g2014 Aug., v. 96 p.61-72dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009500164300001600259520113000275592002801405650004401433650001701477650000801494650001101502650001401513650002301527650001701550650002001567650001801587650001401605650002501619650001201644650001401656650001401670650002401684650001301708653002801721653003101749653003201780653001701812653002301829700001501852700001701867700001601884700002101900773012501921856008302046852000902129655001202138IND60730649120221119225608.0210506e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073064912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yansu10aSpatially isolated cobalt oxide sites derived from MOFs for direct propane dehydrogenation  ap. 113-121.  aThe “active site isolation” strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOₓ@NC/S-1) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N₂ and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere. This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 °C. With intensive characterizations and experiments, it is indicated that the real active sites of CoOₓ@NC/S-1 are isolated CoO sites during the PDH process. In situ FT-IR spectroscopy shows the same intermediate product (Co-C₃H₇) during both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation, indicating that they have a reverse reaction process, and a reaction mechanism for PDH is proposed accordingly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aair 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt oxide 3adehydrogenation 3ahydrogenation 3aimidazole 3aintermediate product 3apropane 3apropylene 3apyrolysis 3areaction mechanisms 3azeolites 0aPropane dehydrogenation 0aMetal–organic frameworks 0aIsolated cobalt oxide sites 0aActive sites 0aReaction mechanism1 aSuo, Yujun1 aRen, Jin-Tao1 aWang, Zheng1 aYuan, Zhong-Yong0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 July 15, v. 594 p.113-121dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245008400155300001600239500001900255500001100274520090200285592002801187596003801215596003601253650001701289650001401306650001801320650002401338650001601362650002801378650001801406650002201424650001201446650002201458650001901480700002301499700002601522700002001548700001901568700001901587700001701606700002101623700002501644773013701669856007201806852000901878655001201887IND60715798320221119074621.0201103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071579832DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.22522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorn, Simon14aThe living dead: acknowledging life after tree death to stop forest degradation  ap. 505-512.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aGlobal sustainability agendas focus primarily on halting deforestation, yet the biodiversity crisis resulting from the degradation of remaining forests is going largely unnoticed. Forest degradation occurs through the loss of key ecological structures, such as dying trees and deadwood, even in the absence of deforestation. One of the main drivers of forest degradation is limited awareness by policy makers and the public on the importance of these structures for supporting forest biodiversity and ecosystem function. Here, we outline management strategies to protect forest health and biodiversity by maintaining and promoting deadwood, and propose environmental education initiatives to improve the general awareness of the importance of deadwood. Finally, we call for major reforms to forest management to maintain and restore deadwood; large, old trees; and other key ecological structures.  aPublisher supplied data  cAlexander von Humboldt Foundation  cGerman Environmental Foundation 3abiodiversity 3adead wood 3adeforestation 3aecological function 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental education 3aforest health 3aforest management 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3atree mortality1 aSeibold, Sebastian1 aLeverkus, Alexandro B1 aMichler, Thomas1 aMüller, Jörg1 aNoss, Reed F.,1 aStork, Nigel1 aVogel, Sebastian1 aLindenmayer, David B0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2020 Nov., v. 18, no. 9 p.505-512dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23083x1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.22523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012900172300001400301520161000315592002801925650001201953650000801965650001601973650002801989650001502017650001002032650001702042650001502059650002402074650001102098651001602109653002002125653001902145653001502164653002302179653001202202653001602214700001802230700002102248773008902269856009002358852000902448655001202457IND60593373620221119142352.0201125e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059337362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.04.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Wha Me10aFactors affecting ambient endotoxin and particulate matter concentrations around air vents of subway stations in South Korea  ap. 45-51.  aLevels of airborne endotoxins and particulate matter less than 10 μm and 2.5 μm in diameter (PM) were measured in the air vents of subway stations in Seoul, South Korea, and factors affecting both pollutants were analyzed. The measurements were completed from March 2016 to February 2017 for eight air vents situated at the ground level around the subway stations. A total of 166 air samples were collected and analyzed using the kinetic limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Endotoxin levels ranged from not detected to 1.986 EU m⁻³, with a mean of 0.227 EU m⁻³. The results showed significantly different PM levels from the measurements reported by AIRKOREA as part of the comprehensive air quality index. This can be attributed to different sampling sites in the same area. Endotoxin levels tended to be higher in fall compared to summer. Airborne bacteria levels showed a pattern similar to the endotoxin levels, but no significant association was reported between them. The levels of endotoxins around air vents with a glass cover and streets that allowed smoking were significantly higher than those not containing a walled barrier and streets in which smoking was prohibited. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the factors affecting endotoxin levels comprised air vents with a glass cover (coefficient = 0.106, p = 0.014) and season (coefficient = 0.062, p < 0.0001). Therefore, installing barriers on the air vents and prohibiting smoking in streets to which the vents open may be effective ways to lessen exposure to airborne endotoxin levels around air vents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLimulus 3aair 3aair quality 3aairborne microorganisms 3aendotoxins 3aglass 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aregression analysis 3asummer 3aSouth Korea 0aAir vent system 0aSubway station 0aEndotoxins 0aParticulate matter 0aSmoking 0aSouth Korea1 aPark, Dong Uk1 aHwang, Sŭng-ho,0 tChemosphere.g2018 Aug., v. 205 p.45-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.04.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014200169300001600311520121900327592002801546650002501574650002301599650002301622650001901645650001001664650002301674650004301697650001101740650002201751650004401773650001301817650003001830650001001860653001901870653003701889653001501926653001701941700001701958700001801975700001601993700001802009700001902027700001502046700001902061773016402080856008602244852000902330655001202339IND60527933520221120223309.0190416e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052793352DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61098-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHAO, Xiu-mei10aSeparation and purification of deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin from wheat culture using a simple two-step silica gel column chromatography  ap. 694-701.  aDeoxynivalenol (DON) is a type B trichothecenes mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium species, often found in foodstuffs for humans and animals. DON is in great demand for the toxicological researches both in vivo and in vitro. In this work, wheat culture was inoculated with a Fusarium graminearum PH-1 strain for DON production. The solvent system for crude extraction was acetonitrile-water (84:16, v/v). A simple two-step silica gel column chromatography was employed to separate the DON mycotoxin from wheat culture, combined with preparative high performance liquid chromatography (preparative HPLC) to purify the compound. The solvent system for the second silica gel column chromatography was methylene chloride-methanol (17:1, v/v), which provided a good elution effect selected on thin layer chromatography (TLC). The target compound was identified by HPLC, and the chemical structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A total of 433 mg of purified DON was obtained from 1 kg of wheat culture, with a purity of 99.01%.

We aimed to determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were found in quantities of 0.57 ± 0.22 and 1.95 ± 0.43 ng/g, respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and associated markers. The proteomics results indicate that the consequences of imidacloprid treatment are complex, and the marker changes are associated with metabolic and neurological diseases and olfaction disruption. This study provides important markers and can help to explain the widely held assumptions from biological observations.The major finding is that all markers of the mevalonate pathway were substantially downregulated due to the chronic imidacloprid exposure. The disbalance of mevalonate pathway has many important consequences. We suggest the mechanism associated with the novel toxicogenic effect of imidacloprid. The results are helpful to explain that imidacloprid impairs the cognitive functions and possesses the delayed and time cumulative effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus terrestris 3aadverse effects 3abiosynthesis 3achronic exposure 3afatty acids 3aimidacloprid 3alaboratory experimentation 3ametabolites 3anervous system diseases 3apollinators 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asmell 3asugars 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aterpenoids 0aImidacloprid-olefin 0aPesticide exposure 0aEndocrine disruptor 0aBombus terrestris 0aProteomics 0aTerpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway1 aSopko, Bruno1 aTalacko, Pavel1 aHarant, Karel1 aKadlikova, Klara1 aHalesova, Tatana1 aRiddellova, Katerina1 aPekas, Apostolos0 tJournal of proteomics.g2019 Mar. 30, v. 196 p.69-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2018.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245014100159300001400300520157700314592002801891650001301919650001101932650001501943650001401958650001501972650001301987650001302000650000902013650001502022653001702037653001502054653001802069700002102087700002002108700002102128773009702149856007102246852000902317655001202326IND60119178120221119140353.0141206s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011917812DNAL7 a10.1071/MF132092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKendrick, Alan J.10aSpatial and temporal patterns in the distribution of large bivalves in a permanently open temperate estuary: implications for management  ap. 41-49.  aTo inform management, baseline ecological studies in estuaries must be implemented at spatial scales that accommodate both environmental gradients and likely anthropogenic pressures. We describe fine-scale spatial patterns in the abundances and size structure of large infaunal bivalves inhabiting shallow sand habitats in the lower reaches of a relatively undisturbed, permanently open, temperate estuary. Sampling over 3 years at 19 sites during the autumn, when freshwater influence was minimal, revealed that Soletellina alba, Wallucina assimilis and Paphies elongata were consistently the most abundant of nine species present. Although most abundant near the ocean entrance, S. alba was distributed widely and shells of differing lengths, and presumably ages, were present at most sites, suggesting that this species recruited continuously throughout the study area when conditions were appropriate. In contrast, W. assimilis and P. elongata occurred only near or in the entrance channel of the Nornalup Inlet in areas where seagrass rhizomes may grow and where oceanic influences caused relatively turbulent conditions, respectively. Sediment structure appeared to exert only a moderate and intermittent influence on the bivalve assemblage at some sites where particularly large grain sizes occurred. This study provides important baseline information on the distribution and abundance of large bivalves in this estuary. These species are likely to be important in the trophic ecology of this system and are potential indicators of disturbance and ecosystem health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aautumn 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3arhizomes 3asand 3aseagrasses 0aconservation 0amonitoring 0asoft-sediment1 aRule, Michael J.1 aLavery, Paul S.1 aHyndes, Glenn A.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2015, v. 66, no. 1 p.41-49dCSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF132093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245013000202300002000332520131700352592002801669650001201697650002001709650001401729650002201743650001901765650002201784650002501806650001101831650001401842650001301856650001701869651001501886700001801901700001801919700002301937700002501960773015501985856008202140852000902222655001202231IND60746990320221118113726.0210811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074699032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13605-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Baijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1153-145910aAssessing the mechanism of energy efficiency and energy poverty alleviation based on environmental regulation policy measures  ap. 40858-40870.  aThis work aims to assess multidimensional energy poverty and energy efficiency for environmental policy measures using data envelopment analysis (DEA), a DEA-Like mathematical composite indicator applied on a dataset based on multiple sets of variables from South Asian economies. The multidimensional energy poverty index (MEPI) is computed to analyze the combining effects and energy poverty in these countries. Simultaneously, South Asia’s metropolitan areas’ population rose by 130 million between 2001 and 2011 and is projected to expand by approximately 250 million by 2030. The findings reveal that endogenous increasing population shocks account for about 72% of energy use. In contrast, the long-term effects of remittance revenue, economic growth, and urbanization on energy use are approximately 20%, 8.25%, and 0.03%, respectively. This work advocates more coordinated and innovative policies to eliminate energy poverty. It can act as a base for policymakers and government officials to make efficient policies and enforce them properly in the regional power sector. Policies should be designed around a smarter use of biomass for cooking, alternate sources for domestic energy production, increased programs for biomass-based cookstoves, and periodic regional-level energy database development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy poverty 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental policy 3aincome 3apollution 3aresearch 3aurbanization 3aSouth Asia1 aLiu, Shaochen1 aWang, Jingwei1 aTahir, Shaharuddin1 aPatwary, Ataul Karim0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 30 p.40858-40870dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13605-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01323naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013400161300002000295520030100315592002800616650002400644650002700668650002300695650002300718650002000741700001700761700002400778773013600802856007400938852000901012655001201021IND60659988720221117181203.0190823e20131031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065998872DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc45938a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlaasar, Mohamed12aA new room temperature dark conglomerate mesophase formed by bent-core molecules combining 4-iodoresorcinol with azobenzene units  ap. 11062-11064.  aThe first bent-core molecules comprising 4-iodoresorcinol as the central core unit and incorporating azobenzene units have been synthesized.

Our quantitative understanding of the bioactivity and bioavailability of the various members of each vitamin family has increased markedly, but many issues remain to be resolved concerning the reporting and use of analytical data. Modern methods of vitamin analysis rely heavily on chromatographic techniques that generally allow the measurement of the individual chemical forms of vitamins. Typical applications of food analysis include the evaluation of shelf life and storage stability, monitoring of nutrient retention during food processing, developing food composition databases and data needed for food labeling, assessing dietary adequacy and evaluating epidemiological relationships between diet and disease. Although the usage of analytical data varies depending on the situation, important issues regarding how best to present and interpret the data in light of the presence of multiple vitamers are common to all aspects of food analysis. In this review, we will evaluate the existence of vitamers that exhibit differences in bioactivity or bioavailability, consider when there is a need to address differences in bioactivity or bioavailability of vitamers, and then consider alternative approaches and possible ways to improve the reporting of data. Major examples are taken from literature and experience with vitamin B₆ and folate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abioavailability 3achemical species 3achromatography 3adiet 3afolic acid 3afood analysis 3afood labeling 3afood processing 3amonitoring 3anutrient databanks 3anutrient retention 3apyridoxine 3ashelf life 0aVitamin 0avitamers 0abioactivity 0aanalysis 0adatabases0 tFood & nutrition research.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 56, no. 1 p.5809-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:6165x1654-661X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3402/fnr.v56i0.58093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245004200167300001800209500001900227500002000246520184900266592002802115596009702143596005602240596003702296596003602333650002002369650002302389650002802412650001202440650002102452650001202473650001502485650001102500650001402511650001002525650002102535651001102556700002002567700005602587700006002643773012202703856007902825852000902904655001202913IND60707202820221116173356.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070720282DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.133832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrosdidier, Marie10aLandscape epidemiology of ash dieback  ap. 1789-1799.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAsh dieback is induced by Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, an invasive pathogenic fungus. It is causing severe damage to European ash populations. However, the local environment, such as climate or site conditions, is known to affect ash dieback. We studied the landscape epidemiology of the disease on a 22 km² area in north‐eastern France at two stages of the invasion process using Bayesian spatio‐temporal models fitted with integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). Several features characterizing disease severity, crown dieback, frequency of collar canker and density of infected leaf debris in the litter were determined on a regular grid over a 3.5 × 6.5 km area. We first analysed the effect of landscape features on the disease establishment stage in 2012, 2 years after the first report of the disease in the area, and then on further disease development, in 2016–2018. Landscape features had little impact on the disease at the establishment stage, but strongly determined its further development. Local fragmentation of tree cover was the most important factor, with trees that are isolated or in hedges far less affected than trees in a forest environment. We showed that they were subjected to different microclimates, with higher crown temperatures unfavourable to pathogen development. Low host density strongly reduced disease development. The presence of large ash populations in the vicinity affected local disease severity up to several hundred metres. Synthesis. We showed that the landscape characteristics strongly affect the development and spread of ash dieback. The disease is far less severe in forest conditions when ash density is low or in open canopies such as hedges and isolated trees. Ash trees are often in these types of landscapes, which should strongly limit the overall impact of ash dieback.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgence Nationale de Sécurité Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de l'Environnement et du Travail  cDépartement de la Santé des Forêts, DGAL, France  aUMR1136cMinistry of Agriculture  cFrench National Research Agency 3aBayesian theory 3aFraxinus excelsior 3aHymenoscyphus fraxineus 3adieback 3adisease severity 3aforests 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3apathogens 3atrees 3avirulent strains 3aFrance1 aScordia, Thomas1 aIoos, Renaud1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9359-50981 aMarçais, Benoit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8107-644X0 tjournal of ecology.g2020 Sept., v. 108, no. 5 p.1789-1799dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.133833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100001600163245016200179300001800341500001500359520105400374592002801428650001501456650002801471650001001499650001601509650000701525650002201532650002601554653001601580653001601596700001701612700001501629700001501644773010101659856004501760852000901805655001201814IND50090289120221120095226.0140612e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009028912DNAL7 a246593862pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2013012912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Xuejin10aDetermination of plant growth regulators in pears by microwave‐assisted extraction and liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  ap. 1352-1358.  a2019-12-05  aA new method for the determination of six plant growth regulators, 3‐indolylacetic acid, 3‐indolepropionic acid, 2‐naphthoxyacetic acid, 2,4‐dicholrophenoxyacetic acid, 1‐naphthlcetic acid, and methyl naphthalene‐1‐acetate, in pears was established by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.

Under optimized conditions, the average recoveries (five replicates) for six plant growth regulators (spiked at 0.01, 0.05, and 0.5 mg/kg) ranged from 78.9 to 118.0%, and the RSDs were 1.4–10.3%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aionization 3aplant growth substances 3apears 3aformic acid 3apH 3amass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aTang, Lijuan1 aDan, Ding,1 aWan, Yiqun0 tJournal of separation science.g2014 June, v. 37, no. 11 p.1352-1358dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.201301291  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013600159300002000295520141000315592002801725650002201753650001501775650001301790650001901803650001701822650001301839650001601852650001101868650001101879653002501890653002501915653002301940653002101963653001801984653003802002700002202040700002502062700001902087700002002106700002702126700001802153700002002171700001902191773012702210856007502337852000902412655001202421IND60527715420170710000000.0160715e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052771542DNAL7 a10.1021/am503126k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanthony, Cloé10aElementary Surface Chemistry during CuO/Al Nanolaminate-Thermite Synthesis: Copper and Oxygen Deposition on Aluminum (111) Surfaces  ap. 15086-15097.  aThe surface chemistry associated with the synthesis of energetic nanolaminates controls the formation of the critical interfacial layers that dominate the performances of nanothermites. For instance, the interaction of Al with CuO films or CuO with Al films needs to be understood to optimize Al/CuO nanolaminates. To that end, the chemical mechanisms occurring during early stages of molecular CuO adsorption onto crystalline Al(111) surfaces are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, leading to the systematic determination of their reaction enthalpies and associated activation energies. We show that CuO undergoes dissociative chemisorption on Al(111) surfaces, whereby the Cu and O atoms tend to separate from each other. Both Cu and O atoms form islands with different properties. Copper islanding fosters Cu insertion (via surface site exchange mechanism) into the subsurface, while oxygen islands remain stable at the surface. Above a critical local oxygen coverage, aluminum atoms are extracted from the Al surface, leading to oxygen–aluminum intermixing and the formation of aluminum oxide (γ-alumina). For Cu and O co-deposition, copper promotes oxygen–aluminum interaction by oxygen segregation and separates the resulting oxide from the Al substrate by insertion into Al and stabilization below the oxide front, preventing full mixing of Al, Cu, and O species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3acupric oxide 3aenthalpy 3amethodology 3amixing 3aoxygen 0aAl/CuO nanolaminates 0aAl/CuO nanothermites 0aaluminum oxidation 0aDFT calculations 0aCu on Al(111) 0aCu and O co-deposition on Al(111)1 aGuiltat, Mathilde1 aDucéré, Jean Marie1 aVerdier, Agnes1 aHémeryck, Anne1 aDjafari-Rouhani, Mehdi1 aRossi, Carole1 aChabal, Yves J.1 aEstève, Alain0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Sept. 10, v. 6, no. 17 p.15086-15097dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam503126k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245002800167300001300195520123700208592002801445653002501473653002001498653003201518653003001550653002701580653003601607653002501643653003901668653003001707773008801737856008101825852000901906655001201915IND60527933820221120062803.0160715e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052793382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jop.2015.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Zeng-Zhao10aOn palaeogeographic map  ap. 1-27.  aThe palaeogeographic map is a graphic representation of physical geographical characteristics in geological history periods and human history periods.

Its main characteristics are difficulties in understanding language and localizing sound. Presbycusis is an increasingly critical public health problem, but the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death caused by iron‐ and reactive oxygen species‐induced lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis is related to many pathological processes, but whether it participates in the degeneration of the auditory system remains unclear. To investigate this, we measured iron levels in a simulated ageing model established by the addition of d‐galactose (d‐gal). We found, for the first time, that iron accumulated within cells and that the ultrastructural features of ferroptosis appeared in the auditory cortex with ageing. These changes were accompanied by upregulation of iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP‐2), which led to an increase in transferrin receptor 1 (TfR‐1), thus increasing iron entry into cells and potentially leading to ferroptosis. In addition, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the occurrence of mitochondrial DNA common deletions (CDs) increased, neuron degeneration appeared, and glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased. Furthermore, we found that treatment with the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) and knockdown of IRP‐2 both relieved ferroptosis during the simulated ageing process, thus achieving a partial protective effect to delay ageing. In summary, we describe here the first discovery that age‐related iron deposition and ferroptosis may be associated with auditory cortex neurodegeneration. Relieving ferroptosis might thus be a new intervention strategy for age‐related hearing loss.  aPublisher supplied data  a81873700cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81230021cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3achelating agents 3acortex 3adeferoxamine 3aferroptosis 3agalactose 3aglutathione 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxygen 3aprotective effect 3apublic health 3aregulatory proteins 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atransferrin receptors1 aLi, Dan1 aSun, Hai‐Ying1 aWang, Wen‐Wen1 aWu, Han1 aKong, Wen1 aKong, Wei‐Jia0 tFEBS journal.g2020 Nov., v. 287, no. 21 p.4747-4766dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.152663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05444naa a2201213 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005400149245017500203300001300378520260700391592002802998650001303026650002603039650002203065650001903087650001803106650001103124650002203135650002003157650001103177650003103188650002003219650001803239650001003257650001703267650001703284650001503301650002103316650002803337650001303365650001503378650002003393653001003413653001003423653001003433653000803443653001003451653000703461653000703468653000703475653001103482653001103493653001103504653001203515653000903527653000903536653000703545653000803552653000903560653001003569653000803579653001103587653000803598653000803606653000703614653000803621653000703629653000903636653001403645653001003659653000703669653000903676653001003685653001003695653001003705653001003715653001203725653000703737653001103744653001003755653000903765653000703774653000703781653000803788653001203796653000803808653000903816653000803825653000803833653000803841653000903849653000803858653000803866653000903874653001403883653000803897653000803905653000803913653000903921653000803930700001603938700001603954700001603970700001903986700001704005773010304022856008404125852000904209655001204218IND60628736420221119205551.0190206e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062873642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2018.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7474-605710aIntegrative hepatic metabolomics and proteomics reveal insights into the mechanism of different feed efficiency with high or low dietary forage levels in Holstein heifers  ap. 1-13.  aFeed efficiency (FE) can be affected by dietary composition, management, and metabolic conditions. The liver is the central metabolic organ in cattle; however, specific metabolic changes in the liver under different dietary forage levels have not been clarified. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the hepatic physiology mechanisms of high or low dietary forage levels (80% or 20% forage, namely S80 and S20) on FE in dairy heifers using integrative metabolomic and proteomic methods. Feed efficiency was lower in the S80 group than the S20 group. A total of 29 metabolites and 60 proteins were significantly different between the liver samples of the two groups. Fourteen selected proteins were analyzed using parallel reaction monitoring to confirm the reliability of proteomic analysis. Integrative functional analysis of differentially expressed metabolites/proteins confirmed the enhanced hepatic ability of fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, ketone bodies synthesis, and oxidative stress defense in the S80 heifers. These metabolic pathways are associated with FE in ruminants. Thus, our results suggested that the aforementioned metabolic pathways may be responsible for the reduced FE in heifers fed high levels of forage.Improving the efficiency of animal production is a continuously urgent mission of all agricultural producers. Limit-feeding high concentrate diets to heifers is considered as an effective way to improve feed efficiency in heifers' raising, which can not only decrease the feeding and management cost but also relieve some environmental problems. However, the detailed metabolic and physiological changes and mechanisms associated with this strategy remain to be further characterized even some transcriptomics and microbiology work have been done. For extending the knowledge towards this strategy, an integrative metabolomic and proteomic method was used to investigate the hepatic physiology mechanisms of high or low dietary forage levels on feed efficiency in dairy heifers. Enhanced hepatic ability of fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, ketone bodies synthesis, and oxidative stress defense were found in high forage consumed heifers, which were all related to energy utilization in ruminants and might be responsible for the reduced feed efficiency. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating the hepatic metabolism in high or low forage fed heifers may help to design alternative feeding or management strategies that improve feed efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aamino acid metabolism 3aanimal production 3abeta oxidation 3adairy heifers 3aenergy 3afeed concentrates 3afeed conversion 3aforage 3agene expression regulation 3agluconeogenesis 3aketone bodies 3aliver 3ametabolomics 3amicrobiology 3amonitoring 3aoxidative stress 3apentose phosphate cycle 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3atranscriptomics 0aACAT1 0aACOX1 0aACSS3 0aADG 0aALDOB 0aBP 0aCC 0aCP 0aCYP1A1 0aCYP2E1 0aCYP2J2 0aCYP450s 0aDSPs 0aDHAP 0aDM 0aDMI 0aDPMs 0aECHS1 0aETC 0aF1,6BP 0aF6P 0aFDR 0aFE 0aG3P 0aGC 0aGCSH 0aGC-TOF/MS 0aGLUD1 0aGO 0aGOT2 0aGSTA3 0aGSTM1 0aGSTM2 0aGSTP1 0aHMG-CoA 0aHK 0aHMGCS2 0aiTRAQ 0aKEGG 0aME 0aMF 0aND4 0aOPLS-DA 0aPCA 0aPCK1 0aPDV 0aPEP 0aPRM 0aPSPH 0aROS 0aSOD 0aSOD1 0aTCA cycle 0aTKT 0aTMR 0aTXN 0aUGDH 0aVIP1 aShi, Haitao1 aLi, Shengli1 aCao, Zhijun1 aYang, Hongjian1 aWang, Yajing0 tJournal of proteomics.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 194 p.1-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2018.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002100097024005000118040001800168100001800186245007800204300001600282500000900298500001500307520124600322592002801568650001401596650001901610650001701629650002001646650001301666650002101679650002001700651001401720653001501734700002001749773012101769852000901890856011201899856009702011961001302108655001202121991615590510742620221123002642.0191122e198705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870568622DNAL7 a10113/218302hdl7 a10.2134/agronj1987.00021962007900030010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarvel, G.

Knifed-in versus broadcast applications of 0, 56, 112, and 168 kg N ha⁻¹ were compared on Morex and Glenn cultivars in field experiments during 1981, 1982, and 1983 on a Hegne silty clay loam soil (fine, frigid Typic Calciaquolls). An additional cultivar, Robust, was added during 1983. Early plant, forage, and grain N concentrations, forage and grain yields, and percent plump kernels were measured. Cultivar and N rate main effects explained most differences in yield and malting quality after significant cultivar ✕ year, and N rate ✕ year interactions were found to be caused by differences in initial NO₃-N levels. Method of N application was not significant. Grain N concentrations never exceeded 21.6 g kg⁻¹, a maximum set by the malting industry, during the 3 yr. On the basis of grain yields and percent plump kernels, Glenn was superior to Morex overall, but in 1983, Robust surpassed both Glenn and Morex at all levels of applied N. Each cultivar attained high yield levels and maintained malting quality with careful N management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3asoil injection 3acrop quality 3aHordeum vulgare 3anitrogen 3ayield components 3amalting quality 3aMinnesota 0acrop yield1 aSeverson, R.

Through structure from motion (SfM) and multi-view-stereo (MVS) techniques, aerial imagery can provide a low-cost alternative compared to bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) surveys, as it offers additional important visual information and higher spatial resolution. Nevertheless, water refraction poses significant challenges on depth determination. Till now, this problem has been addressed through customized image-based refraction correction algorithms or by modifying the collinearity equation. In this article, in order to overcome the water refraction errors in a massive and accurate way, we employ machine learning tools, which are able to learn the systematic underestimation of the estimated depths. In particular, an SVR (support vector regression) model was developed, based on known depth observations from bathymetric LiDAR surveys, which is able to accurately recover bathymetry from point clouds derived from SfM-MVS procedures. Experimental results and validation were based on datasets derived from different test-sites, and demonstrated the high potential of our approach. Moreover, we exploited the fusion of LiDAR and image-based point clouds towards addressing challenges of both modalities in problematic areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aarchaeology 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3aengineering 3aequations 3ahydrology 3alidar 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asurveys1 aSkarlatos, Dimitrios 1 aGeorgopoulos, Andreas 1 aKarantzalos, Konstantinos 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Sept. 24, v. 11, no. 19dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111922253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009900169520189200268592002802160650001302188650001602201650001802217650001702235650001302252650001502265650003002280650001302310650001502323650002402338700002102362700002002383700002402403773013302427856008402560852000902644655001202653IND60771180420221116233826.0220325e20220310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077118042DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120303882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoivula, Minna 10aAccounting for Missing Pedigree Information with Single-Step Random Regression Test-Day Models  aGenomic selection is widely used in dairy cattle breeding, but still, single-step models are rarely used in national dairy cattle evaluations. New computing methods have allowed the utilization of very large genomic data sets. However, an unsolved model problem is how to build genomic- (G) and pedigree- (A₂₂) relationship matrices that satisfy the theoretical assumptions about the same scale and equal base populations. Incompatibility issues have also been observed in the manner in which the genetic groups are included in the model. In this study, we compared three approaches for accounting for missing pedigree information: (1) GT_H used the full Quaas and Pollak (QP) transformation for the genetic groups, including both the pedigree-based and the genomic-relationship matrices, (2) GT_A₂₂ used the partial QP transformation that omitted QP transformation in G⁻¹, and (3) GT_MF used the metafounder approach. In addition to the genomic models, (4) an official animal model with a unknown parent groups (UPG) from the QP transformation and (5) an animal model with the metafounder approach were used for comparison. These models were tested with Nordic Holstein test-day production data and models. The test-day data included 8.5 million cows with a total of 173.7 million records and 10.9 million animals in the pedigree, and there were 274,145 genotyped animals. All models used VanRaden method 1 in G and had a 30% residual polygenic proportion (RPG). The G matrices in GT_H and GT_A₂₂ were scaled to have an average diagonal equal to that of A₂₂. Comparisons between the models were based on Mendelian sampling terms and forward prediction validation using linear regression with solutions from the full- and reduced-data evaluations. Models GT_H and GT_A₂₂ gave very similar results in terms of overprediction. The MF approach showed the lowest bias.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aagriculture 3aanimal models 3adairy cattle 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3amarker-assisted selection 3apedigree 3aprediction 3aregression analysis1 aStrandén, Ismo 1 aAamand, Gert P.1 aMäntysaari, Esa A.0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Mar. 10, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120303883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04717naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245012500205300001800330500002000348520280800368592002803176596005803204596005803262596005803320596004903378650002403427650001103451650001903462650001403481650002303495650002203518650001103540650001503551650001603566700005503582700005703637700006403694700006003758700002303818700002603841700001703867700006503884700005703949773012804006856008004134852000904214655001204223IND60792477720221120053531.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079247772DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.137482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayo‐Payo, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5482-242X10aModelling the responses of partially migratory metapopulations to changing seasonal migration rates: From theory to data  ap. 1781-1796.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAmong‐individual and within‐individual variation in expression of seasonal migration versus residence is widespread in nature and could substantially affect the dynamics of partially migratory metapopulations inhabiting seasonally and spatially structured environments. However, such variation has rarely been explicitly incorporated into metapopulation dynamic models for partially migratory systems. We, therefore, lack general frameworks that can identify how variable seasonal movements, and associated season‐ and location‐specific vital rates, can control system persistence. We constructed a novel conceptual framework that captures full‐annual‐cycle dynamics and key dimensions of metapopulation structure for partially migratory species inhabiting seasonal environments. We conceptualize among‐individual variation in seasonal migration as two variable vital rates: seasonal movement probability and associated movement survival probability. We conceptualize three levels of within‐individual variation (i.e. plasticity), representing seasonal or annual variation in seasonal migration or lifelong fixed strategies. We formulate these concepts as a general matrix model, which is customizable for diverse life‐histories and seasonal landscapes. To illustrate how variable seasonal migration can affect metapopulation growth rate, demographic structure and vital rate elasticities, we parameterize our general models for hypothetical short‐ and longer‐lived species. Analyses illustrate that elasticities of seasonal movement probability and associated survival probability can sometimes equal or exceed those of vital rates typically understood to substantially influence metapopulation dynamics (i.e. seasonal survival probability or fecundity), that elasticities can vary non‐linearly, and that metapopulation outcomes depend on the level of within‐individual plasticity. We illustrate how our general framework can be applied to evaluate the consequences of variable and changing seasonal movement probability by parameterizing our models for a real partially migratory metapopulation of European shags Gulosus aristotelis assuming lifelong fixed strategies. Given observed conditions, metapopulation growth rate was most elastic to breeding season adult survival of the resident fraction in the dominant population. However, given doubled seasonal movement probability, variation in survival during movement would become the primary driver of metapopulation dynamics. Our general conceptual and matrix model frameworks, and illustrative analyses, thereby highlight complex ways in which structured variation in seasonal migration can influence dynamics of partially migratory metapopulations, and pave the way for diverse future theoretical and empirical advances.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/M005186/1cUK Natural Environment Research Council  aNE/R000859/1cUK Natural Environment Research Council  aNE/R016429/1cUK Natural Environment Research Council  cRoyal Society University Research Fellowship 3aGulosus aristotelis 3aadults 3aanimal ecology 3afecundity 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory species 3amodels 3aplasticity 3aprobability1 aAcker, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3815-772X1 aBocedi, Greta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9131-66701 aTravis, Justin M.

In this review, statistical analysis of different BC physico–chemical properties was conducted. It was observed that woody materials are the most suitable for preparing BCs, among many other potential raw materials such as food wastes and agricultural materials. Currently BCs are produced through a variety of thermal treatment processes between 300 and 900 °C, among which slow pyrolysis is widely used due to its moderate operating conditions and optimization of BC yields. Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) is also an effective approach for BC production under certain conditions. As pyrolysis temperature is increased, the carbon content, ash content, surface area, and pore volume tend to be increased while the yield, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen content, and H/C and O/C molar ratios tend to decrease. The economic feasibility of BCs depends on a range of factors from raw material price to efficient production technologies. Thus, the overall cost equation of a pilot BC production plant together with the cost equation for BC regeneration has been proposed. The future research directions of BCs are also elaborated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acost analysis 3aeconomic feasibility 3aequations 3afood waste 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollution 3aprices 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3aremediation 3astatistical analysis 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aBiochar 0aBiosorbent 0aFeedstocks 0aCost analysis 0aSlow pyrolysis 0aPilot plant1 aZhou, John L.1 aNgo, Huu Hao1 aGuo, Wenshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5542-28580 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Jan., v. 84 p.76-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245007500177300001600252500001400268520120900282592002801491650002901519650001201548650001501560650001101575650001701586650001801603650001401621650000901635650001401644650001201658650001001670650001101680650001701691650001001708651001301718653001301731653001901744653002401763653001801787700002001805700002201825700002301847700002201870700002201892773011101914856008502025852000902110655001202119IND60693106720221121043718.0200505e20000101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069310672DNAL7 a10.1080/09524622.2000.97534402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDOS SANTOS, MANUEL E.10aSound production by the lusitanian toad fish, halobatrachus didactylus  ap. 309-321.  aNAL-light  aSeveral batrachoidids have been known to produce sounds associated with courtship and agonistic interactions, and their repertoires have been studied acoustically and behaviourally. In contrast, sound production of the Lusitanian toadfish Halobatrachus didactylus, although often noted, has not been acoustically studied. This sedentary predator of Northeastern Atlantic coastal waters is usually found in sandy and muddy substrates, under rocks or crevices. Sound recordings were made in Ria Formosa, a lagoon complex in southern Portugal. The sound producing apparatus was studied in adult individuals of both sexes captured by local fishermen. It is shown that this species produces acoustic emissions similar to other batrachoidids. It produces a long, rhythmical, tonal sound, often in choruses, which is comparable to the boatwhistle or hum signals of Opsanus and Porichthys, and a complex of signals that were classified as grunts, croaks, double croaks and mixed calls (‘grunt-croak’). As in other toadfishes, H. didactylus presents sonic muscles connected to a bi-lobed swimbladder. Asynchronous contractions of the sonic muscles were detected when massaging the ventral surface of the fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalobatrachus didactylus 3aOpsanus 3aPorichthys 3aadults 3abioacoustics 3acoastal water 3acourtship 3afish 3afishermen 3amuscles 3arocks 3asounds 3aswim bladder 3atoads 3aPortugal 0atoadfish 0aBatrachoididae 0aacoustic repertoire 0asonic muscles1 aMODESTO, TERESA1 aMATOS, RICARDO J.1 aGROBER, MATTHEW S.1 aOliveira, Rui F.,1 aCANÁRIO, ADELINO0 tBioacoustics.g2000 Jan. 1, v. 10, no. 4 p.309-321dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:21583x2165-05867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2000.97534403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245006900131300001800200500001900218520125500237592002801492650002401520650000901544650001001553650002101563650001201584653002301596653004101619700002101660773015401681852000901835655001201844IND60723777920221120214551.0210117e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072377792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJogi, Jyotsana10aEconomics of Okra Production in Bilspur District of Chhattisgarh  ap. 4918-4922.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study was conducted with a view to economics of okra production in Bilspur district of Chhattisgarh.

By placing fluorescent reporters under the direct regulation of the promoter region of specific marker proteins, these models can localize and characterize very specific cell types. One important application of transgenic species is the study of the cytoarchitecture of the nervous system. Neurofluorescent reporters can be used to study the structural patterns of nerves in the central or peripheral nervous system in vivo, as well as phenomena involving embryologic or adult neurogenesis, injury, degeneration, and recovery. Furthermore, crucial molecular factors can also be screened via the transgenic approach, which may eventually play a major role in the development of therapeutic strategies against diseases like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. This review describes currently available reporters and their uses in the literature as well as potential neural markers that can be leveraged to create additional, robust transgenic models for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanimal models 3afluorescence 3anerve tissue 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3aperipheral nervous system 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3arecombinant DNA 3atherapeutics 3atransgenic animals 0aThy1-YFP 0aNeurofluorescent transgenic mice 0aNestin 0aNerve 0a5-HT 0aACh 0aAkt 0aMapttm1(EGFP)kit 0aβIII-tubulin-YFP 0aBAC 0aBGEM 0aBMC 0aCCK-RGC 0aCFP 0aCGRP 0aCGX 0aChATBAC-EGFP 0aChAT-ChR2-EYFP BAC 0aCLSM 0aCNPase 0aCNPase-GFP 0aCNS 0aCp 0aCPZ 0aCre 0aCRISPR-Cas9 0aCST 0aCTb-594 0aD1-MSN 0aDAPI 0adLGN 0aDrd1a-EGFP 0aDrd2-EGFP 0aDRG 0aED 0aEAE 0aEDL 0aEGFP 0aEGFR 0aEGL 0aEn1-Cre 0aENS 0aEPC 0aERCC1 0aFRAP 0aGCL 0aGFAP 0aGFP 0aGFP-Cre 0aGPe 0aHDB 0aHoxb4 0ahPRPH1-G 0aHSV-1 0aIBA 0aIF 0aiGABASnFR 0aINL 0aIVCM 0aLASIK 0aMAP2 0aMAPK 0aMath1 0aMIP 0aml 0aMNU 0aMOB 0aMP 0amRNA 0aNE 0aNeu-N 0aNF 0aNF-H 0aNF-200 0aNGF 0aNGFR 0aNGFpr 0aNK 0aNK-1 0aNMPP1 0anNGFP 0aNPC 0aNPY 0aNSE 0aOCT 0aOEC 0aONL 0aOVA 0ap75NTR 0aPACAP 0aPD 0aPI3K 0aPiezo2 0aPKH26 0aPNS 0aPSD95 0arAAV/EnvA 0aRAG 0arAION 0aRFP 0aRT-PCR 0aSC 0aSCG 0aSirt1 0aSMN 0aSNr 0aSP 0aSprr1a 0aStr 0aSTZ 0aTAG-1 0aTG 0aThy1 0aTrKA 0aTRPA1 0aTRPC 0aTRPM 0aTRPM8 0aTRPML 0aTRPP 0aTRPV 0aTRPV1 0aTPM 0aUCHL1-EGFP 0aVAChT 0aVEGF 0aVIP 0avLGN 0aWnt1 0aWP 0aXFP 0aYFP1 aSantosa, Samuel M.1 aChawla, Neeraj1 aIvakhnitskaia, Evguenia1 adel Pino, Matthew1 aGiakas, Sebastian1 aNadel, Arnold1 aBontu, Sneha1 aTambe, Arjun1 aGuo, Kai1 aHan, Kyu-Yeon1 aCortina, Maria Soledad1 aYu, Charles1 aRosenblatt, Mark I.1 aChang, Jin-Hong1 aAzar, Dimitri T.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 July, v. 1864, no. 7 p.129595-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2020.1295953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008700162300001800249520135800267592002801625650002201653650001101675650001101686650002201697650001601719650003701735650001101772650001101783650001201794650001501806650001101821650001601832650001301848700002101861773012201882856008102004852000902085655001202094IND60627425620221117021539.0190128e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062742562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2687-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaly, Jean10aSpark Plasma synthesis and diffusion of Cu and Ag in vanadium mixed valence oxides  ap. 6391-6399.  aSpark Plasma sintering (SPS) technique allows powders to be compacted at low temperature with a very short holding time. The powder loaded into a carbon die is heated via direct current pulses and simultaneously submitted to an uni-axial pressure of several MPa. Full density of the sample is achieved within minutes. This process is used to study Cu and Ag metals interactions with V₂O₅ oxide. Syntheses of MₓV₂O₅ phases (M = Cu, Ag) have been achieved within minutes. Thus Cu and Ag atoms penetrate microcrystals of V₂O₅ oxide at a high speed, shearing its crystal network and simultaneously rebuilding the crystal structures of the prototype networks β, β′, ε or δ MₓV₂O₅. To account for the formation of these phases identified by X-ray diffraction, structural mechanisms are proposed. Cu and Ag atomic diffusion parameters have been determined from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electron micropobe analysis (EPMA) line scans. High values of diffusion coefficients have been determined. Cu atoms diffuse faster than Ag, DCᵤ ≈ 4 × 10⁻⁸ m²/s and DAg ≈ 0.5–1 × 10⁻⁹ m²/s in ε and δ MₓV₂O₅ phases, respectively. Their formation may also be used as a model for further investigations into the diffusion mechanisms of atoms in solids and for a better understanding of the SPS process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3adiffusivity 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amodels 3aoxides 3apowders 3aprototypes 3asilver 3atemperature 3avanadium1 aMonchoux, J.

In all experiments, a current density of approximately 723 A/cm² was applied to the specimen and used in a temperature range of 1,673–1,973 K. From the results of X-ray diffraction analysis, the product phases formed between Nb and C were found to be Nb₂C and NbC. The growth of product layers significantly increased in the presence of current. However, the thickness of the product layer did not change in the current direction in the SPS. The activation energies for the formation of the Nb₂C and NbC layers were calculated to be 298 ± 4 kJ/mol and 282 ± 3 kJ/mol in the presence of current, which were similar values compared to the activation energies of 300 ± 5 kJ/mol and 285 ± 2 kJ/mol in the absence of current, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3atemperature1 aYasuhara, Masahide1 aKuramoto, Taku1 aKodera, Yasuhiro1 aOhyanagi, Manshi1 aMunir, Zuhair A.0 tJournal of materials science.g2008 Oct., v. 43, no. 19 p.6400-6405dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-008-2758-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05538naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006100145245010600206300001800312500002000330520234200350592002802692596002702720596003002747596003302777596002902810596004202839596004102881650002102922650001902943650002002962650001802982650001403000650001303014700006503027700002603092700002503118700005803143700006603201700002303267700005503290700002203345700006503367700006003432700005803492700002103550700007403571700006303645700001803708700001803726700006703744700001703811700006903828700002003897700002203917700002303939700006903962700002204031700005704053700001704110700002204127700001604149700002204165700001704187700001604204700006704220700001904287700001904306700005904325700005404384700006504438773012804503856008004631852000904711655001204720IND60792477920221120053455.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079247792DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.137582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeogan, Katharine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1801-741210aVariation and correlation in the timing of breeding of North Atlantic seabirds across multiple scales  ap. 1797-1812.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTiming of breeding, an important driver of fitness in many populations, is widely studied in the context of global change, yet despite considerable efforts to identify environmental drivers of seabird nesting phenology, for most populations we lack evidence of strong drivers. Here we adopt an alternative approach, examining the degree to which different populations positively covary in their annual phenology to infer whether phenological responses to environmental drivers are likely to be (a) shared across species at a range of spatial scales, (b) shared across populations of a species or (c) idiosyncratic to populations. We combined 51 long‐term datasets on breeding phenology spanning 50 years from nine seabird species across 29 North Atlantic sites and examined the extent to which different populations share early versus late breeding seasons depending on a hierarchy of spatial scales comprising breeding site, small‐scale region, large‐scale region and the whole North Atlantic. In about a third of cases, we found laying dates of populations of different species sharing the same breeding site or small‐scale breeding region were positively correlated, which is consistent with the hypothesis that they share phenological responses to the same environmental conditions. In comparison, we found no evidence for positive phenological covariation among populations across species aggregated at larger spatial scales. In general, we found little evidence for positive phenological covariation between populations of a single species, and in many instances the inter‐year variation specific to a population was substantial, consistent with each population responding idiosyncratically to local environmental conditions. Black‐legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla was the exception, with populations exhibiting positive covariation in laying dates that decayed with the distance between breeding sites, suggesting that populations may be responding to a similar driver. Our approach sheds light on the potential factors that may drive phenology in our study species, thus furthering our understanding of the scales at which different seabirds interact with interannual variation in their environment. We also identify additional systems and phenological questions to which our inferential approach could be applied.  aPublisher supplied data  cFrench Polar Institute  cNorwegian Polar Institute  cNorwegian Environment Agency  cNatural Resources Canada  cEnvironment and Climate Change Canada  cNatural Environment Research Council 3aRissa tridactyla 3aanimal ecology 3adata collection 3aglobal change 3aphenology 3aseabirds1 aDaunt, F.q(Francis),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4638-33881 aWanless, S.q(Sarah),1 aPhillips, Richard A.1 aAlvarez, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2190-79501 aAnker‐Nilssen, Tycho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1030-55241 aBarrett, Robert T.1 aBech, Claus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0860-06631 aBecker, Peter H.,1 aBerglund, Per‐Arvid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5378-97921 aBouwhuis, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4023-15781 aBurr, Zofia M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6850-40241 aChastel, Olivier1 aChristensen‐Dalsgaard, Signe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1657-19191 aDescamps, Sebastien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0590-90131 aDiamond, Tony1 aElliott, Kyle1 aErikstad, Kjell‐Einar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2171-57211 aHarris, Mike1 aHentati‐Sundberg, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3201-92621 aHeubeck, Martin1 aKress, Stephen W.1 aLangset, Magdalene1 aLorentsen, Svein‐Håkon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7867-00341 aMajor, Heather L.1 aMallory, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2744-34371 aMellor, Mick1 aMiles, Will T.

Most of microRNA assays require target conversion in combination with nucleic acid amplification to improve the detection sensitivity, which may compromise the assay accuracy and specificity. Herein we report a sensitive bioluminescent method for microRNA assay on the basis of controlled target degradation without target conversion and nucleic acid amplification. In this assay, the target microRNA can be specifically degraded by exonuclease III after hybridization to its complementary probe, releasing adenosine monophosphate (AMP) from microRNA itself. The AMP then triggers an efficient bioluminescence generation system to produce a strong bioluminescence signal. This assay is highly sensitive with zero-background signal and a detection limit of 7.6 fM even without target amplification, and it can discriminate the single-nucleotide difference among microRNA family members with extremely high discrimination ratio. With the assistance of magnetic separation to eliminate the interference of endogenous ATP, ADP, and AMP in sample matrix, this assay can be further applied to absolute quantification of microRNAs in cancer cells and tissues from lung cancer patients, holding great potential in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abioluminescence 3abiomedical research 3adetection limit 3agene amplification 3alung neoplasms 3amagnetic separation 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasm cells 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apatients 3atherapeutics1 aMa, Fei1 aHuang, Si-qiang1 aTang, Bo1 aZhang, Chun-yang0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 July 05, v. 89, no. 13 p.7077-7083dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.7b008923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245012900137300001800266500001900284520093400303592002801237650001401265650002401279650002601303650001701329650001201346650001301358650001501371650001301386650001601399650001701415650001801432653002101450653002601471653003101497700002001528700002001548773015401568852000901722655001201731IND60723778220221121214604.0210117e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072377822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarapi, Dinesh Kumar10aInfluence of Planting Methods and Organic Manure Levels on Productivity and Soil Quality of Aloe Vera in Chhattisgarh Plains  ap. 4933-4936.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA field experiment carried out during Kharif-rabi season 2014–15.

Arif,10aEngineering broad-spectrum resistance against RNA viruses in potato  ap. 303-311.  aRNA silencing technology has become the tool of choice for inducing resistance against viruses in plants. A significant discovery of this technology is that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is diced into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), is a potent trigger for RNA silencing. By exploiting this phenomenon in transgenic plants, it is possible to confer high level of virus resistance by specific targeting of cognate viral RNA. In order to maximize the efficiency and versatility of the vector-based siRNA approach, we have constructed a chimeric expression vector containing three partial gene sequences derived from the ORF2 gene of Potato virus X, Helper Component Protease gene of Potato virus Y and Coat protein gene of Potato leaf roll virus. Solanum tuberosum cv. Desiree and Kuroda were transformed with this chimeric gene cassette via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and transgenic status was confirmed by PCR, Southern and double antibody sandwich ELISA detection. Due to simultaneous RNA silencing, as demonstrated by accumulation of specific siRNAs, the expression of partial triple-gene sequence cassette depicted 20% of the transgenic plants are immune against all three viruses. Thus, expression of a single transgene construct can effectively confer resistance to multiple viruses in transgenic plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotato leafroll virus 3aPotato virus X 3aPotato virus Y 3aRNA interference 3aSolanum tuberosum 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apotatoes 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3aviruses 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgenetics 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDisease Resistance 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGenes, Viral 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxvirology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsximmunologyxvirology. 2aPlasmidsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPotexvirusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPotyvirusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSolanum tuberosumxgeneticsximmunologyxvirology. 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aTransgenes1 aAzhar, U.1 aAshraf, M.

Many types of membranes were prepared using different copolymer/PVDF blend ratios via nonsolvent induced phase separation. The membranes with similar pure water permeabilities and surface pore sizes were prepared by controlling the dope solution composition. Thus, the bovine serum albumin antifouling properties could be assessed under similar hydrodynamic filtration conditions. The membrane hydrophilicity, surface PEGMA coverage, and antifouling properties of the prepared membranes increased with increasing copolymer/PVDF ratio and PEGMA/MMA monomer ratio of the copolymers and PEG length of the copolymer. A molecular dynamics simulation was performed to assess the surface chemical composition, and the results were compared with those of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The antifouling properties depended more strongly on the membrane surface hydrophilicity when the copolymer chemical structures, that is, the PEGMA/MMA monomer ratio and PEG side chain length, were changed, rather than when the copolymer/PVDF blend ratio was changed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aartificial membranes 3abovine serum albumin 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3afiltration 3afluorides 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophilicity 3amixing 3amolecular dynamics 3apolyethylene glycol 3aseparation 0aPoly(Vinylidene Fluoride) (PVDF) 0aPoly(Poly(Ethylene Glycol)Methyl Ether Methacrylate-Methyl Methacrylate) [P(PEGMA-MMA)] 0aAntifouling properties 0aBlend membranes 0aNonsolvent induced phase separation1 aRajabzadeh, Saeid1 aShaikh, Abdul Rajjak1 aKakihana, Yuriko1 aSun, Yuchen1 aMatsuyama, Hideto0 tJournal of membrane science.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 514 p.429-439dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009000161300001600251520138600267592002801653650001501681650002801696650002501724650001501749650001901764650002001783650001201803650001601815650001601831650001301847650002101860650001101881650002201892650001901914650002201933650000901955650001701964650001301981650001501994653001502009653000902024653000802033653002102041653002002062700001402082700001902096700002402115700005702139773011202196856008202308852000902390655001202399IND60635869320221119232759.0190509e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063586932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.03.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Peng10aAntioxidant effects of sulforaphane in human HepG2 cells and immortalised hepatocytes  ap. 129-136.  aSulforaphane (SFN) has shown anti-cancer effects in cellular and animal studies but its effectiveness has been limited in human studies. Here, the effects of SFN were measured in both human hepatocytes (HHL5) and hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Results showed that SFN inhibited cell viability and induced DNA strand breaks at high doses (≥20 μM). It also activated the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and increased intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels at 24 h. Pre-treatment with a low dose SFN (≤5 μM) protected against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell damage. High doses of SFN were more toxic towards HHL5 compared to HepG2 cells; the difference is likely due to the disparity in the responses of Nrf2-driven enzymes and -GSH levels between the two cell lines. In addition, HepG2 cells hijacked the cytoprotective effect of SFN over a wider dose range (1.25–20 μM) compared to HHL5. Manipulation of levels of GSH and Nrf2 in HepG2 cells confirmed that both molecules mediate the protective effects of SFN against H2O2. The non-specific nature of SFN in the regulation of cell death and survival could present undesirable risks, i.e. be more toxic to normal cells, and cause chemo-resistance in tumor cells.

In this work, we present the first example of chemical modification of graphene on stainless steel wire (SSW) for SBSE. Bio-inspired polydopamine was firstly modified on the SSW covalently; then graphene oxide was introduced and reacted with amino groups of polydopamine layer. The modification of polydopamine and graphene can be repeated by a layer-by-layer strategy, resulting in control of the thickness of graphene layer and increase of extraction capability. The prepared covalently immobilized graphene-stainless steel wire (G-SSW) exhibited good stability under stirring, ultrasonication and treatment with commonly used organic solvents, basic and acidic solutions. Application as stir bar for SBSE, G-SSW was found to possess good extraction efficiency towards pollutant polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with enrichment factors from 10086 to 16896. After optimization of conditions, G-SSW based SBSE was coupled HPLC for determination of PAHs in environmental and food samples. The quantitative method has low limits of detection of 0.2–50pg/mL, which is better than some reported SBSE-HPLC methods. The method shows wide linear range (200–5000, 10–1000 and 1–1000pg/mL), good linearity (r≥0.9950) and good reproducibility (RSD≤4.97%). The method has been applied to soil and food samples, with good selectivity and good recoveries ranging from 88.5–113.6%.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3adetection limit 3afoods 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amixing 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aquantitative analysis 3asoil 3asolvents 3astainless steel 3aultrasonic treatment 0aCovalent immobilization 0aStainless steel wire 0aPolydopamine 0aGraphene 0aStir bar sorptive extraction1 aZhang, Zixin1 aZhang, Juan1 aMeng, Jiawei1 aBao, Tao1 aChen, Zilin0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 July 18, v. 1351 p.12-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009000166300001600256520116100272592002801433650002501461650001201486650002501498650002101523650002001544650001301564650001901577650002001596650001201616650001601628653003901644653002401683653002201707653002501729653003901754700001901793700002201812700003101834700002001865773011301885856008501998852000902083655001202092IND60582867320221118002933.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058286732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2016.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Wenhai10aEvaluating ionic organic draw solutes in osmotic membrane bioreactors for water reuse  ap. 636-645.  aThe performance of two ionic organic draw solutes, namely sodium acetate (NaOAc) and ethylene-diamine-tetra acetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na), during osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) operation was investigated in this study. Their performance was compared to that of sodium chloride (NaCl). A reverse osmosis (RO) process was integrated with OMBR to form an OMBR-RO hybrid system for draw solute recovery and clean water production. Results show that the NaOAc and EDTA-2Na draw solutes significantly reduced salinity build-up in the bioreactor in comparison with NaCl during OMBR operation. At the same osmotic pressure, these two ionic organic draw solutions produced slightly lower water flux, but considerably less reverse salt flux than NaCl. Compared to NaCl and NaOAc, EDTA-2Na resulted in significantly less fouling to the forward osmosis membrane. Regardless of the draw solutes, the OMBR-RO hybrid system could remove all 31 trace organic contaminants investigated in this study by more than 97%. Results reported here suggest that ionic organic draw solutes can be used to mitigate salinity build-up in the bioreactor during OMBR operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3afouling 3amembrane bioreactors 3aosmotic pressure 3areverse osmosis 3asalinity 3asodium acetate 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3awater reuse 0aOsmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) 0aOrganic draw solute 0aSalinity build-up 0aReverse osmosis (RO) 0aTrace organic contaminants (TrOCs)1 aHai, Faisal I.1 aPrice, William E.1 aElimelech, M.q(Menachem),1 aNghiem, Long D.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 514 p.636-645dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013000172506002800302520081200330592002801142506003701170650001201207650001101219650001901230700002701249700002601276700002501302700002401327773009601351856008301447852000901530655001201539IND60739580620221207135236.0200302s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073958062DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202017000622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafiollin, Faik N.10aFertilizers and biological products used for cultivation of perennial grasses on gray forest soils of the Middle Volga region  aResource is Open Access  aIn recent years, fertilizers and biological products are widely used for cultivating perennial grasses to form highly productive agrocenoses and reduce the cost of feed.

Ideally, the agent reduces invader abundance to some acceptably low level, and the two coexist at low density with the agent providing continuous control over the long term. But the outcome may be complicated when the agent is attacked by native predators and parasites. We used a spatially explicit, discrete‐time, individual‐based, coupled plant–seed predator–parasitoid model to estimate the impact of the biocontrol agent Eustenopus villosus (a seed predator) on the invasive, annual weed Centaurea solstitialis, both with and without the generalist parasitoid Pyemotes tritici. We estimated the agent's ability to reduce plant density, spread rate, and population growth rate over 50 years. We used long‐term demographic data from two sites in central California, USA, to parameterize the model and assess how populations in different climatic zones might respond differently to the agent and the parasitoid. We found that the biocontrol agent reduced plant density (relative to predictions for an uncontrolled invasion), but its impact on the invader's spread rate was modest and inconsistent. The agent had no long‐term impact on population growth rate (λ). Parasitism caused a trophic cascade, the strength of which varied between sites. At our coastal site, the parasitoid entirely eliminated the impact of the agent on the plant. At our Central Valley site, even when parasitized, the agent significantly reduced plant density and spread rate over several decades (although to a lesser degree than when it was not parasitized), but not invader λ. Surprisingly, we also found that the length of time the invader was allowed to spread across the landscape prior to introducing the agent (5, 25, or 50 years) had little influence over its ability to control the weed in the long term. This is encouraging news for land managers attempting to control invasive plants that have already established widespread, high‐density populations. Unfortunately, our results also show that attack by the native generalist parasitoid had a larger influence over how effectively the agent reduced invader performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentaurea solstitialis 3aEustenopus villosus 3aPyemotes tritici 3aannual weeds 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aclimatic zones 3agranivores 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3along term effects 3amodels 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aplant density 3apopulation growth 3apredators 3aprediction 3aweed control 3aCalifornia1 aSatterthwaite, William H.0 tEcological applications.g2012 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.20-34dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-2120.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245010000173300001800273520177600291592002802067650002602095650001302121650001202134650001202146650002802158650001302186650001302199650002702212650001802239650001302257650001902270650001202289650001402301650000702315650002202322650001302344650001902357700002002376700001402396700001702410773008602427856009002513852000902603655001202612IND60090397620221119053106.0141102e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009039762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Qingye,10aMolecular interactions of mussel protective coating protein, mcfp-1, from Mytilus californianus  ap. 1903-1911.  aProtective coating of the byssus of mussels (Mytilus sp.) has been suggested as a new paradigm of medical coating due to its high extensibility and hardness co-existence without their mutual detriment. The only known biomacromolecule in the extensible and tough coating on the byssus is mussel foot protein-1 (mfp-1), which is made up with positively charged residues (∼20 mol%) and lack of negatively charged residues. Here, adhesion and molecular interaction mechanisms of Mytilus californianus foot protein-1 (mcfp-1) from California blue mussel were investigated using a surface forces apparatus (SFA) in buffer solutions of different ionic concentrations (0.2–0.7 M) and pHs (3.0–5.5). Strong and reversible cohesion between opposed positively charged mcfp-1 films was measured in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer with 0.1 M KNO₃. Cohesion of mcfp-1 was gradually reduced with increasing the ionic strength, but was not changed with pH variations. Oxidation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) residues of mcfp-1, a key residue for adhesive and coating proteins of mussel, didn’t change the cohesion strength of mcfp-1 films, but the addition of chemicals with aromatic groups (i.e., aspirin and 4-methylcatechol) increased the cohesion. These results suggest that the cohesion of mcfp-1 films is mainly mediated by cation-π interactions between the positively charged residues and benzene rings of DOPA and other aromatic amino acids (∼20 mol% of total amino acids of mcfp-1), and π-π interactions between the phenyl groups in mcfp-1. The adhesion mechanism obtained for the mcfp-1 proteins provides important insight into the design and development of functional biomaterials and coatings mimicking the extensible and robust mussel cuticle coating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus californianus 3aadhesion 3aaspirin 3abenzene 3abiocompatible materials 3acoatings 3acohesion 3adihydroxyphenylalanine 3aextensibility 3ahardness 3aionic strength 3amussels 3aoxidation 3apH 3apotassium nitrate 3aproteins 3asodium acetate1 aHwang, Dong Soo1 aLiu, Yang1 aZeng, Hongbo0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Feb., v. 33, no. 6 p.1903-1911dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010100174300001400275520138400289592002801673650001801701650001401719650004401733650001401777650002301791650001901814650002601833650001801859650001501877650003201892653001501924653000901939653001801948653002201966653002401988700002402012700002602036700002402062700002902086700002302115700002302138773010402161856008702265852000902352655001202361IND60526752320221118201349.0190410e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052675232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShekh, Ajam Yakub10aStress enhances poly-unsaturation rich lipid accumulation in Chlorella sp. and Chlamydomonas sp.  ap. 59-66.  aIn the present study, effects of various cultivation conditions on biomass and lipid productivity, detail FAME signature, CO2 biofixation and elemental composition of Chlorella sp. and Chlamydomonas sp. have been investigated. In Chlorella sp., N-depletion has enhanced the lipid productivity by 12.70–14.61%. In Chlamydomonas sp., though the lipid content has increased by 22–26% upon N-depletion, lipid productivity has not changed significantly due to concomitant decrease in biomass productivity by 18–25%. The presence of lipid was also confirmed by FTIR spectroscopic analysis of biomass. The characteristic bands observed at 1744.30 cm−1 (Chlamydomonas sp.) and (Chlorella sp.) were credited to lipids due to C–O mode of the side chain from ester carbonyl group. Extracted lipid was transesterified to FAMEs. Chlorella sp. at N-replete indoor condition has produced the highest weight percentage of C16:0 (26.64%), C18:0 (3.77%) and C18:1 (27.94%). In Chlamydomonas sp., N-replete indoor condition has resulted in maximum content of MUFA (30.12%), LUFA (53.35%), second highest SFA (29.22%) and DUFA (23.23%). Inverse relationship was observed between MUFA and PUFA at all cultivation conditions. In both the microalgae, C16:0, C18:1 (9), C18:2 (9, 12), C18:3 (9, 12, 15) were identified as the major FAMEs which are suitable to be used as biodiesel components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas 3aChlorella 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3aelemental composition 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 0aMicroalgae 0aFAME 0aChlorella sp. 0aChlamydomonas sp. 0aNitrogen limitation1 aShrivastava, Preeti1 aKrishnamurthi, Kannan1 aMudliar, Sandeep N.1 aDevi, Sivanesan Saravana1 aKanade, Gajanan S.1 aChakrabarti, Tapan0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Jan., v. 84 p.59-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245006800175520080000243592002801043650001001071650001301081650001201094650002101106650001601127650002301143650003301166650002101199650002301220653001801243653001401261653000801275653000701283700002001290700001601310700001801326700001501344773011801359856008201477852000901559655001201568IND60686568720221122230114.0200503e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068656872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2020.1040352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrendafilova, Antoaneta10aVolatile constituents of four Inula species of Bulgarian origin  aIn this study the volatile components of four Inula species (Inula germanica L., I. bifrons (L.)

We developed an interdisciplinary approach for floodplain‐forest restoration identifying sites suitable for reforestations from both an ecological and hydraulic point of view. In the ecological module, habitat‐distribution models are developed providing information on ecologically suitable sites. In the hydraulic module, a two‐dimensional hydrodynamic‐numerical model (2D‐HN model) delivers the requested hydraulic information. The output of the two models is intersected. Subsequently, in an iterative procedure, the potential of plantings without exceeding critical water levels can be identified by hydraulic evaluation using the 2D‐HN‐model. The approach is exemplified using two reforestation scenarios at the Elbe River, Germany, showing considerable potential for softwood forest establishment without negative hydraulic effects. The approach reported here provides a solution for a severe conflict in river‐basin management that hampers the reestablishment of the strongly threatened floodplain forests in Europe. Alternative measures to enhance floodplain‐forest regeneration feasible under certain preconditions are discussed in the context of the current state of European large rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflood control 3afloodplains 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amodels 3areforestation 3arivers 3asoftwood 3aGermany1 aMosner, Eva1 aLehmann, Boris0 tEcological applications.g2012 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.240-249dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-0021.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012100178300001500299500001400314520135100328592002801679650001201707650001301719650002401732650001701756650001001773650001301783650002901796650001501825650002601840650001201866650001101878650001601889653003601905653003501941653002101976653002501997653002002022700002102042773011002063856008502173852000902258655001202267IND60693107420221120064145.0200505e20000101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069310742DNAL7 a10.1080/09524622.2000.97534542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCORTOPASSI, KATHRYN A.14aThe comparison of harmonically rich sounds using spectrographic cross-correlation and principal coordinates analysis  ap. 89-127.  aNAL-light  aWe explore the effectiveness of spectrographs cross-correlation (SPCC) combined with principal coordinates (PCO) analysis as a method for sound comparison. We do this using synthetic sounds modeled after the individually-distinctive, harmonically-rich contact calls of wild orange-fronted conures Aratinga canicularis. Calls with acoustic properties similar to Aratinga contact calls are common in other taxa including non-oscine birds, primates and cetaceans. We generated signals with known variations in time-frequency pattern, duration, noise level, harmonic content and harmonic weighting, and applied SPCC-PCO analysis to obtain an ordering of sounds in n-dimensional space. We find that shared time-frequency patterns dominate the positioning of sounds in PCO space. This was true despite high variability in signal-to-noise ratio (from −60 to +40 dB) and duration (150–275 ms). Furthermore, inclusion of naturally-weighted harmonics (versus fundamentals only) enhances, rather than obscures, the separation of call types. We conclude that SPCC-PCO is an effective method for sorting sounds based on overall time-frequency pattern. In addition, the resulting PCO measures can be used in statistical tests of association with extrinsic variables. The method is thus an effective starting point for examining most bioacoustic hypotheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCetacea 3aPrimates 3aacoustic properties 3abioacoustics 3abirds 3aduration 3amultidimensional scaling 3aseparation 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asorting 3asounds 3avariability 0aspectrographs cross-correlation 0aprincipal coordinates analysis 0asound comparison 0aparrot vocalizations 0asound synthesis1 aBradbury, J.

The water hyacinth was fermented, and a higher production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (782.67 mg L⁻¹) and soluble organic carbon (CSOL) (4788.34 mg L⁻¹) was obtained using a particle size of 7 mm compared to 50 mm. For composting, four treatments (10 kg fresh weight each) were evaluated: treatment A (100 % SS + 0 % WHfₑᵣₘ), treatment B (75 % SS + 25 % WHfₑᵣₘ), treatment C (50 % SS + 50 % WHfₑᵣₘ), and treatment D (25 % SS + 75 % WHfₑᵣₘ). The WHfₑᵣₘ added to SS, especially in treatments C (50 %) and D (75 %), increased the initial contents of organic matter (OM), organic carbon (CORG), CSOL, the C/N ratio, and the germination index (GI). The heavy metal content (HMC) (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) at the beginning was below the maximum allowed by USEPA regulations. All of the samples were free of Salmonella sp. from the beginning. The reduction of the CORG, CSOL, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and C/N ratio indicated the degradation of the OM by day 198. The treatments with WHfₑᵣₘ (B, C, and D) yielded higher values of electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and GI than SS at day 198. No significant differences were observed in GI among the treatments with WHfₑᵣₘ. The fecal coliforms were eliminated (<3 MPN g⁻¹) and the helminths were reduced to ≤5 eggs/2 g during the process. The competition for nutrients and the presence of suppressive fungi of the genera Penicillium, Rhizopus, Paecilomyces (penicillin producers), and Fusariella isolated from the compost may have promoted the elimination of pathogens since no thermophile temperatures were obtained.

Various models for estimating the bark thickness of interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) from measured dbh (diameter at breast height) were evaluated. Sample trees were from northern Rocky Mountain mixed conifer stands that had been subjected to four levels of experimental woody biomass harvesting. Among simple linear, nonlinear, and segmented linear mixed effects models, the segmented linear model performed best. A join point (where the linear equations are linked) for the segmentation was statistically detected at approximately 19.0 cm dbh. The join point seems to indicate the size at which juvenile Douglas-fir trees boost the production of bark tissue, perhaps as those trees express dominance over competing understory vegetation. Woody biomass utilization level had no impact on bark thickness, indicating that the bark:dbh relationship does not depend on biomass utilization intensity. The study results enable accurate bark thickness estimation for interior Douglas-fir in this region, and suggest several silvicultural applications for juvenile Douglas-fir stand management.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca 3abark 3abiomass 3aconifers 3aequations 3aforesters 3aharvesting 3ajuveniles 3alinear models 3astand management 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avegetation 3awood 0aInterior Douglas-fir 0aBark thickness 0aSegmented linear regression 0aBiomass harvesting 0aNorthern Rocky Mountains1 aKeyes, Christopher R.1 aGraham, Jonathan M.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Jan., v. 84 p.118-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.11.0153Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5267525  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01482naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010700157300001800264520030200282592002800584650001000612650002300622650002300645650001700668650002100685650000900706650001300715650001200728650002100740700001900761700001600780700001700796700001800813700001800831700002000849773013200869856007401001852000901075655001201084IND60660194520221118045616.0190823e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066019452DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc02011a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yeon Ok10aDetection of Aβ plaques in mouse brain by using a disaggregation-induced fluorescence-enhancing probe  ap. 5741-5744.  aWe herein report a fluorescence probe 1 capable of detecting water-soluble oligomeric Aβ aggregates and Aβ fibrils.

The measured total PCDD/F toxic equivalency (TEQ) ranged between 0.73 and 7348.40 pg/g dry weight. The mean TEQ of PCDD/Fs in industrial sludge was approximately 40 times higher than that in sewage sludge. The PCDD homolog concentrations in the industrial samples were higher than those observed at the wastewater treatment plants by a factor of 10, with total heptachlorodibenzodioxin (HpCDD) exhibiting the maximum concentration in most of the samples. Among the PCDF homologs, total heptadichlorodibenzofuran (HpCDF) dominated the total homolog concentration in sludge from the wastewater treatment plants, whereas total tetradichlorodibenzofuran (TeCDF) dominated the industrial sludge samples. Overall, the total PCDD/F TEQ in sludge samples was much higher than that in effluent samples from the same facility. A linear correlation (R ² = 0.62, p value < 0.068) was found indicating that sludge sampling can be used as a surrogate for effluent concentrations in wastewater treatment plants but not for industrial discharges.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenicity 3ahumans 3aindustry 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3asewage sludge 3awastewater treatment1 aRifai, H.

Lead was extracted using the air-assisted liquid–liquid microextraction (AALLME) technique and determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). O, O-diethyl dithiophosphoric acid was used as a chelating agent to form a hydrophobic complex. Several factors influencing the microextraction efficiency and the complex formation such as extraction solvent type and its volume, pH, concentration of the chelating agent and extraction time were evaluated. Under optimum conditions, the calibration graph was linear in the concentration range of 30–350 μg L⁻¹ with a detection limit of 8.5 μg L⁻¹. The relative standard deviation for six replicated measurements of 140 μg L⁻¹ of Pb²⁺ was 4.07%. Obtained enrichment factor was 25. Through combination of AALLME with FAAS, the analytical performance of FAAS for the detection of lead greatly improved. The accuracy of the developed method was evaluated by the analysis of the certified reference material and addition recovery test. The presented method was able to analyse lead in different real samples including human urine, wastewater and water samples with satisfactory recovery ranged from 95% to 108%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acalibration 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3alead 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3apH 3areference standards 3asolvents 3astandard deviation 3aurine 3awastewater 0aAir-assisted liquid–liquid microextraction 0aflame atomic absorption spectrometry 0aPb2+ 0aenvironmental water 0aOO- diethyl dithiophosphoric acid0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2021 May 03, v. 101, no. 6 p.838-848dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12218x1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2019.16726723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245012600158300001800284520091000302592002801212650002901240650001001269650001201279650001201291650001401303650001501317700001701332700001801349700001601367700005201383773014601435856007701581852000901658655001201667IND60769673420221121185311.0220309e20220222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076967342DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c124242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hepan10aModular and Facile Access to Chiral α-Aryl Phosphates via Dual Nickel- and Photoredox-Catalyzed Reductive Cross-Coupling  ap. 3989-3997.  aChiral phosphine-containing skeletons are important motifs in bioactive natural products, pharmaceuticals, chiral catalysts, and ligands. Herein, we report a general and modular platform to access chiral α-aryl phosphorus compounds via a Ni/photoredox-catalyzed enantioconvergent reductive cross-coupling between α-bromophosphates and aryl iodides. This dual catalytic regime exhibited high efficiency and good functional group compacity. A wide variety of substrates bearing a diverse set of functional groups could be converted into chiral phosphates in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The utility of the method was also demonstrated by the development of a new phosphine ligand and the synthesis of enzyme inhibitor derivatives. The detailed mechanistic studies supported a radical chain process and revealed a unique distinction compared with traditional reductive cross-coupling.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-coupling reactions 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3aligands 3aphosphine 3aphosphorus1 aZheng, Purui1 aWu, Xiaoqiang1 aLi, Yuqiang1 aXu, Tao,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4228-48950 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Feb. 22, v. 144, no. 9 p.3989-3997dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c124243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009500152300002000247520136800267592002801635650002301663650003401686650002301720650002001743650002601763650001401789650001401803650003401817650001601851650001201867650002201879650001301901700001301914700001601927700001601943700001601959700001901975700002001994700001602014700001702030700002002047773012402067856007402191852000902265655001202274IND60667296320221119105257.0190919e20150210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066729632DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00194c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Yi10aRole of pentahedrally coordinated titanium in titanium silicalite-1 in propene epoxidation  ap. 17897-17904.  aTwo titanium silicalite-1 samples with different crystal sizes were synthesized in the tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) hydrothermal systems. The small-crystal TS-1 with a size of 600 nm was then treated with different organic bases. These TS-1 samples were evaluated in the epoxidation of propene, and characterized by ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance (UV-vis), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and Raman spectroscopies. The Ti L-edge absorption spectra show that a new Ti species, pentahedrally coordinated Ti, appears in some of the samples. This pentahedrally coordinated Ti species is correlated with the catalytic oxidation activity of TS-1, closely. Tetrahedrally coordinated Ti in TS-1 is the primary active center for selective oxidation reactions, but the existence of a small amount of pentahedrally coordinated Ti can further improve the catalytic activity. A high molar ratio of Si/Ti (n(Si/Ti)) in the synthesis process (n(Si/Ti) = 92.78) was beneficial for the generation of pentahedrally coordinated Ti. The improved catalytic activity of the TPAOH treated TS-1 is mainly due to the increasing amount of pentahedrally coordinated Ti, besides the elimination of diffusion limitation. Slowing down the crystallization rate can also increase the content of pentahedrally coordinated Ti.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acatalytic activity 3acrystallization 3aepoxidation reactions 3aoxidation 3apropylene 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3areflectance 3asilicon 3aspectral analysis 3atitanium1 aLiu, Min1 aZhang, Ting1 aHong, Luwei1 aGuo, Xinwen1 aSong, Chunshan1 aChen, Yongsheng1 aZhu, Pengyu1 aJaye, Cherno1 aFischer, Daniel0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 10, v. 5, no. 23 p.17897-17904dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra00194c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012000170300001800290520123100308592002801539650001701567650002501584650001901609650001201628650002501640650001701665650001101682700002501693700002401718700002001742700002501762773010501787856008601892852000901978655001201987IND60578311820180713000000.0170812e20170725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057831182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.7b006012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHénot, Marceau10aComparison of the Slip of a PDMS Melt on Weakly Adsorbing Surfaces Measured by a New Photobleaching-Based Technique  ap. 5592-5598.  aWe present an experimental method allowing to quantify slip at the wall in viscous polymer fluids, based on the observation of the evolution under simple shear flow of a photobleached pattern within a fluorescent labeled polymer melt. This straightforward method provides access to slip length at top and bottom interfaces in the 1 μm to 1 mm range and to the actual shear rate experienced by the fluid. Based on simple optical imaging and image analysis techniques, this method affords an improvement compared to previously reported methods in which the photobleached fluorescence intensity profiles before and after shear were compared and measured by scanning a photomultiplier. The present method relies on a direct determination of the displacement profile inside the polymer fluid from an analysis of the 3D evolution of the whole photobleached pattern. We demonstrate the potential of this method with measurements of the slip length for an entangled polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) melt, as a function of the shear rate, in contact with several weakly adsorbing surfaces, i.e., end-tethered PDMS or polystyrene (PS) chains, a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of trimethoxy(octadecyl)silane (OTS), and a glassy PS thin film.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3afluorescent labeling 3aimage analysis 3amelting 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3apolystyrenes 3asilane1 aChennevière, Alexis1 aDrockenmuller, Eric1 aLéger, Liliane1 aRestagno, Frédéric0 tMacromolecules.g2017 July 25, v. 50, no. 14 p.5592-5598dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b006013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245007400200300001600274520085300290592002801143650001701171650001701188650002701205650001201232650001801244650001501262650000901277650003701286650001401323650001201337650000901349650001601358653001701374653003401391653002701425653002601452653001901478700001701497700001801514700001401532700001301546700001401559700001801573700001701591700001501608700001501623700001401638773011201652856008201764852000901846655001201855IND60619616720221119145445.0190401e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061961672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2018.10.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7640-673110aReproductive and developmental toxicity study of caffeic acid in mice  ap. 106-112.  aCaffeic acid is an antioxidant commonly used to promote hematopoiesis and hemostasis. However, little is known about its systemic safety profile in reproduction and development. Here, we focused on the reproductive and developmental toxicity of caffeic acid in F0 female mice and F1 offspring. In the three-segment study, the F0 female mice were continuously exposed to 0, 0.15, 5 or 150 mg/kg/day of caffeic acid by gavage. We found that 5 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day of caffeic acid affected implantation of embryos when administered before gestation day 6. In addition, 150 mg/kg/day of caffeic acid affected fetal weight gain. No maternal toxicity, fetal teratogenesis or post-natal effects on pup development were observed. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level was 0.15 mg/kg/day for pregnant mice under the conditions of this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acaffeic acid 3adevelopmental toxicity 3afemales 3ahematopoiesis 3ahemostasis 3amice 3ano observed adverse effect level 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3apups 3aweight gain 0aCaffeic acid 0aThrombocytopenia in pregnancy 0aDevelopmental toxicity 0aReproductive toxicity 0aTeratogenicity1 aQiu, Shidong1 aWang, Lingjun1 aZhang, Na1 aShi, Yan1 aZhou, Hai1 aLiu, Xinguang1 aShao, Linlin1 aLiu, Xuena1 aChen, Jian1 aHou, Ming0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Jan., v. 123 p.106-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2018.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245010100171300001600272500001100288520138800299592002801687650001501715650001701730650001301747650002101760650001901781650001201800650001901812650001101831650001301842650001501855650001301870650002601883650002001909700003601929700003201965773016801997856007902165852000902244655001202253IND60082168120221119063721.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008216812DNAL7 a10.1111/1574-6968.125812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiran Kumar Reddy, G.10aAerobic granular sludge mediated biodegradation of an organophosphorous ester, dibutyl phosphite  ap. 110-115.  aLETTER  aDibutyl phosphite, an organophosphorous compound, finds applications in different chemical industries and processes. Here, we report an efficient approach of biodegradation to be eventually used in bioremediation of dibutyl phosphite. Aerobic granules capable of dibutyl phosphite biodegradation were cultivated in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The SBR was operated with a 24‐h cycle by feeding with dibutyl phosphite as a cosubstrate along with acetate. During the course of the SBR operation, aerobic granules of 0.9 ± 0.3 mm size were developed. Complete biodegradation of 1.4, 2 and 3 mM of dibutyl phosphite was achieved in 4, 5 and 8 h, respectively, accompanied by stoichiometric release of phosphite (H₃PO₃). Phosphatase activity in the dibutyl phosphite‐degrading granular biomass was 3‐ and 1.5‐fold higher as compared to the activated sludge (seed biomass) and acetate‐fed aerobic granules, respectively, indicating involvement in the hydrolysis of dibutyl phosphite. Microbial community analysis by t‐RFLP showed the presence of 12 different bacterial types. Two bacterial strains capable of growth on dibutyl phosphite as sole carbon source were isolated and characterized as Acidovorax sp. and Sphingobium sp. The results show that aerobic microbial granules based process is suitable for the treatment of dibutyl phosphite contaminated water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidovorax 3aSphingomonas 3aacetates 3aactivated sludge 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3agranules 3ahydrolysis 3aindustry 3amicrobial communities 3awater pollution1 aNancharaiah, Yarlagadda Venkata1 aVenugopalan, Vayalam Purath0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2014 Oct., v. 359, no. 1 p.110-115dElsevier Science on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx0378-10977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6968.125813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015100175300001600326520167200342592002802014650001702042650001002059650001302069650001902082650001202101650001902113650002402132650001302156650001502169650002002184650001902204650002102223650001102244650001002255650001502265650001302280651001902293653001902312653001502331653002402346653003002370653001802400653000802418700002102426773009702447856008502544852000902629655001202638IND60086931320221119223335.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008693132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoudrý, Vítězslav10aRelative importance of climate, topography, and habitats for breeding wetland birds with different latitudinal distributions in the Czech Republic  ap. 165-171.  aGiven species' vulnerability to climate change, land use change, and habitat loss, it is pertinent to examine how the distribution of a particular species is related to those factors. We assessed the use of climate, habitat, and topography data for modeling the distributions of 14 central European wetland birds, and compared the relative importance of these factors among bird groups with differing latitudinal distributions in Europe. We used the Third Atlas of Breeding Birds in the Czech Republic as a source of species distribution data. Variables were derived from Corine Land Cover, WorldClim, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. Hierarchical partitioning and multiple logistic models identified climatic, topographical, and habitat predictors as important determinants of distribution for each of the species under study. However, the relative contributions of particular variables differed among the species. Climatic, topographical, and habitat factor groups also differed in their importance to latitudinal species groups. Our results indicated that wetland birds with range margins close to the Czech Republic were potentially limited by two different factors: climate conditions impact the southerly distributed species and the availability of suitable habitat affects the northerly distributed species. The accuracy of the study models varied from fair to high (the area under curve values was 0.60–0.89) and revealed negative correlations with the relative occurrence area. In this study, we propose that any difference in model performance is more attributable to data characteristics than to a species' geographical characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alogit analysis 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aradar 3atopography 3awetlands 3aCzech Republic 0aCentral Europe 0aLand cover 0aLogistic regression 0aHierarchical partitioning 0aRange margins 0aSDM1 aŠimová, Petra,0 tApplied geography.g2013 Oct., v. 44 p.165-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03710naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015400164520162400318592002801942650002601970650001701996650002002013650001002033650001202043650002102055650001202076653002502088653004102113653004402154653001302198653003702211653001202248653000802260653000802268653001002276653001102286653000902297653000802306653001102314653000902325653000902334653000802343653000802351653000702359653000702366653001002373653001302383653001102396653000802407653000802415653000702423653001202430653000802442653000902450653000802459653000902467653000902476653001002485653000802495653000902503653000802512653000802520653001102528653000702539653000802546653000702554700001502561700001702576700001502593700001902608700001602627700001702643700001602660773008802676856008302764852000902847655001202856IND60786178320221123041238.0220809e20221005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078617832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2022.1467552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yewei10aInsulin can up-regulate LC-PUFA biosynthesis with the involvement of Srebp-1c and stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1) in marine teleost Siganus canaliculatus  aThe rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus is the first marine teleost found to have the biosynthetic ability of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from C₁₈ precursors catalyzed by fatty acyl desaturases (Δ6/Δ5 Fads, Δ4 Fads) and elongases of very long chain fatty acids (Elovls). Previously, we predicted the existence of insulin (INS) response elements (IREs) including nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) and sterol regulatory element (SRE) in the core promoter region of rabbitfish Δ6/Δ5 fads and Δ4 fads. To clarify the potential regulatory effect and mechanism of INS in LC-PUFA biosynthesis, INS responding region was identified at −456 bp to + 51 bp of Δ6/Δ5 fads core promoter, but not in Δ4 fads promoter. Moreover, a unique stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1) element was predicted in the INS responding region of Δ6/Δ5 fads. Subsequently, SRE, NF-Y and Sp1 elements were proved as IREs in Δ6/Δ5 fads promoter. The up-regulation of INS on gene expression of Srebp-1c, Sp1, Δ6/Δ5 fads and elovl5 as well as the LC-PUFA biosynthesis was further demonstrated in S. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) cells, but no influence was detected on Δ4 fads. Besides, inhibitors of transcription factors Srebp-1c (Fatostatin, PF-429242) and Sp1 (Mithramycin) could inhibit the gene expression of Srebp-1c, Δ6/Δ5 fads and elovl5, and abolish the up-regulation of INS on these genes’ expression and LC-PUFA biosynthesis. These results indicated that INS could up-regulate LC-PUFA biosynthesis with the involvement of Srebp-1c and Sp1 in rabbitfish S. canaliculatus, which is the first report in teleost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiganus canaliculatus 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainsulin 3apromoter regions 3asterols 0aLC-PUFA biosynthesis 0aTranscriptional regulation mechanism 0aS. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) 0aPromoter 0aInsulin response elements (IREs) 0aInsulin 0aACC 0aALA 0aANOVA 0add H2O 0aDMEM 0aEFA 0aElovls 0aFads 0aFAME 0aFAS 0aFBS 0aFM 0aFO 0aGC-MS 0aHEK 293T 0aHNF4α 0aINS 0aIRE 0aLA 0aLC-PUFA 0aLXR 0aNF-Y 0aPBS 0aPPAR 0aPUFA 0aQ-PCR 0aSCD 0aSCHL 0aSp1 0aSRE 0aSrebps 0aTF 0aTSS 0aVO1 aLiu, Lijie1 aLi, Mengmeng1 aXie, Dizhi1 aZhao, Jianhong1 aWang, Shuqi1 aYou, Cuihong1 aLi, Yuanyou0 tGene.g2022 Oct. 05, v. 840 p.146755-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.1467553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01723naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005500169300001800224520053400242592002800776650001700804650002200821650002500843650001700868650003200885650001900917650004400936650002700980650002201007700002001029700005801049773017301107856008401280852000901364655001201373IND60671575720221119032131.0191003e20190822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067157572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b002602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Cheng-Dong10aPyrimidine Nucleosides from Streptomyces sp.

Its dynamics plays a significant role in laser-material interaction, especially in the air environment1-11. Early plasma evolution has been captured through pump-probe shadowgraphy1-3 and interferometry1,4-7. However, the studied time frames and applied laser parameter ranges are limited. For example, direct examinations of plasma front locations and electron number densities within a delay time of 100 picosecond (ps) with respect to the laser pulse peak are still very few, especially for the ultrashort pulse of a duration around 100 femtosecond (fs) and a low power density around 1014 W/cm2. Early plasma generated under these conditions has only been captured recently with high temporal and spatial resolutions12. The detailed setup strategy and procedures of this high precision measurement will be illustrated in this paper. The rationale of the measurement is optical pump-probe shadowgraphy: one ultrashort laser pulse is split to a pump pulse and a probe pulse, while the delay time between them can be adjusted by changing their beam path lengths. The pump pulse ablates the target and generates the early plasma, and the probe pulse propagates through the plasma region and detects the non-uniformity of electron number density. In addition, animations are generated using the calculated results from the simulation model of Ref. 12 to illustrate the plasma formation and evolution with a very high resolution (0.04 ~ 1 ps). Both the experimental method and the simulation method can be applied to a broad range of time frames and laser parameters. These methods can be used to examine the early plasma generated not only from metals, but also from semiconductors and insulators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aionization 3airradiation 3ametals 3asemiconductors 3asimulation models1 aShin, Yung C.1 aKing, Galen B.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 July 02, , no. 65 p.e4033-e4033dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/40333Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/4033/investigation-early-plasma-evolution-induced-ultrashort-laser  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04056naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015600169506031000325520188900635592002802524650001602552650001702568650002202585650002202607650001302629650001302642650002602655650001002681650001602691650001302707650001302720650001502733650001102748650001902759650001602778650000702794650002302801650001102824650001402835650002002849650001102869650001802880650001802898650001202916653001602928653001802944653003202962653001402994653002503008700003003033700002303063700002303086700002103109700003603130700002203166700001903188773010903207856008103316852000903397655001203406IND60579355920221117233656.0170816e20161108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057935592DNAL7 a10.4081/jlimnol.2016.15352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBUCZYŃSKA, Edyta10aEnvironmental Heterogeneity at Different Scales: Key Factors Affecting Caddisfly Larvae Assemblages in Standing Waters Within a Lowland River Catchment  aThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.  aWe examined the importance of environmental parameters at different spatial scales influencing the occurrence of caddisfly larvae at different levels of their organization (species, faunistic metrics and functional groups) in lentic floodplain waters, in order to gain information on the ecological status and management of a small lowland river catchment. At the lowest spatial level – pH, sediment grain size, insolation and the presence of aquatic macrophytes proved significant for caddisfly larvae, at higher and the highest level (including buffer zones and the catchment) – the surface areas of watercourses and the river, distance from standing waters and distance from broadleaf forests, respectively. Rheophilous hydropsychids accounted for 17% of the whole fauna of the examined water bodies. They spread from the river via water during flood in the spring. We also detected some significant correlations between functional groups of caddisfly larvae and parameters describing buffer zones and the river catchment against the sub-catchment type use. Information provided by the Caddisfly Habitat Index showed an overall good ecological status of the river-floodplain. Caddisfly larvae may be good indicators of numerous factors and processes, but they should be studied comprehensively, at different levels of organization. Our results can be useful for preservation of biodiversity and management of river valleys. We suggest: 1) maintaining the varied structure of aquatic macrophytes in water bodies, 2) securing the long-term presence of broadleaf trees in buffer zones in order to provide detritus input, varied insolation and shelter for caddisflies, 3) limiting drainage activities in the river valley in order to save varied habitats, especially temporary ones, 4) providing heterogeneous landscape in the river catchment (homogenous land use is inappropriate).  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoptera 3abiodiversity 3abroadleaved trees 3adeciduous forests 3adetritus 3adrainage 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alarvae 3alentic systems 3amacrophytes 3apH 3arheophilic species 3arivers 3asediments 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asubwatersheds 3asurface water 3avalleys 0aTrichoptera 0aspatial scale 0aenvironmental heterogeneity 0alandscape 0alateral connectivity1 aCzachorowski, Stanisław,1 aBUCZYŃSKI, Paweł1 aPAKULNICKA, Joanna1 aSTĘPIEŃ, Edyta1 aSZLAUER-ŁUKASZEWSKA, Agnieszka1 aSTRYJECKI, Robert1 aZAWAL, Andrzej0 tJournal of limnology.g2016 Nov. 08, v. 76, no. 2dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx1723-86337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.15353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245012100211300001800332506007600350520070100426592002801127506003701155650001601192650002201208650001701230650001001247650003201257650001201289650001601301650001701317650001201334651001501346651001101361700001801372700003001390700002401420700002701444700002201471700002201493700007601515700006401591700007901655773017301734856008401907852000901991655001202000IND60671575920221207064001.0191003e20190829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067157592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b003402doi7 aPMC68587932pmcid7 a314652222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Choon Yong10aα-Pyrone and Sterol Constituents of Penicillium aurantiacobrunneum, a Fungal Associate of the Lichen Niebla homalea  ap. 2529-2536.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFour new metabolites, 4-epi-citreoviridin (1), auransterol (3), and two analogues (2 and 4) of paxisterol (6), together with two known metabolites (15R*,20S*)-dihydroxyepisterol (5) and (6), were isolated from cultures of the fungal associate, Penicillium aurantiacobrunneum, of the lichen Niebla homalea, endemic to California and Baja California.

Winter Brassica rapa produces high early biomass and could be grown as a pre-crop harvested early in the year followed by a second crop such as maize. The objectives of this study were to estimate heterosis and combining ability of 15 European winter B. rapa cultivars for biomass yield at end of flowering. A half-diallel without reciprocals was conducted among cultivars to produce 105 crosses. These crosses and their parents were evaluated in two years at two locations in Northern Germany. Data collected were days to flowering (DTF), fresh biomass yield (FBY), dry matter content (DMC) and dry biomass yield (DBY). The mean DBY was 5.3 t/ha for the parental cultivars and 5.6 t/ha for their crosses. The crosses surpassed on average their parents by 7.6% for FBY and 5.9% for DBY whereas DMC was 1.4% higher in the parents. Maximum mid parent heterosis was 21.0% for FBY and 30.4% for DBY. Analysis of variance showed that genetic variance was mainly due to specific combining ability (SCA). The correlation between parental performance and general combining ability (GCA) was 0.42** for FBY and 0.53** for DBY. In conclusion, the amount of heterosis in crosses between European winter B. rapa cultivars is not very high on average, but can be up to 30% in the best crosses. Selection of parental combinations with high specific combining ability to produce synthetic cultivars can rapidly improve biomass yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa 3aanalysis of variance 3abioenergy 3abiomass production 3acorn 3acultivars 3adry matter content 3agas production (biological) 3agenetic variance 3aheterosis 3aphytomass 3aresearch 3asynthetic populations 3aGermany1 aBecker, Heiko C.0 tBioEnergy research.g2008 Mar., v. 1, no. 1 p.98-104dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-008-9001-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015500172300001600327520104500343592002801388650001801416650002501434650001301459650001001472650001601482650003101498650001901529650002001548650002301568650001001591650001001601650002101611650001601632650003901648650002101687650002201708650000901730650001301739653001601752653001301768653002001781653001601801653002101817653002801838653000801866653001301874653000901887653001101896653000801907653000901915653001201924653000901936653000801945653000801953653001001961653000901971653000801980653000801988653000801996653000702004653000702011653001002018653000702028653000802035700001902043700002502062700002502087700001902112773011202131856008202243852000902325655001202334IND60619617220221119145447.0190401e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061961722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2018.10.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunker, Suresh Kumar10aCurcumin restores hepatic epigenetic changes in propylthiouracil(PTU)Induced hypothyroid male rats: A study on DNMTs, MBDs, GADD45a, C/EBP-β and PCNA  ap. 169-180.  a6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU), a thioamide drug, is used as an effective anti-thyroid agent to treat hyperthyroidism and Graves’ disease. However, acute liver oxidative damage is an important side effect of the drug. In the present study, we report that PTU administration to rat induces hepatic epigenetic changes by upregulating expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, MBD4, MeCP2, p53 and Gadd45a and down-regulation of PCNA and C/EBP-β. This is accompanied by decrease in the cell population and augmentation of cellular lipid peroxidation, an index of oxidative stress, in liver. On the other hand, co-administration of curcumin, a polyphenol extract from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L, along with PTU ameliorates PTU- induced oxidative stress and epigenetic parameters except for the expression of MBD4. Also, co-administration of curcumin with PTU resulted in restoration of hepatic cell population and histoarchitecture. The protective effect of curcumin to PTU-induced hepatotoxicity is attributed to its antioxidative properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma longa 3aantioxidant activity 3acurcumin 3adrugs 3aepigenetics 3agene expression regulation 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahyperthyroidism 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amales 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3apropylthiouracil 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arhizomes 0aAntioxidant 0aCurcumin 0aDNA methylation 0aEpigenetics 0aOxidative stress 0a6-n-Propyl-2-thiouracil 0aBSA 0aC/EBP-β 0acDNA 0aCPCSEA 0aDNA 0aDNMT 0aGadd45a 0aIAEC 0aLPx 0aMBD 0aMeCP2 0aPCNA 0aPTU 0aRNA 0aROS 0aT3 0aT4 0aTBARS 0aTH 0aTSH1 aDutta, Abinash1 aPradhan, Jyotsnarani1 aDandapat, Jagneshwar1 aChainy, G.B.N.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Jan., v. 123 p.169-180dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2018.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002000175245008000195300001400275520156700289592002801856650002601884650002801910650002101938650001501959650002001974650002101994650001702015650002102032650000902053650001102062650001402073650002002087650001502107650003302122650001402155650002402169650003702193650001002230700001902240700001902259700002502278700001402303773014902317856006802466856009602534990002302630852000902653655001202662IND60643369420221119083624.0190510e20120811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064336942DNAL7 a10.3791/40362doi7 aPMC34867602pmcid7 a229073152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJerchel, Stefan12aA human fallopian tube model for investigation of C. trachomatis infections  ap. e4036.  aGenital tract infections with Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) are the most frequent transmitted sexually disease in women worldwide. Inefficient clearance or persistence of the pathogens may lead to ascending infections of the upper genital tract and are supposed to cause chronic inflammatory damage to infected tissues 1,2. As a consequence, severe clinical sequelae like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal occlusion and infertility may occur 3,4. Most of the research with C. trachomatis has been conducted in epithelial cell lines (e.g. HEp-2 cells and HeLa-229) or in mice. However, as with cell- culture based models, they do neither reflect the physiology of native tissue nor the pathophysiology of C. trachomatis genital tract infections in vivo 5. Further limitations are given by the fact that central signaling cascades (e.g. IFN-γ mediated JAK/STAT signaling pathway) that control intracellular chlamydial growth fundamentally differ between mice and humans 6,7. We and others therefore established a whole organ fallopian tube model to investigate direct interactions between C. trachomatis and human fallopian tube cells ex vivo 8,9. For this purpose, human fallopian tubes from women undergoing hysterectomy were collected and infected with C. trachomatis serovar D. Within 24 h post infection, specimen where analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to detect Chlamydia trachomatis mediated epithelial damage as well as C. trachomatis inclusion formation in the fallopian tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia trachomatis 3acomplications (disease) 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afallopian tubes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahysterectomy 3ainterferon-gamma 3amice 3amodels 3apathogens 3apathophysiology 3aphysiology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aserotypes 3asignal transduction 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awomen1 aKnebel, Gudrun1 aKönig, Peter,1 aBohlmann, Michael K.1 aRupp, Jan0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Aug. 11, , no. 66 p.e4036-e4036dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/40363Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/4036/a-human-fallopian-tube-model-for-investigation-c-trachomatis  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245011500210300001600325520099800341592002801339650002701367650002301394650001401417650001201431650001201443650001101455650001101466650000901477650001401486650001201500650001801512650002001530650001401550650001801564650000901582650002101591650001301612650001301625650001301638650000901651651001101660653001101671653001701682653001901699653001701718653002201735653002401757700006001781700002401841700002501865700002201890773011201912856008202024852000902106655001202115IND60619617320221119144256.0190401e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061961732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2018.10.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSofoulaki, Katerina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-257310aMetals in sardine and anchovy from Greek coastal areas: Public health risk and nutritional benefits assessment  ap. 113-124.  aConcentrations of 26 metals and elements were measured in sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) sampled from 6 Greek coastal areas in order to assess public health risks and benefits. Nutritional benefits seem to outweigh the potential risks arising from fish metal content, since various parameters (Safety Standards, Estimated Daily Intake, Maximum Safe Consumption, Hazard Quotient, Metal Pollution Index, As Carcinogenic Risk, Mercury toxicity – Selenium benefits, Nutrient Reference Values) indicated mostly safe consumption of the studied species. Weekly consumption of 480.76 g of sardine and anchovy poses minor risks (due to increased levels of essential metals like Fe and Zn in some cases) but great benefits regarding intake of essential elements like Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mo, Ca, P, Se. The traces of inorganic As detected were well below all safety limits. Hg toxicity symptoms are not likely to appear and Se benefits are not likely to be compromised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEngraulis encrasicolus 3aSardina pilchardus 3aanchovies 3aarsenic 3acalcium 3acoasts 3acopper 3airon 3amagnesium 3amercury 3anormal values 3anutritive value 3apollution 3apublic health 3arisk 3asafety standards 3asardines 3aselenium 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aGreece 0aMetals 0aS.pilchardus 0aE.encrasicolus 0aHealth risks 0aNutritional value 0aGreek coastal areas1 aKalantzi, Ioanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6539-47391 aMachias, Athanasios1 aPergantis, Spiros A.1 aTsapakis, Manolis0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Jan., v. 123 p.113-124dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2018.10.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245011300151300002000264520084700284592002801131650002301159650002801182650001501210650001501225650002101240650002201261650001101283650001201294650001601306650003701322650001301359650001101372700001701383700001401400700001601414700001801430700001501448773012401463856007401587852000901661655001201670IND60667297120221119105114.0190919e20150203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066729712DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00210a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Qi10aControllable synthesis of high quality monolayer WS₂ on a SiO₂/Si substrate by chemical vapor deposition  ap. 15795-15799.  aTungsten disulfide (WS₂), with its transformation from indirect to direct band transitions when scaled down to a monolayer, exhibits great potential for future micro-device applications. In this work, we report a controllable route for monolayer WS₂ synthesis. The high-quality of as-grown monolayer WS₂ was confirmed by optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM), Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL). The impact of growth parameters (including gas flow rate and reaction temperature) on the morphology of the WS₂ domain was investigated. A growth mechanism is proposed based on the experimental analysis. Our results also provide some general guidelines for other two dimensional (2D) monolayer syntheses of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3adisulfides 3aguidelines 3alight microscopy 3aphotoluminescence 3asilica 3asilicon 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atungsten 3avapors1 aWang, Wenhui1 aYang, Lei1 aHuang, Jian1 aZhang, Jingyu1 aXiang, Bin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 03, v. 5, no. 21 p.15795-15799dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra00210a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245014500211300001100356520207500367592002802442650002802470650001402498650001502512650001402527650000902541650002202550650001902572650001902591650002702610650002302637650001502660651002102675651001002696700001902706700001802725773013202743856008302875852000902958655001202967IND60761373820221123030453.0220126e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076137382DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-10143-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeethambaran, Bipin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9905-995510aInsights to pre- and post-event stability analysis of rainfall-cum-anthropogenically induced recent Laxmanpuri landslide, Uttarakhand, India  ap. 21.  aThe recent Laxmanpuri landslide of Mussoorie area is one of the major landslide events in the Uttarakhand Himalaya. The landslide occurred in July 2016, in proximity to Civil Hospital Quarters and Mussoorie Veterinary Hospital buildings on the Mussoorie-Chamba road. The landslide had caused serious environmental and socio-economic problems as part of the road segment along with nearby buildings being severely damaged. Though it was categorized solely as a rain-induced landslide, the Laxmanpuri area in the vicinity of the landslide location has undergone significant anthropogenic exploitation in terms of building and road construction in recent times. The proximity of landslide to civil structures and recent history of anthropogenic activities make a strong reason for detailed stability evaluation. Therefore, an engineering geological investigation and comparison based on pre- and post-event stability analyses has been carried out to derive its failure mechanism, causes and also to assess the present stability condition. This study uses finite element modelling with shear strength reduction technique for stability analysis. In the pre-event stability analysis, the slope was found to be unstable (with factor of safety < 1), and the shear strain and displacement are confined to the shallow overburden. While in the post-event stability analysis, the landslide-affected slope was found to be stable with a factor of safety of > 2. The rise in factor of safety in the post-event stability analysis may be attributed to the fact that the unstable shallow overburden mass got translationally moved down, exposing the competent in-situ quartzite rock on the slope. The investigation revealed this to be a translational failure involving shallow overburden material triggered by rainfall. The anthropogenic activities involving deep excavation for road construction and improper discharge of wastewater from the surrounding buildings over the landslide-affected slope had derailed the equilibrium condition of the slope, causing failure during rains.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3ahospitals 3alandslides 3aquartzite 3arain 3aroad construction 3ashear strength 3asocioeconomics 3atranslation (genetics) 3aveterinary clinics 3awastewater 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aKanungo, D.

Active fractions were partially purified and characterized. The necrosis-inducing factors in CFs are proteinaceous, heat stable and their necrosis-inducing activity is temperature and light dependent. The in planta activity of CFs was tested by a time series of proteinase K (PK) co-infiltrations, which was unable to affect activity 30min after CF infiltrations. This suggests that the necrosis inducing proteins (NIPs) are either absent from the apoplast and likely actively transported into mesophyll cells or protected from the protease by association with a receptor. Alternatively, plant cell death signaling pathways might be fully engaged during the first 30min and cannot be reversed even after PK treatment. Further fractionation of the CFs with the highest necrosis-inducing activity involved fast performance liquid chromatography, SDS–PAGE and mass spectrometry. This revealed that most of the proteins present in the fractions have not been described before. The two most prominent ZtNIP encoding candidates were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and subsequent infiltration assays showed their differential activity in a range of wheat cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3aKomagataella pastoris 3anecrosis 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asignal transduction 3awheat 3amass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3aTriticum aestivum 3amesophyll 3apathogens 3aleaves 3acultivars 3aapoplast 3atemperature 3apeptidase K 3afractionation 3aheat stability 3atime series analysis 3afungal proteins 3aculture filtrates 3afungi 0aLiquid chromatography mass spectrometry 0aCulture filtrates 0aNecrosis-inducing proteins 0aZymoseptoria tritici 0aPichia pastoris 0aFast protein liquid chromatography1 aCordewener, Jan H.G.1 aTabib Ghaffary, Seyed M.1 avan der Lee, Theo A.J.1 aLiu, Zhaohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8106-91861 aMirzadi Gohari, Amir1 aMehrabi, Rahim1 aAmerica, Antoine H.P.1 aRobert, Olivier1 aFriesen, Timothy L.1 aHamza, Sonia1 aStergiopoulos, Ioannis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2368-61191 ade Wit, Pierre J.G.M.1 aKema, Gerrit H.J.0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2015 June, v. 79 p.54-62dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/610083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2015.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Friesen2015%20%28M%27Barek%29%20Fungal%20Genet%20Biol%2079%2054-62.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016000172300001800332520152700350592002801877650001501905650001301920650002001933650001201953650001301965650003701978650002002015650001402035650001902049650002002068650001902088650001402107650001602121650001302137653001002150653000902160653001102169653001002180653000702190653000802197653000902205653000702214653000902221653002202230653004002252653000902292653002202301700002002323700001502343700001902358700001802377700001602395700002002411700001802431700001602449700001702465773009902482856008602581852000902667655001202676IND60535075820221120145201.0190319e20150826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053507582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Joon Young10aImmunogenicity and safety of concomitant MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine administration in older adults  ap. 4647-4652.  aConcomitant administration of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines facilitates their uptake by older adults; however, data on immunogenicity and safety of concomitant administration of adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) have not been reported.Subjects aged ≥65 years (N=224) were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive MF59-aIIV3 alone, MF59-aIIV3+PPSV23 in contralateral arms, MF59-aIIV3+PPSV23 in the same arm or PPSV23 alone (Clinical Trial Number – NCT02225327). Hemagglutination inhibition assay and multiplex opsonophagocytic killing assay were used to compare immunogenicity after single or concomitant vaccination.All groups met immunogenicity criteria for the influenza vaccine in older adults with similar seroconversion rates and geometric mean fold-increases, irrespective of concomitant vaccinations and injection site. For each pneumococcal serotype, opsonic index (OI) increased markedly after the PPSV23 vaccination, irrespective of the concomitant influenza vaccine. All subjects showed an OI≥8 for serotypes 6B, 18C and 19A post-vaccination, with a suggestion that the ipsilateral concomitant vaccination might be associated with higher OIs for some antigens. Local and systemic adverse events were more common in subjects receiving PPSV23 compared to those receiving aIIV3 alone.No interference was observed with antibody responses to influenza or pneumococcal antigens when aIIV3 and PPSV23 were administered concomitantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aclinical trials 3aelderly 3ageometry 3ahemagglutination inhibition test 3aimmune response 3ainfluenza 3ainjection site 3apolysaccharides 3aseroconversion 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aaIIV3 0aIIV3 0aPPSV23 0aPCV13 0aHI 0aGMT 0aCHMP 0aOI 0aMOPA 0aInfluenza vaccine 0aPneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 0aMF59 0aEmulsion adjuvant1 aCheong, Hee Jin1 aTsai, T.F.1 aChang, Hyun-ah1 aChoi, Min Joo1 aJeon, Ji Ho1 aKang, Seong Hee1 aJeong, Eun Ju1 aNoh, Ji Yun1 aKim, Woo Joo0 tVaccine.g2015 Aug. 26, v. 33, no. 36 p.4647-4652dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012900167506031000296520103700606592002801643650001401671650001201685650002401697650001001721650002101731650002401752650002101776650001001797650001401807650001601821653001401837653001601851653001301867653003601880700002001916700001601936700002001952773010901972856008102081852000902162655001202171IND60579356320221117233908.0170816e20170118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057935632DNAL7 a10.4081/jlimnol.2017.15642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aESTLANDER, Satu10aShould I Stay or should I Go?

The diurnal attachment behaviour of Sida crystallina (O.F. Müller, 1776) was more pronounced in the less humic lake where the animals remained fixed on plants, indicating that staying attached was a more profitable option. In the highly humic lake, the pattern was opposite, and regardless of time the highest density observed was in the free-swimming individuals, with only few animals attached to the floating-leaves for refuge, indicating that low transparency provided sufficient protection against predation. The attached S. crystallina were larger compared to free-swimming individuals in the more transparent lake, suggesting greater vulnerability of large-sized individuals to predation. The results indicate that increasing concentrations of humic substances affecting the light environment may alter the diurnal behaviour and habitat use of plant-attached zooplankton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aanimals 3aattachment behavior 3acolor 3adiurnal activity 3ahabitat preferences 3ahumic substances 3alakes 3apredation 3azooplankton 0aCladocera 0ahumic lakes 0alittoral 0aSida crystallina (O.F.

Overall, 14 previously undescribed analogues of the natural products myxochelin B and pseudochelin A were generated and structurally characterized. A subset of 10 derivatives together with their parental molecules were evaluated for their activity toward human 5-lipoxygenase. This testing revealed pseudochelin A as the most potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor among the naturally occurring compounds, whereas myxochelin A is the least active. Replacement of the catechol moieties in myxochelin B and pseudochelin A affected the bioactivity to different degrees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyxococcus xanthus 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3acarboxylic acids 3acatechol 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agenetic engineering 3alipoxygenases 3amoieties1 aWinand, Lea1 aPace, Simona1 aHiller, Wolf1 aWerz, Oliver1 aNett, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0847-086X0 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Aug. 29, v. 82, no. 9 p.2544-2549dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b004033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245013200207300001800339500002000357520092000377592002801297596004001325596003101365650002301396650000801419650005201427650001701479650001401496650002101510650001101531650001601542650001501558650001101573650000901584650001401593700005901607700005901666700006301725700006001788773011701848856008001965852000902045655001202054IND60786934120221120161456.0220806e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078693412DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.141802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaneske, Elisabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6230-401610aGenome‐scale metabolic modelling of SARS‐CoV‐2 in cancer cells reveals an increased shift to glycolytic energy production  ap. 2350-2365.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCancer is considered a high‐risk condition for severe illness resulting from COVID‐19. The interaction between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and human metabolism is key to elucidating the risk posed by COVID‐19 for cancer patients and identifying effective treatments, yet it is largely uncharacterised on a mechanistic level. We present a genome‐scale map of short‐term metabolic alterations triggered by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of cancer cells. Through transcriptomic‐ and proteomic‐informed genome‐scale metabolic modelling, we characterise the role of RNA and fatty acid biosynthesis in conjunction with a rewiring in energy production pathways and enhanced cytokine secretion. These findings link together complementary aspects of viral invasion of cancer cells, while providing mechanistic insights that can inform the development of treatment strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  cChildren's Liver Disease Foundation  cUK Research and Innovation 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3abiosynthesis 3acytokines 3adisease severity 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3arisk 3asecretion1 aZampieri, Guido1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4518-59131 aBertoldi, Loris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8516-76801 aBenvenuto, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9147-49461 aAngione, Claudio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3140-79090 tFEBS letters.g2021 Sept., v. 595, no. 18 p.2350-2365dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.141803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245013900161300002000300500001900320520128800339592002801627650001601655650001401671650001201685650002501697650000901722650001501731650002101746650001101767651001201778651001701790700002601807700001801833700001901851700002201870700001801892700001701910773014201927856007902069852000902148655001202157IND60719262920221120140924.0201201e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071926292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c041172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Elton10aEight-Year Estimates of Methane Emissions from Oil and Gas Operations in Western Canada Are Nearly Twice Those Reported in Inventories  ap. 14899-14909.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan account for 70% of Canada’s methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. In 2018, the Government of Canada introduced methane regulations to reduce emissions from the sector by 40–45% from the 2012 levels by 2025. Complementary to inventory accounting methods, the effectiveness of regulatory practices to reduce emissions can be assessed using atmospheric measurements and inverse models. Total anthropogenic (oil and gas, agriculture, and waste) emission rates of methane from 2010 to 2017 in Alberta and Saskatchewan were derived using hourly atmospheric methane measurements over a six-month winter period from October to March. Scaling up the winter estimate to annual indicated an anthropogenic emission rate of 3.7 ± 0.7 MtCH₄/year, about 60% greater than that reported in Canada’s National Inventory Report (2.3 MtCH₄). This discrepancy is tied primarily to the oil and gas sector emissions as the reported emissions from livestock operations (0.6 MtCH₄) are well substantiated in both top-down and bottom-up estimates and waste management (0.1 MtCH₄) emissions are small. The resulting estimate of 3.0 MtCH₄ from the oil and gas sector is nearly twice that reported in Canada’s National Inventory (1.6 MtCH₄).  aPublisher supplied data 3ainventories 3alivestock 3amethane 3aoil and gas industry 3aoils 3atechnology 3awaste management 3awastes 3aAlberta 3aSaskatchewan1 aWorthy, Douglas E.

They are different from those responsive hydrogels whose changes are passive or cannot be stopped or reversed once started and vice versa. The purpose of this review is to summarize major progress in developing programmable hydrogels from the viewpoints of principles, functions and biomedical applications. The principles are first introduced in three categories including biological, chemical and physical stimulation. With the stimulation, programmable hydrogels can undergo functional changes in dimension, mechanical support, cell attachment and molecular sequestration, which are introduced in the middle of this review. The last section is focused on the introduction and discussion of four biomedical applications including mechanistic studies in mechanobiology, tissue engineering, cell separation and protein delivery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiophysics 3ahydrogels 3atissue engineering 0aHydrogel 0aCell separation 0aTissue engineering 0aProtein delivery0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Sept., v. 178 p.663-680dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015600158300001600314520144400330592002801774650003401802650002501836650001701861650002401878650002001902650001701922650001901939650001301958650001701971650002701988650002302015650001602038650001502054650001102069650002402080650002102104650002102125650000902146650002502155650001402180650001002194650002102204700001602225700002302241700001702264700002202281700002402303700001702327700002502344773012202369856007402491961001302565852000902578655001202587IND60662140520221122042124.0190904e20140326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066214052DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60446b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubió, Laura10aEffect of the co-occurring components from olive oil and thyme extracts on the antioxidant status and its bioavailability in an acute ingestion in rats  ap. 740-747.  aThe aim of this work was to examine whether bioactives in thyme could enhance the antioxidant capacity of phenolics in virgin olive oil and their bioavailability in Wistar rats. After acute oral administration of extracts from olive cake (OE), thyme (TE) or their combination (OTE), blood samples were collected from 0 to 360 min. Plasma antioxidant status was analyzed by DPPH and FRAP in plasma and by SOD, CAT and GPx activities in erythrocytes. Plasma pharmacokinetics of the main metabolites of bioactives in olive oil and thyme were characterized. Plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity was significantly modulated by OE, TE, and OTE in a time-, assay, and extract-dependent manner. OE, TE, and OTE all significantly decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and catalase (CAT) activity was increased. Pharmacokinetic results showed that plasma concentration (Cₘₐₓ) of the main olive phenolic metabolites in rats fed with OTE were similar to those of OE. These results indicate that an enhanced bioavailability of olive phenolic compounds could occur in the presence of thyme, although any synergistic effect was observed in the antioxidant status when both phenolic extracts were administered. Antioxidant protection by phenolics from olive and thyme against oxidative stress occurs primarily through a direct antioxidant effect and may be related to the phenolic plasmatic metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3ablood plasma 3ablood sampling 3acatalase 3aerythrocytes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3alaboratory animals 3ametabolites 3aolive cake 3aolives 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asynergism 3athyme 3avirgin olive oil1 aSerra, Aida1 aChen, C.-Y.

The structure-activity relationship between the lipidoids and intracellular protein delivery efficiencies was explored and it was demonstrated that the newly developed LNPs are effective for gene recombination in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3abiopharmaceuticals 3agene editing 3agenes 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aribonucleoproteins 3aselenium 3astructure-activity relationships 3asulfur 0aLipidoids 0aProtein delivery 0aCRISPR/Cas9 0aGenome editing1 aYang, Tao1 aYu, Yingjie1 aShi, Nicola1 aYang, Liu1 aGlass, Zachary1 aBolinger, Justin1 aFinkel, Isaac James1 aLi, Wenhan1 aXu, Qiaobing0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Sept., v. 178 p.652-662dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014100158300002000299520131200319592002801631650001101659650002401670650001601694650002601710650001801736650001401754650001201768650001101780650001501791650001701806650000901823700001401832700001801846700001501864700001401879700001901893700001701912773012401929856007402053852000902127655001202136IND60667297520221119111204.0190919e20150402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066729752DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00224a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Shaodi12aA highly-deformable piezoresistive film composed of a network of carbon blacks and highly oriented lamellae of high-density polyethylene  ap. 31074-31080.  aThe electrical resistance change of highly extensible films consisting of a network of carbon blacks in high-density polyethylene, with different regularity of stacked lamellae, is investigated. The film was fabricated by melt mixing of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and carbon black (CB) via cast film extrusion. The morphology of particle network and regularity of stacked lamellae were affected by draw ratio during the cast film extrusion process. Testing has shown that the regularly stacked lamellar structure furnishes the film with hard elastic behavior and is conducive to the enhancement of the reversible level for the conductive film, which correlates with the piezoresistance response during the stretching and strain recovery. A rebound peak of R/R₀ is observed at the beginning of each loading cycle within the relatively low deformation level and a marked growth of the amplitude of R/R₀, as the number of cycle increases, is observed within the high deformation level for the film with highly regular stacked lamellae. It indicates that the regularity of stacked lamellar structure of matrix has a significant influence on the piezoresistivity of the film. The results could be utilized for the development of smart sensing and structural health monitoring of CB composite materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acomposite materials 3adeformation 3aelectrical resistance 3aextensibility 3aextrusion 3amelting 3amixing 3amonitoring 3apolyethylene 3asoot1 aDeng, Jie1 aYang, Luqiong1 aRen, Danqi1 aYang, Wei1 aLiu, Zhengying1 aYang, Mingbo0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 02, v. 5, no. 39 p.31074-31080dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra00224a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009700168300001800265520131700283592002801600650001901628650002301647650001901670650002201689650001701711650003601728650001601764650001501780650001201795650001301807650001701820650001001837650001401847650001001861650001101871700001501882700001701897700001701914700001801931700001101949700005801960700005202018773017402070856008402244852000902328655001202337IND60671576520221119032034.0191003e20190910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067157652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b004222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hang-Ying10aLabdane-Type Diterpenoids from Leonurus japonicus and Their Plant-Growth Regulatory Activity  ap. 2568-2579.  aThirteen new labdane-type diterpenoids 1–6, 9–11, 13, 14, 18, and 19 and seven known ones were isolated from the aerial parts of Leonurus japonicus. Compounds 1–5 represent rare examples of labdane-type diterpenoids, of which compounds 1–4 carry an N-chain linked at C-7 in their B-ring and compound 5 featured an α,β-unsaturated-γ-lactam moiety. The structures and absolute configurations of these new diterpenoids were characterized by a combination of spectroscopic techniques, X-ray crystallography, electronic circular dichroism, and calculated specific rotations. The plant-growth regulatory activity of these compounds on the growth of the roots and shoots of Lactuca sativa and Lolium perenne seedlings were evaluated. Compound 3 showed a broad-spectrum inhibitory activity with the inhibition rates ranging from 60 to 83.5% at a concentration of 200 μg/mL, which were as active as those of glyphosate. Compound 8 had a selective inhibitory activity against the growth of the roots of L. perenne seedlings with an inhibition rate of 81.7%. However, compounds 11 and 16 exhibited significant stimulation effects on the roots of L. sativa with stimulation rates of 59.8 and 65.3%, respectively. In addition, compounds 3 and 8 exhibited inhibitory effects on the germination of L. perenne seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aLeonurus japonicus 3aLolium perenne 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaerial parts 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3agermination 3aglyphosate 3alabdane 3amoieties 3aplant growth 3aroots 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots1 aPeng, Xing1 aJin, Xiaojie1 aWei, Wen-Jun1 aMa, Kai-Liang1 aLi, Ya1 aChen, Jian-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5937-55691 aGao, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3856-36720 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Sept. 10, v. 82, no. 9 p.2568-2579dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b004223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245007000211300001400281520168500295592002801980650001502008650002002023650001402043650002502057650001302082650001102095650001502106650003102121650001502152650001402167650001502181650001302196653000702209653000802216653000902224653000902233653000902242653000802251653002302259653003002282653002302312653001802335653001802353700002602371700002202397700001902419700006002438700002302498700002102521700001802542700002702560700002502587773009302612856008202705852000902787655001202796IND60619617720221119145314.0210201e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061961772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2018.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDardiotis, Efthimios1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2957-641X10aParaoxonase-1 genetic polymorphisms in organophosphate metabolism  ap. 24-31.  aOrganophosphates (OPs) are a class of chemicals commonly used in agriculture as pesticides, that can often lead to severe toxicity in humans. Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) belongs to a family of A-esterases and hydrolyses several OPs while also serving other biological roles. Two main genetic polymorphisms have been shown to affect enzymatic ability; an A > G transition in the 192nd position (192 Q/R, rs662), and an A > T at codon 55 (55 M/L, rs854560). In this review, we searched PubMed for relevant articles published from its inception till June 2018 and included publications from 1996 to 2018. We aimed to address the distribution of the polymorphisms in various populations, the way they affect enzymatic activity and the possible use of PON1 as a biomarker. The polymorphisms present great heterogeneity between populations, with the data being clearer over 192 Q/R, and this heterogeneity is related to the phylogenetic origins of each population. Concerning enzymatic activity, the different genotypes react better or worse to different OP substrates, with studies presenting a variety of findings. Detecting the “paraoxonase status” of an individual -referring to PON1 function- seems to be important in predicting OP toxicity, as studies have shown that some specific-genotype individuals present symptoms of toxicity in higher rates than others. We are strongly convinced that in order for the scientific community to reach a consensus over which polymorphisms confer susceptibility to toxicity and whether PON1 can eventually be used as a biomarker, more studies need to be carried out, since the data thus far does not seem to reach a universal conclusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3apesticides 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3atoxicity 0aOP 0aOPs 0aAChE 0aBChE 0aPON1 0aNTE 0aAnticholinesterase 0aOrganophosphate poisoning 0aGenetic toxicology 0aParaoxonase 1 0aPolymorphisms1 aAloizou, Athina-Maria1 aSiokas, Vasileios1 aTsouris, Zisis1 aRikos, Dimitrios1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2346-50571 aMarogianni, Chrysa1 aAschner, Michael1 aKovatsi, Leda1 aBogdanos, Dimitrios P.1 aTsatsakis, Aristidis0 tToxicology.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 411 p.24-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2018.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010200168300001400270520106100284592002801345650001901373650003401392650001901426650001701445650001301462650000701475650001101482650001301493700001801506700001601524700001801540700001301558773009301571856008401664852000901748655001201757IND60113088020221120091601.0141111e20130705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011308802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Juxiang10aPreparation of a dibenzylated 1,4-diazacyclohexane-derived strong anion-exchange stationary phase  ap. 77-84.  aThis paper reports the preparation of a novel, silica-based, strong anion-exchange stationary phase from a 1,4-diazacyclohexane derivative. To prepare the difunctional strong anion-exchange stationary phase, activated silica beads were first bonded with 3-chloropropyltriethoxysilane and then reacted with 1-methylpiperazine followed by benzyl chloride. The silica beads, the strong anion-exchange stationary phase and its precusors were instrumentally characterized. Aromatic acids were separated with non-aqueous anion-exchange chromatography. After elution with eluant prepared in mixed solvents of water and methanol, the resulting 1,4-diazacyclohexane-derived, difunctional, strong anion-exchange stationary phase exhibited good separation and selectivity for the aromatic acids investigated. The effects of eluant pH, eluant ion concentration and solvent composites on the separations were investigated. Organic acids with different substituents were eluted in order of decreasing dissociation coefficients, with no observable peak shape differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3aanion exchange chromatography 3aaromatic acids 3adissociation 3amethanol 3apH 3asilica 3asolvents1 aZuo, Xiongjun1 aLang, Qiwei1 aZeng, Zhijian1 aLi, Chao0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 July 5, v. 1297 p.77-84dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245017700156300002000333520099900353592002801352650001901380650002501399650001801424650002301442650002101465650001301486650002101499650001701520650001701537650001601554650001201570700001401582700001901596700001801615700001601633773012401649856007401773852000901847655001201856IND60667297620221119111129.0190919e20150302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066729762DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00225g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lina10aSynthesis of two-dimensional mesoporous carbon nitride under different carbonization temperatures and investigation of its catalytic properties in Knoevenagel condensations  ap. 22838-22846.  aA two-dimensional mesoporous carbon nitride (MCN-1) material with tunable surface area, pore volume and nitrogen content has been synthesized by using carbon tetrachloride and ethylenediamine as precursors and SBA-15 as a template. The effect of the carbonization temperature on the textural properties, N content and the types of nitrogen species of the MCN-1 samples was also investigated by several characterization techniques. The results reveal that the higher temperature favors the formation of porous structure during the thermal condensation process. In addition, the nitrogen content and the surface N/C ratio in the samples monotonically decrease with the increase of carbonization temperature. The catalytic activity of MCN-1-T is not only related to its surface nitrogen content but also dependent on the structural diversities of the surface nitrogen species. The MCN-1 sample synthesized at 400 °C shows the higher catalytic activity and stability for Knoevenagel condensations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acarbonization 3acatalytic activity 3aethylenediamines 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aporous media 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atexture1 aWang, Hao1 aQin, Zhangfeng1 aWang, Jianguo1 aFan, Weibin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 02, v. 5, no. 29 p.22838-22846dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra00225g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007000150245010200220300001800322520081100340592002801151650002701179650002901206650002901235650001801264650001001282650001401292650002101306650002101327650001301348650001901361650004401380650001801424700003101442700003901473700003301512700003301545700003101578700002501609700002801634700003101662700005901693700002501752700002401777773017301801856008401974852000902058655001202067IND60671576620200117000000.0191003e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067157662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b004632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKezetas Bankeu, Jean Jules1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8483-608010aConstituents from Nauclea latifolia with Anti-Haemophilus influenzae Type b Inhibitory Activities  ap. 2580-2585.  aThree previously undescribed indole alkaloids, named latifolianine A (1) and latifoliaindoles A and B (2 and 3), along with 10 known compounds (4–13), were isolated from the heartwood of Nauclea latifolia. Their structures were elucidated based on the analysis of their NMR and MS data.

Raman spectroscopic analysis of such types of carbon-coated SnS nanorod clearly shows the influence of the size and shape of the conductive graphite crystallites on their electrochemical performance against Li/Li⁺. The incorporation of an r-GO support for the SnS nanorods enhances the electrochemical performance. The SnS NRs/r-GO composite with both reduced graphene oxide and a carboxymethyl cellulose binder shows better performance than the carbon-coated sample. The ex situ transmission electron microscopy studies show that the carbon coating of the SnS nanorod is ruptured during the lithiation process and the particle size is not maintained uniformly, while the r-GO composite is able to maintain its shape and size during the continuous charge–discharge process. The discharge capacity of the SnS NRs/r-GO composite was 602 mA h g⁻¹ at a current rate of 160 mA h g⁻¹ after fifty continuous charge–discharge cycles. The current observations suggest that the practical energy density need not be sacrificed for power density, provided that the carbon coatings are optimized by the careful selection of additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aanodes 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acoatings 3acrystallites 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananorods 3aparticle size 3aspectral analysis 3atin 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMitra, Sāgara,0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 04, v. 5, no. 30 p.23671-23682dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra00226e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245011800199300002000317500001900337520138900356592002801745650002101773650002401794650001201818650001301830650002401843650001501867650002101882650001201903650001301915650001301928650001301941650001701954650001401971650001101985650002201996650002502018700001302043700001602056700001302072700001402085700001702099700005602116700005402172773014202226856007902368852000902447655001202456IND60719263220221120084414.0201201e20201112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071926322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c041922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9148-754410aCritical Factors Facilitating Candidatus Nitrotoga To Be Prevalent Nitrite-Oxidizing Bacteria in Activated Sludge  ap. 15414-15423.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNitrite oxidation is the primary pathway that generates nitrate in engineered systems. However, little is known about the role of a novel nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) genus Candidatus Nitrotoga in activated sludge systems. To elucidate key factors that impact NOB community composition, laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were designed and operated under the same conditions as real wastewater treatment plants to achieve considerable nitrogen removal and similar community; then, different conditions including temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), free nitrous acid (FNA), and free ammonia (FA) were applied. The 16S rRNA gene-based PCR and sequence analysis illustrated that Ca. Nitrotoga were abundant even at ambient temperature, thus further challenging the previous conception of them being solely cold-adapted. Ca. Nitrotoga are less competitive than Nitrospira during oxygen deficiency, indicating its lower affinity to dissolved oxygen. Ca. Nitrotoga are the dominant nitrite oxidizers under regular exposure to FNA and FA due to their relatively higher resistance than other NOB toward these two effective biocides. Therefore, this study demonstrates that Ca. Nitrotoga can play an important role in biological nitrogen removal and also highlights the need for multiple strategies for NOB suppression for the next-generation, shortcut nitrogen removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aambient temperature 3aammonia 3abiocides 3acommunity structure 3aconception 3adissolved oxygen 3ahypoxia 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrous acid 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asequence analysis 3awastewater treatment1 aLi, Siqi1 aNi, Gaofeng1 aXia, Jun1 aHu, Shihu1 aYuan, Zhiguo1 aLiu, Yanchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9431-69191 aHuang, Xia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4076-14640 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Nov. 12, v. 54, no. 23 p.15414-15423dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c041923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245020700197300001800404520179300422592002802215650001602243650001602259650001502275650001102290650002302301650001202324650001302336650001102349650001402360700001802374700005802392700001802450700005502468700005802523700006002581773014602641856007702787852000902864655001202873IND60769674820221121115729.0220309e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076967482DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c131512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Heejun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0439-386310aInvestigation of the C–N Bond-Forming Step in a Photoinduced, Copper-Catalyzed Enantioconvergent N–Alkylation: Characterization and Application of a Stabilized Organic Radical as a Mechanistic Probe  ap. 4114-4123.  aWhereas photoinduced, copper-catalyzed couplings of nitrogen nucleophiles with alkyl electrophiles have recently been shown to provide an attractive approach to achieving a variety of enantioselective C–N bond constructions, mechanistic studies of these transformations have lagged the advances in reaction development. Herein we provide mechanistic insight into a previously reported photoinduced, copper-catalyzed enantioconvergent C–N coupling of a carbazole nucleophile with a racemic tertiary α-haloamide electrophile. Building on the isolation of a copper(II) model complex whose EPR parameters serve as a guide, we independently synthesize two key intermediates in the proposed catalytic cycle, a copper(II) metalloradical (L*Cuᴵᴵ(carb′)₂) (L* = a monodentate chiral phosphine ligand; carb′ = a carbazolide ligand), as well as a tertiary α-amide organic radical (R·); the generation and characterization of R· was guided by DFT calculations, which suggested that it would be stable to homocoupling. Continuous-wave (CW) and pulse EPR studies, along with corresponding DFT calculations, are among the techniques used to characterize these reactive radicals. We establish that these two radicals do indeed combine to furnish the C–N coupling product in good yield and with significant enantiomeric excess (77% yield, 55% ee), thereby supporting the chemical competence of these proposed intermediates. DFT calculations are consistent with R· initially binding to copper(II) via a dative interaction from the closed-shell carbonyl oxygen atom of the radical, which positions the α-carbon for direct reaction with the copper(II)-bound carbazole N atom, to generate the C–N bond with enantioselectivity, without the formation of an alkylcopper(III) intermediate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3aalkylation 3acopper 3aenantioselectivity 3aligands 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphosphine1 aAhn, Jun Myun1 aOyala, Paul H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8761-46671 aCitek, Cooper1 aYin, Haolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2063-86051 aFu, Gregory C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0927-680X1 aPeters, Jonas C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6610-44140 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 144, no. 9 p.4114-4123dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c131513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009700159300001800256500001400274520136400288592002801652650002501680650001001705650001701715650001301732650001201745650001501757650001501772650001901787650001301806650001501819650001601834650001301850650001401863650001301877650001701890650002701907650001101934650001701945650001001962650002001972650001501992650001202007650001902019650002102038650002702059700001802086700001502104700001702119700001702136700001502153700001502168700002002183700001602203700001802219700001602237700001902253773012502272856007402397852000902471655001202480IND60731002320221118203730.0210315e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073100232DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo02910f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Shihong10aApigenin protects mice against 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-induced cholestasis  ap. 2323-2334.  aNAL-light  aCholestasis can induce liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Apigenin has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Herein, we determined whether apigenin can protect mice against cholestasis. In vitro, apigenin protected TFK-1 cells (a human bile duct cancer cell line) against H₂O₂-induced ROS generation and inhibited transforming growth factor-β-activated collagen type 1 alpha 1 and α-smooth muscle actin in LX2 cells (a human hepatic stellate cell line). In vivo, cholestatic mice induced by 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) were treated with apigenin. Apigenin potently blocked DDC-induced gallbladder atrophy and associated liver injury, fibrosis and collagen accumulation. Moreover, apigenin relieved the DDC-caused abnormality of bile acid metabolism and restored the balance between bile secretion and excretion by regulating the farnesoid X receptor signaling pathway. Furthermore, apigenin reduced inflammation or oxidative stress in the liver by blocking the DDC-activated Toll-like receptor 4, nuclear factor κB and tumor necrosis factor α, or DDC-suppressed superoxidase dismutase 1/2, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Taken together, apigenin improves DDC-induced cholestasis by reducing inflammation and oxidative damage and improving bile acid metabolism, indicating its potential application for cholestasis treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aactin 3aantioxidants 3aapigenin 3aatrophy 3abile acids 3abile ducts 3abile secretion 3acatalase 3acell lines 3acholestasis 3acollagen 3aexcretion 3afibrosis 3agall bladder 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3atumor necrosis factors1 aCao, Peichang1 aYin, Zequn1 aWang, Xuerui1 aChen, Yuanli1 aYu, Maoyun1 aXu, Baocai1 aLiao, Chenzhong1 aDuan, Yajun1 aZhang, Shuang1 aHan, Jihong1 aYang, Xiaoxiao0 tFood & function.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 12, no. 5 p.2323-2334dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo02910f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03904naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013900170300001800309500001500327520188700342592002802229650002002257650001802277650002102295650002102316650001302337650002102350650001302371650002702384650002202411650001802433650002102451650002002472650001702492650001102509650003702520650000902557650002802566650001402594650003502608650002202643650002302665650002502688653001702713653001502730653002002745653004102765653002602806653001602832653002202848700001802870700002002888700001802908700001502926700001702941700001902958700001302977700002002990700001403010773009903024856008603123852000903209655001203218IND60535076220221120145203.0190319e20150626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053507622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Dong-Bo10aConstruction and evaluation of DNA vaccine encoding Hantavirus glycoprotein N-terminal fused with lysosome-associated membrane protein  ap. 3367-3376.  a2019-12-06  aHantaviral diseases can have a high case fatality rate within the absence of broadly effective antiviral treatments or vaccines. We developed a DNA vaccine targeting the Hantavirus glycoprotein N-terminal (Gn) to major histocompatibility complex class II compartment by fusing the antigen with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), which altered antigen presenting pathway and activated the CD4+ T cells.The segments of Gn and LAMP1 were cloned into vector pVAX1, and recombinant plasmid was constructed by inserting Gn sequence into LAMP1, between luminal and the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains. Subsequently, the protein expression was identified through immunoprecipitation, western blot and Immunofluorescent assay. Adaptive immune responses were assessed by the presence of specific and neutralizing antibodies, interferon (ELISpot results, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) cytotoxicity. Epitope mapping was performed to study the T-cell epitopes. Protective immunity in vivo was evaluated using a novel HTNV-challenging model, and safety evaluation was based on histological and behavioral observations.Native or LAMP1 targeting HTNV Gn was successfully identified. Humoral immune responses were enhanced, featuring with satisfying titers of specific and neutralizing antibody production. The boosted activities of IFN-γ and CTL cytotoxicity witnessed enhanced cellular immune responses. Effective protection against HTNV in vivo was conferred in all three vaccine groups by the challenge model. Safety was confirmed and one dominant T-cell epitope screened from immunized mice overlapped the specific T-cell hot spot in HFRS patients.LAMP1 targeting strategy successfully enhanced the efficacy of HTNV Gn-based vaccine, which is highly immunogenic and safe, showing promise for immunoprophylaxis against HFRS. Further investigations are warranted in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepitope mapping 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainterferon-gamma 3aWestern blotting 3aplasmids 3aprecipitin tests 3aepitopes 3acell-mediated immunity 3amembrane proteins 3aglycoproteins 3ahumoral immunity 3aOrthohantavirus 3acytotoxicity 3amodels 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amice 3aneutralizing antibodies 3amortality 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aprotein synthesis 3aantibody formation 3arecombinant vaccines 0aAnimal model 0aHantavirus 0aImmune response 0aLysosome-associated membrane protein 0aTrafficking molecular 0aDNA vaccine 0aImmune protection1 aSun, Yuan-Jie1 aCheng, Lin-Feng1 aZhang, Ge-Fei1 aDong, Chen1 aJin, Bo-Quan1 aSong, Chao-Jun1 aMa, Ying1 aZhang, Fang-Lin1 aYang, Kun0 tVaccine.g2015 June 26, v. 33, no. 29 p.3367-3376dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245010300170300001600273520120700289592002801496650002001524650001701544650001801561650001001579650001301589650001301602650001801615650001401633650001901647650001701666653001801683653002601701653002501727653002501752700001401777700001601791700001301807700001801820700001801838700001501856700001901871773009401890856009101984852000902075655001202084IND60610090420221120105657.0190613e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061009042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huaan10aMolecular bottlebrush as a unimolecular vehicle with tunable shape for photothermal cancer therapy  ap. 620-629.  aMorphology of delivery nanovehicle plays a significant role in bioavailability of drug. Molecular bottlebrush (MBB)-based unimolecular micelle, with tunable morphologies including sphere, rod, and worm, offers a new aspect to uncover the relationship between morphology and bio-behaviors. In this study, a series of MBB as unimolecular micelle with core-shell structures were tailor-made through controlled/living polymerization and click chemistry, and served as carriers of IR780 photothermal agent. With an excellent IR780 loading content of up to ca. 25%, these molecular nanovehicles still maintained their molecular morphologies and did not aggregate in cell culture medium. Among three MBB, the rodlike one exhibited best performance in cell uptake in the 2D and also in spheroid penetration in 3D cell culture. Furthermore, this rodlike system had preferential accumulation in tumor in vivo and excellent effect on photothermal cancer therapy which effectively inhibited tumor growth. These results demonstrated an important role of nanoparticle shape on bio-behaviors and the unimolecular micelle could be a promising nanovehicle with precisely defined structure for biomedicine applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acell culture 3aculture media 3adrugs 3amedicine 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apolymerization 3atherapeutics 0aDrug delivery 0aMolecular bottlebrush 0aPhotothermal therapy 0aUnimolecular micelle1 aLiu, Hong1 aNie, Tianqi1 aChen, Yi1 aWang, Zhiyong1 aHuang, Huahua1 aLiu, Lixin1 aChen, Yongming0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Sept., v. 178 p.620-629dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010100164300001600265520129900281592002801580650001601608650002901624650002101653650001501674650002501689650002301714650001101737650001701748650001201765650002101777650002501798650001701823650002301840650001501863650002001878650001601898650001901914650002701933700002001960700002101980700002602001700002202027700002202049700001902071700002002090700002102110700002002131700001202151773012202163856007402285852000902359655001202368IND60662140820221122025811.0190904e20140129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066214082DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60454c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanello, Pier Paolo10aAntimicrobial activity of poultry bone and meat trimmings hydrolyzates in low-sodium turkey food  ap. 220-228.  aThis research was aimed at the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity exerted by poultry protein hydrolyzates derived from industrial leftovers added to minced turkey meat, intended for the production of burgers for human consumption. Hydrolyzates were obtained through enzymatic hydrolysis from poultry bone and meat trimmings, as by-products from the poultry industry. Colony forming unit assays, under both laboratory and industrial conditions, were performed to assess microbial growth. Poultry protein hydrolyzates inhibited microbial growth occurring in semi-finished turkey meat during the normal retention period because of their water holding capacity resulting in a decreased water activity. Overall, the findings demonstrated that poultry protein hydrolyzates could decrease mesophilic, psychrophilic, and thermophilic bacterial growth for the entire product shelf-life. Bacterial growth inhibition obtained in minced turkey meat by addition of poultry protein hydrolyzates (1.5%), hygroscopic amino acids mixture (1.5%) or sodium chloride (1%) was similar. It is suggested that the use of hydrolyzates could allow the reduction of salt content in poultry meat based products leading to the production of low-sodium turkey food still maintaining acceptable sensory characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacterial growth 3abyproducts 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3ahydrolysates 3apoultry 3apoultry industry 3aprotein hydrolysates 3asalt content 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3asodium chloride 3aturkey meat 3awater activity 3awater holding capacity1 aSforza, Stefano1 aDossena, Arnaldo1 aLambertini, Francesca1 aBottesini, Chiara1 aNikolaev, Ilya V.1 aKoroleva, Olga1 aCiociola, Tecla1 aMagliani, Walter1 aConti, Stefania1 aPierre,0 tFood & function.g2014 Jan. 29, v. 5, no. 2 p.220-228dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fo60454c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245017800175300001600353520117600369592002801545650002301573650001901596650002601615650001701641650005801658650001101716650001401727650001301741650002101754700002601775773009501801856008401896852000901980655001201989IND60113088320221120102501.0141111e20130705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011308832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.04.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBegnini, Fernanda R.10aPreparation and characterization of a new microwave immobilized poly(2-phenylpropyl)methylsiloxane stationary phase for reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography  ap. 113-122.  aA new reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) stationary phase was prepared and its chromatographic and physical–chemical properties were evaluated. The new stationary phase was prepared with a silica support and poly(2-phenylpropyl)methylsiloxane (PPPMS), a phenyl type polysiloxane copolymer. Since this is a new copolymer and there is little information in the literature, it was submitted to physical–chemical characterization by infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry. The chromatographic phase was prepared through sorption and microwave immobilization of the copolymer onto a silica support. The chromatographic performance was evaluated by employing test procedures suggested by Engelhardt and Jungheim, Tanaka and co-workers, Neue, and Szabó and Csató. These test mixtures provide information about the hydrophobic selectivity, silanophilic activity, ion-exchange capacity, shape selectivity and interaction with polar analytes of the new Si-PPPMS reversed phase. Stability tests were developed using accelerated aging tests under both basic and acidic conditions to provide information about the lifetime of the packed columns.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrophobicity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aion exchange 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asilica 3asiloxanes 3asorption 3athermogravimetry1 aJardim, Isabel C.S.F.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 July 5, v. 1297 p.113-122dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.04.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015600167300002000323520145300343592002801796650002201824650002001846650001201866650001001878650001801888650002001906650001601926650001601942650001601958650002301974650001401997650001602011650001902027650001702046650001402063650001002077650001102087650001202098650001102110650002002121650002002141650001002161650001002171700001702181700002002198700002102218700002102239700001902260773015002279856008102429852000902510655001202519IND60440195820221119040014.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044019582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4983-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzeem, Muhammad10aEfficacy of silicon priming and fertigation to modulate seedling’s vigor and ion homeostasis of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under saline environment  ap. 14367-14371.  aSeed preconditioning, a short gun approach to modulate the effects of abiotic stresses on crop plants, has recently gained considerable attention of the researchers to induce salinity tolerance in agronomically important crops. The present study was conducted to explore the comparative efficacy of presowing seed priming with silicon (Si) and Si fertigation to modulate the wheat growth and ion dynamics. Seeds of wheat variety, PUNJAB-11, were sown in Petri plates having nutrient solutions with (120 mM) and without NaCl. Six levels of Si (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mM), applied as sodium silicate (Na₂SiO₃), were tested either as a seed priming agent or as a supplement in the nutrient solution. Priming of seeds with Si mitigated the adverse effects of salinity stress on germination percentage, root as well as shoot length, dry and fresh weight. Application of Si either as preconditioning of seeds or addition in the growth medium resulted in reduced accumulation of sodium (Na⁺) in wheat seedlings under saline environment. Seedling’s potassium (K⁺) contents either remained unaffected or decreased whereas calcium (Ca²⁺) contents decreased at all Si concentrations except at 30 mM when Si primed seeds were grown under salt stress. Addition of Si, under salt stress, in cultivation medium exerted a positive effect on seedling’s K⁺ and Ca²⁺ contents. Silicon contribution to decontamination strategies was evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aadverse effects 3acalcium 3acrops 3aculture media 3adecontamination 3afertigation 3agermination 3ahomeostasis 3anutrient solutions 3apotassium 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed priming 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asilicon 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asodium silicate 3avigor 3awheat1 aIqbal, Naeem1 aKausar, Shakila1 aTariq Javed, M.,1 aAkram, M.

Here we have compared analysis of central carbon metabolites on optimized methods using HILIC, porous graphitic carbon or ion pair chromatography (IPC) using tributyl ammonium as IP reagent. Of the 3 chromatographic approaches examined only IPC enabled us to obtain a robust analytical methodology. This system was used to profile more than a hundred endogenous metabolic intermediates in urine, serum and tissue samples. However, whilst we found IPC to be the best of the approaches examined considerable care was still needed to obtain robust data. Thus, in excess of 40 of representative biological samples were needed to “condition” a new analytical column and further 10 matrix injections were then required at the beginning of each analytical batch in order to obtain robust and reproducible chromatographic separations. An additional limitation that we have found was that, for a small number of phosphorylated and poly carboxylic acid metabolites, measurement was only possible if the analytes were present in relatively high concentrations. We also found that, whilst this methodology could be used for the analysis of both in vitro cell culture media, cell extracts, tissue, and biological fluids (blood, urine), for the best results columns should only be used to analyze a single matrix. However, despite the need for extensive column conditioning, and the manifold disadvantages resulting from the contamination of the separation system and mass spectrometer with the ion pair reagent, IPC-MS currently provides the best means of analyzing these polar, ionic and problematic metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3ablood serum 3acarbon metabolism 3acarboxylic acids 3acell culture 3aculture media 3agraphene 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3aion pair chromatography 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 0aMetabolite profiling 0aHILIC 0aPorous graphitic carbon 0aIon pair chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aCentral carbon metabolism1 aWhalley, Nicky1 aTheodoridis, Georgios1 aWilson, Ian D.1 aDunkley, Tom P.J.1 aCritchlow, Susan E.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 July 04, v. 1349 p.60-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001700193245008900210300001600299500001500315506007600330520130600406592002801712506003701740650001801777650001901795650001001814650002401824650001801848650001401866650001901880650002301899650002501922650002501947650001801972650001001990650001702000650002602017650001602043650001702059650001402076650001702090650001702107650002002124650001302144650002002157650002102177650001602198650002102214650003402235650001102269650002302280650002902303650001802332653001802350700001702368773010002385856005502485852000902540655001202549IND4488249320221207123654.0120824e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448824932DNAL7 a225514732pmid7 aPMC36672202pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2012.01001.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, D.

We describe studies that illustrate how these automatic mechanisms underlie eating behaviours, as well as evidence that individuals are subject to inherent cognitive limitations, and mostly lack the capacity to consistently recognize, ignore or resist contextual cues that encourage eating. Restaurants and grocery stores are the primary settings from which people obtain food. These settings are often designed to maximize sales of food by strategically placing and promoting items to encourage impulse purchases. Although a great deal of marketing research is proprietary, this paper describes some of the published studies that indicate that changes in superficial characteristics of food products, including packaging and portion sizes, design, salience, health claims and labelling, strongly influence food choices and consumption in ways for which people generally lack insight. We discuss whether contextual influences might be considered environmental risk factors from which individuals may need the kinds of protections that fall under the mission of public health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahealth claims 3agrocery stores 3afoods 3apackaging materials 3aenergy intake 3apackaging 3afood marketing 3aconsumers (people) 3amarketing strategies 3aconsumer information 3apublic health 3asales 3arisk factors 3anutrition information 3arestaurants 3afood choices 3acognition 3aportion size 2aAdvertising. 2aChoice Behavior 2aCommerce 2aDecision Making 2aDietxpsychology 2aEnvironment 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology. 2aHumans 2aMarketingxmethods 2aPersuasive Communication 2aPublic Health 0aeating habits1 aBabey, S.

It was assessed from the viewpoint of energy, environment and economy by using energy efficiency, green degree and net present value index respectively. The assessment considered the trade-off relationships among these indexes, which is more comprehensive than previous systematic evaluation work only included single or two of the pathway(s) by using one or two of the index(es). Assessment results indicated that biogas upgrading pathway has the highest systematic energy efficiency (46.5%) and shortest payback period (8.9year) with the green degree production is the lowest (9.29gd/day). While for biogas SOFC pathway, although the green degree production is the highest (21.77gd/day), the payback period is longer (14.5year) and the energy efficiency is 13.6% lower than the biogas upgrading pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3aenergy efficiency 3afuel cells 3aheat 0aGreen degree 0aBiogas 0aEnergy efficiency 0aCombined heat and power 0aEconomic analysis 0aFuel cell1 aZhang, Xiangping1 aShang, Dawei1 aBao, Di1 aZhang, Suojiang1 aZheng, Tao0 tBioresource technology.g2016 Aug., v. 214 p.722-728dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009900164300001600263520109700279592002801376650001801404650001301422650003201435650001601467650001901483650002501502650001501527650001101542650001301553650001301566653001601579653003201595653001501627653002401642653002601666653001301692700005801705700001901763700001501782700001901797700006001816700002001876700002001896773010701916856008502023852000902108655001202117IND60635867320221119232930.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063586732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jun10aFate and removal of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in hybrid constructed wetlands  ap. 894-903.  aHybrid design and artificial aeration has been widely applied in wetlands, but little is known about their effectiveness in the removal of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Here we investigated the performance of various mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (CWs) with artificial aeration and hybrid design in removal of antibiotics and ARGs from antibiotics-spiked domestic sewage. Four hybrid constructed wetland systems with zeolite as substrate and Iris tectorum Maxim as plant were set up to have different artificial aeration designs. The aqueous removal efficiencies of total antibiotics ranged from 87.4% to 95.3%, while those of total ARGs varied from 87.8% to 99.1%. The mass removal of antibiotics by the CWs was attributed mainly to the microbial degradation. The present study imply that sorption of substrates and biological processes could be the two main mechanisms for ARGs elimination. The results from this study showed the hybrid CWs with artificial aeration could enhance treatment efficiencies of antibiotics and ARGs as well as conventional pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIris tectorum 3aaeration 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3aantibiotics 3abiodegradation 3aconstructed wetlands 3apollutants 3asewage 3asorption 3azeolites 0aAntibiotics 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aWastewater 0aConstructed wetland 0aMicrobial degradation 0aAeration1 aDeng, Wen-Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5383-55951 aLiu, You-Sheng1 aHu, Li-Xin1 aHe, Liang-Ying1 aZhao, Jian-Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1380-02641 aWang, Tuan-Tuan1 aYing, Guang-Guo0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 June, v. 249 p.894-903dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012200169300001400291520173200305592002802037650002702065650001702092650001102109650001502120650002602135650002202161650001602183650001102199650001602210650002602226650001602252651001502268700003102283700002302314700002502337700002502362700002502387773008902412856008102501852000902582655001202591IND60121246020221119160137.0150219e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012124602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-014-0388-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvolio, Meghan L.10aUnderstanding preferences for tree attributes: the relative effects of socio-economic and local environmental factors  ap. 73-86.  aUrban plant biodiversity is influenced by both the physical environment and attitudes and preferences of urban residents for specific plant types. Urban residents are assumed to be disconnected from their immediate environment, and cultural and societal factors have been emphasized over environmental factors in studies of landscaping choices. However, we postulate that local climatic and environmental factors can also affect preferences for plant attributes. Therefore, spatial and temporal patterns in urban tree biodiversity may be driven not only by the direct effect of environmental variables on plant function, but also by the effect of environmental variables on attitudes toward trees and associated choices about which types of trees to plant. Here, we tested the relative effects of socio-economic and local environmental factors on preferences toward tree attributes in five counties in southern California in and surrounding Los Angeles, based on 1,029 household surveys. We found that local environmental factors have as strong an effect on preferences for tree attributes as socio-economic factors. Specifically, people located in hotter climates (average maximum temperature 25.1 °C) were more likely to value shade trees than those located in cooler regions (23.1 °C). Additionally, people located in desert areas were less likely to consider trees to be important in their city compared with people located in naturally forested areas. Overall, our research demonstrates the inherent connections between local environmental factors and perceptions of nature, even in large modern cities. Accounting for these factors can contribute to the growing interest in understanding patterns of urban biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiodiversity 3acities 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3ahousehold surveys 3alandscaping 3apeople 3ashade trees 3asocioeconomic factors 3atemperature 3aCalifornia1 aPataki, D.

Herein, a novel hyperbranched amphiphilic poly[(amine-ester)-co-(d,l-lactide)]/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine copolymer (HPAE-co-PLA/DPPE) with RGD peptide (cRGDfK) and transferrin (Tf) on the periphery was synthesized and used to prepare paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for dual-targeting chemotherapy. These NPs show satisfactory size distribution, high encapsulated efficiency and a pH-dependent release profile. The intrinsic fluorescence of the hyperbranched copolymer renders the detection and tracking of NPs in vitro and in vivo conveniently. In vitro cytotoxicity studies proved that the presence of cRGDfK enhanced the cytotoxic efficiency by 10 folds in ανβ₃ integrin over-expressed human umbilical vein endothelial cells, while Tf improved cytotoxicity by 2 folds in Tf receptor over-expressed human cervical carcinoma cells. The drug-loaded NPs can be efficiently transported into the vascular endothelial cells and the target tumor cells. These results indicate that the cRGDfK and Tf decorated HPAE-co-PLA/DPPE could deliver chemotherapies specifically inside the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis with greater efficacy. Therefore, such a fluorescent nanocarrier prepared from non-cytotoxic and biodegradable polymers is promising for drug delivery in tumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3abiodegradability 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aendocytosis 3afluorescence 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3aintegrins 3amonitoring 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apaclitaxel 3atransferrin 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aLiu, Yuexian1 aSu, Shishuai1 aLi, Wei1 aChen, Chunying1 aWu, Yan0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Feb., v. 33, no. 5 p.1627-1639dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04860naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014800169300002000317520263500337592002802972650001503000650001503015650001303030650001103043650001903054650001503073650002103088650001703109650002103126650001203147650001103159650001303170650001903183650001303202650000903215650002403224650002303248650001003271650002503281650002403306650001003330650002303340650002003363650002603383650001903409650001503428650003703443650001503480650004303495650001603538650001803554650001003572650001203582650000903594650001803603650001503621650000903636700002603645700002803671700002503699700001803724700002403742700002403766700002103790700001903811700002003830773015003850856008104000852000904081655001204090IND60440196220221119035650.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044019622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-4117-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCébron, Aurélie10aImpact of clay mineral, wood sawdust or root organic matter on the bacterial and fungal community structures in two aged PAH-contaminated soils  ap. 13724-13738.  aThe high organic pollutant concentration of aged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated wasteland soils is highly recalcitrant to biodegradation due to its very low bioavailability. In such soils, the microbial community is well adapted to the pollution, but the microbial activity is limited by nutrient availability. Management strategies could be applied to modify the soil microbial functioning as well as the PAH contamination through various amendment types. The impact of amendment with clay minerals (montmorillonite), wood sawdust and organic matter plant roots on microbial community structure was investigated on two aged PAH-contaminated soils both in laboratory and 1-year on-site pot experiments. Total PAH content (sum of 16 PAHs of the US-EPA list) and polar polycyclic aromatic compounds (pPAC) were monitored as well as the available PAH fraction using the Tenax method. The bacterial and fungal community structures were monitored using fingerprinting thermal gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) method. The abundance of bacteria (16S rRNA genes), fungi (18S rRNA genes) and PAH degraders (PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase and catechol dioxygenase genes) was followed through qPCR assays. Although the treatments did not modify the total and available PAH content, the microbial community density, structure and the PAH degradation potential changed when fresh organic matter was provided as sawdust and under rhizosphere influence, while the clay mineral only increased the percentage of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase genes. The abundance of bacteria and fungi and the percentage of fungi relative to bacteria were enhanced in soil samples supplemented with wood sawdust and in the plant rhizospheric soils. Two distinct fungal populations developed in the two soils supplemented with sawdust, i.e. fungi related to Chaetomium and Neurospora genera and Brachyconidiellopsis and Pseudallescheria genera, in H and NM soils respectively. Wood sawdust amendment favoured the development of PAH-degrading bacteria holding Gram-negative PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase, catechol-1,2-dioxygenase and catechol-2,3-dioxygenase genes. Regarding the total community structure, bacteria closely related to Thiobacillus (β-Proteobacteria) and Steroidobacter (γ-Proteobacteria) genera were favoured by wood sawdust amendment. In both soils, plant rhizospheres induced the development of fungi belonging to Ascomycota and related to Alternaria and Fusarium genera. Bacteria closely related to Luteolibacter (Verrucomicrobia) and Microbacterium (Actinobacteria) were favoured in alfalfa and ryegrass rhizosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aChaetomium 3aFusarium 3aLolium 3aMicrobacterium 3aNeurospora 3aPseudallescheria 3aThiobacillus 3aVerrucomicrobium 3aalfalfa 3aassays 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3acatechol 3aclay 3acommunity structure 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3amicrobial activity 3amontmorillonite 3anutrient availability 3aorganic matter 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apopulation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3aroots 3asawdust 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3awastelands 3awood1 aBeguiristain, Thierry1 aBongoua-Devisme, Jeanne1 aDenonfoux, Jérémie1 aFaure, Pierre1 aLorgeoux, Catherine1 aOuvrard, Stéphanie1 aParisot, Nicolas1 aPeyret, Pierre1 aLeyval, Corinne0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 Sept., v. 22, no. 18 p.13724-13738dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4117-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009700165300001800262520112500280592002801405650002201433650001501455650001701470650000901487650001401496650001801510650001301528650001301541650001601554650001301570650001701583650001101600650001201611650002301623650001701646650003701663700001501700773012301715856008201838852000901920655001201929IND60627423620221117021331.0220430e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062742362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-2900-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiansheng10aFacile synthesis of ordered mesoporous silica with high γ-Fe2O3 loading via sol-gel process  ap. 6359-6365.  aA series of ordered mesoporous silica loaded with iron oxide was synthesized by facile one-step sol-gel route using Pluronic P123 as the template, tetraethylorthosilicate as the silica source, and hydrated iron nitrite as the precursor under acid conditions. The as-synthesized materials with Fe/Si molar ratio ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and N₂ adsorption porosimetry. All samples possess ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure similar to SBA-15, with a high surface area, large pore volume, and uniform pore size. Although higher iron content causes a distortion of hexagonal ordering structure to some extent, the materials still maintain the ordered mesopore structure even with Fe/Si molar ratio as high as 0.8. Pore structure and TEM data suggest that iron oxide nanoparticles are buried within the silica wall, and increasing the iron oxide loading has little effects on the pore structure of the mesoporous silica.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is known to sterically stabilize particles and prevent protein binding; as such, it is a routine way to impart in vivo longevity to drug carriers. The effect of the silica beads, both with and without silicon nanowires and PEG, on the disruption of the tight junctions in Caco-2 cells was evaluated by means of: (a) analysis of the localization of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), claudin-1 and f-actin; (b) measurements of trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER); (c) real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the expression of PKC-α and PKC-z, which regulate the fluidity of cell membranes, and RhoA and Rac1, which are mainly involved in mechanotransduction processes; and (d) drug permeability experiments with fluorescein-sodium. The results have shown that Si-nanowire-coated silica microparticles added to Caco-2 cells in culture lead to alterations in tight junction permeability and the localization of ZO-1 and f-actin, as well as to decreased width of ZO-1 and claudin-1 at the tight junction and increased expression of PKC transcripts. Si-nanowire-coated silica microparticles increased the permeability of Caco-2 cell monolayers to fluorescein-sodium in proportion to their amount. Effects indicative of loosening the Caco-2 cell monolayers and increasing their permeability were less pronounced for PEGylated particles, owing to their greater supposed inertness in comparison with the non-functionalized beads and nanowires. The analyzed Si-nanowire-coated silica microparticles have thus been shown to affect membrane barrier integrity in vitro, suggesting the possibility of using nanostructured microparticles to enhance drug permeability through the intestinal epithelium in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3aelectrical resistance 3aepithelial cells 3ahuman cell lines 3aintestinal mucosa 3alongevity 3amechanotransduction 3ananowires 3apermeability 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprotein binding 3aprotein kinase C 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asilica 3asilicon 3atight junctions1 aLee, Phin Peng1 aWalsh, Laura A.1 aFischer, Kathleen E.1 aDesai, Tejal A.0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Feb., v. 33, no. 5 p.1663-1672dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245012300208300001600331500001500347520110200362592002801464650001501492650002201507650001401529650001501543650001201558650000901570650001301579650001701592650001801609650001501627650001701642650002101659653001501680700002301695700002501718700002001743700002701763700003301790700002101823700002401844700002101868700002501889700002601914700002201940700002501962700002001987700001502007700002602022773009002048856008202138990002302220852000902243655001202252IND60092826320221122053204.0141103e20121205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.11.0032doi7 aPMC35440782pmcid7 a232172572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanza, Ian R.10aChronic Caloric Restriction Preserves Mitochondrial Function in Senescence without Increasing Mitochondrial Biogenesis  ap. 777-788.  a2019-12-06  aCaloric restriction (CR) mitigates many detrimental effects of aging and prolongs life span. CR has been suggested to increase mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby attenuating age-related declines in mitochondrial function, a concept that is challenged by recent studies. Here we show that lifelong CR in mice prevents age-related loss of mitochondrial oxidative capacity and efficiency, measured in isolated mitochondria and permeabilized muscle fibers. We find that these beneficial effects of CR occur without increasing mitochondrial abundance. Whole-genome expression profiling and large-scale proteomic surveys revealed expression patterns inconsistent with increased mitochondrial biogenesis, which is further supported by lower mitochondrial protein synthesis with CR. We find that CR decreases oxidant emission, increases antioxidant scavenging, and minimizes oxidative damage to DNA and protein. These results demonstrate that CR preserves mitochondrial function by protecting the integrity and function of existing cellular components rather than by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aprotein synthesis 3alongevity 3abiogenesis 3asurveys 3amice 3aoxidants 3amitochondria 3amuscle fibers 3aproteomics 3aantioxidants 3alow calorie diet 0asenescence1 aZabielski, Piotrek1 aKlaus, Katherine A.1 aMorse, Dawn M.1 aHeppelmann, Carrie J.1 aBergen, H. Robert, IIIcIII1 aDasari, Surendra1 aWalrand, Stéphane,1 aShort, Kevin R.1 aJohnson, Matthew L.1 aRobinson, Matthew M.1 aSchimke, Jill M.1 aJakaitis, Daniel R.1 aAsmann, Yan W.1 aSun, Zhifu1 aNair, K.

However, scores should not be interpreted as identical across groups without evidence of measurement invariance. Noninvariant measures indicate that the underlying construct may be different across groups. To determine whether the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) is invariant across different groups of Ghanaian and South African youth aged 15 to 24. We analyzed cross-sectional quantitative data from 1437 and 4165 young South Africans and Ghanaians, respectively. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine whether the HFIAS was invariant across different groups of youth, including sex (male or female), age group (middle adolescence, late adolescence, or emerging adulthood), and receipt of child support grant (yes or no). We assessed 3 levels of invariance: configural, metric, and scalar. The model fit between nested models was compared using χ² difference testing. Invariance tests indicated that the HFIAS had configural, metric, and scalar invariance across different groups of Ghanaian and South African youth. Model fit statistics across all invariance levels indicated good fit of our hypothesized model with the observed data. χ² difference testing results were not statistically significant across all nested models. Food insecurity, as measured by the HFIAS, meant the same thing for different groups of Ghanaian and South African youth. Evidence of invariance means that the HFIAS scores could be interpreted as identical across youth groups in our study.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aadulthood 3achildren 3afactor analysis 3afemales 3afood security 3amales 3amodels 3anutrition 3ayouth 0ahousehold food insecurity 0aGhana 0aadolescents 0asouth Africa1 aSharma, Anjalee0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g2021 Sept., v. 42, no. 3 p.437-450dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x1564-82657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/037957212110196343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245017100166300001600337520101800353592002801371650002501399650002101424650001301445650001701458650001701475650001901492650002101511650001101532650001201543650001501555650001901570650001901589650001701608650002001625653001701645653002601662653002101688653002001709653002601729700001701755700001401772700001701786700001501803700001301818700001201831773011301843856008501956852000902041655001202050IND60582865420221118002844.0180830e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058286542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2016.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Xinfei10aHigh desalination permeability, wetting and fouling resistance on superhydrophobic carbon nanotube hollow fiber membrane under self-powered electrochemical assistance  ap. 501-509.  aGlobal shortage of fresh water is becoming an increasingly serious problem. Membrane distillation is an attractive technology, but suffers from low permeability, insufficient wetting and fouling resistance. In this work, membrane distillation coupling with electrochemistry was developed to achieve high desalination performance on superhydrophobic CNT hollow fiber membrane. The prepared membrane possessed higher permeability, better wetting resistance with permeate flux of 1.3–1.6 folds, water entry pressure of 1.4–1.7 folds as high as conventional PVDF and PP hollow fiber membranes. When it worked as cathode at a low voltage of 0.5V, its fouling resistance was further improved and no flux loss occurred in 36h operation for feed containing natural organic matter, while 15% flux loss was observed under open circuit. Interestingly, the energy consumed by electrochemical assistance can be self-powered by thermoelectric power generating module from the temperature gradient between feed and permeate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon nanotubes 3acathodes 3adesalination 3adistillation 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afouling 3afreshwater 3ahydrophobicity 3aorganic matter 3apermeability 3awater treatment 0aDesalination 0aMembrane distillation 0aElectrochemistry 0aCarbon nanotube 0aHollow fiber membrane1 aLiu, Yanming1 aQuan, Xie1 aZhao, Huimin1 aChen, Shuo1 aYi, Gang1 aDu, Lei0 tJournal of membrane science.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 514 p.501-509dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04126naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009400167300001600261520183100277536045802108592002802566596008602594650001602680650001502696650001702711650001202728650001502740650001702755650002402772650001202796650001502808650001702823650001502840651001302855653001202868653001602880653001402896653001002910653001602920653001402936653001902950653001902969653002802988700002703016700002403043700001903067700001903086700002803105700001503133700001603148700002103164700005803185700006003243773011903303856008103422852000903503655001203512IND60750522520221120114923.0210915e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075052252DNAL7 a10.1177/037957212110207152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRector, Colette10aSchool-Based Nutrition Programs for Adolescents in Dodoma, Tanzania: A Situation Analysis  ap. 378-388.  aTanzania has a double burden of malnutrition, including a high prevalence of undernutrition and an increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents. Schools present a valuable opportunity to reach a large section of the country’s adolescent population with nutrition-oriented interventions. The objective of this study was to assess the current state of adolescent school nutrition interventions in Dodoma, Tanzania, with emphasis on 3 potential school-based nutrition interventions, school vegetable gardens, school meals, and education (on nutrition, agriculture, and water, sanitation, and hygiene). Focus group discussions were conducted with several regional and district-level governmental stakeholders, including health, education, and agricultural officers. Ten public secondary schools were visited, and interviews with school administrators, teachers, students, and parents were conducted. All stakeholders interviewed supported interventions to improve school-based nutrition, including school gardens, school feeding, and nutrition education. All 10 schools visited had some experience providing school meals, but parents’ contributions were essential for the program’s sustainability. Most schools visited had land available for a school garden program, but water availability could be challenging during certain times of the year. The teachers interviewed expressed that the curriculum on nutrition education was highly theoretical and did not allow students to practice the knowledge and skills they learned in the classroom. The current school-based approach to tackling the double burden of adolescent malnutrition in Dodoma is localized and ad hoc. To leverage the potential of schools as a platform for nutrition interventions, integrated and policy-mandated interventions are needed.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the program of “Walker Study Group: Improving Public Health through Nutrition & Agriculture” of the Departments of Nutrition and Global Health and Population at Harvard T.H.

They include the (i) discovery of a series of previously unreported monomers from a large library of monomers with high protein resistance and subsequent low fouling characteristics for membrane ultrafiltration of protein-containing fluids, (ii) development of a new approach to investigate protein-resistant mechanisms from structure-property relationships, and (iii) adaptation of a new surface modification method, called atmospheric pressure plasma-induced graft polymerization (APP), together with a high throughput platform (HTP), for low cost vacuum-free synthesis of anti-fouling membranes. Several new high-performing chemistries comprising two polyethylene glycol (PEG), two amines and one zwitterionic monomers were identified from a library (44 commercial monomers) of five different classes of monomers as strong protein-resistant monomers. Combining our analysis here, using the Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) approach, and data from the literature, we conclude that strong interactions with water (hydrogen bonding) and surface flexibility are necessary for producing the highest protein resistance. Superior protein-resistant surfaces and subsequent anti-fouling performance was obtained with the HTP-APP as compared with our earlier HTP-photo graft-induced polymerization (PGP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aamines 3aatmospheric pressure 3afouling 3ahydrogen bonding 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3asolubility 3aultrafiltration 3azwitterions1 aKilduff, James E.1 aBelfort, Georges0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Feb., v. 33, no. 5 p.1261-1270dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011100167300001600278500001900294520149300313536020701806592002802013596001302041596001702054650001202071650001702083650002202100650001902122650001502141650002402156650001702180650002102197650001002218651001002228653002802238653001702266653001902283653002902302700001902331700001202350700001602362700001302378773014502391856008502536852000902621655001202630IND60734212920221119052732.0210417e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073421292DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2020.18453572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jing10aEffect of different biochar application rates on soil organic carbon in the semi-arid Loess Plateau, China  ap. 423-431.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiochar plays an important role in improving soil quality and carbon (C) sequestration. However, the effects of different biochar application rates on soil organic C content and its fractions in the Loess Plateau of northwest China are still unclear. In this work, six biochar treatments were studied, with application rates of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 t·ha⁻¹ (CK, T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5, respectively). Soil total organic C (TOC), readily oxidizable C (ROC), water-soluble organic C (WSOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), light fraction organic C (LFOC), heavy fraction organic C (HFOC) and the Carbon pool management index (CPMI) in the 0–30 cm layer were analyzed after 3 years of wheat field trials. The content of soil TOC and its fractions decreased with soil depth but was significantly (p < .05) increased by biochar. TOC, ROC and HFOC showed significant (p < .05) positive correlations with the rate of biochar application, with the highest content of these components in T5. MBC, WSOC and LFOC first increased and then decreased with the increasing rate of biochar application. MBC and WSOC of T3 and LFOC of T4 were the highest of all treatments. When compared with CK, the CPMI of all biochar treatments was >100% in the order of T5 > T4 > T3 > T2 > T1. This study provides scientific support for large-scale biochar application on the Loess Plateau to significantly improve soil quality via increasing the soil organic C fractions and enhancing the inert soil C pool.  aThis work was supported by the [National Natural Science Foundation of China] under Grants [31571594] and [315159]; and [Gansu New Fertilizer Creation Engineering Laboratory] under Grant [GSXF-2018-03].  aPublisher supplied data  a31571594  aGSXF-2018-03 3abiochar 3acarbon sinks 3amicrobial biomass 3aplant analysis 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3awater solubility 3awheat 3aChina 0aC pool management index 0adry farmland 0aorganic carbon 0aorganic carbon fractions1 aZhang, Ren-zhi1 aWu, Jun1 aCai, Li-Qun1 aDong, Bo0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2021 Mar. 09, v. 52, no. 5 p.423-431dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2020.18453573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03764naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011500163300001800278500002000296520232200316592002802638650002902666650001002695650002602705650001602731650001102747650001302758650002202771650001202793650002402805650001502829650001402844650001102858650001902869650001402888650001502902650000902917650002202926650001502948650002202963650001002985650001202995651001203007700002503019773013203044856007303176852000903249655001203258IND60587604520221118101518.0180102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058760452DNAL7 a10.1890/10-1886.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnowlton, Jessie L.10aSpecies interactions are disrupted by habitat degradation in the highly threatened Tumbesian region of Ecuador  ap. 2974-2986.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInteractions between species in groups are often ignored in studies of the effects of anthropogenic change on species' persistence, and yet, given their global ubiquity, mixed‐species groups have the potential to be models for community ecology. In this paper we examine the impacts of rural community activities that are pervasive in tropical regions on mixed‐species flocks of birds in a unique coastal tropical dry forest ecosystem, with the aim of advancing both our understanding of mixed‐species associations and how best to conserve them. We examined the effects of small‐scale clearing of trees and livestock grazing on mixed flocks in two vegetation types in the highly threatened Tumbesian region of Ecuador. Because the fitness benefits of flocking come from a reduced risk of predation or enhanced feeding efficiencies, or both, habitat degradation could lead to changes in the benefits of flocking and thus flock characteristics. We predicted that, in more disturbed vegetation, flocks would have fewer species and individuals and that species would show lower flocking propensities and feeding efficiencies. Based on observations of 431 flocks, we found that these predictions were supported in tropical dry forest but not always in arid scrub vegetation. Less disturbed tropical dry forest had greater mean species richness per flock than more disturbed tropical dry forest, but mean species richness per flock did not differ between more and less disturbed arid scrub. Flock species richness and composition differed across the disturbance levels in tropical dry forest, but not in arid scrub. Many species had their highest flocking propensities and greatest foraging efficiencies in less disturbed, compared to more disturbed, vegetation. We show that existing park management, which allows community development and livestock grazing within national park borders, leads to degradation of the vegetation and disrupts species' interactions in tropical dry forest. We provide specific conservation recommendations to mitigate these disruptive influences. Examining intraspecific associations across diverse communities is of the utmost importance to both answering basic theoretical questions in community ecology and conserving species diversity in the face of anthropogenic landscape change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abirds 3acommunity development 3adry forests 3aflocks 3aforaging 3aforest ecosystems 3agrazing 3ahabitat destruction 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3amodels 3anational parks 3apredation 3aprediction 3arisk 3arural communities 3ashrublands 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3atropics 3aEcuador1 aGraham, Catherine H.0 tEcological applications.g2011 Dec., v. 21, no. 8 p.2974-2986dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-1886.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010800167300001600275520116100291592002801452650002501480650001101505650002401516650003101540650002401571650001001595650001601605650002001621650001101641650001001652650000901662650001201671650001601683700002001699700001501719700001901734700002001753700002201773700001601795700002101811700002001832700002401852700001901876700002101895773009001916856008202006990002302088852000902111655001202120IND60092826720221122043219.0141103e20121205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009282672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cmet.2012.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsukita, Sohei10aHepatic Glucokinase Modulates Obesity Predisposition by Regulating BAT Thermogenesis via Neural Signals  ap. 825-832.  aConsidering the explosive increase in obesity worldwide, there must be an unknown mechanism(s) promoting energy accumulation under conditions of overnutrition. We identified a feed-forward mechanism favoring energy storage, originating in hepatic glucokinase (GK) upregulation. High-fat feeding induced hepatic GK upregulation, and hepatic GK overexpression dose-dependently decreased adaptive thermogenesis by downregulating thermogenesis-related genes in brown adipose tissue (BAT). This intertissue (liver-to-BAT) system consists of the afferent vagus from the liver and sympathetic efferents from the medulla and antagonizes anti-obesity effects of leptin on thermogenesis. Furthermore, upregulation of endogenous GK in the liver by high-fat feeding was more marked in obesity-prone than in obesity-resistant strains and was inversely associated with BAT thermogenesis. Hepatic GK overexpression in obesity-resistant mice promoted weight gain, while hepatic GK knockdown in obesity-prone mice attenuated weight gain with increased adaptive thermogenesis. Thus, this intertissue energy-saving system may contribute to determining obesity predisposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrown adipose tissue 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglucokinase 3aheat production 3aleptin 3aliver 3amice 3aobesity 3aweight gain1 aYamada, Tetsuya1 aUno, Kenji1 aTakahashi, Kei1 aKaneko, Keizō,1 aIshigaki, Yasushi1 aImai, Junta1 aHasegawa, Yutaka1 aSawada, Shojiro1 aIshihara, Hisamitsu1 aOka, Yoshitomo1 aKatagiri, Hideki0 tCell metabolism.g2012 Dec. 5, v. 16, no. 6 p.825-832dElsevier Inc.x1550-41317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2012.11.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014900173300001600322500001900338520167800357592002802035650002102063650003002084650002502114650001602139650002102155650002002176650002002196650002102216650000902237650002002246650001202266650001902278650001702297650001802314650001002332650000902342650002602351650001102377650002102388653002102409653003202430653002302462653001102485653001202496653003002508700001402538700001702552773014502569856008502714852000902799655001202808IND60734213120221119053141.0210417e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073421312DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2020.18542872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Navin Kumar10aProductivity, Profitability, Enzyme Activities and Nutrient Balance in Summer Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) as Influenced by NPK Drip Fertigation  ap. 443-455.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeanut cultivation during the summer needs precise management of nutrient and water resources particularly in arid and semi-arid areas to sustain agricultural productivity where water is a scarce commodity. Application of NPK fertilizers both normal and water-soluble was evaluated using soil and drip fertigation methods for their effect on productivity, profitability, enzyme activities, and soil nutrient balance. Application of 100% NF at sowing through drip irrigation (T₁₀) significantly (p =.05) enhanced leaf area index (LAI), yield attributes, pod, kernel, and oil yields, and net returns over T₁, which was found at par to the staggered application of 75% or 100% water-soluble fertilizers (WSF) through drip except for net returns at T₅ and T₈. However, the highest plant height, dry weight, and haulm yield was observed under T₄. The highest PFP was recorded with treatment T₆ and showed a declining trend with an increase in fertilizer dose. Activities of phosphatase enzymes increased up to 60 DAS and thereafter, showed a declining trend except for alkaline phosphatase under T₁. Significantly higher dehydrogenase activity was reported under T₉ at 60 DAS except under T₁ and T₆. Compared to initial status, actual available N, P, and K status after harvest increased in all the treatments but maximum actual gains were recorded under T₁. The results clearly indicated that pod yield and net returns obtained under treatments T₂ to T₉ were comparable to T₁₀ except for net returns at T₅ and T₈. Therefore, 25% NPK requirement could be saved without affecting yield and net returns with treatment T₆ in the summer peanut.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aagricultural productivity 3aalkaline phosphatase 3afertigation 3afertilizer rates 3aleaf area index 3amicroirrigation 3anutrient balance 3aoils 3aoxidoreductases 3apeanuts 3aplant analysis 3aplant height 3aprofitability 3aseeds 3asoil 3asoil nutrient balance 3asummer 3awater solubility 0aDrip fertigation 0apartial factor productivity 0anormal fertilizers 0apeanut 0aquality 0awater-soluble fertilizers1 aYadav, RS1 aJat, Ram A.,0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2021 Mar. 09, v. 52, no. 5 p.443-455dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2020.18542873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04055naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245011700203300001600320520152400336536052901860592002802389596012302417596011602540596013402656596015302790650001902943650002802962650001702990650002203007650001303029650002303042650001303065650001503078650001203093651001003105653003203115653001103147653001203158700002103170700002003191700002003211700005503231700006603286773011903352856008103471852000903552655001203561IND60750522920221120125125.0210915e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075052292DNAL7 a10.1177/037957212110265202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFahey, Nisha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9059-147010aKnowledge of Breastfeeding and Kangaroo Mother Care Practices Among General Practitioners in Rural Western India  ap. 460-463.  aBreastfeeding and Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) are interventions to reduce neonatal mortality and undernutrition. We investigated the knowledge of allopathic and Ayurvedic, Yoga-naturopathy, Siddha, and Homeopathic (AYUSH) general practitioners in rural western India and identified attributes associated with awareness and knowledge on these topics. This cross-sectional study of general practitioners in the Anand district of Gujarat, India, used an anonymous self-reported survey. Multivariable regression models were used to identify practitioner attributes associated with awareness and knowledge. Among the 158 respondents, a quarter (26.0%) were trained in allopathic medicine and 63.0% had practiced for 5 years or more. The average score of breastfeeding knowledge was 8.0 of 13. Most (79.1%) did not have any awareness of KMC. After adjusting for potential confounders, knowledge of breastfeeding practices among AYUSH practitioners was 4-fold greater than that of allopathic practitioners (incidence rate ratio: 3.9; 95% CI: 3.2-4.6). By contrast, AYUSH practitioners had 80% decreased odds of awareness about KMC compared with allopathic practitioners (odds ratio: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1-0.3). This study demonstrates distinct knowledge gaps among allopathic and AYUSH general practitioners regarding breastfeeding and KMC. There is a need for tailored continuing medical education among general practitioners to enhance their clinical knowledge of newborn care practices to achieve improvements in neonatal health.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities [P60-MD006912-05 to J.A.]; the National Institute of General Medical Science [T32GM107000 to A.S.]; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences [TL1-TR001454 to A.S.]; and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [1F30HD091975-03 to A.S.].  aPublisher supplied data  aTL1-TR001454cNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100006108  aT32GM107000cNational Institute of General Medical Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100000057  aP60-MD006912-05cNational Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparitiesdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100006545  a1F30HD091975-03cEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Developmentdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100009633 3abreast feeding 3across-sectional studies 3amalnutrition 3amedical education 3amedicine 3aneonatal mortality 3aneonates 3aodds ratio 3asurveys 3aIndia 0akangaroo mother care method 0ainfant 0anewborn1 aSadhwani, Nitesh1 aShethwala, Smit1 aAllison, Jeroan1 aSoni, Apurv1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5049-36571 aNimbalkar, Somashekhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2825-28190 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g2021 Sept., v. 42, no. 3 p.460-463dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x1564-82657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/037957212110265203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009500171300001600266520080900282592002801091650002101119650001301140650001101153650003001164650001401194650002101208650002901229650001201258650002501270650002101295650001801316650001101334650001501345650002501360653002101385653001201406653001801418653003101436700002001467700001901487773010601506856008701612852000901699655001201708IND60526750720221118202125.0190409e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052675072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Kum-Lok10aCharacteristics of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the wastewater treatment plant  ap. 881-884.  aThe nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions were measured from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using a flux chamber to determine the emission factors.

We used an individually based epidemiological model to assess the relative efficacies of three management interventions (sterilization, vaccination, and test‐and‐remove). The model was parameterized with demographic and epidemiological data from bison in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Sterilization and test‐and‐remove were most successful at reducing seroprevalence when they were targeted at young seropositive animals, which are the most likely age and sex category to be infectious. However, these approaches also required the most effort to implement. Vaccination was less effective (even with a perfect vaccine) but also required less effort to implement. For the treatment efforts we explored (50–100 individuals per year or 2.5–5% of the female population), sterilization had little impact upon the bison population growth rate when selectively applied. The population growth rate usually increased by year 25 due to the reduced number of Brucella‐induced abortions. Initial declines in seroprevalence followed by rapid increases (>15% increase in 5 years) occurred in 3–13% of simulations with sterilization and test‐and‐remove, but not vaccination. We believe this is due to the interaction of superspreading events and the loss of herd immunity in the later stages of control efforts as disease prevalence declines. Sterilization provided a mechanism for achieving large disease reductions while simultaneously limiting population growth, which may be advantageous in some management scenarios. However, the field effort required to find the small segment of the population that is infectious rather than susceptible or recovered will likely limit the utility of this approach in many free‐ranging wildlife populations. Nevertheless, we encourage scientists and policy makers to consider sterilization as part of a suite of available brucellosis management tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3abison 3abovine brucellosis 3acattle 3acontrol methods 3adisease prevalence 3afemales 3aherd immunity 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anational parks 3apopulation growth 3aseroprevalence 3avaccination 3avaccines 3awildlife 3aUnited States1 aCross, Paul1 aWallen, Rick1 aWhite, P.

In social species, these adaptations can have a considerable impact on the structure, the organization, and the functioning of groups. Here, we consider how selection for inbreeding avoidance fashions the social behavior of arthropods, a phylum exhibiting an unparalleled richness of social lifestyles. We first examine life histories and parental investment patterns determining whether individuals should actively avoid or prefer inbreeding. Next, we illustrate the diversity of inbreeding avoidance mechanisms in arthropods, from the dispersal of individuals to the rejection of kin during mate choice and the production of unisexual broods by females. Then, we address the particular case of haplodiploid insects. Finally, we discuss how inbreeding may drive and shape the evolution of arthropods societies along two theoretical pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarthropods 3aevolution 3afemales 3ainbreeding 3ainsects 3alife history 3amating behavior 3asocial behavior1 aNozari, Jamasb1 aLihoreau, Mathieu0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2012 Oct., v. 99, no. 10 p.779-788dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-012-0961-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245007100208300001600279520130900295536046801604592002802072596007102100650001402171650001502185650001102200650002202211650001102233650002602244650001502270651001002285653003602295653001402331653002702345653002902372700002102401700002702422700001802449700001802467773011902485856008102604852000902685655001202694IND60750523020221122153443.0210915e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075052302DNAL7 a10.1177/037957212110268072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhury, Samira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3488-078510aCaste-Based Inequality in Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in India  ap. 451-459.  aFruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption is of central importance to many diet-related health outcomes. In India, caste is a major basis of socioeconomic inequality. Recent analysis shows that more disadvantaged “lower” castes consume less F&V than the rest. This article explores whether this consumption gap arises due to differential distribution of drivers of consumption such as income and education across castes, or whether behavioral differences or discrimination may be at play. The Oaxaca-Blinder regression decomposition is applied to explain the gap in F&V consumption between “upper” castes and “lower” castes, using data from the 68th (2011-2012) round of the National Sample Survey Organization household survey. Differences in the distribution of F&V drivers account for all of the 50 grams/person/day consumption gap between upper and lower castes. In particular, much of the gap is explained by income differential across castes. In the long run, India’s positive discrimination policies in education and employment that seek to equalize income across castes are also likely to help close the F&V consumption gap, leading to health benefits. In the medium run, interventions acting to boost lower caste income, such as cash transfers targeting lower castes, may be effective.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study forms part of the Sustainable and Healthy Food Systems (SHEFS) programme supported by the Wellcome Trust’s Our Planet, Our Health programme [grant number: 205200/Z/16/Z].

However, there is no nationwide program where these children are managed with take-home therapeutic/supplementary food as recommended by World Health Organization. This study aimed to identify the changes in nutritional status and morbidities over 3 months of U-5 children having severe wasting (ie, SAM) whose parents refused to admit their children in the residential nutrition rehabilitation unit of the Dhaka Hospital of icddr, b (an international health research Institute based in Dhaka, Bangladesh), and instead attended the nutrition follow-up unit (NFU), and thus did not receive any food supplementation during nutritional rehabilitation. At the NFU, these SAM children on every visit (fortnightly to monthly) received health and nutrition education, multivitamins, zinc and iron supplements, and treatment of illnesses if any. During the study period, a total 180 U-5 SAM children came regularly for NFU visit for at least 3 months, and they comprised our study sample. Their age at first NFU visit (baseline) was 13.4 ± 7.8 months and 46% were female. Over these 3 month follow-up period, the rate of weight gain was 2.2 ± 1.9 g/kg/d, change in mid upper arm circumference was from 105 to 115 mm, and change in weight-for-length or weight-for-height z-score was from −2.70 ± 0.94 to −1.95 ± 1.00. During the prior 14 days to the 4 NFU follow-up visit, 13.6% to 22.8% had common cold and/or cough, and 12.2% to 15.1% had pneumonia. Because the rate of weight gain was far below the expected ∼5 g/kg/d, the NFU visits without food supplementation are insufficient in terms of catchup growth. Thus, additional efforts are required to improve the management of these SAM children for their catchup growth.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Grant support: icddr, b core fund.  aPublisher supplied data  cinternational centre for diarrhoeal disease research, bangladeshdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100009054 3aWorld Health Organization 3aarm circumference 3acommon cold 3acough 3adeath 3adiet therapy 3afemales 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3anutrition education 3anutritional status 3apneumonia 3aresearch institutions 3arisk 3aweight gain 3azinc 3aBangladesh 0asevere wasting 0asevere acute malnutrition 0aSAM 0afood supplementation1 aHuq, Sayeeda1 aAhmed, Tahmeed0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g2021 Sept., v. 42, no. 3 p.399-405dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x1564-82657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/037957212110285453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015300154300001800307520047500325592002800800650001400828650001600842650002300858650002100881650001500902650001000917650001500927650001100942650001600953700001700969700001500986700001601001700001701017700001601034773013401050856007401184852000901258655001201267IND60660193020221118045503.0190823e20140710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066019302DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc01965b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hai10aNovel topotactically transformed carbon–CoO–NiO–NiCo₂O₄ nanosheet hybrid hetero-structured arrays as ultrahigh performance supercapacitors  ap. 8697-8700.  aA novel carbon–CoO–NiO–NiCo₂O₄ integrated electrode has been designed by reducing the hetero-structured NiCo₂O₄ nanosheet array with C₂H₂ on the nickel foam at a low temperature of 350 °C.

The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDX), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption analyses. The adsorption properties and photocatalytic activity of commercial and carbon-coated TiO₂ catalysts were compared for the oxidation of methylene blue (MB) and bisphenol-A (BPA). It was interesting to find that the transition from anatase to rutile was suppressed by carbon coating of TiO₂ at high temperature up to 800 °C. The carbon-coated TiO₂ samples have a higher surface area and a greater adsorption amount than commercial P-25 because of the thin layer of carbon that covered TiO₂. It was also observed that the photodecomposition efficiency was dependent on the crystallinity of the carbon-coated sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3abisphenol A 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3acrystal structure 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amethylene blue 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aYi, Min-ju,1 aShim, Wang-Geun1 aYi, Chae-uk,1 aKim, Tae-yŏng,1 aLee, Dae-Haeng1 aMoon, Hee0 tJournal of materials science.g2008 Oct., v. 43, no. 19 p.6486-6494dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-008-2978-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008500173300001600258520120800274592002801482650001701510650002301527650001501550650001001565650002001575650001901595650002301614650002201637650002001659650002501679651002001704653002701724653002401751653001801775653002301793653001901816700002101835773011201856856008601968852000902054655001202063IND60686567320221121023508.0210212e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068656732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatania, Leopoldo10aHierarchical Markov-switching models for multivariate integer-valued time-series  ap. 118-137.  aWe propose a new flexible dynamic model for multivariate nonnegative integer-valued time-series. Observations are assumed to depend on the realization of two unobserved integer-valued stochastic variables which control for the time- and cross-dependence of the data. We provide conditional and unconditional (cross)-moments implied by the model, as well as the limiting distribution of the series. An Expectation–Maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters is derived, and an extensive Monte Carlo experiment investigates the finite sample properties of the resulting maximum likelihood estimator. Constrained specifications of the model are also formulated by modifying the assumptions about the dependence structure of the latent variables, and model identification is discussed accordingly. An application by means of a crime data set from the New South Wales (NSW) Bureau Of Crime Statistics And Research with observations spanning beyond 20 years is reported to illustrate the methodology. Results indicate that the proposed approach provides a good description of the conditional distribution of crime records, outperforming the standard hidden Markov model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalgorithms 3acrime 3adata collection 3adynamic models 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3atime series analysis 3aNew South Wales 0aMarkov-switching model 0aHidden Markov model 0aMixture model 0aHierarchical model 0aNSW crime data1 aDi Mari, Roberto0 tJournal of econometrics.g2021 Mar., v. 221, no. 1 p.118-137dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01319naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014100160300001800301520033600319592002800655650002300683650002300706650003100729650002200760650000900782700001700791700001900808773010600827856007500933852000901008655001201017IND60578549920221116225819.0170813e20130621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057854992DNAL7 a10.1021/ol401186f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsen, Brian J.10aSynthesis of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Inhibitor Lactimidomycin via Zn(II)-Mediated Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons Macrocyclization  ap. 2998-3001.  aAn enantioselective synthesis of potent eukaryotic translation elongation inhibitor lactimidomycin has been accomplished in 21 linear steps.

Emergent methodologies aided by molecular marker information such as marker assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection (GS) have been widely adopted to assist the development of improved genotypes. In general, the implementation of GS is not straightforward, and it usually requires cross-validation studies to find the optimum set of factors (training set sizes, number of markers, quality control, etc.) to use in real breeding applications. In most cases, these different scenarios (combination of several factors) vary just in the levels of a single factor keeping fixed the levels of the other factors allowing the use of previously developed routines (code reuse). In this study, we present a set of structured modules that are easily to assemble for constructing complex genomic prediction pipelines from scratch. Also, we proposed a novel method for selecting training-testing sets of sizes across different cross-validation schemes (CV2, predicting tested genotypes in observed environments; CV1, predicting untested genotypes in observed environments; CV0, predicting tested genotypes in novel environments; and CV00, predicting untested genotypes in novel environments). To show how our implementation works, we considered two real data sets. These correspond to selected samples of the USDA soybean collection (D1: 324 genotypes observed in 6 environments scored for 9 traits) and of the Soybean Nested Association Mapping (SoyNAM) experiment (D2: 324 genotypes observed in 6 environments scored for 6 traits). In addition, three prediction models which consider the effect of environments and lines (M1: E + L), environments, lines and main effect of markers (M2: E + L + G), and also the inclusion of the interaction between makers and environments (M3: E + L + G + G×E) were considered. The results confirm that under CV2 and CV1 schemes, moderate improvements in predictive ability can be obtained with the inclusion of the interaction component, while for CV0 mixed results were observed, and for CV00 no improvements were shown. However, for this last scenario, the inclusion of weather and soil data potentially could enhance the results of the interaction model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3aagriculture 3acultivars 3afood chain 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3agenotype-environment interaction 3amarker-assisted selection 3amodels 3aprediction 3aquality control 3asoil 3asoybeans 3aweather1 aGrondona, Martin 1 aJarquin, Diego 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Sept. 27, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111009323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012000166520232900286592002802615650001602643650002202659650001702681650001902698650002602717650002502743650001002768650002402778650001102802650002102813650001902834650002302853651001002876700002102886700001602907700001602923700002102939773013502960856008403095852000903179655001203188IND60754093920221120175028.0211023e20210927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075409392DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111009332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaohe 10aSimulations and Experiments of the Soil Temperature Distribution after 2.45-GHz Short-Time Term Microwave Treatment  aMicrowave treatment is a green and pollution-free soil disinfection method. The application of microwaves to disinfect soil before cultivation is highly important to increase crop yields and protect the ecological environment. The electromagnetic field is an important parameter influencing the soil temperature field in the process of microwave soil treatment, and the change in soil temperature directly affects soil disinfection. Therefore, this article carried out research on the heating pattern in North China loess due to microwave treatment. First, COMSOL software was employed to simulate the microwave soil treatment process to analyze microwave penetration into soil. Second, with the application of microwaves at the designed frequency produced with a 2.45-GHz tunable microwave generating microdevice, soil with water contents of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% was treated for 10~60 s (at 10-s time intervals), and experiments on the influence of the microwave output power, treatment time, and soil moisture content on the soil temperature were performed via the controlled variable method. The simulation results indicate that with increasing soil moisture content, the microwave frequency inside the soil model increases, and the electric field intensity value decreases in the model at the same depth. After microwaves traverse through the 20-cm soil model, the incident field strength is three orders of magnitude lower than the outgoing field strength. The results of the microwave soil treatment experiment reveal that: (1) Compared to microwave output power levels of 1.8 and 1.6 kW, a level of 2 kW is more suitable for microwave soil disinfection. (2) After treatment, the highest temperature occurs on the soil surface, not within the soil. (3) The location of the highest soil internal temperature after microwave treatment increasingly approaches the soil surface with increasing soil moisture content, and the microwave output power does not affect the location of the highest soil internal temperature. Combining the electromagnetic field simulation and microwave soil treatment experiment results, it was found that the higher the field strength is, the higher the temperature value, and the highest soil internal temperature after microwave treatment often occurs at the first electromagnetic wave peak.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acomputer software 3adisinfection 3aelectric field 3aelectromagnetic field 3ainternal temperature 3aloess 3amicrowave treatment 3amodels 3asoil temperature 3asoil treatment 3asoil water content 3aChina1 aZhai, Changyuan 1 aYang, Shuo 1 aMa, Haolin 1 aZhao, Chunjiang 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Sept. 27, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111009333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011300174300001600287520120600303592002801509650001401537650001101551650002601562650001301588650002901601650000901630650001801639653003101657653002801688653002601716653002501742653001701767700002001784700001801804773009601822856008401918852000902002655001202011IND60603798520221122222737.0180716e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060379852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddiqui, M. Salman10aQuantification of the effects of geometric approximations on the performance of a vertical axis wind turbine  ap. 661-670.  aWith the soaring energy demands, an urge to explore the alternate and renewable energy resources has become the focal point of various active research fronts. The scientific community is revisiting the inkling to tap the wind resources in more rigorous and novel ways. Recent idea of net-zero buildings has prompted the realization of novel ideas such as employment of omni-directional vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) for roof-top application etc. Generally, owing to the high computational cost and time, different levels of geometric simplifications are considered in numerical studies. It becomes very important to quantify the effect of these approximations for realistic and logical conclusions. The detailed performance of a 2.5 m diameter VAWT is sequentially presented with various levels of approximations spanning from two-dimensional to complete three-dimensional geometry. The performance along with the flow physics with focus on tip effects, spanwise flow effects, effect of supporting arms and central hub is discussed. We conclude that two-dimensional approximation can over predict the performance by 32%. Similar trend is also observed for other geometric and flow approximations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aenergy 3aequipment performance 3ageometry 3arenewable energy sources 3awind 3awind turbines 0aVertical-axis wind turbine 0aGeometric approximation 0aPerformance parameter 0aNumerical simulation 0aSliding mesh1 aDurrani, Naveed1 aAkhtar, Imran0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Feb., v. 74 p.661-670dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01426naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245019500160300001800355520022000373592002800593650002700621650002300648650002300671650001400694653002300708653002900731653000700760700002000767700001900787700001500806700001600821773015300837856007700990852000901067655001201076IND60521573120221120100414.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157312DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-10212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDietrich, W.10a121Sb - Mößbauer- Spektren von mixed-valence-Verbindungen des Typs (RH+)8(Cl)4SbCl63-SbCl6- / 121Sb Mössbauer Spectra of Mixed Valence Compounds of the Structure (RH+)8(Cl-)4SbCl63-SbCl6-  ap. 1454-1455.  aThe ¹²¹Sb Mössbauer spectra of the mixed valence compounds (RH⁺)₈(Cl⁻)₄SbCl₆³⁻SbCl₆⁻with R equal CH₃CH(NH₂)CH₃ (1), CH₃CH(NH₂)CH₂CH₃ (2) are reported and the results are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMossbauer spectroscopy 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3achlorides 0aMössbauer Spectra 0aHexachloroantimonate(III 0aV)1 aEisinger, H.

Since human nutrition is closely dependent on cereal production, research was undertaken aimed at understanding the food losses in the baking and confectionery industry (BCI) in Poland, in particular at determining the volume, reasons and ways of reducing losses, identifying possibly all of the reasons for losses in BCI using the Ishikawa 5M + 1E diagram and determining the level of significance and probability of risk of food losses in the analysed sector. Two research methods were used. Quantitative data were collected using the mass balance method from five businesses that served as case studies. Qualitative data were collected through individual in-depth interviews with 17 industry experts. The companies’ average daily losses ranged from 0.8 to 6.4 tons, representing 9.7 to 14.4% of production volume, including 10.4–13.4% of bread losses and 6.8–24.4% of fresh pastry losses. The highest losses were generated by transport departments and these were exclusively retail returns. Following the Ishikawa concept, 31 primary and 94 secondary reasons for food losses were identified. Using the probability of loss risk, a toolkit for loss prevention and mitigation across all departments within businesses (raw materials magazine, production section, final product magazine and final product transport) and a set of horizontal tools were identified, including specialised training for employees and activities in several areas, e.g., technical status and production technology, organisation and planning, logistics and sales and cooperation with retail. This study, conducted in Poland, offers valuable results for developing programmes and strategies to prevent and manage food losses in BCI. Many of the solutions proposed in both toolkits can bring economic benefits without involving additional high costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3abreads 3aconfectionery industry 3afood security 3afood waste 3ahuman nutrition 3aloss prevention 3apastries 3aproduction technology 3arisk 3asweets 3aPoland1 aGazdecki, Michał 1 aRejman, Krystyna 1 aŁaba, Sylwia 1 aKobus-Cisowska, Joanna 1 aSzczepański, Krystian 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Sept. 28, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111009363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024003700128040001800165100001900183245025100202300001800453520082800471592002801299596006201327596007801389596008301467596006001550650002501610650001701635650001401652650002201666650001901688650001401707650001401721650002401735650001701759650001601776653001901792653002201811653002701833700002701860700001901887700002701906700002401933700002501957773014801982856008102130852000902211655001202220IND60549150220220906000000.0160907e20160629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054915022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b014682doi7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.6b014682chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, João10aInterfacial Concentrations of Hydroxytyrosol and Its Lipophilic Esters in Intact Olive Oil-in-Water Emulsions: Effects of Antioxidant Hydrophobicity, Surfactant Concentration, and the Oil-to-Water Ratio on the Oxidative Stability of the Emulsions  ap. 5274-5283.  aWe determined the interfacial molarities of the antioxidants, AOs, hydroxytyrosol (HT), and HT fatty acid esters with chain lengths of 1 to 16 carbons in intact olive oil/water/Tween 20 emulsions. The results were compared with chain length effects on the oxidative stability of the same emulsions, and a direct correlation was established. Both (AOI) molarities (varying 50–250 times greater than the stoichiometric 3.5 × 10–³ M AO concentration) and antioxidant efficiencies show similar parabola-like dependences on AO chain length with a maximum at C₈, consistent with the “cut-off” effect often observed at longer chain lengths.

We employed two years of survey data and alternative econometric models to better understand the use of individual and bundled packages of technologies and management practices in Ethiopian maize production, i.e., fertilizers, improved varieties, herbicides, pesticides, manure, intercropping, erosion control and crop rotation (the last three labeled integrated management). Although fertilizer and improved varieties were used on 85% of maize fields, with average yields of 3.4 ton/ha, large yield gaps remain. Complementary management practices improved these yields by as much as 22%, although in variable ways. Integrated management contributed to maize yield only when combined with crop protection (herbicides and/or pesticides). Combining manure with fertilizer and improved variety decreased maize yields, possibly due to manure quality and less inorganic fertilizer used on fields that received manure. Packages including crop protection increased labor productivity by 16–70%, while using integrated management decreased labor productivity by almost half. In summary, the combination of management practices did not automatically lead to increased yields, partly related to the conditions under which practices were applied, indicating the need for site-specific research and recommendations for sustainable intensification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3acultivars 3aerosion control 3alabor productivity 3amineral fertilizers 3aplant protection 3asurveys1 aChamberlin, Jordan 1 avan Ittersum, Martin K.1 aReidsma, Pytrik 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Sept. 28, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111009383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245010100179300001600280520148200296592002801778650001901806650001201825650002301837650002901860650001301889650001101902650001901913650002701932650001201959700003001971700002502001700002402026700001702050700001902067700003002086700002002116773008502136856004802221852000902269655001202278IND50060838620221119165914.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006083862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-012-0693-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbanjo, Edwige Gaby Nkouaya10aMolecular marker-based genetic linkage map of a diploid banana population (Musa acuminata Colla)  ap. 369-386.  aA well-saturated genetic linkage map is valuable for fundamental and applied genetic research. Genetic linkage maps of two half-sib diploid banana populations were constructed using allele-specific-polymerase chain reactions (AS-PCRs), diversity array technology (DArT), and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Molecular maps were produced for each parent using the pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. The first maternal map (6142-1, 81 individuals) consisted of 231 markers divided as followed: 121 DArT, 106 SSR and 4 AS-PCR markers in 15 linkage groups (LGs) covering 670 cM. The second maternal map (6142-1-S, 58 individuals) contained a total of 152 markers including 71 DArTs, 79 SSRs, and 2 AS-PCRs mapped to 16 LGs that spanned 698 cM. The combined paternal map (139 individuals) comprised 316 markers (196 DArTs, 117 SSRs and 3 AS-PCRs) distributed over 15 LGs with a total map length of 1,004 cM. While distorted segregation of some markers was observed in all maps, this was much more frequent for the male parent. Homology between maps was assessed using common markers. While there was generally good congruity with regard to marker order across maps, incongruity in other cases may reflect chromosomal rearrangement events such as inversions, translocations, or deletions. The new banana map can provide a better understanding of the Musa genome and could be used for the identification of economically important traits and improvement of breeding strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusa acuminata 3abananas 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome translocation 3adiploidy 3agenome 3alinkage groups 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents1 aTchoumbougnang, François1 aMouelle, Albert Sone1 aOben, Julius Enyong1 aNyine, Moses1 aDochez, Carine1 aFerguson, Morag Elizabeth1 aLorenzen, James0 tEuphytica.g2012 Dec., v. 188, no. 3 p.369-386dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-012-0693-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014800165300001600313520100000329592002801329650000801357650001601365650001601381650002801397650002101425650002801446650001101474650001701485650001301502650000701515650001501522650001301537650003401550650001401584650001301598653000801611653001601619653002901635653002401664653001301688700001601701700001701717700001601734773009201750856008501842852000901927655001201936IND60599443020221119184117.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059944302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Lina12aA new voltammetric sensor for sensitive and selective determination of xanthine based on DNA and polyaniline composite Langmuir–Blodgett film  ap. 346-351.  aDNA–polyaniline (PAn) complex Langmuir–Blodgett film modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was used as a new voltammetric sensor (DNA/PAn-LB/GCE) for xanthine (XA) detection. The characteristic of DNA/PAn-LB film was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope. Electrochemical behaviors of XA at the sensor were studied in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solutions by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse anodic voltammetry. The results showed that this new modified electrode exhibited an excellent immunity from uric acid and hypoxanthine interference and a new sensitive and selective electroanalytical method for XA was proposed with wider linear range. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curve for XA was obtained over the range of 7.0×10⁻⁸–1.0×10⁻⁵molL⁻¹, with the detection limit of 3.0×10⁻⁸molL⁻¹. The practicability of this method was demonstrated by determining the concentration of XA in human serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablood serum 3acalibration 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahumans 3ahypoxanthine 3aimmunity 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopes 3auric acid 3axanthine 0aDNA 0aPolyaniline 0aLangmuir–Blodgett film 0aVoltammetric sensor 0aXanthine1 aLi, Yinfeng1 aCao, Shaokui1 aYe, Baoxian0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.346-351dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245012600210300001600336520095700352592002801309650002601337650001301363650001501376650001101391650001501402650002501417650001401442650001201456650001201468651000901480651001001489651002101499653001601520653001401536653001401550653001701564653001401581653002101595700002201616700005901638700001901697700001901716700001901735700001901754700002101773700002201794773008901816856008301905990002301988852000902011655001202020IND60697477920221119195056.0200605e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhshima, Kazusato1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8592-604210aTemporal analysis of reassortment and molecular evolution of Cucumber mosaic virus: Extra clues from its segmented genome  ap. 188-197.  aCucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is a damaging pathogen of over 200 mono- and dicotyledonous crop species worldwide. It has the broadest known host range of any virus, but the timescale of its evolution is unknown. To investigate the evolutionary history of this virus, we obtained the genomic sequences of 40 CMV isolates from brassicas sampled in Iran, Turkey and Japan, and combined them with published sequences. Our synonymous ('silent') site analyses revealed that the present CMV population is the progeny of a single ancestor existing 1550–2600 years ago, but that the population mostly radiated 295–545 years ago. We found that the major CMV lineages are not phylogeographically confined, but that recombination and reassortment is restricted to local populations and that no reassortant lineage is more than 251 years old. Our results highlight the different evolutionary patterns seen among viral pathogens of brassica crops across the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aancestry 3acole crops 3agenome 3ahost range 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aprogeny 3aviruses 3aIran 3aJapan 3aTurkey (country) 0aCucumovirus 0aEvolution 0aTimescale 0aReassortment 0aSelection 0aSynonymous sites1 aMatsumoto, Kosuke1 aYasaka, Ryosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2240-17671 aNishiyama, Mai1 aSoejima, Kenta1 aKorkmaz, Savas1 aHo, Simon Y.W.1 aGibbs, Adrian J.1 aTakeshita, Minoru0 tVirology.g2016 Jan., v. 487 p.188-197dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015800170300001600328520119200344592002801536650002301564650001601587650002201603650002301625650002601648650001601674653001301690653001901703653003201722653002701754653001201781653001901793700002101812700002701833773009201860856008501952852000902037655001202046IND60599443220221119184037.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059944322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaher, Céline10aTowards a non-invasive quantitative analysis of the organic components in museum objects varnishes by vibrational spectroscopies: Methodological approach  ap. 336-345.  aThe compositions of ancient varnishes are mainly determined destructively by separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry. In this study, a methodology for non-invasive quantitative analyses of varnishes by vibrational spectroscopies is proposed. For that, experimental simplified varnishes of colophony and linseed oil were prepared according to 18th century traditional recipes with an increasing mass concentration ratio of colophony/linseed oil. FT-Raman and IR analyses using ATR and non-invasive reflectance modes were done on the “pure” materials and on the different mixtures. Then, a new approach involving spectral decomposition calculation was developed considering the mixture spectra as a linear combination of the pure materials ones, and giving a relative amount of each component. Specific spectral regions were treated and the obtained results show a good accuracy between the prepared and calculated amounts of the two compounds. We were thus able to detect and quantify from 10% to 50% of colophony in linseed oil using non-invasive techniques that can also be conducted in situ with portable instruments when it comes to museum varnished objects and artifacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3alinseed oil 3amass spectrometry 3aportable equipment 3aquantitative analysis 3areflectance 0aFT-Raman 0aIR-reflectance 0aNon-invasive quantification 0aSpectral decomposition 0aVarnish 0aMuseum objects1 aPimenta, Vanessa1 aBellot-Gurlet, Ludovic0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.336-345dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01846naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007700166300001600243520081000259592002801069650001501097650002001112650002201132650001701154650001101171650001501182650002101197650001901218650000901237650001901246650002101265650001201286773009601298856008101394852000901475655001201484IND60080288620221116173258.0140728e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028862DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293140700722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoptsik, G.

The prospects of gentle methods of stabilization oriented at the reduction of the mobility and biological availability of heavy metals due to the processes of adsorption, ionic exchange, and precipitation are emphasized. The use of sorbents and the traditional application of liming and phosphates to fix metal pollutants in soils is considered. The necessary conditions for successful soil remediation are the assessment of its economic efficiency, the analysis of the ecological risks, and confirming the achievement of the planned purposes related to the content of available metals in the soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abioavailability 3aeconomic analysis 3aheavy metals 3aliming 3aphosphates 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3asoil pollution 3asoil remediation 3awashing0 tEurasian soil science.g2014 July, v. 47, no. 7 p.707-722dSpringer-Verlagx1064-22937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10642293140700723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012800171300001800299500001900317520100300336592002801339650001201367650001501379651002101394651001001415653003701425653002101462653002001483653002101503700001901524700001301543700002201556700002201578700002101600700001601621700002001637700001901657700002301676700002001699773011901719856008501838852000901923655001201932IND60705332620221121131959.0200803e20200909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070533262DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2018.15598852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Binh Thai12aA novel hybrid approach of landslide susceptibility modelling using rotation forest ensemble and different base classifiers  ap. 1267-1292.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present study, Rotation Forest ensemble was integrated with different base classifiers to develop different hybrid models namely Rotation Forest based Support Vector Machines (RFSVM), Rotation Forest based Artificial Neural Networks (RFANN), Rotation Forest based Decision Trees (RFDT), and Rotation Forest based Naïve Bayes (RFNB) for landslide susceptibility modelling.

To better understand the sex determination/differentiation of bivalves, we analyzed the gonadal proteomics of Hyriopsis cumingii. We identified 673 peptides and 76 proteins. The 35 differentially expressed proteins identified included 19 upregulated and 16 downregulated proteins. FEM-1B protein associated with sex determination showed female-specific expression; the function of fem-1b gene was explored. The full-length cDNA of fem-1b cloned by RACE was 2105 bp. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on male and female tissues and early developmental stages; the results showed that fem-1b was expressed in both male and female tissues, and its expression level in gonads was significantly higher in females than in males (P < 0.01). In early embryonic development, the fem-1b mRNA expression increased significantly on the third day after fertilization (cleavage stage). Results of in situ hybridization showed a strong signal on oocyte membranes and no signal in male gonads. Our results indicate that fem-1b plays a certain role in sex determination and oocyte development of H. cumingii. This study provides valuable resources for understanding the mechanism and pathway of sex determination/differentiation of H. cumingii.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0901406cNational Key R&D Program of China  a31772835cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aHyriopsis cumingii 3aaquaculture 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agonads 3ahybridization 3amales 3aoocytes 3apeptides 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asex determination1 aDuan, Sheng-Hua1 aDong, Sai-Sai1 aCui, Xiao-Yu1 aWang, Gui-Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8233-42981 aLi, Jia-Le0 tAquaculture international.g2021 Feb., v. 29, no. 1 p.1-18dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-020-00605-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245012700177300001400304520105600318592002801374650001501402650002201417650001101439650001101450650001001461650001301471650001401484650001001498650001401508650002101522650001201543653003201555653004101587653002201628653002001650653002101670653002401691653002601715653001801741653002201759700002101781700002401802700001701826700002301843700006101866773008701927856008302014990002302097852000902120655001202129IND60697478220221119195608.0200605e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlatti-Cardinaux, Laure10aGeneration of a molecular clone of an attenuated lentivirus, a first step in understanding cytopathogenicity and virulence  ap. 50-58.  aSmall ruminant lentiviruses infect goats and sheep, inducing clinical disease in a minority of infected animals. Following an eradication campaign, clinical cases may disappear in a population. The complete elimination of these lentiviruses is however difficult to achieve and the spreading of less virulent strains often parallels the elimination of their virulent counterparts. Here, we characterized three such strains isolated from a flock in the post-eradication phase. We completely sequenced their genomes, showing that one of the isolates was most probably the product of a recombination event between the other two viruses. By comparing the sequences of these isolates with those of virulent strains, we found evidence that particular LTR mutations may explain their attenuated phenotype. Finally, we constructed an infectious molecular clone representative of these viruses, analyzing its replication characteristics in different target cells. This clone will permit us to explore the molecular correlates of cytopathogenicity and virulence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLentivirus 3acytopathogenicity 3aflocks 3agenome 3agoats 3amutation 3aphenotype 3asheep 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3aviruses 0aSmall ruminant lentiviruses 0aCaprine arthritis encephalitis virus 0aVisna/maedi virus 0aMolecular clone 0aInfectious clone 0aElectron microscopy 0aLong terminal repeats 0aTranscription 0aVirus replication1 aPisoni, Giuliano1 aStoffel, Michael H.1 aZanoni, Reto1 aZahno, Marie-Luise1 aBertoni, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1469-47230 tVirology.g2016 Jan., v. 487 p.50-58dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245008800181300001600269520100100285592002801286650001001314650001201324650001701336650001701353650001401370650001901384650001301403650002401416650001301440650001801453650004301471650001101514653002001525653001401545653001901559653002901578653002601607700002501633700002601658700002801684700002101712700005901733773017201792856008501964852000902049655001202058IND60557540020221120155200.0180904e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055754002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSivagurunathan, Periyasamy10aImprovement of hydrogen fermentation of galactose by combined inoculation strategy  ap. 353-357.  aThis study evaluated the feasibility of anaerobic hydrogen fermentation of galactose, a red algal biomass sugar, using individual and combined mixed culture inocula. Heat-treated (90°C, 30 min) samples of granular sludge (GS) and suspended digester sludge (SDS) were used as inoculum sources. The type of mixed culture inoculum played an important role in hydrogen production from galactose. Between two inocula, granular sludge showed higher hydrogen production rate (HPR) and hydrogen yield (HY) of 2.2 L H2/L-d and 1.09 mol H2/mol galactoseadded, respectively. Combined inoculation (GS + SDS) led to an elevated HPR and HY of 3.1 L H2/L-d and 1.28 mol H2/mol galactoseadded, respectively. Acetic and butyric acids are the major organic acids during fermentation. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that the mixed culture generated using the combined inoculation contained a higher cluster I Clostridium abundance than the culture produced using the single inoculum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3abiomass 3abutyric acid 3afermentation 3agalactose 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ainoculum 3amixed culture 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asludge 0aBioaugmentation 0aGalactose 0aHydrogen yield 0aHydrogen production rate 0aCluster I Clostridium1 aAnburajan, Parthiban1 aKumar, Gopalakrishnan1 aArivalagan, Pugazhendhi1 aBakonyi, Péter,1 aKim, Sang-Hyoun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3835-40770 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2017 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.353-357dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03827naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001700188245008500205300001000290506007600300520221300376592002802589596005902617596005902676506003702735650001702772650001702789650002002806650002202826650001302848650001602861650003102877650001102908650001402919650001902933650000902952650001402961650002502975650001203000700001503012700002103027700001903048700006003067773010303127856008203230852000903312655001203321IND60682131720221207051041.0210210e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068213172DNAL7 aPMC69793342pmcid7 a319984022pmid7 a10.1186/s13007-020-0553-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Tingting10aFast photosynthesis measurements for phenotyping photosynthetic capacity of rice  ap. 6.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Over the past decades, the structural and functional genomics of rice have been deeply studied, and high density of molecular genetic markers have been developed. However, the genetic variation in leaf photosynthesis, the most important trait for rice yield improvement, was rarely studied. The lack of photosynthesis phenotyping tools is one of the bottlenecks, as traditional direct photosynthesis measurements are very low-throughput, and recently developed high-throughput methods are indirect measurements. Hence, there is an urgent need for a fast, accurate and direct measurement approach. RESULT: We reported a fast photosynthesis measurement (FPM) method for phenotyping photosynthetic capacity of rice, which measures photosynthesis of excised tillers in environment-controlled lab conditions. The light response curves measured using FPM approach coped well with that the curves measured using traditional gas exchange approach. Importantly, the FPM technique achieved an average throughput of 5.4 light response curves per hour, which was 3 times faster than the 1.8 light response curves per hour using the traditional method. Tillers sampled at early morning had the highest photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and the lowest variability. In addition, even 12 h after sampling, there was no significant difference of photosynthesis rate between excised tillers and in situ. We finally investigated the genetic variations of photosynthetic traits across 568 F2 lines using the FPM technique and discussed the logistics of screening several hundred samples per day per instrumental unit using FPM to generate a wealth of photosynthetic phenotypic data, which might help to improve the selection power in large populations of rice with the ultimate aim of improving yield through improved photosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Here we developed a high-throughput method that can measure the rice leaf photosynthetic capacity approximately 10 times faster than traditional gas exchange approaches. Importantly, this method can overcome measurement errors caused by environmental heterogeneity under field conditions, and it is possible to measure 12 or more hours per day under lab conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801290cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31671620cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3agas exchange 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agrain yield 3alaboratory experimentation 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3arice 3ascreening 3astomatal conductance 3atillers1 aMeng, Ping1 aHuang, Jianliang1 aPeng, Shaobing1 aXiong, Dongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6332-26270 tPlant methods.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.6-6dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-020-0553-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245012300202300001000325506007600335520151800411592002801929596006301957596006202020506003702082650002302119650001502142650001502157650002402172650001802196650001002214650002402224650001702248650003302265650001302298650002402311650002202335650001702357700005402374700001602428700001502444700001602459700001502475700001602490700001802506700002002524700001402544773012502558856008202683852000902765655001202774IND60681787920221207091903.0220709e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068178792DNAL7 a320208712pmid7 aPMC70768652pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2787-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wei10aStudy on the mechanisms of compound Kushen injection for the treatment of gastric cancer based on network pharmacology  ap. 6.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: As an effective prescription for gastric cancer (GC), Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) has been widely used even though few molecular mechanism analyses have been carried out. METHODS: In this study, we identified 16 active ingredients and 60 GC target proteins. Then, we established a compound-predicted target network and a GC target protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by Cytoscape 3.5.1 and systematically analyzed the potential targets of CKI for the treatment of GC. Finally, molecular docking was applied to verify the key targets. In addition, we analyzed the mechanism of action of the predicted targets by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. RESULTS: The results showed that the potential targets, including CCND1, PIK3CA, AKT1, MAPK1, ERBB2, and MMP2, are the therapeutic targets of CKI for the treatment of GC. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that CKI has a therapeutic effect on GC by synergistically regulating some biological pathways, such as the cell cycle, pathways in cancer, the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, the mTOR signaling pathway, and the FoxO signaling pathway. Moreover, molecular docking simulation indicated that the compounds had good binding activity to PIK3CA, AKT1, MAPK1, ERBB2, and MMP2 in vivo. CONCLUSION: This research partially highlighted the molecular mechanism of CKI for the treatment of GC, which has great potential in the identification of the effective compounds in CKI and biomarkers to treat GC.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 81473547cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo.81673829cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive ingredients 3abiomarkers 3acell cycle 3acomputer simulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3amechanism of action 3apharmacology 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3astomach neoplasms 3atherapeutics1 aWu, Jiarui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1617-61101 aZhu, Yingli1 aMeng, Ziqi1 aLiu, Xinkui1 aLiu, Shuyu1 aNi, Mengwei1 aJia, Shanshan1 aZhang, Jingyuan1 aGuo, Siyu0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.6-6dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2787-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010500170300001300275520096400288592002801252650001101280650001301291650001701304650001501321650001901336650001701355650001701372650001501389650001701404650002101421650001801442650001601460653002001476653002401496653001801520653001901538653002601557653002201583700002101605700002101626700001501647700002201662700001901684773010501703856008601808852000901894655001201903IND60540786420221117180400.0190318e20140830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054078642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaseri, Narges10aElectrospun chitosan-based nanocomposite mats reinforced with chitin nanocrystals for wound dressing  ap. 7-15.  aThe aim of this study was to develop electrospun chitosan/polyethylene oxide-based randomly oriented fiber mats reinforced with chitin nanocrystals (ChNC) for wound dressing. Microscopy studies showed porous mats of smooth and beadless fibers with diameters between 223 and 966nm. The addition of chitin nanocrystals as well as crosslinking had a positive impact on the mechanical properties of the mats, and the crosslinked nanocomposite mats with a tensile strength of 64.9MPa and modulus of 10.2GPa were considered the best candidate for wound dressing application. The high surface area of the mats (35m2g−1) was also considered beneficial for wound healing. The water vapor transmission rate of the prepared mats was between 1290 and 1548gm−2day−1, and was in the range for injured skin or wounds. The electrospun fiber mats showed compatibility toward adipose derived stem cells, further confirming their potential use as wound dressing materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitin 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3amicroscopy 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3apolyethylene 3astem cells 3asurface area 3atensile strength 3atissue repair 3awater vapor 0aElectrospinning 0aChitin nanocrystals 0aNanocomposite 0aWound dressing 0aMechanical properties 0aCytocompatibility1 aAlgan, Constance1 aJacobs, Valencia1 aJohn, Maya1 aOksman, Kristiina1 aMathew, Aji P.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Aug. 30, v. 109 p.7-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012300172300001600295520155900311592002801870650001901898650001401917650004101931650004301972650002002015650004202035650000702077650002702084650001302111650001302124650002502137650001502162650002502177651001002202653003802212653001802250653001702268653001102285653001302296700001602309700002102325700001802346700005802364773009202422856008502514852000902599655001202608IND60599443520221119184238.0180702e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059944352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzo, Valentina10aMicroextraction of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs from waste water samples by rotating-disk sorptive extraction  ap. 486-492.  aIn this study, six non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were extracted from water samples using the rotating-disk sorptive extraction (RDSE) technique. The extraction disk device contains a central cavity that allows for the incorporation of a powdered sorbent phase (Oasis™ HLB). The analytes were extracted from water and pre-concentrated on the sorbent to reach the extraction equilibrium, and then they were desorbed with solvent, derivatized and determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The variables for the extraction were studied using high performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) to avoid the derivatization step, and the optimum values were as follows: 60mg of Oasis™ HLB, a rotation velocity of 3000rpm, a pH of 2, a sample volume of 50mL, and an extraction time of approximately 90–100min. The recoveries ranged from 71 to 104%, with relative standard deviations (RSD) between 2 and 8%. The detection limits ranged from 0.001 to 0.033µgL⁻¹.The described method was applied to the analysis of influents and effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Santiago, Chile. The concentrations of the detected drugs ranged from 1.5 to 13.4µgL⁻¹ and from 1.0 to 3.2µgL⁻¹ in the influents and effluents, respectively. The samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE). No significant differences were observed in the determined concentrations for most of the NSAIDs, indicating that RDSE is an alternative method for the preparation of water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3aeffluents 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amicroextraction 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3apH 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorbents 3astatistical analysis 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aChile 0aRotating-disk sorptive extraction 0aWater samples 0aOasis™ HLB 0aNSAIDs 0aGC–MS.1 aHonda, Luis1 aNavarro, Orielle1 aAscar, Loreto1 aRichter, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7978-06570 tTalanta.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 128 p.486-492dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010900170300001600279520114000295592002801435650000901463650001701472650001601489650002701505650002501532650001801557650001201575650003201587650002001619650002501639650001201664700005501676773013601731856008301867852000901950655001201959IND60725505820221119181205.0210903e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072550582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-020-00619-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖztaşkent, Cenk10aEffect of LED light sources on the growth and chemical composition of brown seaweed Treptacantha barbata  ap. 193-205.  aIn this study, thalli of brown seaweed Treptacantha barbata (Stackhouse) Orellana & Sansón were cultured under four colors of LED light (yellow, blue, green, and red) with cool white fluorescent light as a control, to test how the spectral composition of light affected their growth and biochemical composition under laboratory cultivation. The intensity was 100 μmol photon m² s⁻¹ of light. The specific growth rates, pigment and proximate compositions, sodium alginate, and fatty acid composition of the thalli were studied. The red LEDs provided the highest specific growth rate. The highest lipid content of the thalli of T. barbata occurred under both fluorescent light and green LED lights. Blue LED light produced the highest sodium alginate content (p ≤ .05). The results for fatty acid methyl esters showed that all four LED light sources influenced the fatty acid contents of T. barbata. The polyunsaturated fatty acid levels of T. barbata cultured in LED light sources were extremely high. We suggest that LED lights could be used to grow T. barbata in replacement of the fluorescent lighting currently used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBixa 3aPhaeophyceae 3aaquaculture 3afatty acid composition 3afluorescent lighting 3alipid content 3aphotons 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asodium alginate 3aspecific growth rate 3athallus1 aAk, İlknur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0233-00250 tAquaculture international.g2021 Feb., v. 29, no. 1 p.193-205dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-020-00619-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245008700174300001400261500001900275520107700294592002801371650002701399650002301426650000801449650003201457650001701489650002501506650002001531650003301551650001301584653002701597653001401624653002701638653002101665653003401686653002101720700002901741700002101770700002301791773008701814856008301901990002301984852000902007655001202016IND60697478420221119195214.0200605e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehmann, Kathleen C.10aArterivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: Vital enzymatic activity remains elusive  ap. 68-74.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAll RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which in arteriviruses is expressed as the C-terminal domain of nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9). Previously, potent primer-dependent RdRp activity has been demonstrated for the homologous polymerase subunit (nsp12) of the distantly related coronaviruses. The only previous study focusing on the in vitro activity of nsp9 of an arterivirus (equine arteritis virus; EAV) reported weak de novo polymerase activity on homopolymeric RNA templates. However, this activity was not retained when Mn²⁺ ions were omitted from the assay or when biologically relevant templates were supplied, which prompted us to revisit the biochemical properties of this polymerase. Based on the properties of active-site mutants, we conclude that the RNA-synthesizing activities observed in de novo and primer-dependent polymerase and terminal transferase assays cannot be attributed to recombinant EAV nsp9-RdRp. Our results illustrate the potential pitfalls of characterizing polymerases using highly sensitive biochemical assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlphaarterivirus equid 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aactive sites 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme activity 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3avirology 0aEquine arteritis virus 0aNidovirus 0aIn vitro RdRp activity 0aRecombinant nsp9 0aPolymerase active site mutant 0aReverse genetics1 aGorbalenya, Alexander E.1 aSnijder, Eric J.1 aPosthuma, Clara C.0 tVirology.g2016 Jan., v. 487 p.68-74dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.10.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001500176245010700191300001500298520156600313592002801879650001601907650003001923650001501953650002401968650002001992650003402012650001702046650001502063650002202078650001602100650001702116650001602133650001602149650002802165650001302193650002102206650001002227700002402237700002302261700001902284773015202303856007002455856010402525990002302629852000902652655001202661IND60608463520221119031438.0190510e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060846352DNAL7 a10.3791/545352doi7 aPMC50920982pmcid7 a277680732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aSheathless capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry for metabolic profiling of biological samples  ap. e54535.  aIn metabolomics, a wide range of analytical techniques is used for the global profiling of (endogenous) metabolites in complex samples. In this paper, a protocol is presented for the analysis of anionic and cationic metabolites in biological samples by capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry (CE-MS). CE is well-suited for the analysis of highly polar and charged metabolites as compounds are separated on the basis of their charge-to-size ratio. A recently developed sheathless interfacing design, i.e., a porous tip interface, is used for coupling CE to electrospray ionization (ESI) MS. This interfacing approach allows the effective use of the intrinsically low-flow property of CE in combination with MS, resulting in nanomolar detection limits for a broad range of polar metabolite classes. The protocol presented here is based on employing a bare fused-silica capillary with a porous tip emitter at low-pH separation conditions for the analysis of a broad array of metabolite classes in biological samples. It is demonstrated that the same sheathless CE-MS method can be used for the profiling of cationic metabolites, including amino acids, nucleosides and small peptides, or anionic metabolites, including sugar phosphates, nucleotides and organic acids, by only switching the MS detection and separation voltage polarity. Highly information-rich metabolic profiles in various biological samples, such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid and extracts of the glioblastoma cell line, can be obtained by this protocol in less than 1 hr of CE-MS analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acell lines 3acerebrospinal fluid 3adetection limit 3aelectric potential difference 3aglioblastoma 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anucleosides 3anucleotides 3aorganic acids and salts 3apeptides 3asugar phosphates 3aurine1 aGulersonmez, M.

The all-solid-state TQDs-bridge WO₃/TQDs/In₂S₃ Z-scheme photocatalysts exhibited extremely promoted photocatalytic reduction of Cr (VI) and photocatalytic oxidation of Bisphenol A (BPA) under visible light irradiation, which are 4 and 3 times higher than that of WO₃/In₂S₃ heterojunctions, respectively. The favorable photocatalytic activities of WO₃/TQDs/In₂S₃ should attribute to the effective electron transfer and charges separation with introduction of TQDs as the electron mediators in the Z-scheme system. In addition, the stability of WO₃/TQDs/In₂S₃ was investigated and the possible mechanisms during photo-reduction of Cr (VI) and photo-oxidation of BPA were proposed. This work provides a new strategy for fabrication of all-solid-state Z-scheme heterojunctions using Ti₃C₂ quantum dots as the low-cost solid electron mediator for efficient environmental remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3achromium 3aelectron transfer 3airradiation 3alight 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotooxidation 3aphotoreduction 3aremediation 3asemiconductors 0aTi3C2 QDs 0aAll-solid-state 0aZ-scheme 0aPhoto-oxidation 0aPhoto-reduction1 aHuang, Huoshuai1 aLi, Najun1 aChen, Dongyun1 aXu, Qingfeng1 aLi, Hua1 aHe, Jinghui1 aLu, Jianmei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 May 05, v. 409 p.125027-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1250273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006600169300001400235500001900249520119900268592002801467650001901495650001701514650001901531650003701550650001201587650001401599650001501613650000901628650002001637650001201657650001001669651001001679700002901689773013901718856008101857852000901938655001201947IND60680505220221123032740.0200107e20190502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068050522DNAL7 a10.1894/0038-4909-63-2-912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkinner, Kalin M.10aSurvey of gastrointestinal helminths of feral hogs from texas  ap. 91-95.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aApproximately half the nation's feral hog population resides in Texas, creating a health risk for domesticated livestock and damaging ecosystems. However, biologists know little about the distribution of their intestinal helminths. We collected intestines from wild hogs slaughtered at a private livestock processing facility in South Texas that accepts hogs from over 20 holding facilities across the state. We found a 26% infection prevalence that was not related to host gender or weight. However, female hogs tended to harbor a greater parasite prevalence and diversity than males. We collected five species of nematodes: 153 Oesophagostomum dendatum, 150 Oesophagostomum quadrispinulatum, 64 Globocephalus urosubulatus, 6 Ascaris suum, and 1 Metastrongylus. We collected one species of acanthocephalan: 64 Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus. This is the first wide-scale geographic survey of intestinal parasites of feral hogs in Texas and the first published record of O. quadrispinulatum and M. hirudenaceus from feral hogs in Texas. Thus, our findings set the stage for further collaborative studies on infection patterns as they relate to feral hog control and livestock risk management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aAscaris suum 3aMetastrongylus 3aOesophagostomum quadrispinulatum 3afemales 3ahelminths 3aintestines 3arisk 3arisk management 3asurveys 3aswine 3aTexas1 aValdez, Megan R.

Data consisted of 635,289 test-day records of MY, FY, PY, and MUN on 76,959 first-lactation Swedish Holstein cows calving from 2001 to 2003, and corresponding lactation records for the fertility traits. Yields and MUN were analyzed with a random regression model followed by a multi-trait model in which the lactation was broken into 10 monthly periods. Heritability for MUN was stable across lactation (between 0.16 and 0.18), whereas MY, FY, and PY had low heritability at the beginning of lactation, which increased with time and stabilized after 100 d in milk, at 0.47, 0.36, and 0.44, respectively. Fertility traits had low heritabilities (0.02 to 0.05). Phenotypic correlations of MUN and milk production traits were between 0.13 (beginning of lactation) and 0.00 (end of lactation). Genetic correlations of MUN and MY, FY, and PY followed similar trends and were positive (0.22) at the beginning and negative (−0.15) at the end of lactation. Phenotypic correlations of MUN and fertility were close to zero. A surprising result was that genetic correlations of MUN and fertility traits suggest a positive relationship between the 2 traits for most of the lactation, indicating that animals with breeding values for increased MUN also had breeding values for improved fertility. This result was obtained with a random regression model as well as with a multi-trait model. The analyzed group of cows had a moderate level of MUN concentration. In such a population MUN concentration may increase slightly due to selection for improved fertility. Conversely, selection for increased MUN concentration may improve fertility slightly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aanimal breeding 3abreeding value 3acalving 3acalving interval 3acows 3agenetic correlation 3aheritability 3ainsemination 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk analysis 3amilk yield 3amodels 3aphenotypic correlation 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3aurea nitrogen 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMilkxchemistry 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhenotype 2aPregnancy 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable1 aStrandberg, E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Nov., v. 94, no. 11 p.5665-5672dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-39163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007200169300001600241520093900257592002801196650002601224650002201250650002701272650002601299650001401325650002101339650001901360650001001379650002501389650001901414653001601433653001601449653001401465653001701479653002401496700002101520700001401541700001801555773017201573856008501745852000901830655001201839IND60557540320221120191507.0180904e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055754032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeuchi, Yuya10aMicrobial fuel cells using Cellulomonas spp. with cellulose as fuel  ap. 358-363.  aCellulomonas fimi, Cellulomonas biazotea, and Cellulomonas flavigena are cellulose-degrading microorganisms chosen to compare the degradation of cellulose.

Our results showed that C. fimi was an excellent candidate to produce the electric current from cellulose via MFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCellulomonas biazotea 3aCellulomonas fimi 3aCellulomonas flavigena 3aShewanella oneidensis 3acellulose 3aelectric current 3aelectric power 3afuels 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amicroorganisms 0aAir-cathode 0aCarbon felt 0aCellulose 0aCellulomonas 0aMicrobial fuel cell1 aKhawdas, Wichean1 aAso, Yuji1 aOhara, Hitomi0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2017 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.358-363dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009800166300001600264520094800280592002801228650001601256650002201272650003001294650001401324650002301338650001101361650000701372653002601379653003101405653002201436653002101458700001801479700001701497700001401514700001701528773009201545856008501637852000901722655001201731IND60599443820221119184240.0180702e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059944382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Jian10aNovel methoxypropylimmidazolium β-cyclodextrin for improved enantioseparation of amino acids  ap. 460-465.  aA new single-isomer cationic cyclodextrin, mono-6ᴬ-[3-(3-methoxypropyl)imidazol-1-ium]-6ᴬ-β-cyclodextrin chloride, has been synthesized and successfully used for the chiral separation of dansyl amino acids in capillary electrophoresis. With methoxy functionality, the new cationic cyclodextrin exhibits significantly improved enantioselectivities. Excellent enantioseparations for amino acids are obtained in chiral selector concentration range between 2.5mM to 15mM at pH 6.0. Chiral resolution as high as 7.3 was achieved for Dns-Aca with 5mM chiral selector. Comparison study and theoretical calculation with Wren’s model attribute the enhanced enantioseparation to the stronger inclusion complexation between amino acids and cyclodextrin.

It is one of the most important cash crop in the rain fed areas of Pakistan and its production, under changing climatic conditions, that can be improved by developing short duration varieties. The present study was based on the molecular characterization of the maturity associated gene families in the peanut under two light conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genomic analysis based on the in silico study of important gene families for early maturity associated attributes like flowering time, their pattern, duration and photoperiodism was done for a comprehensive mapping of maturity related genes. Phytochromes genes Phy A, Phy B and Phy E and flowering genes FT2a, Ft5a and COL2 were selected for in silico characterization for protein based analysis including Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), and Neighbor Joining (NJ) tree. MSA and NJ trees of the peanut with Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max showed a clear picture of the phylogenetic relationship on the basis of selected gene proteins. Expression profile of phytochrome and flowering genes revealed that photoperiod conditions i.e. short and long days, have great influence on the Phy A, Phy B and Phy E, Ft2a, FT5a and COL2 gene expression pattern. In current study, the relative expression of all studied genes was found higher in short day light condition at flower initiation stage of the plants than in the long light day condition with exception of COL2 gene protein. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular characterization based on the in silico study of the particular genes and qPCR based gene expression profiling of the selected genes provided an evidence of the role of these genes and their comparative analysis under two photoperiodic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aArachis hypogaea 3aGlycine max 3acash crops 3acomputer simulation 3aearly development 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomics 3amolecular biology 3apeanuts 3aphotoperiodism 3aphylogeny 3aphytochrome 3arain 3asequence alignment 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3aPakistan1 aHassan, Mahmood ul1 aOrtiz, Gabriela Toledo1 aShah, Muhammad Kausar Nawaz1 aAhmed, Mukhtar1 aShah, Asad Hussain1 aQayyum, Abdul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5322-79360 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.5495-5504dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07362-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245022400171500001900395520202900414592002802443650002302471650002602494650002402520650002502544650002102569650002002590650002202610650002502632650001402657650001802671650002702689650001402716650001302730650001002743650001402753650001202767650001402779650001502793650001302808650002802821653002002849653001602869653002402885653003102909653002802940700002502968700003302993700003003026700002003056700002603076773010803102856008503210852000903295655001203304IND60722794220221119083232.0210519e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072279422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2021.1093412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordin, Cristina10aFumigant activity of essential oils from Cinnamomum and Citrus spp. and pure compounds against Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) (Acari: Dermanyssidae) and toxicity toward the nontarget organism Beauveria bassiana (Vuill.)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDermanyssus gallinae(De Geer) (Acari: Dermanyssidae) is the main ectoparasite associated with laying poultry. This mite is commonly controlled by the application of synthetic chemical insecticides, wich lead to the selection of resistant populations and formation of residues in eggs. Thus, new molecules must be developed to control D. gallinae. This work evaluated the toxicity of essential oils (EOs) from Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum camphora, Cinnamomum camphora var. linalooliferum, Citrus aurantium, Citrus aurantium var. bergamia, Citrus aurantifolia and Citrus reticulata var. tangerine against D. gallinae. Additionally, the chemical profiles of the most bioactive EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and the major compounds were subjected to new tests using D. gallinae. The most toxic EOs against D. gallinae were evaluated for the nontarget entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Unioeste 88). The EOs from C. cassia (LC₅₀ = 25.43 ± 1.0423 μg/cm³) and C. camphora var. linalooliferum (LC₅₀ = 39.84 ± 1.9635 μg/cm³) were the most active in the fumigant bioassay and caused mortality rates of 96 and 61%, respectively. The GC–MS analysis revealed that the major constituents of EOs from C. cassia and C. camphora var. linalooliferum were trans-cinnamaldehyde and linalool, respectively. The pure compounds, trans-cinnamaldehyde (LC₅₀ = 68.89 ± 3.1391 μg/cm³) and linalool (LC₅₀ = 51.45 ± 1.1967 μg/cm³), were tested on D. gallinae and showed lower toxicity than the EOs. Thus, the compounds were not the only active substances produced by C. cassia and C. camphora var. linalooliferum; moreover synergism may have occurred between the substances. The EOs from C. cassia and C. camphora var. linalooliferum were also toxic to B. bassiana (Unioeste 88). Thus, EOs from C. cassia and C. camphora var. linalooliferum are promising candidates for use in D. gallinae control, but cannot be used in conjunction with the fungus B. bassiana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aCinnamomum aromaticum 3aCinnamomum camphora 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3aCitrus aurantium 3aCitrus bergamia 3aCitrus reticulata 3aDermanyssus gallinae 3abioassays 3aectoparasites 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afumigants 3alinalool 3amites 3amortality 3apoultry 3asynergism 3atangerines 3atoxicity 3aveterinary parasitology 0aCinnamomum spp. 0aCitrus spp. 0aBotanical acaricide 0aIntegrated pest management 0aEntomopathogenic fungus1 aAlves, Dejane Santos1 aAlves, Luis Francisco Angeli1 aOliveira, Murilo Silva de1 aAscari, Jociani1 aScharf, Dilamara Riva0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2021 Feb., v. 290 p.109341-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2021.1093413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245010500208300001600313520162700329592002801956653002401984653003002008653001102038653000802049653002002057653001302077700001602090700001502106700001402121700001702135700002302152773016702175856008202342852000902424655001202433IND60517080120221121124907.0190728e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051708012DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140017142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, J.F.M.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0146-212214aThe European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax in the Dutch Wadden Sea: from visitor to resident species  ap. 839-850.  aThis paper analyses the population dynamics, growth and feeding ecology of Dicentrarchus labrax in order to gain a better understanding of its present role in the western Dutch Wadden Sea ecosystem. Otolith analysis showed that the population is mostly comprised of individuals aged 3–5 years old and between 20 and 45 cm in length. In autumn, 0-group juveniles are also an important part of the population. Both juveniles and adults use the area as a feeding ground exhibiting an opportunistic feeding strategy that relies on available prey, especially the brown shrimp Crangon crangon. Stomach content analysis and nitrogen stable isotope analysis showed an ontogenetic shift towards piscivory and a general decrease in the dominance of invertebrates with increasing size. Over the last 50 years, large between-year fluctuations in D. labrax abundance have been observed with an underlying increasing trend from about 1990 until 2007 followed by a subsequent decline. Spring abundance showed significant relationships with temperature and salinity while autumn abundance was only related to temperature. Spring and autumn D. labrax abundance were also strongly related to abundance of brown shrimp C. crangon prey. Long-term trends in temperature and salinity in the area suggest that environmental conditions for juvenile growth have become optimal, resulting in increased abundance since the mid-1980s. Continued monitoring of the dynamics of this species in the Dutch Wadden Sea is important to understand and anticipate the effects of climate change on the D. labrax population and its role in the local food web.  aPublisher supplied data 0apopulation dynamics 0along-term abundance trend 0agrowth 0aage 0afeeding ecology 0asea bass1 aFreitas, V.1 aQuilez, I.1 aJouta, J.1 aWitte, J.IJ.1 aVan Der Veer, H.W.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2015 June, v. 95, no. 4 p.839-850dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140017143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245012400176300001400300520105500314592002801369650003101397650001701428650001401445650002701459650001101486650001701497650002001514650000901534650001101543650002801554650002401582650003301606653002701639653001801666653001501684700003701699700002001736700002601756700002601782700003601808700002801844700002501872700003701897773008701934856008302021990002302104852000902127655001202136IND60697478820221119195115.0200605e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmorim, Jaime Henrique10aAntibodies are not required to a protective immune response against dengue virus elicited in a mouse encephalitis model  ap. 41-49.  aGenerating neutralizing antibodies have been considered a prerequisite to control dengue virus (DENV) infection. However, T lymphocytes have also been shown to be important in a protective immune state. In order to investigate the contribution of both humoral and cellular immune responses in DENV immunity, we used an experimental model in which a non-lethal DENV2 strain (ACS46) is used to intracranially prime Balb/C mice which develop protective immunity against a lethal DENV2 strain (JHA1). Primed mice generated envelope-specific antibodies and CD8⁺ T cell responses targeting mainly non-structural proteins. Immune sera from protected mice did not confer passive protection to naïve mice challenged with the JHA1 strain. In contrast, depletion of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T lymphocytes significantly reduced survival of ACS46-primed mice challenged with the JHA1 strain. Collectively, results presented in this study show that a cellular immune response targeting non-structural proteins are a promising way in vaccine development against dengue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aDengue virus 3aantiserum 3acell-mediated immunity 3adengue 3aencephalitis 3aimmune response 3amice 3amodels 3aneutralizing antibodies 3avaccine development 3aviral nonstructural proteins 0aNonstructural proteins 0aT lymphocytes 0aAntibodies1 ados Santos Alves, Rúbens Prince1 aBizerra, Raíza1 aAraújo Pereira, Sara1 aRamos Pereira, Lennon1 aNascimento Fabris, Denicar Lina1 aSantos, Robert Andreata1 aRomano, Camila Malta1 aFerreira, Luís Carlos de Souza,0 tVirology.g2016 Jan., v. 487 p.41-49dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.10.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008800170300001600258500001500274520182600289592002802115650001602143650001302159650002002172650001702192650002002209650001902229650003002248650003302278650001602311650001502327650001002342650002202352650003602374650003102410653002502441700001702466700001802483700002502501700001602526773010702542856004802649852000902697655001202706IND50067755120221116142142.0130712e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006775512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-013-0555-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakeel, Samina N.10aProteomic and Transcriptomic Analyses of Agave americana in Response to Heat Stress  ap. 840-851.  a2019-12-06  aPlants with Crassulacean acid metabolism must cope with severe environmental stresses including heat-limited, water-limited, and CO₂-limited environments throughout their life cycles in arid or semiarid habitats. Heat stress affects the rate of photosynthesis and related thermotolerance in many plants. To elucidate the mechanism(s) of heat tolerance and the role(s) of stromal proteomes in the heat-tolerant plant Agave americana, stromal proteins were extracted from heat-stressed and control plants and subjected to a novel proteomics approach using a Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) and followed by mass spectrometry. Several differentially expressed stromal proteins were identified under heat stress, and their subcellular localization, as well as their biological and molecular functions, was determined in silico. A total of 58 stromal proteins that play important roles in photosynthesis, defense, plastid metabolic functions, hormonal biosynthesis, stress signal perception, and transduction were identified. Expression of both nuclear-encoded and chloroplast-encoded proteins was reduced under heat stress, suggesting that plants must have undergone disruption of major physiological and metabolic pathways at high temperature stress. Similarly, relative transcript levels of 16 selected stromal genes were analyzed in heat-stressed plants at 3 different temperatures and compared to those of control plants. Both MudPIT and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that several proteins/genes were either upregulated or downregulated under heat stress. As there was no correlation between some transcriptomic and proteomics data, this suggested that posttranslational modifications must play some roles in plant thermotolerance and adaptation to high temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3aproteins 3atranscriptomics 3abiosynthesis 3aAgave americana 3aheat tolerance 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3aheat stress 3aproteomics 3agenes 3amass spectrometry 3apost-translational modification 3agene expression regulation 0abiochemical pathways1 aAman, Sitwat1 aHaq, Noor ul,1 aHeckathorn, Scott A.1 aLuthe, Dawn0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2013 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.840-851dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-013-0555-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245010300178300001800281520113500299592002801434650001701462650001401479650001101493650002301504650001001527650001801537650000901555650002501564650002701589650001201616650003701628650005601665650001101721650002001732650002801752650002501780650002301805700001801828700001601846700001901862700001701881700001401898700002101912700001601933773010001949856007702049852000902126655001202135IND60083365320221120043741.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008336532DNAL7 a220323932pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2010-40862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosenza, G.10aShort communication: Translational efficiency of casein transcripts in Mediterranean river buffalo  ap. 5691-5694.  aBuffalo milk is characterized by the presence of all 4 casein fractions (αS₁, β, αS₂, and κ) encoded by the 4 tightly linked autosomal genes (CSN1S1, CSN2, CSN1S2, and CSN3, respectively). In the present paper, we report for the first time a quantitative characterization of buffalo casein transcripts and show that the 4 genes are not transcribed and translated with the same efficiency. In particular, the analysis of individual milk samples obtained from 9 Mediterranean river buffaloes showed that the most abundant casein fractions were β (53.45%) and αS₁ (20.61%), followed by αS₂ and κ, at 14.28 and 11.66%, respectively. Quantification of the corresponding mRNA showed that the percentage of transcripts of the 4 caseins was 16.48, 23.18, 55.87, and 4.47% for αS₁, β, αS₂, and κ, respectively. Translation efficiency was 0.25 for CSN1S2, 1.31 for CSN1S1, 2.39 for CSN2, and 2.69 for the CSN3 transcripts, respectively. A comparison of nucleotide sequences with the Kozak consensus sequence was also carried out to investigate if the mRNA sequences might be responsible for the observed differences.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffalo milk 3abuffaloes 3acasein 3aconsensus sequence 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amilk 3anucleotide sequences 3atranslation (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aBuffaloesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCaseinsxanalysisxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aSequence Alignment1 aPauciullo, A.1 aColetta, A.1 aDi Francia, A.1 aFeligini, M.1 aGallo, D.1 aDi Berardino, D.1 aRamunno, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Nov., v. 94, no. 11 p.5691-5694dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-40863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245009100198300001500289520148500304592002801789650001401817650001501831650001301846650001501859650002201874650001201896650001201908650002201920650002101942650001201963650001301975650001501988700001802003700002002021700001802041700002102059700001702080773015202097856007002249856010202319990002302421852000902444655001202453IND60608463820221119031159.0190510e20161019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060846382DNAL7 a10.3791/545382doi7 aPMC50922142pmcid7 a278056132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahnewald, Stefan10aSpiral ganglion neuron explant culture and electrophysiology on multi electrode arrays  ap. e54538.  aSpiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) participate in the physiological process of hearing by relaying signals from sensory hair cells to the cochlear nucleus in the brain stem. Loss of hair cells is a major cause of sensory hearing loss. Prosthetic devices such as cochlear implants function by bypassing lost hair cells and directly stimulating SGNs electrically, allowing for restoration of hearing in deaf patients. The performance of these devices depends on the functionality of SGNs, the implantation procedure and on the distance between the electrodes and the auditory neurons. We hypothesized, that reducing the distance between the SGNs and the electrode array of the implant would allow for improved stimulation and frequency resolution, with the best results in a gapless position. Currently we lack in vitro culture systems to study, modify and optimize the interaction between auditory neurons and electrode arrays and characterize their electrophysiological response. To address these issues, we developed an in vitro bioassay using SGN cultures on a planar multi electrode array (MEA). With this method we were able to perform extracellular recording of the basal and electrically induced activity of a population of spiral ganglion neurons. We were also able to optimize stimulation protocols and analyze the response to electrical stimuli as a function of the electrode distance. This platform could also be used to optimize electrode features such as surface coatings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3abrain stem 3acoatings 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophysiology 3aganglia 3ahearing 3ahearing disorders 3ain vitro culture 3aneurons 3apatients 3aprostheses1 aRoccio, Marta1 aTscherter, Anne1 aStreit, Jürg1 aAmbett, Ranjeeta1 aSenn, Pascal0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Oct. 19, , no. 116 p.e54538-e54538dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/545383Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54538/spiral-ganglion-neuron-explant-culture-electrophysiology-on-multi  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010700172300001400279520080600293592002801099650004401127650002301171650001601194650002701210650001901237650002601256650003301282650002001315650002101335650002201356650002101378653003901399653001901438653002101457653003101478653004401509700002001553700001501573773010701588856008601695852000901781655001201790IND60540787020221123034302.0190318e20140922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054078702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.03.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Mithilesh10aSynthesis and characterization of graphene oxide/carboxymethylcellulose/alginate composite blend films  ap. 18-25.  aIn this work, graphene oxide/carboxymethylcellulose/alginate (GO/CMC/Alg) composite blends were prepared by a simple solution mixing-evaporation method.

In this study, an ethanol-salt aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) was explored for the purification of the total steroidal saponins, and the process conditions were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Under the optimized conditions, the RSM predicted recovery of the total steroidal saponins in the top phase of ATPS was 97.9%, which agreed with the average experimental recovery (98.3 ± 4.2% (n = 6)). Moreover, a rapid micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method was developed for the determination of diosgenin from extracts. The diosgenin content in the ATPS top phase extract was 3-fold higher than that in crude extract, suggesting this ATPS having a great potential for purification pharmacological active ingredients from fenugreek seeds.  aPublisher supplied data  a31570810cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3aactive ingredients 3adiosgenin 3afenugreek 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3aresponse surface methodology 3aseed extracts 3aseeds 0aAqueous two-phase system 0afenugreek seeds 0atotal steroidal saponins1 aHe, Famei1 aLi, Wenliang1 aFang, Xu1 aLi, Hailing0 tNatural product research.g2019 Feb. 1, v. 33, no. 3 p.453-456dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2018.14550473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012000172300001600292520159700308592002801905653001901933653002501952653002001977653001801997653001602015653001302031653001902044700002202063700002102085773016702106856008202273852000902355655001202364IND60517080320221121124927.0190728e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051708032DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140018302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAppelqvist, Christin10aDistribution and abundance of teredinid recruits along the Swedish coast – are shipworms invading the Baltic Sea?  ap. 783-790.  aShipworms (teredinids) are highly specialized marine bivalves that consume terrestrially derived wood. Changes in environmental variables may result in shipworms spreading into the Baltic Sea – which would have devastating consequences for maritime cultural heritage and submerged wooden structures. We investigated the distribution and abundance of the shipworms Teredo navalis and Psiloteredo megotara along the Swedish coast in 2006–2008, and compared our findings with data collected at partly the same locations in 1971–1973. Wooden test panels were submerged in near-surface waters at 18 harbours. The presence of shipworms was determined by X-ray radiography of each panel. Sea surface temperature and salinity data were analysed to investigate whether any changes in distribution were correlated to changes in environmental variables. We found that past and present distributions of T. navalis were similar – indicating that no range expansion of shipworms into the Baltic Sea has taken place the last 35 years. The abundance of T. navalis was similar between decades at all investigated sites except two (Arild and Barsebäckshamn), where abundances were higher in 2006–2008. The abundance of T. navalis varied along the coast and was positively correlated to mean sea surface salinity, but not to mean sea surface temperature (2006–2008 data). The distribution and abundance of P. megotara were similar during the two study periods with only single observations at a few sites. In conclusion, we found no evidence of range expansion of shipworms along the Swedish coast.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTeredo navalis 0aspatial distribution 0arange expansion 0aSwedish coast 0atemperature 0asalinity 0aclimate-change1 aHavenhand, Jon N.1 aToth, Gunilla B.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2015 June, v. 95, no. 4 p.783-790dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140018303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011200176300001600288500001900304520097400323536011101297592002801408596005501436650002201491650001501513650001401528650001101542650000901553651001401562653001401576653002401590653002401614700003301638700002301671700002101694773012401715856008601839852000901925655001201934IND60705333520221117165358.0201111e20200723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070533352DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2020.17920232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHandayani, Putu Wuri10aSwitching Intention from Traditional to Online Groceries Using the Moderating Effect of Gender in Indonesia  ap. 425-439.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo date, there is still a low consumer intention to use an online grocery (e-grocery) in Indonesia. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the factors affecting consumer intention to switch from traditional to online grocery shopping using the moderating effect of gender. This study involved 522 respondents. The data were then analyzed using the Covariance Based Structural Equation Modeling (CB-SEM) method with the AMOS 21.0 software. The results show that the factors influencing consumer intention to switch from offline to online shopping in Indonesia are perceived channel risk, perceived price-search intentions, mobility, and perceived difference in delivery time. Additionally, the moderating effect of gender significantly influences the factors affecting consumer intention to switch. This research can be a reference to developers of e-grocery applications that are aimed to provide better services and that could be widely accepted by consumers.  aThis work was supported by the Universitas Indonesia [PUTI Q2, grant No. NKB-1472/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2020].  aPublisher supplied data  aPUTI Q2agrant No. NKB-1472/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2020 3acomputer software 3acovariance 3aequations 3agender 3arisk 3aIndonesia 0aE-grocery 0aswitching intention 0amoderating variable1 aNurahmawati, Rismanti Amalia1 aPinem, Ave Adriana1 aAzzahro, Fatimah0 tJournal of food products marketing.g2020 July 23, v. 26, no. 6 p.425-439dRoutledgewJournal:jnl48134x1540-41027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10454446.2020.17920233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03874naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001500176245011100191300001500302520201000317592002802327650001902355650001702374650001802391650002002409650001802429650001502447650002502462650001302487650001902500650001102519650001502530650003002545650004302575650001202618650001302630650000902643650001502652650001802667700002002685700001802705700002302723700001802746700002302764700001902787700001802806700002302824700002102847700001702868700002102885773015202906856007003058856010003128990002303228852000903251655001203260IND60608463920221119031420.0190510e20170804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060846392DNAL7 a10.3791/545392doi7 aPMC56140152pmcid7 a288098242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Yuka10aCreation and transplantation of an adipose-derived stem cell (asc) sheet in a diabetic wound-healing model  ap. e54539.  aArtificial skin has achieved considerable therapeutic results in clinical practice. However, artificial skin treatments for wounds in diabetic patients with impeded blood flow or with large wounds might be prolonged. Cell-based therapies have appeared as a new technique for the treatment of diabetic ulcers, and cell-sheet engineering has improved the efficacy of cell transplantation. A number of reports have suggested that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), a type of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC), exhibit therapeutic potential due to their relative abundance in adipose tissue and their accessibility for collection when compared to MSCs from other tissues. Therefore, ASCs appear to be a good source of stem cells for therapeutic use. In this study, ASC sheets from the epididymal adipose fat of normal Lewis rats were successfully created using temperature-responsive culture dishes and normal culture medium containing ascorbic acid. The ASC sheets were transplanted into Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, a rat model of type 2 diabetes and obesity, that exhibit diminished wound healing. A wound was created on the posterior cranial surface, ASC sheets were transplanted into the wound, and a bilayer artificial skin was used to cover the sheets. ZDF rats that received ASC sheets had better wound healing than ZDF rats without the transplantation of ASC sheets. This approach was limited because ASC sheets are sensitive to dry conditions, requiring the maintenance of a moist wound environment. Therefore, artificial skin was used to cover the ASC sheet to prevent drying. The allogenic transplantation of ASC sheets in combination with artificial skin might also be applicable to other intractable ulcers or burns, such as those observed with peripheral arterial disease and collagen disease, and might be administered to patients who are undernourished or are using steroids. Thus, this treatment might be the first step towards improving the therapeutic options for diabetic wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aallografting 3aanimal models 3aartificial skin 3aascorbic acid 3ablood flow 3acell transplantation 3acollagen 3aculture dishes 3adrying 3aepididymis 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apatients 3arats 3astem cells 3atissue repair1 aIwata, Takanori1 aWashio, Kaoru1 aYoshida, Toshiyuki1 aKuroda, Hozue1 aMorikawa, Shunichi1 aHamada, Mariko1 aIkura, Kazuki1 aKaibuchi, Nobuyuki1 aYamato, Masayuki1 aOkano, Teruo1 aUchigata, Yasuko0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Aug. 04, , no. 126 p.e54539-e54539dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/545393Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54539/creation-transplantation-an-adipose-derived-stem-cell-asc-sheet  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245007200174500001900246520155100265592002801816650001901844650001001863650001001873650001001883650001801893650002201911650001001933650002901943650001001972650001401982650001301996650001402009650002002023650002402043650001502067653003102082653001502113653001802128653001302146653001102159653002602170653002202196653001102218700001902229700002202248700001902270773011102289856008802400852000902488655001202497IND60704811020221119211414.0210226e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070481102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1104132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreivik, Håvard10aPost mortem tissue distribution of quetiapine in forensic autopsies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe antipsychotic drug quetiapine is widely used, and increasingly prescribed off-label. Furthermore, quetiapine use has been linked to increased mortality rates, most likely due to a range of cardiovascular and metabolic adverse effects. This makes quetiapine a relevant substance in forensic toxicology casework. Quetiapine is believed to undergo significant post mortem redistribution. Herein, we present tissue distribution and concentration levels of quetiapine in post mortem whole blood, brain tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver tissue in a series of 14 quetiapine-implicated forensic autopsy cases along with the quetiapine concentrations determined in femoral whole blood in conjunction with the autopsies. Quantification was performed using liquid-liquid extraction and a validated UPLC-MSMS method. Six deaths were attributed to intoxication with quetiapine in combination with other substances; there were no quetiapine monointoxications. In eight cases, death was attributed to other causes than drug toxicity. In a majority of the cases, liver tissue contained the highest quetiapine concentrations, while whole blood levels were the lowest. Central (heart) blood concentrations were generally higher than peripheral (femoral) blood levels. Quetiapine concentrations in femoral blood correlated most strongly with concentrations in skeletal muscle. Otherwise, there was no consistent hierarchy of quetiapine tissue concentrations, and the tissue distribution showed no clear relationship with the length of the post mortem interval.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantipsychotics 3ablood 3abrain 3adeath 3adrug toxicity 3aforensic sciences 3aheart 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3aliver 3amortality 3anecropsy 3apoisoning 3askeletal muscle 3atissue distribution 3atoxicology 0aPost mortem redistribution 0aQuetiapine 0aAntipsychotic 0aForensic 0aMuscle 0aLiquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aTissue1 aFrost, Joachim1 aLøkken, Trine N.1 aSlørdal, Lars0 tForensic science international.g2020 Oct., v. 315 p.110413-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1104133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245013600163300001600299520217900315592002802494650000802522650001302530650002202543650001302565650002402578650001702602650001902619650002302638650001402661653003402675653003002709653003902739653002202778653001002800700001502810700001602825700001502841700001902856700001702875773011202892856008703004852000903091655001203100IND60581727320221119092756.0190822e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058172732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yi10aNumerical modeling study of a man-made low-permeability barrier for the compressed air energy storage in high-permeability aquifers  ap. 820-833.  aCompressed air energy storage (CAES) is a grid-scale energy storage technology for intermittent energy, as proven by the decades-long successful operation of two existing compressed air energy storage in cavern (CAESC) power plants. Because of the limited availability of salt domes appropriate for CAESC, the more widely available aquifers (compressed air energy storage in aquifers, CAESA) have recently attracted considerable attention as candidates for CAES. An ideal aquifer for CAESA is highly permeable around the well to facilitate easy injection and withdrawal of air, but the high-permeability region is surrounded by low-permeability zones to minimize the loss of injected air and decrease in energy efficiency. However, such ideal geological structures are not always available in nature. Therefore, the potential of creating man-made low-permeability barrier in high-permeability aquifers is very interesting. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of man-made low-permeability barriers in high-permeability aquifers using the numerical simulator TOUGH2/Gel to calculate the three-component flow (including a miscible gelling liquid). The simulation results show that an expected low-permeability barrier can be created by injecting grout with certain properties, and the altered aquifer performs well for CAESA. Additional sensitivity studies are also performed to reveal the effects of the various factors on the success of the low-permeability barrier creation, including the critical solidification concentration, the scale factor of the time dependence of the grout viscosity, the relative density of the grout, and the volume of the follow-up water injection. The results indicate that, in a horizontal aquifer, low critical solidification concentrations, and small scale factors are generally preferred and the density of grout should be close to that of the in situ water. For the given volume of the injected grout, there is an optimal follow-up water injection that will create the largest storage space without damaging the barrier. These results may help to extend the candidate sites for CAESA and the prospect of large scale energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaquifers 3aenergy efficiency 3agelation 3amathematical models 3apower plants 3asolidification 3astorage technology 3aviscosity 0aCompressed air energy storage 0aHigh-permeability aquifer 0aMan-made low- permeability barrier 0aEnergy efficiency 0aModel1 aPan, Lehua1 aZhang, Keni1 aHu, Litang1 aWang, Jinsheng1 aGuo, Chaobin0 tApplied energy.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 208 p.820-833dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009300175300001600268520143000284592002801714650002101742650001401763650002201777650002301799650001101822653001901833653002501852653001301877653001501890700002501905773010801930856008602038852000902124655001202133IND60540787220221117161256.0190318e20140830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054078722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThakur, Vijay Kumar10aProcessing and characterization of natural cellulose fibers/thermoset polymer composites  ap. 102-117.  aRecently natural cellulose fibers from different biorenewable resources have attracted the considerable attraction of research community all around the globe owing to their unique intrinsic properties such as biodegradability, easy availability, environmental friendliness, flexibility, easy processing and impressive physico-mechanical properties.

The spleen, the liver, the kidneys and the pancreas were eviscerated in the course of standard forensic autopsy, followed by manual arterial and venous perfusion of the organs with the lipophilic contrast agent Angiofil®. Computed tomography (CT) of the organ packages was executed to evaluate if the perfusion with Angiofil® was sufficient. The CT scans revealed a good delineation of the vessel trees up to the organ periphery, suggesting a sufficient perfusion. Tissue samples were taken before and after perfusion, stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and examined by using microscopy. Native and perfused specimens were assessed on the basis of a qualitative rating scale in regard to the integrity of the cells, the tissue architecture and induced alterations. Subsequently the observed differences before and after perfusion with Angiofil® were analyzed quantitatively. While the liver, spleen and kidneys could be evaluated, further microscopic examinations of the pancreatic tissue were not possible due to vast autolytic changes.On the cellular level no changes in the liver, spleen and kidneys were observed after administering Angiofil®. While the tissue architecture of these organs remained intact, a significant blood volume displacement occurred. As a consequence, tissue with hypoemic or normal blood state demonstrated congestion. Further, optically empty spaces emerged regularly in the vessels and the parenchyma of each organ as a surrogate for the lipophilic contrast agent. With a few exceptions an adequate perfusion up to the microscopic level was observed.Following the results of this investigation, CT-controlled manual injection of Angiofil® into isolated organs may be an alternative to the generalized in situ application of contrast agents in the course of PMCTA. It is of eminent importance to know the artefacts induced by an Angiofil® injection in order to avoid a misinterpretation or a masking of findings. Thus, a collection of native tissue specimens has to be done before contrast agent application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiography 3ablood 3ablood volume 3acomputed tomography 3aforensic sciences 3ahistology 3alipophilicity 3aliver 3amicroscopy 3anecropsy 3apancreas 3aspleen 0aTargeted contrast agent injection of visceral organs 0aAngiofil® 0aPostmortem computed tomography angiography (PMCTA) 0aAutopsy 0aArtefacts1 aWittig, Holger1 aKalberer, Nicole M.1 aScheurer, Eva0 tForensic science international.g2020 Oct., v. 315 p.110427-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1104273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04964naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113024003400144040001800178100001800196245011900214300001800333506002800351506005900379520250200438592002802940596010402968506003703072650000903109650001603118650002103134650001503155650001803170650002303188650001103211650001903222650001403241650001403255650001203269650001603281650001903297650001703316650001603333650001603349650001203365650000903377650001503386650001103401650001803412650002403430650001503454650000903469650001703478650001303495650001903508650002703527650001203554650001103566650002403577650003403601650002003635650002103655650004503676650001103721650002003732651001003752651001003762700001903772700002103791700001803812700001703830700001803847700001303865773011503878856007703993903002204070961000904092852000904101655001204110IND60083365620221207083224.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008336562DNAL7 a220323962pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2011-43612doi7 a10.3168/jds.2011-43612chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoshide, A.K.10aEffects of stored feed cropping systems and farm size on the profitability of Maine organic dairy farm simulations  ap. 5710-5723.  aResource is Open Access  aAmerican Dairy Science Association License Information  aUnited States organic dairy production has increased to meet the growing demand for organic milk. Despite higher prices received for milk, organic dairy farmers have come under increasing financial stress due to increases in concentrated feed prices over the past few years, which can make up one-third of variable costs. Market demand for milk has also leveled in the last year, resulting in some downward pressure on prices paid to dairy farmers. Organic dairy farmers in the Northeast United States have experimented with growing different forage and grain crops to maximize on-farm production of protein and energy to improve profitability. Three representative organic feed systems were simulated using the integrated farm system model for farms with 30, 120, and 220 milk cows. Increasing intensity of equipment use was represented by organic dairy farms growing only perennial sod (low) to those with corn-based forage systems, which purchase supplemental grain (medium) or which produce and feed soybeans (high). The relative profitability of these 3 organic feed systems was strongly dependent on dairy farm size. From results, we suggest smaller organic dairy farms can be more profitable with perennial sod-based rather than corn-based forage systems due to lower fixed costs from using only equipment associated with perennial forage harvest and storage. The largest farm size was more profitable using a corn-based system due to greater economies of scale for growing soybeans, corn grain, winter cereals, and corn silages. At an intermediate farm size of 120 cows, corn-based forage systems were more profitable if perennial sod was not harvested at optimum quality, corn was grown on better soils, or if milk yield was 10% higher. Delayed harvest decreased the protein and energy content of perennial sod crops, requiring more purchased grain to balance the ration and resulting in lower profits. Corn-based systems were less affected by lower perennial forage quality, as corn silage is part of the forage base. Growing on better soils increased corn yields more than perennial forage yields. Large corn-based organic dairy farms that produced and fed soybeans minimized off-farm grain purchases and were the most profitable among large farms. Although perennial sod-based systems purchased more grain, these organic systems were more profitable under timely forage harvest, decreased soil quality, and relatively lower purchased energy prices and higher protein supplement prices.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000070140 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acorn 3acorn silage 3acropping systems 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3aeconomies of scale 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3aequipment 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afeed prices 3aforage quality 3aforage yield 3agrain crops 3alarge farms 3amarkets 3amilk 3amilk yield 3amodels 3aprofitability 3aprofits and margins 3apurchasing 3asoil 3asoil quality 3asoybeans 3avariable costs 2aAnimal Feedxeconomics 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aComputer Simulation 2aDairyingxeconomicsxmethods. 2aMilkxeconomics 2aModels, Economic 2aOrganic Agriculturexeconomicsxmethods. 2aSilage 2aSoilxstandards 3aMaine 0aMaine1 aHalloran, J.M.1 aKersbergen, R.J.1 aGriffin, T.S.1 aDeFauw, S.L.1 aLaGasse, B.J.1 aJain, S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Nov., v. 94, no. 11 p.5710-5723dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12516x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-43613Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012200164300001600286520099900302592002801301653001801329653002601347653001501373700002101388700002001409700002801429773016701457856008201624852000901706655001201715IND60517080620221121124951.0190728e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051708062DNAL7 a10.1017/S002531541400201X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoykan, Ozan10aAge, growth and reproduction of European hake (Merluccius merluccius (Linn., 1758)) in the Central Aegean Sea, Turkey  ap. 829-837.  aSpecimens of European hake were collected by a traditional demersal trawl between July 2004 and June 2007 from İzmir Bay, Central Aegean Sea.

Glucose can be oxidized by oxygen (O2) in the presence of glucose oxidase (GOD), and the generated gluconic acid can decrease the pH value of the solution and then induce the fluorophore- and quencher-labeled cytosine-rich single-stranded DNA to fold into a close-packed i-motif structure. As a result, the fluorescence quenching occurs because of the resonance energy transfer between fluorophore and quencher. Based on this working principle, the concentration of glucose can be detected by the decrease of fluorescence density. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the assay shows a linear response range of 5–100µM for the glucose concentration with a detection limit of 4µM. This glucose biosensor was applied to determine glucose in real samples successfully, suggesting its potential in the practical applicability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agluconic acid 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aoxygen 3apH 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aGlucose 0aFluorescence 0aI-motif DNA 0apH1 aZheng, Yu1 aYang, Fan1 aZhang, Hanchang1 aYang, Xiurong0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.539-544dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245016800172300001600340520145400356592002801810650001201838650002001850650001101870650001901881650001501900650002401915650001001939650001301949650001301962650002401975650002401999650001102023650001802034650001602052650001602068653003202084653002002116653002002136653003102156653001602187700001102203700001602214773009802230856008702328852000902415655001202424IND60581727520221119090813.0190822e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058172752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Mansour, R.10aEffects of oxygen carrier mole fraction, velocity distribution on conversion performance using an experimentally validated mathematical model of a CLC fuel reactor  ap. 803-819.  aDue to the severity of the worldwide climate change problem and the ocean acidification problem, chemical looping combustion (CLC) technology is studied worldwide by researchers in order to meet the urgency of carbon emission reduction after its concept has been put forward. An experimentally validated computer model has been implemented in Ansys-Fluent code with the most appropriate kinetic model implemented in User Define Functions. The validated model has been used to carry out a numerical study on a model fuel reactor using CaSO4 as oxygen carrier and H2 as fuel; is conducted in the present work. Effects of mole fraction of CaS, operating temperature, superficial feeding velocity magnitude of fuel and the diameter of oxygen carrier particles were discussed. The results indicate that the superficial feeding velocity of gaseous fuel has significant effects on the flow condition with fuel reactor and conversion performance, while operating temperature mainly affects the fuel conversion. The effects of particle diameter on flow condition within FR are obvious but insignificant on conversion performance of fuel. The mole fraction of CaS has the least effect among these three parameters. Several velocity distributions are also studied. The rectangle-trianble distributor results in better bubbles distributions, but the gain of higher fuel conversion rate is insignificant due to the low chemical activity of OC used in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3acalcium sulfate 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3acomputer simulation 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3akinetics 3amathematical models 3aocean acidification 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3aresearchers 3atemperature 0aChemical looping combustion 0aMultiphase flow 0aNumerical study 0aChemical reaction kinetics 0aDistributor1 aLi, H.1 aHabib, M.A.0 tApplied energy.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 208 p.803-819dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.09.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03898naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245009300191300001600284500001500300520199300315592002802308650002102336650001802357650002202375650002602397650001902423650003202442650001902474650001802493650002302511650001402534650002602548650005102574650002302625650001902648650004102667650002102708650002302729650002502752650005602777650004202833650005002875650005202925650002202977650002502999653001903024653001003043653000803053700002403061773014503085852000903230856008103239655001203320IND4378849420221121213312.0191016e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437884942DNAL7 a160213402pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-005-7307-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, Birgit Otzen10aEvidence implying only unprimed RdRP activity during transitive gene silencing in plants  ap. 575-583.  a2019-12-06  aRNA silencing is a sequence-specific RNA degradation mechanism found in most eukaryotes, where small cleavage products (siRNAs) of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) mediate silencing of genes with sequence identity to the dsRNA inducer. In several systems, silencing has been found to spread from the dsRNA inducer sequence into upstream or downstream regions of the target RNA, a phenomenon termed transitive silencing. In nematodes, silencing spreads only in the 3′–5′ direction along the target mRNA by siRNAs serving as primers for cRNA synthesis by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In plants, transitive silencing is seen in both directions suggesting that at least some cRNA synthesis occurs by un-primed initiation at the 3′ end of mRNAs. Replicating plant viruses trigger an RNA silencing defence response that degrades the viral RNA, thus tempering the virus infection. Likewise, fragments of plant genes inserted into a virus will become targets for degradation, leading to virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of the homologous plant mRNAs. We have analyzed the spreading of gene silencing in VIGS experiments using a transgene and two endogenous genes as targets. In Nicotiana benthamiana plants expressing a β-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene, a Potato virus X vector carrying a 5′ fragment of the GUS gene induced silencing which spread to downstream regions of the transgene mRNA including the 3′-untranslated region. Conversely, silencing induced by a 3′ fragment spread only for a limited distance in the 3′–5′ direction. Silencing induced by a central GUS gene fragment spread only into downstream regions. Similar analyses using the endogenous plant genes, magnesium chelatase subunit I (ChlI) and an RNase L inhibitor homologue (RLIh), revealed no spreading along target sequences. This implies that transitive silencing in plants occurs by un-primed cRNA synthesis from the 3′ end of targeted (transgene) transcripts, and not by siRNA-primed cRNA synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3amessenger RNA 3atransgenic plants 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPotato virus X 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3areporter genes 3aribonucleases 3abeta-glucuronidase 3ainfection 3asmall interfering RNA 2a3' Untranslated Regionsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Northern 2aGene Silencing 2aGlucuronidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aPotexvirusxgenetics 2aRNA-Dependent RNA Polymerasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTobaccoxgenetics 2aTransgenesxgenetics 0agene silencing 0agenes 0aRNA1 aAlbrechtsen, Merete0 tPlant molecular biology.g2005 July, v. 58, no. 4 p.575-583dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl33639x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-005-7307-43Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02672naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245009900167500001900266520129100285592002801576650001501604650001601619650002201635650004101657650001301698650001201711650001601723650002401739653002101763653002501784653002801809653003201837653003101869700001701900700001401917700001201931700001401943700001301957700001601970700002001986773011102006856008802117852000902205655001202214IND60704811320221119211358.0210226e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070481132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1104302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Jing10aInfluence of thermal environment in fire on the identification of gasoline combustion residues  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecent advances in fire investigation have engendered signiﬁcant interest in fire debris analysis. Many factors in fire scenes, however, may interfere with the identification of ignitable liquid residues (ILRs). Generally, all ILRs suffer unavoidably from thermal destruction in fires. In contrast to weathering, the thermal effects on ILRs involve evaporation, thermal degradation and other chemical reactions. In order to study the influence of the thermal environment in fire scenes on the stability of target compounds for ILRs identification, gasoline combustion residues were reheated at different temperatures and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) systematically. The results showed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and indanes were more susceptible to thermal destruction, and could not be detected effectively after heating. On the other hand, alkylbenzenes and condensed ring aromatics were comparatively more stable. When the temperature rose to 600 °C, almost all the target compounds were lost after reheating again for 2 min. The research provides an important reference for gasoline combustion residues identification, and care should be taken on the interpretation of results due to the inevitable thermal damage to ILRs in fires.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aevaporation 3aforensic sciences 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agasoline 3aliquids 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 0aForensic science 0aFire debris analysis 0aGasoline identification 0aThermal environment in fire 0aTarget compounds stability1 aChi, Jiaping1 aXue, Teng1 aXu, Jie1 aLiu, Ling1 aLi, Yang1 aDeng, Liang1 aZhang, Jinzhuan0 tForensic science international.g2020 Oct., v. 315 p.110430-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.1104303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012400168300001400292520111200306592002801418650003501446650001001481650002001491650001901511650001201530653001001542653002301552653002001575700001701595700002001612700002201632700006101654773008701715856008301802990002301885852000901908655001201917IND60697479420221119195320.0200605e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemion, Azaria10aKinetics of the establishment of HIV-1 viral interference and comprehensive analysis of the contribution of viral genes  ap. 59-67.  aViral interference defines the reduced susceptibility of an infected cell to reinfection. For HIV-1, both receptor-dependent and independent pathways were described. The relative importance of different receptor-independent pathways has not been addressed.We have used reporter viruses to quantify the percentage of single- and double-infected cells, as a function of the delay between the two infections. For co-infection experiments, the frequency of double infected cells was higher than expected for independent events. By delaying the second infection, this frequency progressively diminished, resulting in significant interference after 18h. Interference measured here was largely receptor-independent. By individually deleting viral genes or expressing them in isolation, we demonstrate that the viral protein Rev plays a dominant role, while other viral proteins contributes to optimal interference.Our study defines the kinetics of early HIV-1 interference, describing the transition from higher susceptibility to double-infection to viral interference, and identifies Rev as its dominant effector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3agenes 3amixed infection 3aviral proteins 3aviruses 0aHIV-1 0aViral interference 0aSuper-infection1 aDelord, Marc1 aHance, Allan J.1 aSaragosti, Sentob1 aMammano, Fabrizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9193-76960 tVirology.g2016 Jan., v. 487 p.59-67dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001800190245013000208300001600338500002400354500001500378520111500393650002601508650002401534650001701558650001101575650001801586650001201604650001701616650001001633650001701643650002201660650002301682650002001705650000901725650001901734650002501753650001701778650001201795650001601807650001701823650001101840650001101851650000901862650002101871651001101892651001101903653001701914700001801931700001601949700001701965773011701982852000902099856007502108930003302183945002502216946001302241655001202254IND4435803920221116141931.0100422e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443580392DNAL7 a203882642pmid7 a10.1603/EN091802doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL001 0aK001 0aB2001 aSilva, F.A.B.10aStudy of the Dung Beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) Community at Two Sites: Atlantic Forest and Clear-Cut, Pernambuco, Brazil  ap. 359-367.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to compare the dung beetle (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) community structure at two sites in the Charles Darwin Ecological Refuge in Igarassu, Pernambuco, Brazil. Dung beetles were collected in 2006 using monthly samples from 48 pitfall traps baited with human dung and bovine carrion. The dung beetle communities from the study sites were compared in terms of abundance, species richness, and diversity (Shannon index). Seasonality was analyzed by Spearman correlation between rainfall data and community parameters. In total, 2,560 individuals belonging to 40 species, 16 genera, and 6 tribes were collected. Species richness was higher for the clear-cut area compared with the forest habitat. Estimators of species richness suggested a total richness of 42–47 species in the entire study area. A positive correlation was observed between monthly rainfall and total abundance of individuals for the clear-cut area but not for the forest habitat. This study contributes to a better understanding of Scarabaeinae ecology in the Atlantic rainforest of northeastern Brazil. 3atropical rain forests 3acommunity structure 3adung beetles 3ahumans 3apitfall traps 3abaiting 3aScarabaeidae 3afeces 3adead animals 3aspecies diversity 3aseasonal variation 3aforest habitats 3arain 3ainsect ecology 3apopulation structure 3aclearcutting 2aAnimals 2aColeoptera. 2aBiodiversity 2aCattle 2aHumans 2aRain 2aTropical Climate 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0abiodiversity1 aCosta, C.M.Q.1 aMoura, R.C.1 aFarias, A.I.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2010 Apr., v. 39, no. 2 p.359-367dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN091803Available from publisher's Web site  a20100701b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03842naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245014600198300001500344520200900359592002802368650002502396650002102421650001502442650002302457650001302480650003802493650002102531650002602552650001202578650001502590650003102605650001302636650001502649650001702664650001802681650002902699650001202728650001202740700001502752700001702767700002002784700002402804700002302828700002402851700002002875700001702895773015202912856007003064856009803134990002303232852000903255655001203264IND60608464120221119025757.0190510e20161020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060846412DNAL7 a10.3791/545412doi7 aPMC50922242pmcid7 a278056162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeywood, Wendy E.12aA high throughput, multiplexed and targeted proteomic csf assay to quantify neurodegenerative biomarkers and apolipoprotein e isoforms status  ap. e54541.  aMany neurodegenerative diseases are still lacking effective treatments. Reliable biomarkers for identifying and classifying these diseases will be important in the development of future novel therapies. Often potential new biomarkers do not make it into the clinic due to limitations in their development and high costs. However, targeted proteomics using Multiple Reaction Monitoring Liquid Chromatography-tandem/Mass Spectrometry (MRM LC-MS/MS), specifically using triple quadrupole mass spectrometers, is one method that can be used to rapidly evaluate and validate biomarkers for clinical translation into diagnostic laboratories. Traditionally, this platform has been used extensively for measurement of small molecules in clinical laboratories, but it is the potential to analyze proteins, that makes it an attractive alternative to ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)-based methods. We describe here how targeted proteomics can be used to measure multiplexed markers of dementia, including the detection and quantitation of the known risk factor apolipoprotein E isoform 4 (ApoE4). In order to make the assay suitable for translation, it is designed to be rapid, simple, highly specific and cost effective. To achieve this, every step in the development of the assay must be optimized for the individual proteins and tissues they are analyzed in. This method describes a typical workflow including various tips and tricks to developing a targeted proteomics MRM LC-MS/MS for translation. The method development is optimized using custom synthesized versions of tryptic quantotypic peptides, which calibrate the MS for detection and then spiked into CSF to determine correct identification of the endogenous peptide in the chromatographic separation prior to analysis in the MS. To achieve absolute quantitation, stable isotope-labeled internal standard versions of the peptides with short amino acid sequence tags and containing a trypsin cleavage site, are included in the assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aapolipoprotein E 3abiomarkers 3acost effectiveness 3adementia 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquids 3amonitoring 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apeptides 3aproteomics 3arisk factors 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atissues 3atrypsin1 aBaud, Anna1 aBliss, Emily1 aSirka, Ernestas1 aSchott, Jonathan M.1 aZetterberg, Henrik1 aGalimberti, Daniela1 aSebire, Neil J.1 aMills, Kevin0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Oct. 20, , no. 116 p.e54541-e54541dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/545413Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54541/a-high-throughput-multiplexed-targeted-proteomic-csf-assay-to  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245007600171520163900247592002801886650001601914650001101930650001401941650001501955650001401970650001401984650001401998650001902012650001402031700002402045773013402069856008402203852000902287655001202296IND60754091120221119172305.0211023e20211017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075409112DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111010172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzembor, Jerzy H.10aSources of Resistance to Powdery Mildew in Barley Landraces from Turkey  aPowdery mildew on barley, caused by the pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, occurs worldwide and can result in severe yield loss. Germplasm of barley, including landraces, commercial cultivars, wild relatives and breeding lines are stored in more than 200 institutions. There is a need for characterization of this germplasm in terms of resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. This is necessary in order to use specific accessions in breeding programs. In the present study, 129 barley landraces originated from Turkey and provided by the ICARDA genebank were tested for resistance to powdery mildew. Seedling resistance tests after inoculation with 19 differentiated isolates of B. graminis f. sp. hordei were used to postulate the presence of resistance genes. From the 129 landraces studied, plants of 19 (14.7%) of them showed resistance to infection with powdery mildew. Based on preliminary tests from these 19 landraces, 25 resistant single plant lines were selected for testing with differential powdery mildew isolates. Seven lines were resistant to all 19 isolates used. However, only one line (5583-1-4) showed resistance scores of zero against all isolates used. It is likely that this line possesses unknown, but highly effective genes for resistance. In five resistant lines it was not possible to postulate the presence of specific resistance genes. In 19 lines the presence of the genes Mlp, Mlk, Mlh, Mlg, Ml(CP), Mlat, Mla3, Mla6, Mla7 and Mla22 were postulated. These new sources of highly effective powdery mildew resistance in barley landraces from Turkey could be successfully used in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3abarley 3acultivars 3agene banks 3agermplasm 3alandraces 3apathogens 3apowdery mildew 3aseedlings1 aCzembor, Elżbieta 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Oct. 17, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111010173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015100176300001600327520108900343592002801432650001501460650001801475650002201493650002001515650002201535650001501557650002901572650002101601650001301622650002501635650001901660653002201679653001501701653001901716653002101735653001801756700002101774700002001795700002001815700002101835700002701856773010301883856008601986852000902072655001202081IND60535901120221122233123.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053590112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilinkovitch, Thomas10aIn situ evaluation of oxidative stress and immunological parameters as ecotoxicological biomarkers in a novel sentinel species (Mimachlamys varia)  ap. 170-175.  aAlthough the variegated scallop Mimachlamys varia seems to be a suitable sentinel species for contaminant monitoring, no study has identified biomarkers in this species. In order to fill this gap, this study conducted an in situ biomarker approach. M. varia were collected in contaminated and uncontaminated areas and responsiveness of oxidative stress and immunological biomarkers was evaluated in the digestive gland. In parallel, 14 trace element concentrations were evaluated in the same organ. Superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde content responded efficiently to in situ contamination when a certain degree of contamination was reached. Laccase-type phenoloxidase showed a high sensitivity but saturation of the response was highlighted for the highest contaminations. Additionally, correlations were found between biomarkers and trace element concentrations. Taken together, results showed that biomarker approach conducted in the digestive gland of M. varia represents a sensitive analytical tool to highlight ecotoxicological issues in coastal marine ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3aecotoxicology 3aindicator species 3amalondialdehyde 3amarine ecosystems 3amonitoring 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aoxidative stress 3ascallops 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atrace elements 0aMimachlamys varia 0aBiomarkers 0aTrace elements 0aOxidative stress 0aPhenoloxidase1 aBustamante, Paco1 aHuet, Valérie,1 aReigner, Anaïs1 aChurlaud, Carine1 aThomas-Guyon, Hélène0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Apr., v. 161 p.170-175dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013400208300002000342500001900362500001100381520129900392592002801691596005901719596005901778596005901837596007701896650002201973650001101995650001302006650001202019650001102031650002002042650001402062700005602076773012502132856008202257852000902339655001202348IND60698303420221121020343.0200611e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069830342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04841-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Sheng-Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5007-360110aDetermination of viscosity and surface tension of liquid Ni–Al–Ti system using the evaluated thermodynamic properties by AMCT  ap. 11071-11085.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThe thermophysical properties of Ni–Al. Ni–Ti, and Al–Ti alloys, i.e., viscosity and surface tension, have been investigated using the evaluated thermodynamic properties, i.e., enthalpy of mixing [Formula: see text], Gibbs free energy of mixing [Formula: see text], and excess Gibbs free energy [Formula: see text], by the atom and molecular coexistence theory. Then, the third-degree Redlich–Kister (R–K) parameters for viscosity, surface tension, and excess Gibbs free energy at 1973 K were obtained. Based on this, the isothermal viscosity of Ni–Al–Ti ternary melts was simultaneously determined form the excess viscosity of the above-mentioned three binary systems by CALPHAD model and the similarity coefficients by Chou’s model, and the surface tension of the liquid ternary Ni–Al–Ti alloy systems was investigated with considering the excess surface tension of the three binary systems by Chou’s model as well as the excess Gibbs free energy of Ni–Al–Ti melts by Butler’s model for the multicomponent system at 1973 K. The results showed that the viscosity and surface tension of liquid Ni–Al–Ti alloy increase with the increase in Ti content at a fixed Al/Ni ratio, whereas decreases with increasing Al/Ni ratio at a given alloy composition at 1973 K.  aPublisher supplied data  aU1560203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51704021cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51274031cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aFRF-TP-16-079A1cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aGibbs free energy 3aalloys 3aenthalpy 3aliquids 3amodels 3asurface tension 3aviscosity1 aGuo, Han-Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6493-88530 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 25 p.11071-11085dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04841-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012500177300001400302520084000316592002801156650001801184650001401202650002001216650001701236700002001253700002301273773011001296856008401406852000901490655001201499IND60746686120221120175422.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074668612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2020.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicholson, Charles F.,10aFood value chain interventions and nutritional outcomes: a review of evidence and recommendations for future assessments  ap. 61-67.  aFood value chains (FVC) have become an important framework for the assessment of interventions to improve nutritional outcomes during the past decade, and recent literature indicates considerable agreement about FVC importance and potential impact pathways. Despite the usefulness of the FVC framework, the majority of studies reviewed provide only conceptual models or descriptive analyses of linkages with nutrition, limiting their usefulness for quantitative assessment of intervention impacts. Fewer than five studies of 113 reviewed measure the impacts of FVC interventions on nutritional outcomes or provide study protocols for that purpose. In addition to randomized controlled trials, comparative analysis and systems modeling methods will provide relevant evidence about the effectiveness of FVCs for improvement of nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3asupply chain1 aMonterrosa, Eva1 aGarrett, James L.,0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2021 Aug., v. 70 p.61-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2020.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245012400162300001800286520095900304592002801263650002001291650001301311650001101324700001601335700001701351700002201368700001801390700001801408700001701426700001501443700001601458700001301474700001601487700002101503700001301524700002001537773010201557856004801659852000901707655001201716IND4483981220221121190241.0120531e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448398122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5101-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, JieTai10aSqueezing bandwidth controllable twin beam light and phase sensitive nonlinear interferometer based on atomic ensembles  ap. 1925-1930.  aWe review our recent experimental progress in quantum technology employing amplification effect of four-wave mixing in a rubidium vapor. We have produced an intensity difference squeezed light source at frequencies as low as 1.5 kHz which is so far the lowest frequency at which squeezing has been observed in an atomic system. Moreover, we find that the bandwidth of our squeezed light source can be controlled with light intensity pumping. Using our non-classical light source, we have further developed a nonlinear Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer, for which the maximum fringe intensity depends quadratically on the intensity of the phase-sensing field at the high-gain regime, leading to much better sensitivity than a linear MZ interferometer in which the beam splitters have the same phase-sensing intensity. The quantum technologies developed by our group could have great potential in areas such as precision measurement and quantum information.  aPublisher supplied data 3alight intensity 3arubidium 3avapors1 aLiu, CunJin1 aZhou, ZhiFan1 aHudelist, Florian1 aYuan, ChunHua1 aChen, Liqing,1 aLi, Xiaoyun,1 aQian, Jing1 aZhang, KeYe1 aZhou, Lu1 aMa, HongMei1 aDong, GuangJiong1 aOu, ZeYu1 aZhang, Weiping,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 June, v. 57, no. 16 p.1925-1930dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5101-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245016200164300001800326520145500344592002801799650002201827650003101849650002101880650002401901650001701925650001301942650001101955650000701966650001601973650001601989650001602005700001402021700005402035773011402089856008402203852000902287655001202296IND60634930720221123013244.0190326e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063493072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b002612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Nana10aZwitterionic Surfactant Micelle-Directed Self-Assembly of Eu-Containing Polyoxometalate into Organized Nanobelts with Improved Emission and pH Responsiveness  ap. 4370-4379.  aRecently, hybrid coassembly between polyoxometalates (POMs) and cationic building blocks provides an efficient strategy to greatly optimize POMs’ functionality as well as their aggregate structural diversity. Adaptive hybrid supramolecular materials with enhanced luminescence have then been obtained from lanthanide-containing POMs. In this work, a commercially available and pH-switchable zwitterionic surfactant, tetradecyldimethylamine oxide (C₁₄DMAO), was chosen to coassemble with a lanthanide-containing anionic POM [Na₉(EuW₁₀O₃₆)·32H₂O, abbreviated as EuW₁₀] in water. The much improved red-emitting luminescent nanobelts at a C₁₄DMAO/EuW₁₀ molar ratio (R) of 20 were obtained, which exhibited longer luminescence lifetime and higher quantum yield compared with EuW₁₀ aqueous solution. After careful characterization of morphology and structure of nanobelts, an unusual axial lamellar aggregation arrangement mechanism was proposed. It was the partial protonation of C₁₄DMAO at the solution pH of about 6.5 that led to positively charged micelles, being bridged by anionic EuW₁₀ clusters to aggregate into such novel nanobelts under the synergetic effects of appropriate electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. The resulted pH-responsive luminescent nanobelts and their aggregation model should offer attractive references for preparing smart optical supramolecular materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aluminescence 3amicelles 3amodels 3apH 3aprotonation 3asurfactants 3azwitterions1 aFeng, Lei1 aChen, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1801-70140 tLangmuir.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 35, no. 12 p.4370-4379dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b002613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01341naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009700164300001200261520030700273592002800580650002300608650002300631650002300654650002400677653002900701653002800730700002000758700002600778773013700804856007700941852000901018655001201027IND60521570320221121045315.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157032DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-01262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabrowsky, Horst10aNeue Phasen im System Thallium-Eisen-Schwefel/New Phases in the System Thallium-Iron-Sulphur  ap. 115.  aThe structure and magnetic properties of the new ferromagnetic compounds TlFe₁₊ₓS₂ (0,25 ≤ x ≤ 0,85) were investigated.

This school-based survey was carried out among high school students from the city of Maringá in the state of Paraná (PR), Brazil (2007). The sample included 991 students (54.5% girls) from high schools. DIPs were investigated by the frequency of weekly consumption of each food group: vegetables, fruit, rice, beans, fried food, sweet food, milk, soda, meat, eggs, alcoholic drinks. Independent variables were: demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and lifestyle variables. DIPs were identified using principal component analysis with orthogonal rotation (varimax). Three components were extracted. Component 1 (fried foods, sweets and soft drinks) was positively associated with not having breakfast for girls and dinner for boys. Moreover, component 2 (consumption of fruit and vegetables) was positively associated with having breakfast at home for boys and number of meals for girls. Component 3 (beans, eggs and meat) was positively associated with having lunch, employment and sedentary behavior level for girls. However, it was negatively associated with having lunch and dinner for boys. Adolescents who have healthier eating patterns also had other healthier behaviors regardless of gender. However, factors associated with dietary patterns differ between boys and girls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aalcoholic beverages 3abeans 3aboys 3abreakfast 3adinner 3aeating habits 3aeggs 3aemployment 3afood consumption 3afood groups 3afried foods 3afruits 3agender 3agirls 3ahealthy diet 3ahigh school students 3ahigh schools 3alifestyle 3alunch 3ameat 3amilk 3amultivariate analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3arice 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asoft drinks 3asurveys 3asweets 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 3aBrazil1 aAdami, Fernando1 aFalcão, Mário Cícero0 tAppetite.g2012 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.1057-1062dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009700174300002000271500001900291520113900310592002801449596005001477650001901527650002001546650001701566650002101583700006101604700002001665700002001685700001901705773012501724856008201849852000901931655001201940IND60698303620221121020202.0200611e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069830362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04794-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakalkar, Gorakshnath10aNi incorporation in MgFe2O4 for improved CO2-splitting activity during solar fuel production  ap. 11086-11094.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEfficacy of the sol–gel derived Ni-doped Mg-ferrites for an enhanced CO₂ splitting activity is investigated. The results allied with the characterization indicate the formation of nominally phase pure Ni-doped Mg-ferrites with a coarser particle morphology. Ni-doped Mg-ferrites are further tested for multiple thermal reduction as well as CO₂ splitting steps by using a thermogravimetric analyzer. The results associated with the thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that most of the Ni-doped Mg-ferrites attained a steady TR aptitude after crossing the 5th or 6th cycle. Likewise, the CS capability of all the Ni-doped Mg-ferrites accomplished consistency after 4th cycle (except for Ni₀.₁₁Mg₀.₈₈Fe₂.₀₁O₄.₀₀₅). The Ni₀.₉₀Mg₀.₁₁Fe₂.₀₄O₄.₀₇₀ showed the highest amount of O₂ release (117.1 μmol/g cycle) and CO production (210.3 μmol/g cycle) in ten consecutive thermochemical cycles.

Selection of non‐breeding areas could change over time and space driven by climate change and species habitat requirements. To help explain the mechanism shaping non‐breeding area selection, we provide site‐specific analyses of distributional changes in wintering waterbirds in central Europe, located at the centre of their flyways. We use wintering waterbirds as a highly dynamic model group monitored over a long‐time scale of 50 years (1966–2015). We identified species habitat requirements and changes in habitat use at the level of 733 individual non‐breeding (specifically wintering) sites for 12 waterbird species using citizen‐science monitoring data. We calculated site‐specific mean numbers and estimated site‐specific trends in numbers. The site‐specific approach revealed a general effect of mean winter temperature of site (seven of 12 species), wetland type (all species) and land cover (all species) on site‐specific numbers. We found increasing site‐specific trends in numbers in the northern and/or eastern part of the study area (Mute Swan Cygnus olor, Eurasian Teal Anas crecca, Common Pochard Aythya ferina, Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra). Common Merganser Mergus merganser, Great Cormorant, Grey Heron Ardea cinerea, Common Pochard, Eurasian Coot and Common Moorhen Galinulla chloropus increased their site‐specific numbers on standing industrial waters with traditionally low fish stock. The site‐specific dynamics of bird numbers helped us to identify general preference for sites reducing winter harshness (warmer areas, running waters and more wetlands in the site vicinity), as well as indicating climate‐driven changes in spatial use of wintering sites (northern/north‐eastern range changes and changes in preference for industrial waters). This fine‐scale (site‐specific) approach can reveal large‐scale range and distribution shifts driven by climate and environmental changes regardless of the availability of large‐scale datasets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas crecca 3aArdea cinerea 3aAythya 3aCygnus olor 3aFulica atra 3aGallinula chloropus 3aMergus merganser 3aPhalacrocorax carbo 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adynamic models 3afish 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3amonitoring 3atemperature 3awater birds 3awetlands 3awinter 3awintering grounds 3aCentral European region1 aMusil, Petr1 aZouhar, Jan1 aAdam, Matyáš0 tIbis.g2018 July, v. 160, no. 3 p.582-596dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.125593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01725naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007500168300001400243520074600257592002801003650001701031650001801048650002301066650001301089700001301102700001601115700001601131700001401147700002001161700001801181773009501199856008401294852000901378655001201387IND60553617820221120125423.0161021e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055361782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2013.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Rebecca10aBiomolecular scaffolds for enhanced signaling and catalytic efficiency  ap. 59-68.  aProteins inherently are not designed to be standalone entities.

Several natural systems have been developed through evolution to co-localize the functional proteins of the same pathway in order to ensure efficient communication of signals or intermediates. This review focuses on some selected examples of where synthetic scaffolds inspired by nature have been used to enhance the overall biological pathway performance.

Still, understanding MNM environmental hazards and fates lags MNM industry growth. To catch up, keep pace, and influence future MNM safe design strategies, rapid safety assessments are needed. Bacteria are important ecological nanotoxicology targets to consider when assessing MNM safety: bacteria are exposed to MNMs in water, sewage, soils, and sediments, wherein they influence MNM fates; bacteria can also be impacted—with potential health and ecosystem consequences. Routinely using bacteria for assessing MNMs would promote effective management of the environmental risks of this rapidly growing industry, but appropriate protocols and policies for this assessment need to be instituted.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3aenvironmental hazards 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3ananomaterials 3arisk 3asafety assessment 3asediments 3asewage 3asoil 3awaste disposal1 aSchimel, Joshua P1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1022-66231 aGodwin, Hilary A0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2014 June, v. 27 p.73-78dElsevier Ltdx0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2013.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245009200210300001600302520103700318592002801355650001801383650001901401650001601420650001401436650001401450700002301464773011201487856008401599852000901683655001201692IND60746686520221120175409.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074668652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2021.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgoussar, Asmaâ1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0909-569410aEngineering the plant microbiota in the context of the theory of ecological communities  ap. 220-225.  aCrop-associated microorganisms are known to have a determining influence on crop growth and resistance to stresses. Indeed, microorganisms can deter pathogens, reduce stress levels, improve nutrition, and stimulate growth. However, the microbial communities associated with a plant are rarely optimal for agricultural needs. But how can we engineer crops-associated microbial communities? An interesting framework to address this question is the theory of ecological communities that stipulates four processes by which communities can change: 1) selection, 2) dispersal, 3) speciation and 4) ecological drift. Of these, speciation and dispersal can result in the addition of new species to the plant microbiota, whereas selection and drift can lead to the loss of species. We believe that if these mechanisms are sufficiently understood, they could be harnessed to purposefully engineer the crop microbiota. Here, we will discuss the recent efforts to modify the phenotype of plants that are aligned with these ecological processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3amicroorganisms 3anew species 3anutrition 3aphenotype1 aYergeau, Étienne,0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2021 Aug., v. 70 p.220-225dElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2021.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01303naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245012000170300001600290520025800306592002800564650002300592650002300615650002300638653002900661653001800690653001600708653002100724700002100745773013700766856007700903852000900980655001200989IND60521570720221121045417.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157072DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-01302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlingebiel, U.q(Uwe),10aBenzo(c)-1 λ4.2-thiazol, ein neues bicyclisches 10π-System/ Benzo(c)-1 λ4 ,2-thiazol. a New Bicyclic 10π-System  ap. 123-124.  aIn the reaction of lithiated N-(fluorodimethylsilyl)-2,4,6-trimethylaniline with bis(trimethylsilyl)-sulfurdiimide LiF is eliminated and a benzo(c)-1 λ⁴ ,2-thiazol is formed.

Using a pharmacologic approach, the objective of this study was to investigate the potential role of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) – a nuclear receptor that regulates vertebrate heart morphogenesis – in mediating TPP-induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish. We first revealed that static exposure of zebrafish from 5–72h post-fertilization (hpf) to TPP in the presence of non-toxic concentrations of an RAR antagonist (BMS493) significantly enhanced TPP-induced toxicity (relative to TPP alone), even though identical non-toxic BMS493 concentrations mitigated retinoic acid (RA)-induced toxicity. BMS493-mediated enhancement of TPP toxicity was not a result of differential TPP uptake or metabolism, as internal embryonic doses of TPP and diphenyl phosphate (DPP) – a primary TPP metabolite – were not different in the presence or absence of BMS493. Using real-time PCR, we then quantified the relative change in expression of cytochrome P450 26a1 (cyp26a1) – a major target gene for RA-induced RAR activation in zebrafish – and found that RA and TPP exposure resulted in a ∼5-fold increase and decrease in cyp26a1 expression, respectively, relative to vehicle-exposed embryos. To address whether TPP may interact with human RARs, we then exposed Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with chimeric human RARα-, RARβ-, or RARγ to TPP in the presence of RA, and found that TPP significantly inhibited RA-induced luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Overall, our findings suggest that zebrafish RARs may be involved in mediating TPP-induced developmental toxicity, a mechanism of action that may have relevance to humans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChinese hamsters 3aDanio rerio 3aanimal ovaries 3aantagonists 3abiphenyl 3achimerism 3acytochrome P-450 3adevelopmental toxicity 3aflame retardants 3agenes 3aheart 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amodels 3amorphogenesis 3aphosphates 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aretinoic acid 0aAHR 0aBMS4934 0acyp26a1 0aDMSO 0aDPP 0ahpf 0aMS-222 0aRA 0aRAR 0aTPP 0aRetinoic acid receptor 0aFlame retardant 0aTriphenyl phosphate 0aZebrafish1 aHipszer, Rachel A.1 aRaftery, Tara D.1 aChen, Albert1 aStapleton, Heather M.1 aVolz, David C.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 Apr., v. 161 p.221-230dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016300170300001600333520206700349592002802416650002002444650001902464650000902483650002802492650001102520650001002531650001002541650004302551650001102594650001002605650001802615650002602633650001802659650001002677650002902687650001302716651001002729651001102739653002302750653001502773653001902788653001002807653001102817653001002828700002102838700002502859700002302884700002202907700002002929700002402949773011302973856008603086852000903172655001203181IND60542849320221116161159.0190408e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054284932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldini, Mario10aDetermination of phorbol esters in seeds and leaves of Jatropha curcas and in animal tissue by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 268-276.  aIn order to improve the economic sustainability of the Jatropha-biofuel chain, seed cake detoxification and utilization of ‘non toxic’ Jatropa curcas accessions are the main activities pursued with the aim of using J. curcas seed cake in animal feed. Given this growing interest, a robust and reliable method for phorbol esters (PEs) determination is necessary. HPLC-UV is a well-established method to detect and quantify the PEs content in Jatropha seeds and related products, but it seems to be unsuitable for more complex matrices like Jatropha leaves and animal tissues, due to the presence of interfering compounds. The objective of this work was to develop and optimize a LC–MS/MS method for the quantitative determination of PEs in seeds and leaves of J. curcas L. plants from Ghana and Mexico and in liver (as an organ with the function of accumulation) from goats fed with PEs in their diet. The HPLC-UV analysis evidenced five chromatographic peaks in the toxic seed kernels corresponding to the factors C1, C2, C3, C6 and C4–C5, respectively, with a PEs concentration of about 5100μg/g (as TPA equivalent). No PEs related peaks were detected in Mexican kernel seeds while in the case of leaves and liver the analysis was hampered by the presence of interfering compounds. The toxic kernel seed extract was used as a standard solution for the PEs quantitation in leaves and liver samples by LC–MS/MS, with the standard addition method. The most intense MRM transitions used to quantify and qualify the PEs were: 675→311, 693→311, and 293→265 m/z. The LC–MS/MS method with a LOD and a LOQ of 0.07 and 0.21μg/g, respectively, resulted in more sensitivity and selectivity than the HPLC-UV method. All three MRM transitions were present in Ghanaian toxic kernel seed, while no peaks were present in the supposed non-toxic Mexican kernel seed. PEs concentration in the leaves of toxic Ghanaian accession resulted in about 1/10 of that in the kernel, while no PEs peaks were found in the J. curcas leaves from Mexico and in liver samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3aanimal tissues 3adiet 3aeconomic sustainability 3aesters 3afeeds 3agoats 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3aliver 3aoilseed cakes 3aquantitative analysis 3aseed extracts 3aseeds 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 3aGhana 3aMexico 0aJatropha curcas L. 0aHPLC-MS/MS 0aPhorbol esters 0aSeeds 0aLeaves 0aLiver1 aFerfuia, Claudio1 aBortolomeazzi, Renzo1 aVerardo, Giancarlo1 aPascali, Jennifer1 aPiasentier, Edi1 aFranceschi, Loretta0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 Aug., v. 59 p.268-276dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245002300171300001600194520082200210592002801032650002001060650001801080650001301098650001701111650001501128650001401143650001601157650001201173650002001185650001001205650001201215650001101227650001201238650002101250650001001271650001101281700002601292773009701318856008401415852000901499655001201508IND60553618220221120042128.0161021e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055361822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2013.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRennie, Emilie A10aXylan biosynthesis  ap. 100-107.  aPlant cells are surrounded by a rigid wall made up of cellulose microfibrils, pectins, hemicelluloses, and lignin. This cell wall provides structure and protection for plant cells. In grasses and in dicot secondary cell walls, the major hemicellulose is a polymer of β-(1,4)-linked xylose units called xylan. Unlike cellulose—which is synthesized by large complexes at the plasma membrane—xylan is synthesized by enzymes in the Golgi apparatus. Xylan synthesis thus requires the coordinated action and regulation of these synthetic enzymes as well as others that synthesize and transport substrates into the Golgi. Recent research has identified several genes involved in xylan synthesis, some of which have already been used in engineering efforts to create plants that are better suited for biofuel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGolgi apparatus 3aMagnoliopsida 3abiofuels 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acellulose 3aengineering 3aenzymes 3afuel production 3agenes 3agrasses 3alignin 3apectins 3aplant protection 3axylan 3axylose1 aScheller, Henrik Vibe0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2014 Apr., v. 26 p.100-107dElsevier Ltdx0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2013.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011100170300001300281520123900294592002801533650003601561650001701597650001101614650001201625650001401637650001301651650004301664650001501707650001601722650001401738650001701752650001101769650001101780650002501791653001401816653001901830653001901849653000901868653002201877700002701899700001501926700002101941700002801962700001901990700002802009700001602037773011102053856008602164852000902250655001202259IND60542849620221116161126.0190408e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054284962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.05.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Suhyoung10aMetabolite profiling of phenolics, anthocyanins and flavonols in cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata)  ap. 8-14.  aMetabolite profiling of phenolic acids, anthocyanidins and flavonols in Brassica oleracea var. capitata cultivated in the spring and fall seasons were evaluated. Phenolic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic and sinapic acid), anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin), and flavonols (quercetin and kaempferol) were identified and quantified by LC–MS and HPLC analyses. The total phenolic acid contents (10,633μg/gDW) were increased 6.3-fold in red cabbages; in contrast, phenolic acids were present in significantly higher levels in the outer parts of the green cabbages in the spring sowing than in those of the fall sowing. In the case of red cabbages, the phenolic acid levels in the outer parts were higher (3147.5μg/gDW), but the seasonal factor was not significant. Statistical analysis exhibited a significantly negative correlation between anthocyanidins and quercetin but exhibited a positive correlation between flavonols and phenolic acids in both cultivars. The most dramatic differences in the effect of the tissue position were analyzed by two-way MANOVA. The levels of anthocyanidins were 25–28% higher in the spring than those in the fall cabbages, whereas the contents were similar in the various tissue positions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea var. capitata 3aanthocyanins 3aautumn 3acabbage 3acultivars 3acyanidin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akaempferol 3ametabolites 3aquercetin 3asinapic acid 3asowing 3aspring 3astatistical analysis 0aFlavonols 0aAnthocyanidins 0aPhenolic acids 0aHPLC 0aBrassica oleracea1 aArasu, Mariadhas Valan1 aJiang, Nan1 aChoi, Seung-Hyun1 aLim, Y.

The failure to find further individuals in spite of numerous attempts has led several taxonomists to question its status as a distinct species. Using DNA from the P. makawai type specimen we performed a molecular phylogenetic analysis including samples from other tinkerbird species and, in particular, several subspecies of Yellow‐rumped Tinkerbird Pogoniulus bilineatus, of which several observers considered the P. makawai specimen an aberrant individual. Phylogenetic analyses of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA recovered P. makawai as being nested within a clade of Yellow‐rumped Tinkerbirds. Our results suggest that White‐chested Tinkerbird is not a distinct species but either a distinct subspecies or an aberrant form of Yellow‐rumped Tinkerbird; in either case a genetic basis for plumage differences cannot be ruled out. At present our limited nuclear DNA data do not suggest hybridization with another tinkerbird species. Finally, we suggest that further surveys are needed to determine the extent to which loci that may underpin the ‘makawai phenotype’ may persist in the region, as well as to ascertain the extent to which the P. makawai form itself, or the entire regional population of Yellow‐rumped Tinkerbirds, warrants subspecific status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosepalum 3aforests 3ahybridization 3aloci 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeny 3aplumage 3asurveys 3aZambia1 aNwankwo, Emmanuel C.1 aGonzalez, Juan Carlos T.0 tIbis.g2018 July, v. 160, no. 3 p.673-680dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.125973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001500150245007800165300001600243520167300259592002801932650001401960650002301974650002601997650001502023650001002038650001102048650001602059700001302075700001302088700001602101773010002117856008602217852000902303655001202312IND4450488320221118085425.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445048832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, G.10aAnalysis of radio frequency (RF) power distribution in dry food materials  ap. 548-556.  aThe objectives of this research were to investigate the influence of various factors on radio frequency (RF) power distribution in dry food materials, placed in a 12kW, 27.12MHz parallel plate RF system, using a validated finite element computer model. The factors investigated were sample size, shape, relative position between the RF electrodes, and dielectric properties (DPs) of the sample and the surrounding medium. Effects of electrode gap and top electrode configuration on the RF power distribution behavior of the sample were also studied. The RF power uniformity in the samples was compared using RF power density uniformity index (PUI). Simulated results showed that the RF power uniformity in cuboid shaped samples, placed on the bottom electrode, first decreased and then increased with the increase in sample size. The sample shape and its vertical position between the fixed gap parallel plate electrodes also affected the RF power distribution and uniformity. A cuboid sample had higher RF power densities at the edges, while an ellipsoid had higher power densities in the center parts. Simulated results showed that the smaller values of DPs resulted in better RF power uniformities in the samples. Reducing the electrode gap improved the RF power uniformity of the sample. While studying the influence of the top electrode configuration on the RF power distribution and uniformity, the results showed that optimum RF power uniformity in a particular sample size could be achieved with a particular top electrode bending position and angle. The results are useful in understanding complex RF heating, designing and scaling up of efficient RF systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3adielectric heating 3adielectric properties 3aelectrodes 3afoods 3amodels 3aradio waves1 aWang, S.1 aTang, J.1 aBirla, S.L.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2011 June, v. 104, no. 4 p.548-556dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245013100206300001800337520106600355592002801421650004401449650002201493650001301515650001601528650001801544650001701562700006501579700005901644773011901703856008401822852000901906655001201915IND60634931520190422000000.0190326e20190307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063493152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.8b021682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzo, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3375-311910aChemical Stabilization of Hexanal Molecules by Inclusion as Guests of Nanoporous-Crystalline Syndiotactic Polystyrene Crystals  ap. 2255-2264.  aChemical stabilization of air-unstable molecules, by their inclusion as guest of nanoporous-crystalline phases of syndiotactic polystyrene (s-PS), is for the first time revealed. FTIR analyses show that antimicrobial hexanal molecules are chemically stable for months when guest of s-PS cocrystalline phases, while they easily oxidize to hexanoic acid when they are simply dissolved in polymer amorphous phases. Formation of s-PS/hexanal cocrystalline forms is clearly demonstrated by polarized FTIR spectra and by X-ray diffraction patterns. Chemical stabilization is observed for hexanal molecules being guest of both nanoporous-crystalline forms of s-PS, i.e., for guest molecules isolated in the cavities of δ form or aligned along the channels of ε form. Films exhibiting s-PS/hexanal clathrate forms are able not only to chemically stabilize the antimicrobial molecules but also to give their long-term release (with a diffusivity close to 2 × 10–¹⁴ cm² s–¹). Possible mechanisms of chemical stabilization by clathrate formation are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystals 3adiffusivity 3ahexanoic acid 3apolystyrenes1 aCozzolino, Antonietta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0301-61901 aGuerra, Gaetano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1576-93840 tMacromolecules.g2019 Mar. 07, v. 52, no. 6 p.2255-2264dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b021683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002300183245005500206300002000261506007600281520073900357592002801096506003701124650002101161650001401182650002201196650001101218650001201229650000901241650001101250700002001261700001901281700001801300700002101318700002001339700001901359773013501378856007801513852000901591655001201600IND60549148220221207090900.0160907e20160907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054914822DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b071722doi7 aPMC50168062pmcid7 a275486962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToriyama, Fumihiko10aRedox-Active Esters in Fe-Catalyzed C–C Coupling  ap. 11132-11135.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCross-couplings of alkyl halides and organometallic species based on single electron transfer using Ni and Fe catalyst systems have been studied extensively, and separately, for decades.

This work is placed in context by showing a direct comparison with a Ni catalyst for >40 examples spanning a range of primary, secondary, and tertiary substrates.

The addition of leaf during oil extraction increased oil yield and extractability index by 97% compared to the control oil. The addition of leaf during extraction increased the concentration of pigments in oils, and the oil positive sensory attributes intensities, such as fruitiness and green grass/leaf notes. The influence on oil phenolic composition was dependent on the amount of leaf added. When 1% leaf was added, most of the phenolic compounds were preserved, while the addition of leaf at 5% decreased the concentration of the majority of phenols, especially secoiridoids by 45% compared to the control oil. The addition of leaf slightly increased the concentration of fatty acid ethyl esters and waxes in the oils. The obtained results indicate that particular importance should be given to the amount of olive leaf present in olive paste during oil extraction, since it apparently can increase the extractability of oil, but can also have negative effects on phenolic composition when added in excess.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3achemical composition 3acultivars 3afatty acids 3agrasses 3aleaves 3aoils 3aolives 3asecoiridoids1 aKlisović, Dora 1 aLukić, Igor 1 aLukić, Marina 1 aBrkić Bubola, Karolina 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Sept. 24, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111009173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245010300203506007600306520169700382592002802079506003702107650002102144650002502165650001702190650001402207650001702221650001302238650001702251650001702268650002002285650001802305650001402323650001202337650001602349650001302365650004302378650001602421650002302437650001002460650002402470650002002494650001702514700001802531700002102549700002202570700002802592700002102620700002502641700002302666700002202689700002302711773011802734856007602852852000902928655001202937IND60660464520221207094720.0190823e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066046452DNAL7 a10.3390/foods80803072doi7 aPMC67226102pmcid7 a313749432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadane, Pratap 10aDrumstick (<i>Moringa oleifera</i>) Flower as an Antioxidant Dietary Fibre in Chicken Meat Nuggets  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present work investigated the efficacy of Moringa flower (MF) extract to develop a functional chicken product. Three groups of cooked chicken nuggets&mdash;control (C), T1 (with 1% MF) and T2 (2% MF)&mdash;were elaborated and their physicochemical, nutritional, storage stability and sensory attributes were assessed during refrigerated storage at 4 &deg;C up to 20 days. In addition, MF extracts were characterised in terms of chemical composition, total phenolic content and its components using high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD), dietary fibre and antioxidant capacity. MF contained high protein (17.87 &plusmn; 0.28 dry matter), dietary fibre (36.14 &plusmn; 0.77 dry matter) and total phenolics (18.34 &plusmn; 1.16 to 19.49 &plusmn; 1.35 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry matter) content. The treated nuggets (T1 and T2) had significantly enhanced cooking yield, emulsion stability, ash, protein, total phenolics and dietary fibre compared to control. Incorporation of MF extract at 2% not only significantly reduced the redness/increased the lightness, but also decreased the hardness, gumminess and chewiness of the product compared to control. Moreover, the addition of MF extract significantly improved the oxidative stability and odour scores by reducing lipid oxidation during storage time. Sensory attributes of nuggets were not affected by the addition of MF extract and the products remained stable and acceptable even on 15th day of storage. These results showed that MF extract could be considered as an effective natural functional ingredient for quality improvement and reducing lipid oxidation in cooked chicken nuggets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMoringa oleifera 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achewiness 3achicken meat 3achickens 3acold storage 3acooked foods 3acooking quality 3adietary fiber 3aemulsions 3aflowers 3agallic acid 3ahardness 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aingredients 3alipid peroxidation 3aodors 3aoxidative stability 3astorage quality 3astorage time1 aDas, Arun  K.1 aPateiro, Mirian 1 aNanda, Pramod  K.1 aBandyopadhyay, Samiran 1 aJagtap, Prasant 1 aBarba, Francisco  J.1 aShewalkar, Akshay 1 aMaity, Banibrata 1 aLorenzo, José M.,0 tFoods.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods80803073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04199naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002900168245023600197300001600433520198200449592002802431650001602459650001402475650001202489650000902501650001802510650002402528650001902552650001002571650001202581650001602593650002602609650000902635650001102644650001602655650001102671650001302682650001702695650001202712650003702724650002202761650008102783650001102864650000902875650002602884650003602910650002202946650003602968650003003004650003703034650002903071650004103100650002603141651001303167651001303180700002403193700002303217700002603240700002803266700001903294773009403313856008503407852000903492655001203501IND4475335120221119170131.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447533512DNAL7 a217816542pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadureira, Tânia Vieira14aThe toxicity potential of pharmaceuticals found in the Douro River estuary (Portugal): Assessing impacts on gonadal maturation with a histopathological and stereological study of zebrafish ovary and testis after sub-acute exposures  ap. 292-299.  aConcerns associated with pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems demand the establishment of links between xenobiotics and their respective concentrations and impacts on aquatic organisms. Herein, effects of non-steroidal pharmaceuticals in the gonadal maturation of zebrafish (Danio rerio) were evaluated by histopathological and stereological analyses after 21 days of exposure. Carbamazepine, fenofibric acid, propranolol, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were selected, considering their detection in the Douro estuary (Portugal). Exposures were performed with single compounds and mixtures, the exposure concentrations including environmental levels. Overall, quantitative analyses showed a decreasing trend for late maturation stages in male and female gametogenesis with parallel increases in immature gametes. In females, and at the highest concentration mixture, a significant switch between the volume densities of late/mature oocytes versus primary oocytes was observed. On the verge of statistical significance, oocyte atresia was higher in both mixtures (5.75±4.02% for MXA and 5.65±5.27% for MXB) versus control (2.21±1.88%), in accordance with the histological identification of large atretic areas in some fish. Unlike females, males showed significant effects with single exposures. Spermatozoa in controls totalled 53.25±7.13% of the testis volume, decreasing with carbamazepine (47.19±5.30%), fenofibric acid (46.36±4.30%), propranolol (37.22±2.38%) and sulfametoxazole (39.37±5.15%). An increase in spermatocyte percentage was noted with propranolol (40.13±7.36%) and sulfametoxazole (40.84±1.66%) versus control (30.93±6.53%). The changes in maturation dynamics did not impact the gonadosomatic index. The results show that pharmaceuticals from various therapeutic classes can disrupt the maturation dynamics of fish ovaries and testes. Further studies are justified to tackle the underlying mechanisms and to gauge the full extent of effects/risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aestuaries 3afemales 3afish 3agametogenesis 3agonadosomatic index 3ahistopathology 3amales 3aoocytes 3apropranolol 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk 3arivers 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atoxicity 3atrimethoprim 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Combinations 2aDrug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactionsxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aOocytesxdrug effects 2aOvaryxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSexual Maturationxdrug effects 2aSpermatozoaxdrug effects 2aTestisxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aToxicity Tests, Subacute 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 2aZebrafishxphysiology 3aPortugal 0aPortugal1 aRocha, Maria João,1 aCruzeiro, Catarina1 aGalante, Maria Helena1 aMonteiro, Rogério A.F.1 aRocha, Eduardo0 tAquatic toxicology.g2011 Oct., v. 105, no. 3-4 p.292-299dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04740naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015100171300001400322500001500336520288000351592002803231650002103259650001003280650000903290650002103299650001603320650001003336650001503346650001203361650001403373650003103387650002103418650001503439650004303454650001103497650002503508650002903533650001203562650002503574650001403599650001703613650001003630650000903640650001103649651001103660653002203671653001403693653003103707653001503738653004003753653002003793653002603813700002203839700002503861700002103886773010003907856008604007852000904093655001204102IND60535902220221123021247.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053590222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDefo, Michel A.10aTranscriptional and biochemical markers in transplanted Perca flavescens to characterize cadmium- and copper-induced oxidative stress in the field  ap. 39-53.  a2019-12-06  aDespite recent progress achieved in elucidating the mechanisms underlying local adaptation to pollution, little is known about the evolutionary change that may be occurring at the molecular level. The goal of this study was to examine patterns of gene transcription and biochemical responses induced by metal accumulation in clean yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and metal depuration in contaminated fish in a mining and smelting region of Canada. Fish were collected from a reference lake (lake Opasatica) and a Cd, Cu and Zn contaminated lake (lake Dufault) located in the Rouyn-Noranda region (Qc, Canada) and caged for one or four weeks in their own lake or transplanted in the other lake. Free-ranging fish from the same lakes were also collected. Kidney Cd and Cu concentrations in clean fish caged in the contaminated lake increased with the time of exposure, but metal depuration did not occur in contaminated fish caged in the clean lake. After 4 weeks, the major retinoid metabolites analysed, the percentage of free dehydroretinol (dROH) and the retinol dehydrogenase-2 (rdh-2) transcription level in liver decreased in clean fish transplanted into the metal-contaminated lake, suggesting that metal exposure negatively impacted retinoid metabolism. However, we observed an increase in almost all of the retinoid parameters analysed in fish from the metal-impacted lake caged in the same lake, which we interpret as an adaptation response to higher ambient metal concentration. In support of this hypothesis, liver transcription levels of microsomal glutathione-S-transferase-3 (mgst-3) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh) were enhanced in clean fish transplanted into the metal-contaminated lake and this up-regulation was accompanied by an increase in the activities of corresponding enzymes, involved in antioxidant response. However, although in the same fish the transcription level of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn sod) was also increased, this did not lead to a change in the activity of the SOD enzyme, suggesting that this upregulation was aimed at maintaining SOD-related antioxidant capacities. In contrast, the transcription level of the cat gene, which did not change in contaminated fish, did not compensate for the decrease of CAT activity. After 4 weeks of exposure, some plastic responses of the clean fish were observed when they were transplanted in the metal-contaminated lake. However, probably as a consequence of the prior 80 years of exposure to metals, the contaminated population showed a limited plastic response in the expression of the majority of the candidate genes tested, when they were transplanted in the reference lake.The overall findings of this field investigation highlight how yellow perch molecularly and biochemically responded to a sudden or relatively long-term exposure (4 weeks) to a cocktail of metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerca flavescens 3agenes 3afish 3aoxidative stress 3ametabolites 3alakes 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3apollution 3agene expression regulation 3achronic exposure 3ametabolism 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3acopper 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription (genetics) 3akidneys 3aantioxidant activity 3avitamin A 3aantioxidants 3aliver 3azinc 3amining 3aCanada 0aPlasticity traits 0aWild fish 0aReciprocal transplantation 0aBiomarkers 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase 0aMetal pollution 0aGenomic reaction norm1 aBernatchez, Louis1 aCampbell, Peter G.C.1 aCouture, Patrice0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 May, v. 162 p.39-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01430naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245021200163300001800375520032000393592002800713650001100741650004400752650001500796653003600811653003400847653003300881773014000914856007701054852000901131655001201140IND60521571320221121060307.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157132DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-10032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchäfer, Hans,10aÜbergangsmetallphosphidokomplexe, III [1] Neuartige Nickel-Phosphor-Drei-und Vierringkomplexe / Transition Metal Phosphido Complexes, III [1] Novel Nickel Phosphorus Three-, and Four-Membered Ring Complexes  ap. 1358-1361.  a(R₃P)₂NiCl₂ and LiP(SiMe₃)₂ react in a complex reaction sequence finally yielding (R₃P)₂Ni(PSiMe₃)₂ (5), containing a three-membered PNiP ring system, and [R₃PNiP(SiMe₃)₂]₂ (6), containing a (PNi)₂ four-membered ring system with a nickel-nickel bond, respectively.

This organic fertilizer is increasingly used in agriculture and horticulture as an alternative to mineral fertilizers. Research has investigated the use of vermicompost made from the waste mass of sugar beet pulp as a soil additive in the cultivation of peas (Pisum sativum L.). Experimentally, five treatments consisted of: a heavy clay soil as control (SL); the same soil with 10, 25, and 50% substitution of vermicompost, (V10, V25, and V50, respectively); and a standard peat-based horticulture substrate (GS) for comparison. Analyzed pea characteristics and the content of macro and microelements in their biomass were most favorably influenced by 25 and 50% vermicompost addition, and the values obtained were similar to those in the GS treatment. The lowest values of analyzed traits for P. sativum were found in the SL group. Thus, appropriate addition of vermicompost in the construction of plant growing substrates can reduce the use of inorganic fertilizers and be an alternative to peat in the medium, contributing to reduced use of this valuable environmental resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aagriculture 3abiomass 3aclay soils 3ahorticulture 3aorganic wastes 3apeas 3apeat 3asugar beet pulp 3asustainable technology 3avermicomposting 3avermicomposts1 aMazur-Pączka, Anna 1 aGarczyńska, Mariola 1 aHajduk, Edmund 1 aKostecka, Joanna 1 aBartkowska, Izabela 1 aButt, Kevin R.0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Sept. 25, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111009193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010400170300001600274520124000290592002801530650004401558650002201602650003701624650001901661650001501680650001501695650001201710650001401722650002301736650001101759650001101770650001701781650001201798650001801810650001701828650001101845650002701856650001601883650003701899653001601936653001601952653002601968653001201994653000802006653001102014653000902025653000702034653000802041653000802049653001002057653000802067653001202075653001302087700001802100700002502118700002302143700002402166700002202190700002002212700001702232700002402249773009602273856008402369852000902453655001202462IND60603797020221123003533.0180716e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060379702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiittonen, Toni10aContinuous liquid-phase valorization of bio-ethanol towards bio-butanol over metal modified alumina  ap. 369-378.  aCommercial mixed-phase aluminum oxide was used as a heterogeneous catalyst support, providing slightly basic properties which are well-suited for the condensation of bio-ethanol to C4 hydrocarbons, such as 1-butanol. Different metals (Cu, Ni and Co), at various metal loadings were deposited on the support. Consequently, the catalytic reactions were carried out in a continuous laboratory-scale fixed bed reactor operated at 240 °C and 70 bar. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, TEM, FT-IR, XPS and ICP-OES. Different metals were found to give entirely different product distributions. With the best catalysts, the selectivities towards 1-butanol close to 70% were reached, while the ethanol conversion typically varied between 10 and 30% – strongly depending on the metal applied. It was observed that low loading of copper and high loading of nickel were responsible for the formation of 1-butanol, whereas cobalt and high loading of copper resulted in the production of ethyl acetate. The reaction was found to be extremely sensitive to catalyst preparation conditions and procedures such as metal loading, calcination/reduction temperature and, thereby, to the formation of corresponding crystallite structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3abiobutanol 3abioethanol 3abutanol 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acopper 3acrystallites 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3ahydrocarbons 3anickel 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aBio-ethanol 0aBio-butanol 0aCrystallite structure 0aAlumina 0aABE 0aGC-FID 0aHPLC 0aGC 0aTEM 0aXRD 0aFT-IR 0aXPS 0aICP-OES 0aUV–Vis1 aEränen, Kari1 aMäki-Arvela, Päivi1 aShchukarev, Andrey1 aRautio, Anne-Riikka1 aKordas, Krisztian1 aKumar, Narendra1 aSalmi, Tapio1 aMikkola, Jyri-Pekka0 tRenewable energy.g2015 Feb., v. 74 p.369-378dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245012600206500002200332520162200354592002801976650002202004650001202026650001802038650001502056650001302071650001102084650000902095650002602104650002102130650002302151650000902174650001402183650001802197650001402215650001202229650004302241650001802284650001402302653002202316653002502338653001202363653001002375653001402385653002202399700001902421700005602440700001702496700001902513700001402532700001902546700001602565773007102581856008502652852000902737655001202746IND60559599320221121130849.0161216s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055959932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchares, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3217-289X10aChicken line-dependent mortality after experimental infection with three type IIxIII recombinant Toxoplasma gondii clones  aPre-press version  aThree genetically different clones of Toxoplasma gondii, also different in mouse virulence, were studied by experimental infection in chickens. For the experiments, four chicken lines were used, which differed in phylogenetic origin and performance level: two white egg layer lines, one with high laying performance (WLA), one with low (R11) and two brown layer lines, also displaying high (BLA) and low (L68) egg number. Chickens were intraperitoneally infected with three different T. gondii isolates representing type IIxIII recombinant clones, i.e. showing both, type II- and type III-specific alleles. These clones (K119/2 2C10, B136/1 B6H6, K119/2 A7) had exhibited virulence differences in a mouse model. In chickens, a significantly higher mortality was observed in white layer lines, but not in brown layer lines, suggesting that differences in the phylogenetic background may influence the susceptibility of chickens for toxoplasmosis. In addition, antibody (IgY) levels varied in surviving chickens at 31 days post infection. While low to intermediate antibody levels were observed in white layers, intermediate to high levels were measured in brown layers. Infection with a T. gondii clone showing low chicken virulence resulted in higher antibody levels in all chicken lines compared to infection with T. gondii clones of intermediate or high chicken virulence. This was in agreement with the parasite load as determined by real-time PCR. Overall, results show that progeny resulting from natural sexual recombination of T. gondii clonal lineages, may differ in their virulence for mice and chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aalleles 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3achickens 3aclones 3aeggs 3agenetic recombination 3aimmunoglobulin Y 3alaying performance 3amice 3amortality 3aparasite load 3aphylogeny 3aprogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atoxoplasmosis 3avirulence 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aSexual recombination 0aChicken 0aMouse 0aVirulence 0aAntibody response1 aHerrmann, D.C.1 aMaksimov, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9457-06581 aMatzkeit, B.1 aConraths, F.J.1 aMoré, G.1 aPreisinger, R.1 aWeigend, S.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245017500210300001400385520156000399592002801959650003001987650001002017650001202027650001102039650002202050650002402072650001602096650001102112650001302123650001902136650001502155650001702170650002602187653000702213653000702220653000702227653000802234653000702242653000802249653003002257653003002287653002302317653002602340653002502366653001902391700001802410700002102428700002102449700002002470773010002490856008602590852000902676655001202685IND60535902520221123043944.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053590252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorkaric, Muris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9349-189410aMultiple stressor effects in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii – Toward understanding mechanisms of interaction between effects of ultraviolet radiation and chemical pollutants  ap. 18-28.  aThe effects of chemical pollutants and environmental stressors, such as ultraviolet radiation (UVR), can interact when organisms are simultaneously exposed, resulting in higher (synergistic) or lower (antagonistic) multiple stressor effects than expected based on the effects of single stressors. Current understanding of interactive effects is limited due to a lack of mechanism-based multiple stressor studies. It has been hypothesized that effect interactions may generally occur if chemical and non-chemical stressors cause similar physiological effects in the organism. To test this hypothesis, we exposed the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to combinations of UVR and single chemicals displaying modes of action (MOA) similar or dissimilar to the impact of UVR on photosynthesis. Stressor interactions were analyzed based on the independent action model. Effect interactions were found to depend on the MOA of the chemicals, and also on their concentrations, the exposure time and the measured endpoint. Indeed, only chemicals assumed to cause effects on photosynthesis similar to UVR showed interactions with UVR on photosynthetic yield: synergistic in case of Cd(II) and paraquat and antagonistic in case of diuron. No interaction on photosynthesis was observed for S-metolachlor, which acts dissimilarly to UVR. However, combined effects of S-metolachlor and UVR on algal reproduction were synergistic, highlighting the importance of considering additional MOA of UVR. Possible mechanisms of stressor effect interactions are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aalgae 3acadmium 3adiuron 3aexposure duration 3amechanism of action 3ametolachlor 3amodels 3aparaquat 3aphotosynthesis 3apollutants 3areproduction 3aultraviolet radiation 0aCI 0aDR 0aIA 0aMOA 0aPQ 0aUVR 0aMultiple stressor effects 0aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 0aIndependent action 0aUltraviolet radiation 0aMode of toxic action 0aPhotosynthesis1 aBehra, Renata1 aFischer, Beat B.1 aJunghans, Marion1 aEggen, Rik I.L.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2015 May, v. 162 p.18-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2015.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245014800163300001800311520057300329592002800902650002300930650002300953650002200976653001500998653001401013653001601027653001601043653002201059773015301081856007701234852000901311655001201320IND60521571620221120100057.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052157162DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1979-10062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMewis, Albrecht10aDarstellung und Struktur der Verbindungen MgCuP, BaCuP(As) und BaAgP(As) / Preparation and Crystal Structure of MgCuP, BaCuP(As), and BaAgP(As)  ap. 1373-1376.  aThe ABX-compounds MgCuP, BaCuP(As) and BaAgP(As) have been prepared and their structures determined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of dogs that underwent percutaneous ultrasound‐guided fine‐needle aspiration of adrenal gland lesions between August 2014 and December 2016. Nineteen dogs were identified, with three undergoing bilateral adrenal gland aspiration and one dog undergoing aspiration twice, yielding 23 cytology samples in total. Data collected included signalment, concurrent medical conditions, current medications, blood pressure and heart rate before adrenal fine‐needle aspiration, imaging characteristics of the adrenal gland lesions and any clinically apparent procedure‐related complications. RESULTS: Phaeochromocytoma was diagnosed in nine of 19 dogs, including one dog with bilateral phaeochromocytoma. One dog developed ventricular tachycardia following aspiration of an adrenal gland lesion cytologically consistent with a phaeochromocytoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Percutaneous ultrasound‐guided fine‐needle aspiration of adrenal gland lesions appears to be relatively safe, even in phaeochromocytoma, but further data are required to lend more weight to this finding. Minimally invasive aspirates could be considered as part of the diagnostic algorithm in the investigation of an incidentally detected adrenal gland lesion of uncertain clinical significance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal glands 3aalgorithms 3ablood pressure 3acell biology 3adata collection 3adogs 3aheart rate 3ahistopathology 3aimage analysis 3amedical records 3apatients 3arisk 3atachycardia 3aultrasonography1 aLacorcia, L.1 aRose, A.

Home-delivered meals may be beneficial in improving their health and facilitating independent living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify the association between home-delivered meals and use of hospital services. METHODS: This study includes 120 clients recently discharged from an inpatient hospital stay or from an emergency department (ED) visit who received meal services from Meals On Wheels, Inc., of Tarrant County. Healthcare utilization data was extracted from the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council Foundation, a regional all claims database used by over 90% of hospitals in Dallas-Fort Worth area. Signed tests and generalized linear models (GLM) were performed. RESULTS: A total of 16,959 meals were delivered from March 2013 through March 2014. Each client received an average of 6.19 meals per week. The average number of ED visits decreased from 5.03 before receipt of meals to 1.45 after receipt of meals, z = -5.23, p <.001. The average number of hospitalizations decreased from 1.33 to.83, z = -7.29, p <.001. The average length of stay per hospitalization decreased from 5.47 days to 2.34 days, z = -5.84, p <.001. Clients who received more meals were less likely to experience ED visits and hospitalizations after controlling for demographic characteristics and levels of physical functioning. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that home-delivered meals services may contribute to a reduction in hospital based care services among frail and vulnerable adults. Additional studies should consider the short and long-term effects of home-delivered meals services on healthcare utilization and the potential to decrease healthcare costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeals on Wheels program 3aadults 3adatabases 3ademography 3ahealth care costs 3ahospitals 3alinear models 3along term effects 3apatients 3arisk 3aTexas1 aThorud, J.L.1 aMarishak-Simon, S.1 aHammack, L.1 aStevens, A.B.0 tjournal of nutrition, health & aging.g2018 Apr., v. 22, no. 4 p.519-525dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl4279172x1279-77077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-017-0973-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013600170300001600306520109200322592002801414650001501442650001301457650004001470650001501510650001501525650002001540650002001560650001701580650003501597650002101632650002501653650001901678650001501697650001601712650001601728650001401744650001701758653003901775653002401814653001901838653002701857653001501884700002001899700002701919700005701946773017202003856008502175852000902260655001202269IND60557538320221121043425.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055753832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Chan I.,10aDevelopment of a fluorescent protein-antibody Förster resonance energy transfer probe for the detection and imaging of osteocalcin  ap. 272-276.  aFluorescence-based biosensor probes, especially those based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent protein (FP) variants, are widely used to monitor various biological phenomena, often detecting ligand-induced association of the receptor domains. While antibodies are fertile sources of specific receptors for various biomolecules, their potential has not been fully exploited. In this study, we used a fluorescent probe comprising FP-fused antibody variable region fragments to detect a bone metabolism biomarker, osteocalcin (BGP), by using fluorescence spectrometry/microscopy. Because the association between the two proteins increases in the presence of antigen BGP or its C-terminal peptide, the increased antigen in a sample can be monitored as a FRET efficiency increase, based on the open sandwich fluoroimmunoassay principle. The results clearly indicated that the FP-antibody FRET probe could be used as a diagnostic reagent to measure levels of BGP in the clinically relevant concentration range and to image BGP produced from live osteoblast cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiological properties and phenomena 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3abone metabolism 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorescent proteins 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3areceptors 3aspectroscopy 0aFörster resonance energy transfer 0aFluorescent protein 0aNoncompetitive 0aHomogenous immunoassay 0aBioimaging1 aMakino, Ryōji,1 aOhmuro-Matsuyama, Yuki1 aUeda, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8849-42170 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2017 Feb., v. 123, no. 2 p.272-276dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2016.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014200163300001600305520124600321592002801567653001801595653002701613653001301640653000801653653001101661653004901672653002301721653002901744700001801773700001801791700001401809700001901823773016601842856008202008852000902090655001202099IND60517077620221121043024.0190728e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051707762DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140014412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTariche, O.10aAge estimation and growth pattern of the grouper Cephalopholis taeniops (Epinephelidae) off the Cape Verde Archipelago, north-west Africa  ap. 599-609.  aThe grouper Cephalopholis taeniops is a carnivorous fish of the Cape Verde coastal marine ecosystem. Nothing is known regarding the age and growth of this epinephelid. In this study, the age and growth of C. taeniops was investigated by annual growth increment counts from 2804 specimens (7–51 cm total length) collected between January 2005 and December 2011. Whole otoliths underestimated the age indicated in sections by approximately 70%; therefore, sectioned otoliths were used in this study. A year's growth was represented by one opaque and one translucent ring. There was no apparent time lag from the start of the increase in the seawater temperature and the beginning of the formation of the opaque ring. The formation of the translucent rings coincided with a decrease in surface seawater temperature. Cephalopholis taeniops is a slow-growing and long-lived species, with ages of up to 20 years recorded. The seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth function was the best fitted among the four models tested, with an Akaike weight higher than 0.99. Growth was described by the seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth function as follows: L∞ = 54.26 cm, k = 0.135 year⁻¹, t₀ = −0.853 year, C = 0.439 and tₛ = 0.667.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEpinephelidae 0aCephalopholis taeniops 0aotoliths 0aage 0agrowth 0aseasonalized von Bertalanffy growth function 0aCape Verde Islands 0aEastern Central Atlantic1 aPajuelo, J.G.1 aLorenzo, J.M.1 aLuque, A.1 aGonzalez, J.A.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2015 May, v. 95, no. 3 p.599-609dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140014413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245009100177300001500268500001900283520105900302592002801361650002101389650001801410650001401428650001601442650002201458650001801480650001101498653001001509653002601519653001001545653003801555653001301593653001301606653002201619700002601641700001901667700002301686700003401709700001901743700002901762700002501791773008801816856008301904990002301987852000902010655001202019IND60697476220221119195404.0200605e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCobos Jiménez, Viviana10aG3BP1 restricts HIV-1 replication in macrophages and T-cells by sequestering viral RNA  ap. 94-104.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHIV-1 exploits the cellular machinery for replication and therefore several interactions with cellular factors take place, some of which are yet unknown. We identified GTPase-activating protein-(SH3 domain)-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) as a cellular factor that restricts HIV-1, by analyzing transcriptome profiles of in vitro-cytokine-activated macrophages that are non-permissive to HIV-1 replication. Silencing of G3BP1 by RNA interference resulted in increased HIV-1 replication in primary T-cells and macrophages, but did not affect replication of other retroviruses. G3BP1 specifically interacted with HIV-1 RNA in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it sequesters viral transcripts, thus preventing translation or packaging. G3BP1 was highly expressed in resting naïve or memory T-cells from healthy donors and HIV-1 infected patients, but significantly lower in IL-2-activated T-cells. These results strongly suggest that G3BP1 captures HIV-1 RNA transcripts and thereby restricts mRNA translation, viral protein production and virus particle formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytoplasm 3amacrophages 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscriptome 3avirion 0aHIV-1 0aMacrophage activation 0aG3BP1 0aMacrophage transcriptome profiles 0aIFNgamma 0aTNFalpha 0aActivated T-cells1 aMartinez, Fernando O.1 aBooiman, Thijs1 avan Dort, Karel A.1 avan de Klundert, Maarten A.A.1 aGordon, Siamon1 aGeijtenbeek, Teunis B.H.1 aKootstra, Neeltje A.0 tVirology.g2015 Dec., v. 486 p.94-104dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.09.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009200165300001600257520147900273592002801752596012301780596005901903596007101962596006702033650002502100650001202125650002502137650001102162650002602173650002102199650001002220650002602230650002802256650001102284650001102295650001102306650001102317700002002328700002002348700001902368700002502387700002002412700001802432773010602450856008302556852000902639655001202648IND60725503720221119181231.0210716e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072550372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-020-01592-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Ya-Fan10aSpatiotemporal Changes in the Bacterial Community of the Meromictic Lake Uchum, Siberia  ap. 357-369.  aLake Uchum is a newly defined meromictic lake in Siberia with clear seasonal changes in its mixolimnion. This study characterized the temporal dynamics and vertical profile of bacterial communities in oxic and anoxic zones of the lake across all four seasons: October (autumn), March (winter), May (spring), and August (summer). Bacterial richness and diversity in the anoxic zone varied widely between time points. Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum throughout the oxic and anoxic zones across all four seasons. Alphaproteobacteria (Loktanella) and Gammaproteobacteria (Aliidiomarina) exhibited the highest abundance in the oxic and anoxic zone, respectively. Furthermore, there was a successional shift in sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in the anoxic zone across the seasons. The most dominant SRB, Desulfonatronovibrio sp., is likely one of the main producers of hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and typically accumulates the most H₂S in winter. The representative anoxygenic phototrophic bacterial group in Lake Uchum was purple sulfur bacteria (PSB). PSB were dominant (60.76%) in summer, but only had 0.2–1.5% relative abundance from autumn to spring. Multivariate analysis revealed that the abundance of these SRB and PSB correlated to the concentration of H₂S in Lake Uchum. Taken together, this study provides insights into the relationships between changes in bacterial community and environmental features in Lake Uchum.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 19-05-00428cРоссийский Фонд Фундаментальных Исследований (РФФИ) (RU)  aNo. 18-45-243002cKrasnoyarsk Regional Fund of Science  a105-2923-B-001-001-MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan  a108-2811-M-001-603cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 3aDesulfonatronovibrio 3aSiberia 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3aautumn 3abacterial communities 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alakes 3amultivariate analysis 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3aspring 3asulfur 3asummer 3awinter1 aChiang, Pei-Wen1 aTandon, Kshitij1 aRogozin, Denis1 aDegermendzhi, Andrey1 aZykov, Vladimir1 aTang, Sen-Lin0 tMicrobial ecology.g2021 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.357-369dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01592-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011000167500001400277520193300291592002802224650001502252650002502267650001702292650001402309650002402323650002002347650001002367650001202377650001402389650001102403650001902414650001502433650001302448650005302461650001502514650001902529650001402548653001002562653000902572653001202581653001002593653001802603653001802621653002302639700001902662700001402681700001902695700005802714773008802772856008302860852000902943655001202952IND60704808420221119211611.0201024e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070480842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2020.1449812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Fangting10aIsolation, identification, expression and subcellular localization of PPARG gene in buffalo mammary gland  aNAL-light  aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), as a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. In this study, the transcripts of PPARG gene were isolated and identified in buffalo mammary gland. The results showed that two types of transcripts (PPARG1 and PPARG2) of PPARG gene produced by alternative 5′ end use were expressed in buffalo mammary gland, and each of them had four different alternative splicing variants. The PPARG1 includes PPARG1a, PPARG1b, PPARG1c and PPARG1d, while the PPARG2 contains PPARG2a, PPARG2b, PPARG2c and PPARG2d. Among them, only PPARG1a, PPARG2a and PPARG2d can encode complete functional proteins with three complete functional domains, and the rest encode truncated proteins with incomplete functional domains. All the eight variants of PPARG protein do not contain transmembrane regions and signal peptides, but their conserved domain, secondary and tertiary structure and subcellular localization were different. Subcellular localization confirmed that the main transcripts PPARG1a and PPARG2a played a functional role in the nucleus, which was consistent with the results by in silico prediction. RT-qPCR analysis of buffalo mammary tissue showed that the mRNA expression levels of PPARG1 and PPARG2 in lactation were higher than those in non-lactation, and the expression levels of transcripts PPARG2d and PPARG1b + PPARG2b in lactating stage were also higher than those in non-lactating stage, but the mRNA abundance of transcripts PPARG1c, PPARG1d and PPARG2c in non-lactating period was higher than that in lactating period. The results of this study suggest that PPARG1 and PPARG2 may play important role in buffalo milk fat synthesis, and the eight alternative splicing variants found here are likely to be related to the post-transcriptional regulation of lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aalternative splicing 3abuffalo milk 3abuffaloes 3acomputer simulation 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3alactation 3alipids 3amammary glands 3ametabolism 3amilk fat 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3aprediction 3asignal peptide 3asynthesis 0aPPARG 0acDNA 0aRT-qPCR 0aPPARG 0aTranscription 0aMammary gland 0aMilk fat synthesis1 aTeng, Xiaohong1 aWang, Pei1 aZhang, Yongyun1 aMiao, Yongwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2127-03790 tGene.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 759 p.144981-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1449813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245014400207300001800351520176500369592002802134650000802162650001902170650002402189650001002213650001002223650001402233650001702247650001302264650002202277650001302299650002202312700005902334700005702393773012402450856008302574852000902657655001202666IND60782385220221121054130.0220822e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078238522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07312-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGezgin, Yüksel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5812-188210aScreening of OTULIN gene mutation with targeted next generation sequencing in Turkish populations and in silico analysis of these mutations  ap. 4643-4652.  aBACKGROUND: OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by systemic inflammation, recurrent fever. Due to limited knowledge about the OTULIN DNA variants that cause ORAS, the diagnosis and treatment of this disease is difficult. In this study, we aim to identify OTULIN DNA variants responsible for the genetic pathology of ORAS and observe the effects of these variants on the OTULIN protein structure and the function with different bioinformatics approaches. METHODS: The present study included 3230 individuals with the suspicion of an autoinflammatory disease who were referred to Ege University Children’s Hospital Molecular Medicine Laboratory. OTULIN variants were detected using a panel consisting of 37 different autoinflammatory diseases (AID) genes via targeted Next-Generation Sequencing. RESULTS: As a result of the study, DNA variants associated with various AID were detected in 65% of the individuals to whom the panel was applied. Among these variants, only three different OTULIN variants (p.Val82Ile, p.Gln115His and p.Leu131_Arg132insLeuCysThrGlu) were detected. The pathogenic effects of the variants detected in the OTULIN gene were determined by using Polyphen2 as “Probably Pathogenic” for the p.Val82Ile and “benign” for the p.Gln115His. At the same time, the effects of these variants on the structure and function of the OTULIN protein were investigated by in silico approaches. Both variants reduce protein stability and binding affinity. CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that the evaluation of OTULIN variants with in silico approaches will contribute to the development of personalized treatments by diagnosing the disease specific to the variant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abioinformatics 3acomputer simulation 3afever 3agenes 3ahospitals 3ainflammation 3amedicine 3amolecular biology 3amutation 3aprotein structure1 aKırnaz, Berkay1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2913-57881 aBerdeli, Afig1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4791-83670 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.4643-4652dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07312-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024003700134024002200171024001900193040001800212100002300230245012200253506007600375506003100451520100500482592002801487596003201515596000901547506003701556650001701593650002101610650001001631650001001641650002301651650001001674650002601684650001801710650001701728650001401745650001301759650001501772651001501787653002201802653002701824700001801851700001801869773009901887856008401986961001302070852000902083655001202092IND60680502920221215142337.0200403e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068050292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fochx.2019.1000732chorus7 a10.1016/j.fochx.2019.1000732doi7 aPMC69407022pmcid7 a319093952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBañuelos, Gary S.10aAccumulation and speciation of selenium in biofortified vegetables grown under high boron and saline field conditions  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSelenium (Se) biofortification, as an agronomic-based strategy, is utilized to produce Se-enriched food products for increasing Se intake in inhabitants in Se-deficient regions. This strategy can be accomplished by soil and foliar application of Se or by growing crops in soils naturally high in Se. In this study, different cruciferous vegetables were field-grown in high boron (B) and saline soils of central California containing naturally high levels of Se. We investigated whether Se biofortification occurs in salt- and B-tolerant vegetables grown in poor-quality soil. The uptake of Se and other elements occurred in all vegetables. In plant tissues, Se speciation analyses showed greatest percentages of Se-containing compounds were contained in organic Se forms (monomethylated) and as selenate in the inorganic Se forms. Selenium-enriched vegetables produced from saline soils high in B and Se can be a natural source of Se-biofortified food that can be consumed as bioactive food products.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia State University  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassicaceae 3abiofortification 3aboron 3acrops 3afoliar application 3afoods 3anutrient deficiencies 3aplant tissues 3asaline soils 3aselenates 3aselenium 3avegetables 3aCalifornia 0aSelenoamino acids 0aBioactive Se compounds1 aFreeman, John1 aArroyo, Irvin0 tFood chemistry: X.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 5 p.100073-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27262x2590-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fochx.2019.1000733Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03430naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008200168300001800250520158600268536026001854592002802114596009802142596008802240596008402328650001202412650001902424650002002443650001502463650001302478650001402491650001902505650002302524650001402547650001302561650002202574650001602596650002002612650001802632651001702650700001702667700001302684700001702697773013902714856008602853852000902939655001202948IND60654912520221120154307.0200515e20191117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065491252DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.16083922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Haijun10aLoss of terrestrial water storage in the Tianshan mountains from 2003 to 2015  ap. 8342-8358.  aThe Tianshan Mountains region in Central Asia is covered with a large mass of glaciers and seasonal snow cover. This region supplies the main freshwater resources for Central Asia but has been severely affected by climate change over the past decades. In this study, we use the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets to analyze the spatiotemporal variability of the terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the Tianshan Mountains from 2003 to 2015. The analysis shows that the TWS in the Tianshan Mountains has declined during the past decade. Seasonal changes in the water storage are caused by seasonal differences in the combined precipitation and temperature conditions. The results of TWS variations (TWSVs) in the Tianshan Mountains in 2003–2015 indicated that there is a declining rate of the TWS of the TWS-Mascon, TWS-Gaussian, and TWS-Noah is −0.72, −0.48, and −0.41 cm year⁻¹, respectively. This suggests that the water storage loss in Tianshan Mountains has been about −4.32 × 10⁹, −2.88 × 10⁹, and −2.46 × 10⁹ m³ year⁻¹ during 2003–2015, respectively. Glaciers and seasonal snow cover shrinkage obviously are the main factors governing the spatial difference in the TWSV. Annual mean temperature stays in a high state from the mid-1990s has been a predominant factor affecting the TWSV in the mountains during the past decade. A significant temperature increase in the middle region (Chinese part) accelerated the glacier and snow-cover shrinkage, which resulted in TWS loss.  aThis work was supported by the Projects for National Natural Science Foundation of China [41807159]; Public Welfare Scientific Institutions of Fujian Province [2015R1034-1]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20100303].  aPublisher supplied data  a41807159cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2015R1034-1cProjects for Public Welfare Scientific Institutions of Fujian Province  aXDA20100303cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3afreshwater 3aglaciers 3amountains 3aremote sensing 3aseasonal variation 3ashrinkage 3asnowpack 3aspatial variation 3atemperature 3awater resources 3awater storage 3aCentral Asia1 aChen, Yaning1 aLi, Qihu1 aLin, Guangfa0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Nov. 17, v. 40, no. 22 p.8342-8358dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.16083923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245017100154300001800325520101700343592002801360650002201388650003401410650002401444650001801468650001401486650003501500650001301535650002101548650000901569650002701578650001201605650002201617650001001639650002001649650001701669700001801686700001501704700001701719700001801736700001801754700001501772773012601787856007401913852000901987655001201996IND60676288120221121173929.0191114e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067628812DNAL7 a10.1039/c9fo00994a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lin10aProtective effects of tenuifolin isolated from Polygala tenuifolia Willd roots on neuronal apoptosis and learning and memory deficits in mice with Alzheimer's disease  ap. 7453-7460.  aThe roots of Polygala tenuifolia Willd have a long history of being used as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of insomnia, forgetfulness, sorrow and depression. Tenuifolin (TEN) has been isolated from Polygala tenuifolia Willd roots, and this study was carried out to investigate the potential beneficial effects of TEN on neuronal apoptosis and memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). TEN treatment reversed spatial learning and memory deficits, as well as neuronal apoptosis in hippocampal areas, in APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice. TEN treatment protected against Aβ25–35-induced apoptosis, loss of mitochondria-membrane potential, and activation of caspases-3 and -9 in SH-SY5Y cells. TEN has potential benefit in treating learning and memory deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice, and its effects may be associated with reversing AD pathology-induced neuronal apoptosis. These insights pave the way for further analysis of the potential of TEN as an AD therapeutic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPolygala tenuifolia 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3agenetically modified organisms 3alearning 3amemory disorders 3amice 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneurons 3aprotective effect 3aroots 3asleep disorders 3atherapeutics1 aJin, Gui Fang1 aYu, He Han1 aLu, Xiao Hua1 aZou, Zhen Hua1 aLiang, Jia Qi1 aYang, Hong0 tFood & function.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 10, no. 11 p.7453-7460dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9fo00994a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010200162500002000264520173700284592002802021596004902049650001302098650001502111650001302126650000902139650001902148650003702167650001602204700001402220700005402234773012102288856007502409852000902484655001202493IND60789272420221116142530.0220819e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078927242DNAL7 a10.1002/vzj2.201862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBienvenue, Taylor10aDeveloping a soil column system to measure hydrogeophysical properties of unconsolidated sediment  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGeophysical methods have been increasingly used to characterize the Earth's critical zone (CZ) and monitor hydrological processes occurring within it. For a quantitative interpretation, geophysical studies of CZ materials are necessary, and thus require more sophisticated laboratory setups. In this study, we develop a hydrogeophysical soil column system to measure key hydraulic and electrical properties of regolith in CZs. The developed soil column system consists of two components: (a) a novel hydrogeophysical probe that measures pore water pressure and electrical potential in soils and (b) a cylindrical cell to hold soil samples. The system can be arranged to perform both saturated flow and drainage tests. The saturated flow test is similar to the traditional constant head experiment for determining the hydraulic conductivity and streaming potential coupling coefficient. The drainage tests can produce transient responses of cumulative overflow, pore water pressure, and streaming potential. These transient data can be used to estimate the sample's electrical and hydraulic properties with the coupled, stochastic hydrogeophysical inversion. A sand sample is used to demonstrate the procedures of applying this new system. The measured saturated hydraulic conductivity and streaming potential coupling coefficient of the sand are within the typical ranges of sands reported in the literature. The inversion‐estimated soil parameters can well reproduce the measured transient responses during the drainage test of the sample. Moreover, the inversion‐estimated saturated properties are in good agreement with those independently measured in the saturated flow test, showing the robustness of the developed system.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRF#60925‐DNI9cAmerican Chemicals Society 3adrainage 3ageophysics 3aregolith 3asand 3asaturated flow 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3avadose zone1 aXie, Jing1 aNiu, Qifei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2267-66530 tVadose zone journal.g2022 Mar., v. 21, no. 2 p.e20186-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.201863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245008100157300001600238520133900254592002801593653002201621653001001643653001001653653001901663653002201682653002001704700002101724700002001745700003101765700002001796700003001816700002301846773010101869856007401970852000902044655001202053IND60131254120221120135822.0151127e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013125412DNAL7 a10.1672/07-232.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrauss, Ken W.10aWater Level Observations in Mangrove Swamps During Two Hurricanes in Florida  ap. 142-149.  aLittle is known about the effectiveness of mangroves in suppressing water level heights during landfall of tropical storms and hurricanes. Recent hurricane strikes along the Gulf Coast of the United States have impacted wetland integrity in some areas and hastened the need to understand how and to what degree coastal forested wetlands confer protection by reducing the height of peak water level. In recent years, U.S. Geological Survey Gulf Coast research projects in Florida have instrumented mangrove sites with continuous water level recorders. Our ad hoc network of water level recorders documented the rise, peak, and fall of water levels (±± 0.5 hr) from two hurricane events in 2004 and 2005. Reduction of peak water level heights from relatively in-line gages associated with one storm surge event indicated that mangrove wetlands can reduce water level height by as much as 9.4 cm/km inland over intact, relatively unchannelized expanses. During the other event, reductions were slightly less for mangroves along a river corridor. Estimates of water level attenuation were within the range reported in the literature but erred on the conservative side. These synoptic data from single storm events indicate that intact mangroves may support a protective role in reducing maximum water level height associated with surge.  aPublisher supplied data 0aforested wetlands 0amarsh 0asurge 0atropical storm 0aHurricane Charley 0aHurricane Wilma1 aDoyle, Thomas W.1 aDoyle, Terry J.1 aSwarzenski, Christopher M.1 aFrom, Andrew S.1 aDay, R.

The purified CPM-2, having a molecular weight of 24 kDa, was assessed homogeneously by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. TheN-terminal amino acid sequence of CPM-2 was composed of X Val Gln Asp Phe Val Glu Glu Ile Leu. CPM-2 was inactivated by Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺ and strongly inhibited by typical serine proteinase inhibitors such as TLCK, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, benzamidine, and α₁-antitrypsin. However, EDTA, EGTA, cysteine, β-mercaptoethanol, E64, and elastatinal had little effect on enzyme activity. In addition, antiplasmin and antithrombin III were not sensitive to CPM-2. Based on the results of a fibrinolytic activity test, CPM-2 readily cleaved Aα-and Bβ-chains of fibrinogen and fibrin, and γ-chain of fibrinogen more slowly. The nonspecific action of the enzyme resulted in extensive hydrolysis, releasing a variety of fibrinopeptides of fibrinogen and fibrin. Polyclonal antibodies of CPM-2 were reactive to the native form of antigen. The ELISA was applied to detect quantities, in nanograms, of the antigen in CPM-2 protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharsius 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aaffinity chromatography 3aamino acid sequences 3aammonium sulfate 3aantigens 3abeta-mercaptoethanol 3acopper 3acysteine 3adung beetles 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aethylene glycol tetraacetic acid 3afeces 3afibrin 3afibrinogen 3afractionation 3agel chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apurification methods 3aserine proteinases 3asoybeans 3atrypsin inhibitors 3azinc1 aHahn, Bum-Soo1 aRyu, Kang Sun1 aHwang, Jae Sam1 aKim, Yeong Shik0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2005 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.816-822dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029773483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245010900204300001800313520078000331592002801111650002301139650001301162650002301175650002301198700005701221700006001278773013601338856008001474852000901554655001201563IND60735906620221122235021.0210429e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073590662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c010992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelh, Sarah J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2655-623710aSurface-Radical Mobility Test by Self-Sorted Recombination: Symmetrical Product upon Recombination (SPR)  ap. 4212-4220.  aWe describe here a study of the mobility of the alkoxy radical on a surface by detection of its recombination product. A novel method called symmetrical product recombination (SRP) uses an unsymmetrical peroxide that upon sensitized homolysis recombines to a symmetrical product [R′OOR → R′O•↑ + •OR → ROOR]. This allows for self-sorting of the radical to enhance the recombination path to a symmetrical product, which has been used to deduce surface migratory aptitude. SPR also provides a new opportunity for mechanistic studies of interfacial radicals, including monitoring competition between radical recombination versus surface hydrogen abstraction. This is an approach that might work for other surface-borne radicals on natural and artificial particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahomolytic cleavage 3ahydrogen 3amigratory behavior 3aphysical chemistry1 aGhosh, Goutam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2021-45891 aGreer, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4444-90990 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 125, no. 16 p.4212-4220dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c010993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245009000180300001300270520137500283592002801658650001301686650001901699650001901718650001701737650001801754650001701772650001701789650001101806653001601817653001701833653002001850653001801870700002001888700002601908773007801934856008402012852000902096655001202105IND60545228020221119224722.0160901e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054522802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharbatmaleki, Mohamadali10aPotential mechanisms for bioregeneration of perchlorate-containing ion-exchange resin  ap. 1-10.  aIon-exchange (IX) is the most feasible technology for perchlorate removal from drinking water. Reuse of resins present challenges, however. Selective resins are non-regenerable, and are incinerated after one time use, while non-selective resins, when regenerable, produce a waste stream that contains high concentration of perchlorate that must be disposed of. A process to bioregenerate spent resin containing perchlorate with perchlorate-reducing bacteria (PRB) has been recently developed. In this research, potential mechanisms for bioregeneration of resin-attached perchlorate (RAP) were investigated. Batch bioregeneration experiments were performed using gel-type and macroporous-type resins. Various initial chloride concentrations and various resin bead sizes were used. The results of the bioregeneration experiments suggested that chloride, i.e. the product of perchlorate biodegradation, is more likely the desorbing agent of RAP; and increasing the concentration of chloride enhances the bioregeneration process. Both film and pore diffusion were found to be relevant with respect to the rate of perchlorate mass-transfer to the bulk liquid. Bioregeneration was found to be more effective for macroporous than for gel-type resins, especially in the case of macroporous resins with relatively small bead size in the presence of higher chloride concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3adrinking water 3aion exchange 3amass transfer 3aperchlorates 3aporous media 3aresins 0aPerchlorate 0aIon-exchange 0aBioregeneration 0aMass-transfer1 aUnz, Richard F.1 aBatista, Jacimaria R.0 tWater research.g2015 May 15, v. 75 p.1-10dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245010900159300001400268520151600282592002801798653002301826653002201849653002901871653002101900653001901921653002201940653002101962653005001983700001902033700001802052773009902070856007402169852000902243655001202252IND60131254220221120150210.0151127e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013125422DNAL7 a10.1672/07-233.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoyle, Thomas W.10aLandscape Analysis and Pattern of Hurricane Impact and Circulation on Mangrove Forests of the Everglades  ap. 44-53.  aThe Everglades ecosystem contains the largest contiguous tract of mangrove forest outside the tropics that were also coincidentally intersected by a major Category 5 hurricane. Airborne videography was flown to capture the landscape pattern and process of forest damage in relation to storm trajectory and circulation. Two aerial video transects, representing different topographic positions, were used to quantify forest damage from video frame analysis in relation to prevailing wind force, treefall direction, and forest height. A hurricane simulation model was applied to reconstruct wind fields corresponding to the ground location of each video frame and to correlate observed treefall and destruction patterns with wind speed and direction. Mangrove forests within the storm's eyepath and in the right-side (forewind) quadrants suffered whole or partial blowdowns, while left-side (backwind) sites south of the eyewall zone incurred moderate canopy reduction and defoliation. Sites along the coastal transect sustained substantially more storm damage than sites along the inland transect which may be attributed to differences in stand exposure and/or stature. Observed treefall directions were shown to be non-random and associated with hurricane trajectory and simulated forewind azimuths. Wide-area sampling using airborne videography provided an efficient adjunct to limited ground observations and improved our spatial understanding of how hurricanes imprint landscape-scale patterns of disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaerial videography 0adamage assessment 0aEverglades National Park 0aHurricane Andrew 0aremote sensing 0asouthwest Florida 0aspatial analysis 0aTen Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge1 aKrauss, Ken W.1 aWells, C.

In this work, non-hydrolytic sol–gel chemistry was used for precisely controlled synthesis of five different CuₓS polymorphs, namely β-chalcocite, α-chalcocite, djurleite, low digenite and covellite. All polymorphs could be obtained as nanoparticles by adjusting reaction conditions. Notably, α-chalcocite nanoparticles were considerably more stable than any previously reported. In addition, continuous phase evolutions between several sets of copper sulfide polymorphs, and intermediate structures between certain structures, were observed. A route to synthesize digenite with an unusual stoichiometry by grinding β-chalcocite, α-chalcocite or djurleite was also discovered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3agrinding 3ananoparticles 3asol-gel processing 3astoichiometry 3asulfides1 aSoldat, Anne Christine1 aLind, Cora0 tRSC advances.g2013 Nov. 26, v. 4, no. 2 p.717-726dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra45053h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001800155245017000173300001800343520123100361592002801592650001901620650001301639650001601652650002101668650001701689650001101706650001301717650001501730650001801745650000901763650001201772650003701784650002101821650003701842650002101879650003201900650003001932650001801962650002201980650004202002650004602044650000902090650003302099650004502132700002002177700001402197700002002211700001802231700001902249700001902268700001902287773010602306856003902412852000902451655001202460IND4465343720221120164508.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446534372DNAL7 a216746332pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.35532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tae-jun,10aInhibitory Effects of Costunolide Isolated from Laurus nobilis on IgE‐induced Degranulation of Mast Cell‐like RBL‐2H3 Cells and the Growth of Y16 pro‐B Cells  ap. 1392-1397.  aThis study investigated the inhibitory effects of costunolide isolated from the leaves of Laurus nobilis L. (Lauraceae) on basophil‐mediated allergic reactions and interleukin (IL)‐5‐mediated B cell growth. The effects of costunolide on β‐hexosaminidase (a key parameter of degranulation) release and IL‐4 expression in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL‐2H3) cells were determined by measuring β‐hexosaminidase activity and by semi‐quantitative RT‐PCR, respectively. The effects of costunolide on Y16 pro‐B cell viability and growth were determined by 3‐(4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl)2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Costunolide was found significantly to inhibit β‐hexosaminidase activity (p < 0.01) and IL‐4 transcription in RBL‐2H3 cells in a dose‐dependent manner. Its 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 34 µm, while that of the positive control, ketotifen, was 24 µm (IL‐4 mRNA transcription). Moreover, costunolide dose‐dependently suppressed pro‐B cell growth in IL‐5‐stimulated Y16 cells. These results provide evidence that costunolide stabilizes mast cells by inhibiting IgE‐mediated degranulation and inhibits IL‐5‐stimulated B cell growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaurus nobilis 3abromides 3acell growth 3ahypersensitivity 3ainterleukins 3aleaves 3aleukemia 3amast cells 3amessenger RNA 3arats 2aAnimals 2aCell Degranulationxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aImmunoglobulin E 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aInterleukin-4xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-5 2aLaurusxchemistry 2aMast Cellsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPrecursor Cells, B-Lymphoidxdrug effects 2aRats 2aSesquiterpenesxpharmacology 2abeta-N-Acetylhexosaminidasesxmetabolism1 aNam, Kung‐Woo1 aKim, Bora1 aLee, Sung‐Jin1 aOh, Ki‐Bong1 aKim, Kyeong Ho1 aMar, Woongchon1 aShin, Jongheon0 tPhytotherapy research.g2011 Sept., v. 25, no. 9 p.1392-1397dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3553  aDNAL 7aarticle03725naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245017300153300001800326520222500344592002802569650002202597650002402619650002202643650001302665650002802678650001102706650001902717650002302736650002102759650002202780650001202802650001902814650002202833650000802855700002002863700001302883700002202896700002702918700001202945700002302957700002002980700002803000773013103028856007503159852000903234655001203243IND60538548320221122035019.0160815e20120523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053854832DNAL7 a10.1021/ja301539s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, In10aCsSnI3: Semiconductor or Metal? High Electrical Conductivity and Strong Near-Infrared Photoluminescence from a Single Material. High Hole Mobility and Phase-Transitions  ap. 8579-8587.  aCsSnI₃ is an unusual perovskite that undergoes complex displacive and reconstructive phase transitions and exhibits near-infrared emission at room temperature. Experimental and theoretical studies of CsSnI₃ have been limited by the lack of detailed crystal structure characterization and chemical instability. Here we describe the synthesis of pure polymorphic crystals, the preparation of large crack-/bubble-free ingots, the refined single-crystal structures, and temperature-dependent charge transport and optical properties of CsSnI₃, coupled with ab initio first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In situ temperature-dependent single-crystal and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction studies reveal the origin of polymorphous phase transitions of CsSnI₃. The black orthorhombic form of CsSnI₃ demonstrates one of the largest volumetric thermal expansion coefficients for inorganic solids. Electrical conductivity, Hall effect, and thermopower measurements on it show p-type metallic behavior with low carrier density, despite the optical band gap of 1.3 eV. Hall effect measurements of the black orthorhombic perovskite phase of CsSnI₃ indicate that it is a p-type direct band gap semiconductor with carrier concentration at room temperature of ∼ 10¹⁷ cm–³ and a hole mobility of ∼585 cm² V–¹ s–¹. The hole mobility is one of the highest observed among p-type semiconductors with comparable band gaps. Its powders exhibit a strong room-temperature near-IR emission spectrum at 950 nm. Remarkably, the values of the electrical conductivity and photoluminescence intensity increase with heat treatment. The DFT calculations show that the screened-exchange local density approximation-derived band gap agrees well with the experimentally measured band gap. Calculations of the formation energy of defects strongly suggest that the electrical and light emission properties possibly result from Sn defects in the crystal structure, which arise intrinsically. Thus, although stoichiometric CsSnI₃ is a semiconductor, the material is prone to intrinsic defects associated with Sn vacancies. This creates highly mobile holes which cause the materials to appear metallic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3aheat treatment 3aoptical properties 3aphase transition 3aphotoluminescence 3apowders 3asemiconductors 3athermal expansion 3atin1 aSong, Jung-Hwan1 aIm, Jino1 aAndroulakis, John1 aMalliakas, Christos D.1 aLi, Hao1 aFreeman, Arthur J.1 aKenney, John T.1 aKanatzidis, Mercouri G.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 May 23, v. 134, no. 20 p.8579-8587dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja301539s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010100167520197400268592002802242650002902270650003302299650001102332650002402343650000902367650001902376650002502395653001302420653000802433653000702441653000802448653000802456653001002464653000702474653000902481653001002490653001402500653001102514653000802525653000802533653002202541653002402563653002702587653002002614700001602634700002002650700001602670700001802686773013202704856008602836852000902922655001202931IND60759081620221123005127.0220124e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075908162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Wenpeng14aThe external dependence of ecological products: Spatial-temporal features and future predictions  aThe instability of international trade can threaten the resource security of resource-importing countries, while international trade helps address spatial mismatches between regional populations, economies, and resources. Ecological products are the basis for human survival and development, in which agri-livestock products are especially sensitive to trade fluctuation and closely related to human well-being. The external dependence is an important indicator to reveal the external supply risk of regional resources. Scientific understanding the external dependence of ecological products can reveal the potential risks of trade fluctuations to human well-being and ecological sustainability. In this study, the global status and trend of countries' external dependence of agri-livestock ecological products are investigated. The results showed that nearly 80% (141) of countries relied on imports to meet ecological product demands in 2018, in which Asian-African-Latin countries accounted for about 78%, which indicated that the instability of international trade would threaten the ecological resource security in 80% of the world's countries, especially for underdeveloped countries. Even worse, 68% of countries are increasing their external dependence of ecological products. Even if the intensity of ecological resource exploitation reaches the maximum sustainable utilization level, 60% (113) of countries are expected to need imports for meeting their ecological product demands in 2050. Moreover, even considering the agricultural technological upgrade and the consumption transformation, more than 50% (94) of countries are still net importers of ecological products. Therefore, trade liberalization is still one of the important means to reduce resource security risks caused by trade instability. More notably, half of the countries in the world may sacrifice ecological sustainability to meet basic human well-being in the future under deglobalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ahumans 3ainternational trade 3arisk 3asocial welfare 3atrade liberalization 0aCOVID-19 0aFTD 0aMA 0aFAO 0aNPP 0aHANPP 0aED 0aSDGs 0aCMIP6 0aSSPs-RCPs 0aNPISHs 0aGPP 0aGDP 0aResource security 0aEcological products 0aEcosystem productivity 0aDeglobalization1 aYan, Huimin1 aFung, Chi Ming,1 aYang, Zhiqi1 aYang, Yanzhao0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 304 p.114190-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009600175500002200271506011700293506007600410520087300486592002801359506003701387650001901424650001501443650001701458651001201475653000801487653000801495653000801503653003001511653004001541653000901581653001301590653003301603700002401636700001601660773009201676856008601768852000901854655001201863IND60773128320221207122516.0220523e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2022.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitzenberger, Bernd14aThe effects of training incidence and planned training duration on labor market transitions  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper uses a dynamic model for employment and training transitions in discrete time to estimate average employment effects of training incidence and planned training duration for the treated.

Identification relies on a consistency condition, conditional sequential randomization, time-varying covariates, and exclusion restrictions. We implement our framework applying MCMC methods to rich administrative data for a large training program in Germany. In addition to finding a positive training effect on employment between 6 and 12 percentage points 2.5 years after program start, we demonstrate that a longer planned training duration typically results in higher medium- to long-term employment gains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adynamic models 3aemployment 3alabor market 3aGermany 0aJ68 0aC33 0aC11 0aDynamic treatment effects 0aDynamic nonlinear panel data models 0aMCMC 0aTraining 0aActive labor market programs1 aOsikominu, Aderonke1 aPaul, Marie0 tJournal of econometrics.g2022 Mar. 01, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2022.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011800170300001800288520084900306592002801155650001501183650003301198650001301231650002001244650002401264650001001288650001201298650001901310650001901329651001001348700001901358700001901377700002201396700002201418700001801440700002101458700002301479700002001502700001901522700002001541700002001561700002401581773009901605856008601704852000901790655001201799IND60659349820221117050517.0191214e20191008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065934982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakurai, Akira10aRegulatory aspects of quality and safety for live recombinant viral vaccines against infectious diseases in Japan  ap. 6573-6579.  aRecombinant viral vaccines expressing antigens of pathogenic microbes (e.g., HIV, Ebola virus, and malaria) have been designed to overcome the insufficient immune responses induced by the conventional vaccines.

The pressure-induced glass-forming and crystalline states of PA are found to be formed at different compression rates. The experimental results suggest that the polymerization is induced in the glass-forming state at a very low pressure in contrast to that in the crystal phase where much higher threshold pressure is required. The measured rate constants were found to strongly depend on the pressure, the physical state, and UV radiation. In particular, the rate constant reduced to different extents either by UV irradiation or upon phase transition. The derived activation volumes from the rate constants allow the direct comparison and elucidation of photoactivation and environmental effects on the polymerization. Finally, the diffusion-controlled 1D polymer growth processes were suggested for the glass-forming state or the crystal state at specific pressures. Overall, the mechanistic insights of this work provide guidance of optimizing the multiplexed reaction conditions for the production of the conducting poly(PA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aphase transition 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aultraviolet radiation1 aWang, Pan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8642-36341 aSong, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7853-37370 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Apr. 16, v. 125, no. 16 p.4169-4177dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c015793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002600137245009100163300001600254520173900270592002802009653001702037653001602054653001402070653001002084653002402094653001902118653001202137700002102149700002202170700002602192773010102218856007302319852000902392655001202401IND60131254520221120135817.0151127e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013125452DNAL7 a10.1672/07-82.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchriever, Tiffany A.10aEffects of Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita on a Southeastern Louisiana Herpetofauna  ap. 112-122.  aTropical weather disturbances are a major influence on coastal wetlands in North America. However, studies of their impact on biotic communities are rare. The abundance and species composition of amphibians and reptiles were investigated within levee, herbaceous marsh, and forested swamp habitats in southeastern Louisiana from 2002 to 2004 and again in 2005 to 2006. During the course of this study, three major hurricanes (Ivan, Katrina, and Rita) affected our study sites. This allowed us to opportunistically document the effect of major storm disturbances by comparing species richness, diversity, community assemblage, and abundance of amphibians and reptiles before and after hurricane events. We also used a previous study conducted in the same area during the late 1980's to assess long-term community composition changes. We documented the highest species richness in the forested swamp habitat (23 species), but the most diverse assemblage was found in marsh habitat (H′′ == 2.082). Overall, herpetofaunal diversity decreased and evenness increased in each habitat following hurricanes Ivan and Katrina/Rita. Drastic decreases in overall abundance of amphibians occurred, while the effect on reptile abundance varied with habitat. Reduced abundance of reptiles in marsh was recorded over the course of the study, while abundances in adjacent levee habitat increased, suggesting displacement of certain reptiles from the marsh to the levee. Significant saltwater intrusion was recorded in marsh and levee habitats, but not in the forested swamp. The hurricanes altered community composition and increased species evenness within each habitat, potentially affecting long-term community dynamics and species interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aconservation 0adisturbance 0adiversity 0amarsh 0asaltwater intrusion 0atropical storm 0awetland1 aRamspott, Joseph1 aCrother, Brian I.1 aFontenot, Clifford L.0 tWetlands.g2009 Mar., v. 29, no. 1 p.112-122dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F07-82.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002800175245010300203300001400306520232000320592002802640650001902668650001802687650001202705650001502717650001202732650001102744650002602755650002102781650001202802650002002814650001302834650000902847650001202856700002002868700001702888773014902905856006803054856010003122990002303222852000903245655001203254IND60643260320221123031507.0190510e20110106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064326032DNAL7 a10.3791/22652doi7 aPMC31826352pmcid7 a212486992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKupferschmidt, David A.12aA procedure for studying the footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in laboratory rats  ap. e2265.  aThe most insidious aspect of drug addiction is the high propensity for relapse. Animal models of relapse, known as reinstatement procedures, have been used extensively to study the neurobiology and phenomenology of relapse to drug use. Although procedural variations have emerged over the past several decades, the most conventional reinstatement procedures are based on the drug self-administration (SA) model. In this model, an animal is trained to perform an operant response to obtain drug. Subsequently, the behavior is extinguished by withholding response-contingent reinforcement. Reinstatement of drug seeking is then triggered by a discrete event, such as an injection of the training drug, re-exposure to drug-associated cues, or exposure to a stressor 1. Reinstatement procedures were originally developed to study the ability of acute non-contingent exposure to the training drug to reinstate drug seeking in rats and monkeys 1, 2. Reinstatement procedures have since been modified to study the role of environmental stimuli, including drug-associated cues and exposure to various forms of stress, in relapse to drug seeking 1, 3, 4. Over the past 15 years, a major focus of the reinstatement literature has been on the role of stress in drug relapse. One of the most commonly used forms of stress for studying this relationship is acute exposures to mild, intermittent, electric footshocks. The ability of footshock stress to induce reinstatement of drug seeking was originally demonstrated by Shaham and colleagues (1995) in rats with a history of intravenous heroin SA5. Subsequently, the effect was generalized to rats with histories of intravenous cocaine, methamphetamine, and nicotine SA, as well as oral ethanol SA 3, 6. Although footshock-induced reinstatement of drug seeking can be achieved reliably and robustly, it is an effect that tends to be sensitive to certain parametrical variables. These include the arrangement of extinction and reinstatement test sessions, the intensity and duration of footshock stress, and the presence of drug-associated cues during extinction and testing for reinstatement. Here we present a protocol for footshock-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking that we have used with consistent success to study the relationship between stress and cocaine seeking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute exposure 3aanimal models 3acocaine 3adrug abuse 3aethanol 3aheroin 3aintravenous injection 3amethamphetamines 3amonkeys 3aneurophysiology 3anicotine 3arats 3arelapse1 aBrown, Zenya J.1 aErb, Suzanne0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2011 Jan. 06, , no. 47 p.e2265-e2265dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/22653Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2265/a-procedure-for-studying-footshock-induced-reinstatement-cocaine  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245008200212300001600294500001900310520183100329592002802160596006702188650001202255650002002267650002002287650001502307650001502322650001702337650001202354650001102366650001102377650001502388650001902403650001402422650001302436650001002449651001002459700002802469700001902497700001902516700002502535700001902560700001502579700002102594700002202615700002002637700002102657700001802678700002502696773009902721856008202820852000902902655001202911IND60689977220221119224912.0200424e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068997722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-019-00424-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, Anabelle W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4327-725914aThe Role of Forest Elephants in Shaping Tropical Forest–Savanna Coexistence  ap. 602-616.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aForest edges that border savanna are dynamic features of tropical landscapes. Although the role of fire in determining edge dynamics has been relatively well explored, the role of mega-herbivores, specifically elephants, has not received as much attention. We investigated the role of forest elephants in shaping forest edges of the forest–savanna mosaic in Lopé National Park, Gabon. Using forty camera traps, we collected 1.2 million images between May 2016 and June 2017. These images were classified by over 10,000 volunteers through an online citizen science platform. These data were combined with a 33-year phenology dataset on elephant-favoured fruiting tree species, and field measurements of elephant browsing preferences and damage. Our results showed a strong relationship between forest elephant density at the forest edge and fruit availability. When fruit availability was high, elephant density at the edge reached values nearly double the highest densities ever reported in any other part of the landscape (7.5 elephants km⁻² in this study vs the previous highest estimate of 4 elephants km⁻²). The highest elephant densities occurred at the end of the dry season, but even outside of this high density period elephant density at the forest edge (2.4 elephants km⁻²) was more than double what other studies estimate for forest interiors with low human hunting pressure (1 elephant km⁻²). We found forest elephants to be selective browsers, but their browsing was non-destructive (in contrast to savanna elephants) and had little effect on tree size demography. Elephant paths acted as firebreaks during savanna burning, making them inadvertent protectors of the fire-sensitive forest and contributing to the stabilising feedbacks that allow forest and savanna to coexist in tropical landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data  aERC-2013-AdG-321131-GEMTRAITScH2020 European Research Council 3acameras 3acitizen science 3adata collection 3ademography 3adry season 3aedge effects 3aforests 3afruits 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3anational parks 3aphenology 3asavannas 3atrees 3aGabon1 aMalhi, Y.q(Yadvinder),1 aOliveras, Imma1 aLehmann, David1 aNdong, Josué Edzang1 aDimoto, Edmond1 aBush, Emma1 aJeffery, Kathryn1 aLabriere, Nicolas1 aLewis, Simon L.1 aWhite, Lee T.

Short-term reactions (30 days) of the microbial communities in these soils having different levels of historic Hg contamination were further evaluated in microcosm experiments where soils were either spiked with dissolved HgCl2 or not. Results show a clear impact of a long-term Hg contamination on both bacterial and fungal community structures and diversity but only a weak effect was observed on their activities (basal respiration and growth rates). No short-term effects of Hg were observed on the microbial community structures and activities. Taxa from the Chthoniobacteraceae (bacteria) and Trichosporon sp. (fungi) were associated with high Hg contaminated soils, implying they possess capabilities to tolerate Hg in soils. Abundance of mercury reductase (merA) gene copies increased with higher Hg concentrations in soils both during short and long-term exposure to Hg pointing to potential mechanisms within microbial cells to tolerate higher amounts of Hg in soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichosporon 3abacteria 3achronic exposure 3acommunity structure 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agenes 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3amercury(II) reductase 3amicrobiome 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3atoxicity 0aMercury 0aSoil 0aBacteria 0aFungi 0aMercury reductase1 aDonhauser, Johanna1 aMestrot, Adrien1 aGygax, Sebastien1 aBååth, Erland1 aFrey, Beat0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 May, v. 120 p.191-199dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011700158300001600275520074400291592002801035650001201063650001701075650002401092650001901116650002401135650001201159700001701171700001901188700001901207700002001226700001801246700001601264700002001280700002001300700001901320700002001339700001201359773012101371856007401492852000901566655001201575IND60440517720221120211113.0151024e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044051772DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029773512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Hye-Ock14aThe effect of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanol on the lateral and rotational mobilities of liposome lipid bilayers  ap. 839-847.  aThe aim of this study was to provide the basis to further examine the mode of action of ethanol. Fluorescent probes reported to have different membrane mobilities were used to evaluate the effect of dimyristoylphosphatidylethanol (DMPEt) on the lateral and rotational mobilities of liposome lipid bilayers. An experimental procedure, based on the selective quenching of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1,3-di(1-pyrenyl)propane (Py-3-Py) by trinitrophenyl groups, was used. DMPEt increased the bulk lateral and rotational mobilities, and had a greater fluidizing effect on the outer than the inner monolayer. These effects of DMPEt on liposomes may be responsible for some, but not all, of the general anesthetic actions of ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethanol 3afluorescence 3ageneral anesthetics 3alipid bilayers 3amechanism of action 3apropane1 aHuh, Min-Hoi1 aLee, Seung-Woo1 aLee, Young Ho,1 aYi, Chŏng-hwa,1 aSeo, Jun-Bong1 aKoo, Kyo-Il1 aJin, Seong-Deok1 aJeong, Je-Hyung1 aLim, Jang-Seop1 aBae, Moon-Kyung1 aYun, Il0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2005 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.839-847dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029773513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012300177520161300300592002801913650001701941650001301958650001901971650001201990650002602002650002402028653002702052653002802079653004902107653002602156653002402182653000802206653000802214653001802222700002202240700002602262700002602288700002302314700002202337700002802359773011902387856008502506852000902591655001202600IND60773128520221121211712.0220509e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2022.1301392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBairamukov, Viktor Yu.10aNanomechanical characterization of exosomes and concomitant nanoparticles from blood plasma by PeakForce AFM in liquid  aTo date, EVs characterization techniques are extremely diverse. The contribution of AFM, in particular, is often confined to size distribution. While AFM provides a unique possibility to carry out measurements in situ, nanomechanical characterization of EVs is still missing. Blood plasma EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation, analyzed by flow cytometry and NTA. Followed by cryo-EM, we applied PeakForce AFM to assess morphological and nanomechanical properties of EVs in liquid. Nanoparticles were subdivided by their size estimated for their suspended state into sub-sets of small S1-EVs (< 30 nm), S2-EVs (30–50 nm), and sub-set of large ones L-EVs (50–170 nm). Non-membranous S1-EVs were distinguished by higher Young's modulus (10.33(7.36;15.25) MPa) and were less deformed by AFM tip (3.6(2.8;4.4) nm) compared to membrane exosomes S2-EVs (6.25(4.52;8.24) MPa and 4.8(4.3;5.9) nm). L-EVs were identified as large membrane exosomes, heterogeneous by their nanomechanical properties (22.43(8.26;53.11) MPa and 3.57(2.07;7.89) nm). Nanomechanical mapping revealed a few non-deformed L-EVs, of which Young's modulus rose up to 300 MPa. Taken together with cryo-EM, these results lead us to the suggestion that two or more vesicles could be contained inside a large one being a multilayer vesicle. We identified particles similar in morphology and showed differences in nanomechanical properties that could be attributed to the features of their inner structure. Our results further elucidate the identification of EVs and concomitant nanoparticles based on their nanomechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood plasma 3aexosomes 3aflow cytometry 3aliquids 3amodulus of elasticity 3aultracentrifugation 0aExtracellular vesicles 0aAtomic force microscopy 0aQuantitative nanomechanical mapping exosomes 0aMultilayered vesicles 0aThe Young's modulus 0aAFM 0aEVs 0aPeakForce QNM1 aBukatin, Anton S.1 aKamyshinsky, Roman A.1 aBurdakov, Vladimir S.1 aPichkur, Evgeny B.1 aShtam, Tatiana A.1 aStarodubtseva, Maria N.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2022 July, v. 1866, no. 7 p.130139-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2022.1301393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002600142245008100168300001600249500000900265520145000274592002801724650002601752650001701778650002001795650002901815650001501844650002301859650002201882650002101904650001801925650001801943650002401961650001201985650001101997650001702008651001102025700002102036773015702057852000902214856007902223655001202302IND4459637420221120215802.0191125e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963742DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2010.03182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhittinghill, Kyle A.10aEffects of Landscape Age on Soil Organic MatterProcessing in Northern Alaska  ap. 907-917.  aepub  aMuch of the previous research on arctic soil biogeochemistry has focused largely on the effects of climate, organisms, and relief rather than on geologic factors. However, a few studies of limited scope suggest that biogeochemical cycling in tundra soils may be significantly affected by variation in glacial history. To determine if variation in landscape age-related differences in geochemistry influence rates of organic matter decomposition in tundra soils, we conducted soil analyses and a 5-mo soil incubation study across a chronosequence of landscape ages in northern Alaska. Our results indicate that there were landscape-age related controls on microbial activity, with higher microbial biomass, rates of respiration, and production of dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON) in soils from the older landscape ages than in soils from younger, less weathered landscapes. This biological boundary corresponded to a chemical boundary, as older soils had lower pH (4.5–5 vs. 6.5) and exchangeable cation concentrations than the youngest soils. There were no differences among landscape ages in total C stocks in organic soils; however, total N stocks in the organic soil decreased with increasing landscape age. Differences among landscape ages in microbial activity due to geochemical variation may have important consequences for tundra C budgets because differences in soil pH and cation content exist throughout the circumpolar region.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon sinks 3achronosequences 3adissolved organic carbon 3alandscapes 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen content 3aorganic soils 3asoil analysis 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3atundra 3atundra soils 3aAlaska1 aHobbie, Sarah E.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 3 p.907-917dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2010.03183Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01782naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010700167300001600274520084200290592002801132650001001160650001901170650001501189650001701204700001901221700001901240773010701259856008201366990002301448852000901471655001201480IND60094113920221120101516.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFauman, Eric B10aStructure-based druggability assessment—identifying suitable targets for small molecule therapeutics  ap. 463-468.  aA target is druggable if it can be modulated in vivo by a drug-like molecule. The general properties of oral drugs are summarized by the ‘rule of 5’ which specifies parameters related to size and lipophilicity. Structure-based target druggability assessment consists of predicting ligand-binding sites on the protein that are complementary to these drug-like properties. Automated identification of ligand-binding sites can use geometrical considerations alone or include specific physicochemical properties of the protein surface. Features of a pocket's size and shape, together with measures of its hydrophobicity, are most informative in identifying suitable drug-binding pockets. The recent availability of several validation sets of druggable versus undruggable targets has helped fuel the development of more elaborate methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3ahydrophobicity 3aprediction 3atherapeutics1 aRai, Brajesh K1 aHuang, Enoch S0 tCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology.g2011 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.463-468dElsevier Ltdx1367-59317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.05.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01125naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006600160300001800226520021700244592002800461650002300489650001300512650002100525700002600546700002400572700002100596773013400617856007500751852000900826655001200835IND60658990820221121170351.0190826e20110614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065899082DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc11998b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahon, Clare S.10aTemplating a polymer-scaffolded dynamic combinatorial library  ap. 7209-7211.  aA water soluble polymer-scaffolded dynamic combinatorial library whose members can interconvert through acylhydrazone exchange was prepared and shown to re-equilibrate in the presence of macromolecular templates.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3apolymers 3awater solubility1 aJackson, Alexander W.1 aMurray, Benjamin S.1 aFulton, David A.0 tChemical communications.g2011 June 14, v. 47, no. 25 p.7209-7211dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc11998b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100004300152245017900195300001600374520098800390592002801378650001701406650002501423650001101448650001401459650001401473650001601487650001101503650002201514650000901536650001401545650001301559650001601572650001701588650001401605650001001619653002401629653002201653653002401675653001301699653001801712700003401730700002501764700003801789700002801827773010001855856008701955852000902042655001202051IND60601399120221118224608.0190705e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060139912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutra, Maria da Conceição Prudêncio10aIntegrated analyses of phenolic compounds and minerals of Brazilian organic and conventional grape juices and wines: Validation of a method for determination of Cu, Fe and Mn  ap. 157-165.  aThe phenolic profile and antioxidant activity (AOX) of “organic vs. conventional” Brazilian wines and grape juices were analyzed.

The validation parameters were considered satisfactory. Conventional products presented higher anthocyanins content, and no significant differences were observed on other phenolic compounds, AOX and Cu, Fe and Mn minerals. All the evaluated samples presented similar results between the same cultivars and in products from grapes of the two cultivation systems.

Analysis shows that gas fields which have the conditions for the secondary development are faced with many difficulties. For example, it is difficult to produce low permeable reserves and to unset the hydraulic seal which is formed by active formation water. In this paper, therefore, the technical route and selection conditions of old gas fields for the secondary development were comprehensively elaborated with its definition as the beginning. Firstly, geological model forward modeling and production performance inversion characteristic curve diagnosis are performed by using the pressure normalization curve and the identification and quantitative description method for multiple sets of storage–seepage body of complex karst fracture–cavity systems is put forward, after the multiple storage–seepage body mode of fracture–cavity systems is established. Combined with the new occurrence mode of gas and water in U-shape pipes, a new calculation technology for natural gas reserves of multiple fracture–cavity systems with strong water invasion is developed. Secondly, a numerical model of pore–cavity–fracture triple media is built, and simulation and result evaluation technology for the production pattern of "drainage by horizontal wells + gas production by vertical wells" in bottom-water fracture and cavity gas reservoirs with strong water invasion is developed. Thirdly, the geological model of gas reservoirs is reconstructed with the support of the integration technologies which are formed based on fine gas reservoir description. Low permeable reserves of gas reservoirs are evaluated based on each classification. The effective producing ratio is increased further by using the technologies of well pattern optimization, horizontal-well geosteering and staged acid fracturing. And fourthly, overall simulation, optimization and prediction technology for regional pipeline networks is developed by building a multi-node multi-link gas transmission pipeline network model. Application shows that this technology plays an important role in productivity construction, recovery factor improvement, production decline delay and production stabilization of old gas fields.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSichuan Basin 0aOld gas field 0aSecondary development 0aActive water invasion 0aMultiple sets of storage–seepage body 0aDrainage system 0aWell pattern 0aPipe network 0aLow permeable reserves producing 0aRecovery factor1 aLinqing, Liu1 aLi, Zhang1 aXian, Peng0 tNatural Gas Industry B.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aSichuan Petroleum Administrationx2352-85407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ngib.2017.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002100122040001800143072000900161072000900170072000900179072000900188100002500197245010700222300001400329500002400343500002400367500001500391520090600406650001601312650002101328650001101349650002001360650002301380650003301403650001501436650002001451650001601471650002601487650001301513650001401526650001901540650001101559653001701570653002501587700002201612700002201634773010901656852000901765856008001774856011201854930003301966945002501999946001302024961001302037655001202050IND4434769720221118183947.0100401e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443476972DNAL7 a10.1653/024.093.01082doi7 a10113/401382hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL500 0aL001 0aL1001 aLapointe, Stephen L.13aAn Artificial Diet for Diaprepes abbreviatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) Optimized for Larval Survival  ap. 56-62.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aThe root weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) has been reared since 1992 on an artificial diet first reported in 1982. Recently, we have shown that several ingredients included in the original diet have little or no effect on insect performance. Here we examined the effects of 2 principal drivers (cottonseed meal and wheat germ) on weight gain and survival of larval D. abbreviatus in varying proportions along with a non-nutritive filler (cellulose). We employed a geometric design to evaluate amount and proportion combined with response surface models to identify optimal proportions for larval weight gain, larval survival, and development rate. All larval responses measured lead to the conclusion that cottonseed meal is the only major nutritive component, in addition to standard vitamin and salt mixes, required for a successful artificial diet for rearing larvae of D. abbreviatus to pupation. 3aweight gain 3aartificial diets 3amodels 3anutritive value 3alarval development 3aresponse surface methodology 3awheat germ 3acottonseed meal 3aingredients 3aDiaprepes abbreviatus 3amixtures 3amortality 3ainsect rearing 3alarvae 0aoptimization 0amixture optimization1 aNiedz, Randall P.1 aEvens, Terence J.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2010 Mar., v.  93, no.  1 p.56-62dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.093.01083Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/401383Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100406b20100501c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/04/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02366naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010100171300001600272520104400288592002801332650002601360650002701386650001701413650004301430650002101473650001101494650001101505650001701516650001301533650001801546650001801564653002501582653001301607653001401620653000901634700002101643700002001664700002201684700001801706773010001724856008701824852000901911655001201920IND60542310720221119202623.0190402e20150215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054231072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.08.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Tai-Yuan10aInhibitory effect of aqueous extracts from Miracle Fruit leaves on mutation and oxidative damage  ap. 411-416.  aThis study investigated the inhibitory effects of aqueous extracts from Miracle Fruit leaves (AML) on mutation and oxidative damage. The results showed that AML in the range of 1–5mg/plate inhibited the mutagenicity of 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA), an indirect mutagen, and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4-NQO), a direct mutagen toward Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. On the other hand, AML in the range of 0.05–0.2mg/ml showed radical scavenging, reducing activities, liposome protection as well as decreased tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) induced oxidative cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis suggested that the active phenolic constituents in AML are p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, trans-p-coumaric acid and veratric acid. These active phenolic components may contribute to the biological protection effects of AML in different models. The data suggest that AML exhibiting biological activities can be applied to antimutation as well as anti-oxidative damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3acytotoxicity 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman cell lines 3aleaves 3amodels 3amutagenicity 3amutation 3asyringic acid 3avanillic acid 0aMiracle Fruit leaves 0aMutation 0aOxidation 0aHPLC1 aKang, Zhi-Chyang1 aYen, Ming-Tsung1 aHuang, Ming-Hsing1 aWang, Bor-Sen0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 169 p.411-416dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245009700208300001600305520131400321592002801635650001601663650001401679650002001693650001501713650001901728650002601747650001301773650001001786650001901796650001101815650002401826650001501850650000901865650001701874650002301891650001101914650001501925650002001940651001001960653002301970653002301993653002302016653002002039700005402059700001302113700001302126700005602139773010802195856008702303852000902390655001202399IND60601399220221118224556.0190402e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060139922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurarie, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5314-788810aSeasonal dynamics of snail populations in coastal Kenya: Model calibration and snail control  ap. 397-405.  aA proper snail population model is important for accurately predicting Schistosoma transmission. Field data shows that the overall snail population and that of shedding snails have a strong pattern of seasonal variation. Because human hosts are infected by the cercariae released from shedding snails, the abundance of the snail population sets ultimate limits on human infection. For developing a predictive dynamic model of schistosome infection and control strategies we need realistic snail population dynamics. Here we propose two such models based on underlying environmental factors and snail population biology. The models consist of two-stage (young–adult) populations with resource-dependent reproduction, survival, maturation. The key input in the system is seasonal rainfall which creates snail habitats and resources (small vegetation). The models were tested, calibrated and validated using dataset collected in Msambweni (coastal Kenya). Seasonal rainfall in Msambweni is highly variable with intermittent wet - dry seasons. Typical snail patterns follow precipitation peaks with 2–4-month time-lag. Our models are able to reproduce such seasonal variability over extended period of time (3-year study). We applied them to explore the optimal seasonal timing for implementing snail control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma 3acercariae 3adata collection 3adry season 3adynamic models 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3arain 3areproduction 3aseasonal variation 3asnails 3avegetation 3awater resources 3aKenya 0aModel, theoretical 0aNonlinear dynamics 0aPopulation biology 0aSchistosomiasis1 aKing, C.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8349-92701 aYoon, N.1 aWang, X.1 aAlsallaq, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2496-96200 tAdvances in water resources.g2017 Oct., v. 108 p.397-405dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100004200142245007600184300001600260500000900276520150700285592002801792650002001820650001601840650001901856650001301875650001501888650002101903651001001924700002001934700002901954700002001983700001702003773015702020852000902177856007902186655001202265IND4459638420221120215653.0191125e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963842DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2010.03072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontserrat Pujolà, Marithza Ramírez10aSoil Nitrogen Availability after Addition of Thermally Dried Pig Slurry  ap. 940-948.  aepub  aIn the northeast of Spain, the production of large amounts of pig slurry that exceed the fertilization requirements of local field crops is contributing to the deterioration of the soil environment. In recent years, the construction of six treatment facilities has allowed the exportation of nutrient surplus as thermally dried pig slurry (TDPS). Even though it is already used as an amendment, however, little is known about its effect on soil N availability. A long-term aerobic incubation test was used to monitor organic C and apparent N mineralization. After 34 wk, the untreated soil cumulative apparent N mineralization value was 145 mg kg⁻¹ and the potentially mineralizable N (ΘN*) was 196.6 mg kg⁻¹. In soil treated with 1.6 g kg⁻¹ TDPS, the ΘN* increased by 14% in relation to untreated soil. In soil treated with 4.8 g kg⁻¹of TDPS, the ΘN* increased by 24%. The similar patterns of the emitted CO₂–C and the recovered NO₃–N in the untreated soil and TDPS-treated soil show that it is unlikely that significant losses of N occur as gaseous N. It was found that when a low N dose was used, the ΘN*was 66% of that added, but only 37% was detected when a higher dose was used. This suggests that, in relative terms, at higher doses there is less microbiological activity than at lower doses. Adding 62.8 mg N kg⁻¹ as (NH₄)₂HPO₄ and (NH₂)₂CO, however, enhanced the mineralization of the soil organic N, providing 20% more N in relation to the untreated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aedaphic factors 3afield crops 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3apig manure 3asoil degradation 3aSpain1 aQuemada, Miguel1 aJarauta-Bragulat, Eusebi1 aBonmati, August1 aComas, Jordi0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 3 p.940-948dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2010.03073Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04092naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245006800177500001900245520158100264592002801845650002301873650000801896650002601904650001901930650002001949650001701969650001601986650001502002650002002017650001202037650001302049650002602062650001502088650000902103700003002112700002302142700002702165700001902192700002202211700001502233700002202248700005702270700002602327700002102353700005802374700002202432700002102454700002102475700001402496700002002510700001502530700002002545700002202565700002602587700005802613700002202671700006102693700002202754700002202776700001902798700002602817700002002843700002102863700002202884700006002906700001902966700006102985700002203046700001803068773010603086856008503192852000903277655001203286IND60696962120221119181622.0201223e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069696212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1058322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorawska, L.q(Lidia),10aHow can airborne transmission of COVID-19 indoors be minimised?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aair 3aairborne transmission 3adirect contact 3adisease control 3adisinfection 3aenvironment 3afiltration 3ahealth services 3ahygiene 3apandemic 3apublic transportation 3aquarantine 3arisk1 aTang, J.

Apparent molar volumes, V2,ϕ, apparent specific volumes, ASV, apparent molar isentropic compressibilities, Ks,2,ϕ, and apparent specific isentropic compressibilities, ASIC, were calculated from measured density, ρ and speed of sound, u data. Partial molar volumes, V2°, and partial molar isentropic compressibilities, Ks,2° at infinite dilution, transfer parameters (ΔtV2° and ΔtKs,2°), expansion coefficients, [(∂V2°/∂T)P and (∂2V2°/∂T2)P], interaction coefficients, (YAB and YABB) and hydration numbers, Nw, were also evaluated and discussed in terms of solute–cosolute interactions. Further, the effect of protic ionic liquid on the taste behaviour of sucrose has been discussed from ASV and ASIC parameters, as these parameters, which are sensitive to solvation behaviour of solute, are divided into four basic taste qualities occupying certain ranges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aaqueous solutions 3aatmospheric pressure 3aionic liquids 3asolutes 3asucrose 3ataste 3atemperature 0aSucrose (PubChem CID: 5988) 0aAcetic acid (PubChem CID: 176) 0a3-Amino-1-propanol (PubChem CID: 9086) 0aProtic ionic liquid 0aSucrose 0aPartial molar volume 0aHydration number 0aTaste quality1 aChhotaray, Pratap K.1 aGardas, Ramesh L.0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 169 p.478-483dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012100172300001600293520117000309592002801479650002401507650002601531650002401557650001201581650001101593650004301604650001401647650000901661650002401670650001901694650001501713650001601728650002001744651000901764653001201773653000901785653001201794653001601806653001901822653001301841700002201854700006201876700006201938773010802000856008702108852000902195655001202204IND60601399320221118224502.0190402e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060139932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMousam, Aneela10aUsing remote sensing and modeling techniques to investigate the annual parasite incidence of malaria in Loreto, Peru  ap. 423-438.  aBetween 2001 and 2010 significant progress was made towards reducing the number of malaria cases in Peru; however, the country saw an increase between 2011 and 2015. This work attempts to uncover the associations among various climatic and environmental variables and the annual malaria parasite incidence in the Peruvian region of Loreto. A Multilevel Mixed-effects Poisson Regression model is employed, focusing on the 2009–2013 period, when trends in malaria incidence shifted from decreasing to increasing. The results indicate that variations in elevation (β = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75–0.81), soil moisture (β = 0.0021; 95% CI, 0.0019–0.0022), rainfall (β = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.56–0.61), and normalized difference vegetation index (β = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.83–2.43) is associated with higher annual parasite incidence, whereas an increase in temperature (β = -0.0043; 95% CI, − 0.0044-− 0.0041) is associated with a lower annual parasite incidence. The results from this study are particularly useful for healthcare workers in Loreto and have the potential of being integrated within malaria elimination plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3aenvironmental factors 3ahealth care workers 3amalaria 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aparasites 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater resources 3aPeru 0aMalaria 0aPeru 0aClimate 0aEnvironment 0aRemote sensing 0aModeling1 aMaggioni, Viviana1 aDelamater, Paul L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3627-97391 aQuispe, Antonio M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2100-74230 tAdvances in water resources.g2017 Oct., v. 108 p.423-438dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100004300164245011600207300001800323520107100341592002801412650001101440650001001451650001201461650001701473650001401490650001501504650001301519650001601532650003001548650001201578650002401590650005201614650002701666650001101693650002201704650004201726650000901768650003101777650001701808650002801825650001701853651001101870700002801881700002701909700002701936700002301963700003601986700002002022773011402042856004802156852000902204655001202213IND4470440520221123020752.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447044052DNAL7 a214795702pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-011-9849-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Santiago-Miramontes, María Angeles14aThe effect of flushing and stimulus of estrogenized does on reproductive performance of anovulatory-range goats  ap. 1595-1600.  aThis study was conducted to determine whether flushing or the stimulus of estrogenized goats is necessary to achieve a high reproductive response in anestrous goats on rangeland. Does were feed-supplemented on rangeland (flushed, n = 20). Other group was exposed to estrogenized does during the mating period (stimulated, n = 20). A third group was both supplemented and stimulated (stimulated–flushed, n = 20) and other group grazed on rangeland only (control, n = 18). More goats in the stimulated and stimulated–flushed groups showed estrus during the first 5 days of joining (45% and 60%, respectively) than the control and flushed groups (11% and 5%, respectively; P < 0.05). Flushing did not improve prolificacy and reduced (P < 0.05) kidding rates (40% and 35% for the flushed and stimulated–flushed groups, respectively) compared to 67% and 55% for the control and stimulated groups, respectively. This experiment demonstrates potential shortcomings of use of flushing in range goats with inadequate nutrition during gestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestrus 3agoats 3agrazing 3akidding rate 3apregnancy 3arangelands 2aAnestrus 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aDietary Supplements 2aEstradiolxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aEstrus Synchronization 2aFemale 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aInjections, Intramuscularxveterinary 2aMale 2aProgesteronexpharmacology 2aReproduction 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aTime Factors 0aMexico1 aLuna-Orozco, Juan Ramon1 aMeza-Herrera, Cesar A.1 aRivas-Muñoz, Raymundo1 aCarrillo, Evaristo1 aVéliz-Deras, Francisco Gerardo1 aMellado, Miguel0 tTropical animal health and production.g2011 Dec., v. 43, no. 8 p.1595-1600dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-011-9849-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012500174300001200299500001900311520181300330592002802143650003802171650001602209650001902225650002202244650001902266650001902285650001902304650001802323650002502341650001302366650001702379650004302396650001402439650002602453653000802479653001402487653000902501653001302510653001102523700002302534700002002557700002302577700002402600700002002624773009702644856008502741852000902826655001202835IND60696962320221119181630.0200712e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069696232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2020.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-maadawy, Eman A.10aRegulation of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ cells in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL): Implication of cytokines and miRNAs  ap. 1-8.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRegulatory T cells (Tregs) is one of the immunosuppressive subsets of CD4⁺ T cells characterized by transcription factor forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) expression which are involved in tumor development and progression. Identification of the factors that influence Treg cell function is extremely important. Our current study aimed to evaluate the frequency of Treg cells, cytokine secretion and the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. The frequency of CD3⁺, CD4⁺ and CD4⁺CD25⁺FOXP3⁺ Treg was assessed by flow cytometry in 43 ALL patients versus 42 controls. Plasma levels of IL-10, transcription factor β (TGF-β), IL-6, IL-17, IL-23 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) were measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). miR-21, miR-24, miR-26a, miR133b, miR-148a and miR-155 expression were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A slight insignificant increase in Treg cells in ALL patients compared to controls was observed. There was a significant elevation in IL-10 (p < 0.05), IL-6 (p < 0.01), IL-23 (p < 0.05) and TNF-α (p < 0.01) in ALL patients compared with controls. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in TGF-β (p < 0.001) was recorded. A slight insignificant decrease in IL-17 in ALL patients was observed.ALL patients showed a significant increase in miR-21 (p < 0.05), miR-148a (p < 0.01), miR-24 (p < 0.05) and a significant reduction in miR-155 (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the slight change in Treg cells frequency and alteration in related cytokines could possibly involve in the pathogenesis of ALL. Dysregulated miRNAs, as a regulatory mechanism of epigenetics, might contribute to these observed results. Further researches are required to confirm our interesting findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepigenetics 3aflow cytometry 3aimmunosuppression 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-23 3ainterleukin-6 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amicroRNA 3apathogenesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3atranscription factors 0aALL 0aPediatric 0aTreg 0aCytokine 0amiRNAs1 aElshal, Mohamed F.1 aBakry, Rania M.1 aMoussa, Mohamed M.1 aEl-Naby, SobhyHasab1 aTalaat, Roba M.0 tMolecular immunology.g2020 Aug., v. 124 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245008500160300001800245520092900263592002801192650001201220650001101232650001901243650001201262650001501274650002101289650002001310650001601330650001301346650002201359650000901381650001301390650001101403700001901414700002201433773014701455856007801602852000901680655001201689IND60540992320221121001507.0160820e20150422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054099232DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b019652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, Job L.10aDecarboxylation of Fatty Acids to Terminal Alkenes by Cytochrome P450 Compound I  ap. 4940-4943.  aOleTJE, a cytochrome P450, catalyzes the conversion of fatty acids to terminal alkenes using hydrogen peroxide as a cosubstrate. Analytical studies with an eicosanoic acid substrate show that the enzyme predominantly generates nonadecene and that carbon dioxide is the one carbon coproduct of the reaction. The addition of hydrogen peroxide to a deuterated substrate–enzyme (E–S) complex results in the transient formation of an iron(IV) oxo π cation radical (Compound I) intermediate which is spectroscopically indistinguishable from those that perform oxygen insertion chemistries. A kinetic isotope effect for Compound I decay suggests that it abstracts a substrate hydrogen atom to initiate fatty acid decarboxylation. Together, these results indicate that the initial mechanism for alkene formation, which does not result from oxygen rebound, is similar to that widely suggested for P450 monooxygenation reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3acoproducts 3acytochrome P-450 3adecarboxylation 3afatty acids 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3aisotopes 3aoxygen1 aHsieh, Chun H.1 aMakris, Thomas M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Apr. 22, v. 137, no. 15 p.4940-4943dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b019653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01328naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011100154300001800265520022800283592002800511650000800539650001500547650002300562650001100585650001700596650002100613650001300634650000900647700001700656700001500673700001600688700001800704700001400722773013400736856007500870852000900945655001200954IND60658991320221121195613.0190826e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065899132DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12006a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Meng10aLabel-free fluorescent detection of Cu(ii) ions based on DNA cleavage-dependent graphene-quenched DNAzymes  ap. 7749-7751.  aWe developed a novel and general methodology to design a label-free fluorescent Cu(ii) sensor based on internal DNA cleavage and an extrinsic fluorophore in a graphene/DNAzymes complex with high sensitivity and selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agraphene 3aions1 aZhao, Huimin1 aChen, Shuo1 aYu, Hongtao1 aZhang, Yaobin1 aQuan, Xie0 tChemical communications.g2011 June 28, v. 47, no. 27 p.7749-7751dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc12006a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245004700163300001200210520158600222592002801808650002001836650002101856650001001877650001801887650001001905650001101915650001801926650001101944650001901955700001501974700001401989773009402003856008402097852000902181655001202190IND50070822320221119110357.0190318e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007082232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2013.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeira, I.10aDietary restraint predicts snacking memory  ap. 482.  aEvidence suggests that food memories may be influenced by eating habits. However, the relationship between restraint, emotional, and external eating and food memories has yet to be thoroughly investigated or compared to visual memory more generally. Here we investigated the relationship between scores on the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ), snack recall, and visual memory. 100 female undergraduate students participated, with a mean age of 18.8years, and a mean BMI of 22.3. Participants consumed a snack of 7 different coloured jelly beans, followed by either an immediate snack recall or a delayed recall. Recall required participants to list the colour order in which they consumed each Jelly Bean. Both groups then completed two computerized neuropsychological tests of visual memory. The Food Preoccupation Questionnaire was also completed to test for mediation effects. Hunger at baseline and BMI were not related to snack recall accuracy. Linear regression showed that restraint was a significant predictor of recall accuracy (higher restraint was associated with better recall) and recall accuracy was also related to food preoccupation scores. A Structural Equation Model showed that food preoccupation mediated the relationship between restraint and recall. In addition, restraint predicted enhanced visual memory but only in the later more difficult stages of a paired associated learning task. Further investigation is required to assess whether restrained eaters enhanced ability to recall eaten foods contributes to actual reductions in dietary intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acollege students 3acolor 3aeating habits 3afoods 3ahunger 3alinear models 3amemory 3aquestionnaires1 aChirwa, B.1 aHiggs, S.0 tAppetite.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 71 p.482-482dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2013.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01667naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245013000164300001800294520050000312592002800812650002300840650002300863650001400886650001700900650002000917700001300937700001500950700001400965700001300979700005400992700005801046773012101104856008301225852000901308655001201317IND60653933820221116183950.0190722e20190708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065393382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b021492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Yang10aPd(0)-Catalyzed Cyclizative Phosphorylation of (Z)-1-Iodo-1,6-diene: Synthesis of Alkylphosphonate and Alkylthionophosphonate  ap. 5742-5746.  aA palladium-catalyzed cyclizative phosphorylation reaction of (Z)-1-iodo-1,6-diene with diethyl H-phosphonate is developed, which provides facile access to unsaturated six-membered heterocycles bearing an alkylphosphonate group.

Location Global. Methods General area cladograms (GACs) are a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of a set of areas and unrelated clades within those areas. Nodes on a GAC correspond to speciation events in a group of taxa; general nodes are those at which multiple unrelated clades speciate. We undertake temporal calibration of GACs using molecular clock estimates of splitting events between extant taxa as well as first appearance data from the fossil record. We present two examples based on reâanalysis of previously published data: first, a temporally calibrated GAC generated from secondary Brooks parsimony analysis (BPA) of six extant bird clades from the southâwest of North America using molecular clock estimates of divergence times; and second, an analysis of African Neogene mammals based on a phylogenetic analysis for comparing trees (PACT) analysis. Results A hypothetical example demonstrates how temporal calibration reveals potentially critical information about the timing of both unique and general events, while also illustrating instances of incongruence between dates generated from molecular clock estimates and fossils. For the African Neogene mammal dataset, our analysis reveals that most mammal clades underwent geodispersal associated with the Neogene climatic optimum (c.â16âMa) and vicariant speciation in central Africa correlated with increased aridity and cooler temperatures around 2.5âMa. Main conclusions Temporally calibrated GACs are valuable tools for assessing whether coordinated patterns of speciation are associated with largeâscale climatic or tectonic phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3adata collection 3amammals 3aphylogeny 3aNorth America1 aEvans, David C.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2012 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.688-697dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02643.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01269naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245004800169300001600217520031800233592002800551653001100579653001500590653002500605653001700630653001000647700001700657700002100674700001700695773015000712856008400862852000900946655001200955IND60558726420221119030907.0161115e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055872642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijmyco.2016.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Bindiya10aGenital tuberculosis: Unusual presentations  ap. 357-359.  aGenital tract tuberculosis is usually secondary to extragenital tuberculosis.

Field studies were conducted at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan during the cropping seasons for three years, from 2010 to 2012, with ten open pollinated maize varieties (OPVs) derived from two breeding eras (1 and 2). The ten OPVs and their crosses were evaluated under high-N and low-N conditions. The aim was to identify superior populations that may be useful sources genes for inbred line extraction and hybrid development for grain yield. Under low-N condition, mid and high parent heterosis for grain yield were low indicating the suitability of the hybrids for cultivation only in environments with high productivity index. Hybrid DMR-LSR-W (Era 1) × TZSR-Y-I (Era 2) had greatest mid and high-parent heterosis for grain yield under high-N and across the other four test environments. Parent AMATZBR-WC2B with higher general combining ability effects and mean values for grain yield, and cross combinations DMR-LSR-W (Era 1) x BR9928DMRSR (Era 2) and BR9922DMRSR (Era 2) x TZBRELD-4C0W (Era 2) with higher specific combining ability for grain yield under low-N environment are promising candidates for the development of nitrogen use efficient varieties for cultivation in low-N environments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabiotic stress 3acorn 3acrossing 3acultivars 3ageneral combining ability 3agenes 3agrain yield 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3anitrogen 3aopen pollination 3asoil 3aspecific combining ability 3atropical agriculture 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aLow nitrogen 0aZea mays L. hybrid vigour 0aspecific combining ability1 aBello, O.B.1 aAlake, O.0 tOpen Agriculture.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 3, no. 1 p.339-347dDe GruyterwJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2018-00373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245007000174300001600244520065500260592002800915650001800943650001100961650002300972650002200995650001601017650002401033650001201057650001801069650001701087650001601104650002401120650001301144650002001157650001601177653001501193653002301208653001801231653001701249653001401266653002201280653001801302653001901320700002101339773012501360856008301485852000901568655001201577IND60601573720181023000000.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060157372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Guenno, Guillaume10aConduite à tenir devant une carence en vitamine B12 (cobalamine)  ap. 130-134.  aCobalamin deficiency is common in adults.

The whole number of bubbles likely to form in a single glass is the result of the fine interplay between dissolved CO₂, tiny gas pockets trapped within particles acting as bubble nucleation sites, and ascending bubble dynamics. Based on theoretical models combining ascending bubble dynamics and mass transfer equations, the falsely naı̈ve question of how many bubbles are likely to form per glass is discussed in the present work. A theoretical relationship is derived, which provides the whole number of bubbles likely to form per glass, depending on various parameters of both the wine and the glass itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3acarbon dioxide 3achampagne 3aequations 3aglass 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Mar. 20, v. 118, no. 11 p.3156-3163dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp500295e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003300153245005500186300001600241520124700257592002801504650001701532650001201549650001601561650001101577650002901588650002501617650002001642650001801662650001301680651001201693653001801705653003301723653001801756653002301774653001701797700002301814700001801837700002101855700002101876773010801897856008702005852000902092655001202101IND60601399720221118224309.0190402e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060139972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertassello, Leonardo Enrico10aStochastic modeling of wetland-groundwater systems  ap. 214-223.  aModeling and data analyses were used in this study to examine the temporal hydrological variability in geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs), as influenced by hydrologic connectivity to shallow groundwater, wetland bathymetry, and subject to stochastic hydro-climatic forcing. We examined the general case of GIWs coupled to shallow groundwater through exfiltration or infiltration across wetland bottom. We also examined limiting case with the wetland stage as the local expression of the shallow groundwater. We derive analytical expressions for the steady-state probability density functions (pdfs) for wetland water storage and stage using few, scaled, physically-based parameters. In addition, we analyze the hydrologic crossing time properties of wetland stage, and the dependence of the mean hydroperiod on climatic and wetland morphologic attributes. Our analyses show that it is crucial to account for shallow groundwater connectivity to fully understand the hydrologic dynamics in wetlands. The application of the model to two different case studies in Florida, jointly with a detailed sensitivity analysis, allowed us to identify the main drivers of hydrologic dynamics in GIWs under different climate and morphologic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3agroundwater 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 3astochastic processes 3awater resources 3awater storage 3awetlands 3aFlorida 0aCrossing time 0aProbability density function 0aEco-hydrology 0aHydrologic regimes 0aHydro-period1 aRao, P. Suresh C.1 aPark, Jeryang1 aJawitz, James W.1 aBotter, Gianluca0 tAdvances in water resources.g2018 Feb., v. 112 p.214-223dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245018100166300001600347520109100363592002801454650001201482650001601494650001901510650001901529650000901548650001101557650001501568650001201583650002201595650001601617650001701633650002001650650001601670651001101686653001901697653001901716653001801735653002001753653001101773653001101784700001801795700002301813700003101836700001701867773011701884856007902001852000902080655001202089IND60614569120221120050339.0181029e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061456912DNAL7 a10.2478/pjen-2018-00152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanaszak, Józef,10aAndrena florea Fabricius, 1793 (Hymenoptera, Apoidea, Apiformes): a rare bee species in Poland, related to the expansion of the alien plant Bryonia dioica Jacq.

This study investigated the pollinators of Bryonia dioica, an invasive climber in the temperate zone. Flowers of this plant in two cities in western Poland (Bydgoszcz and Poznań) were visited by 27 bee species, the most frequent ones being Apis mellifera and Andrena florea. Until recently, the latter was regarded as rare and threatened in Poland. Our results indicate that the spread of Bryonia dioica into urban areas has enabled large and stable populations of Andrena florea to flourish there. This study investigated the daily and seasonal dynamics of its activity. A positive relationship was found between the spread of Bryonia dioica and the presence of its obligatory pollinator Andrena florea. Alien plant species are thus not only an additional source of food for local pollinators but also may favour the occurrence of otherwise rare species with specific food requirements, such as A. florea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrena 3aApis florea 3aApis mellifera 3aBryonia dioica 3abees 3acities 3aecosystems 3aflowers 3aintroduced plants 3apollinators 3arare species 3atemperate zones 3aurban areas 3aPoland 0aAndrena florea 0aBryonia dioica 0aalien species 0aoligolectic bee 0aPoland 0acities1 aTwerd, Lucyna1 aRatyńska, Halina,1 aBanaszak-Cibicka, Weronika1 aZyś, Teresa0 tPolskie pismo entomologiczne.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 87, no. 3 p.199-215dSciendowJournal:jnl24265x2299-98847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/pjen-2018-00153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245009500160300001600255500000900271520159900280592002801879650002201907650001401929650002501943650001201968650002101980650001602001650001302017650002502030650002802055650001602083650000902099650001002108651001002118700001702128700001802145700001202163700001702175773015702192852000902349856007902358655001202437IND4459639120221120215632.0191125e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963912DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2010.01172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Zhenling10aUsing In-Season Nitrogen Management and Wheat Cultivars to Improve Nitrogen Use Efficiency  ap. 976-983.  aepub  aThe development of more efficient N management strategies and more N-efficient plants is crucial to achieving maximum grain yield with minimum N fertilizer inputs. An on-farm study was conducted during 3 yr (one site per year) with six N levels and two soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars: an N-efficient cultivar (KN) and a major commercial cultivar (LM). The goal was to evaluate the potential to improve grain yield and N use efficiency (NUE) and to determine the optimal N management strategy for the two cultivars in the North China Plain. Optimal N fertilizer rates (ONR) were determined for an in-season N management strategy by estimating soil NO₃–N content in the root zone from a target N value at two wheat growth periods. Compared with farmers’ practices, the ONR reduced N fertilizer by 68%, from 369 to 117 kg N ha⁻¹, without any yield losses while decreasing N losses from 123 to 30 kg N ha⁻¹ across all wheat cultivars and years. Grain yield with ONR treatment increased from 5.5 to 6.4 Mg ha⁻¹ and improved agronomic N efficiency from 12 to 16 kg kg⁻¹, N partial factor productivity from 50 to 61 kg kg⁻¹, and physiological N efficiency from 21 to 37 kg kg⁻¹ for KN compared with LM. More efficient N use, low N demand, and high growth and N uptake postanthesis contributed to high grain yields and high NUE for KN. Changes in N management may not be necessary during early growth for all wheat cultivars, but more N must be available at later growth stages to achieve maximum grain yield for KN, given its high growth and N uptake postanthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3afarmers 3afertilizer rates 3agrain yield 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3awheat 3aChina1 aZhang, Fusuo1 aChen, Xinping1 aLi, Fei1 aTong, Yiping0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 3 p.976-983dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2010.01173Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03058naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245009300172300001600265520162500281592002801906650001301934650000901947650001401956650001401970650002801984650001402012650001402026650002602040650001102066650001402077650001602091650002302107650001302130650003202143650001202175650001602187653001402203653002102217653001402238653002202252653001202274653002102286653001402307653001402321773012502335856008302460852000902543655001202552IND60601573820181023000000.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060157382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2014.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambrier, Cécile10aNutrition en postopératoire.

Several ways, included pharmaco-nutrition, could attenuate surgical stress and reduce postoperative morbidity. The postoperative administration of a diet, containing three immuno-nutrients (arginine, nucleotides and fish oil) (Impact®), reduces postoperative morbidity in all types of serious gastrointestinal surgeries. The effect is greater when the product is given pre-and postoperatively. It is noticeable that the effect of immune-nutrition in patients undergoing ERAS techniques has not been investigated. Several studies showed that intravenous form of glutamine (Dipeptiven®) reduces infectious complications and postoperative hospital length of stay. In patient with major postoperative complication receiving parenteral nutrition, glutamine administration is recommended. There is more uncertainty about the clinical effects of intravenous fish oils (EPA and DHA). Most of studies, conducted in small series of patients, showed a tendency to decrease infectious complications and length of stay. Therefore, in patients on parenteral nutrition and with a high-risk of postoperative complications, it is probably indicated to use lipid emulsions containing fish oil. A minimum length of administration is required (at least five days) to expect to have beneficial effects. The use of pharmaco-nutrients must be integrated into an overall management of perioperative patient whose objective is to reduce the postoperative aggression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3adiet 3aemulsions 3afish oils 3agastrointestinal system 3aglutamine 3ahospitals 3aintravenous injection 3alipids 3amorbidity 3anucleotides 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 3apostoperative complications 3asurgery 3auncertainty 0aChirurgie 0aImmuno-nutrition 0aGlutamine 0aHuiles de poisson 0aSurgery 0aImmune-nutrition 0aGlutamine 0aFish oils0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2014 May, v. 28, no. 2 p.153-158dElsevier SASwJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2014.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01318naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009200160300002000252520036900272592002800641650002200669650002300691650001700714650001100731650001300742700002100755700001900776773013700795856007500932852000901007655001201016IND60658991520221121195654.0190827e20110927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065899152DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12010g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaney, Conor M.10aPromoting peptide α-helix formation with dynamic covalent oxime side-chain cross-links  ap. 10915-10917.  aCovalent side-chain cross-linking has been shown to be a viable strategy to control peptide folding.

(Fam. Liliaceae) is an ethno-pharmacologically acclaimed Ayurvedic medicinal plant. In the present study, aqueous extract of A. racemosus (ARC) was fractionated and screened for the polysaccharide fraction (ARP). The characterization was done by enzymatic, Size Exclusion, gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC–FID), high pressure anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and thin layer chromatographic analyses. Phyto-chemical evaluation confirmed the presence of 26.7% of 2→1 linked fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). They have a degree of polymerization (DP) of nearly 7–8. Cytotoxicity evaluation on P388 cell lines was consistent with low cytotoxicity of the extracts. In vitro Natural Killer (NK) cell activity was evaluated using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from whole blood on a ficoll-hypaque density gradient. K562 a myeloid leukemia cell line, were used as target cells. ARC, tested over the range 0.2–50μg/ml, showed a dose-related stimulation of NK cell activity with a peak increase of 16.9±4.4% at 5.6μg/ml. However, ARP demonstrated a higher stimulatory activity of 51.8±1.2% at 25μg/ml. The results indicate that the FOS from A. racemosus potentiates the NK cell activity and this could be an important mechanism underpinning the ‘Rasayana’ properties of this plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsparagus racemosus 3aLiliaceae 3aanion exchange chromatography 3acytotoxicity 3aflame ionization 3afructooligosaccharides 3ahumans 3amedicinal plants 3amyeloid leukemia 3anatural killer cells 3aneoplasm cells 3apolymerization 3apolysaccharides 3ascreening 3athin layer chromatography1 aConnellan, Paul1 aDeseo, Myrna A.1 aMorris, Carol1 aPraznik, Werner1 aLoeppert, Renate1 aDixit, V.K.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 50, no. 1 p.77-81dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2011.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011500167300001400282500001500296520182700311592002802138650003002166650001002196650002102206650002302227650002402250650001102274650001702285650001302302650001502315651001702330653002302347700002302370773010102393856008102494852000902575655001202584IND4477229420221120225926.0141111e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447722942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2010.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Craig R.10aPredicting the potential distribution of an endangered cryptic subterranean mammal from few occurrence records  ap. 87-94.  a2019-12-05  aKnowledge of geographical distributions and habitat preferences are central to the conservation and management of threatened species. Ecological niche models can be used to map potentially suitable habitat, making them valuable tools in conservation biology. These models can assist in searching for new populations of species with poorly known distributions and can also be used to guide area selection for systematic biodiversity planning. These models have traditionally required ten or more occurrence records for calibration and this has limited the use of these tools in conservation biology, since many threatened species are known from fewer records. However, recently models have been successfully calibrated using few records. To illustrate this, we developed an ecological niche model to map the potential distribution of the endangered Juliana's golden mole (Neamblysomus julianae) in South Africa so that it could be used in searching for unrecorded populations and for area selection in systematic biodiversity plans. A model was calibrated in Maxent using only four occurrence records. Predictor variables included various bioclimatic, soil and vegetation types. The model identified limited suitable habitat within the map region. The first model facilitated the identification of two previously unrecorded populations. A second model was calibrated using the two additional occurrence records. This increased the proportion of correctly predicted presence records. Jackknife analyses indicated that the models were successful at predicting known presences as suitable. This paper demonstrates the use of ecological niche modelling to conservation of a cryptic endangered species with a poorly known distribution and discusses issues that are relevant for the application of this approach to other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographical distribution 3amoles 3avegetation types 3aendangered species 3ahabitat preferences 3amodels 3abiodiversity 3ahabitats 3aprediction 3aSouth Africa 0athreatened species1 aRobertson, Mark P.0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2011 May, v. 19, no. 2 p.87-94dElsevier GmbHx1617-13817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2010.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01415naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156300001800271520025500289592002800544650002300572650002300595650001700618650001600635700001600651700002100667700002500688700002500713700001400738700002000752700001600772700001500788700002000803773013400823856007500957852000901032655001201041IND60658991620221121195547.0190826e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065899162DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12011e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zujin10aHigh hole mobility of 1,2-bis[4′-(diphenylamino)biphenyl-4-yl]-1,2-diphenylethene in field effect transistor  ap. 6924-6926.  aTriphenylamine-functionalized tetraphenylethene shows aggregation-induced emission feature with unity solid-state fluorescence efficiency.

D.10aOn the Viability of Heterolytic Peptide N–Cα Bond Cleavage in Electron Capture and Transfer Dissociation Mass Spectrometry  ap. 2985-2992.  aWhile frequently employed as an experimental technique, the mechanistic picture surrounding the gas-phase dissociation of peptides carrying multiple positive charges during electron capture and electron transfer dissociation tandem mass spectrometry remains incomplete. Despite this mechanistic uncertainty, most proposals agree that the peptide backbone N–Cα bond located to the C-terminal (right) side of an aminoketyl radical formed in a peptide backbone during the electron capture process is homolytically cleaved. Recently, we introduced the “enol” mechanism, which proposes that a backbone N–Cα bond located to the N-terminal (left) side of an aminoketyl radical is cleaved heterolytically. Here, we further validate this mechanism using replica-exchange molecular dynamics to create unbiased representative sets of low-energy conformers for several model tryptic peptide systems (H-Alaₓ-Lys-OH²⁺, x = 3–5). Transition state barrier enthalpies for the cleavage of N–Cα bonds proceeding via the homolytic (right-side) and heterolytic (left-side) pathways, determined by density functional computations, identify the preferred cleavage route for each conformer. These findings support our original hypothesis that heterolytic N–Cα cleavage can exist in a competitive balance with homolytic cleavages, independent of the relative energy of the precursor dication species. Smaller peptide systems see decreased heterolytic N–Cα cleavage probabilities, likely resulting from an insufficient hydrogen-bonding network needed to stabilize and ultimately annihilate the transition state zwitterion. This observation may explain the early dismissal of left-side cleavage pathways based on computational studies employing small model systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3agases 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3apeptides 3atandem mass spectrometry 3auncertainty 3aviability 3azwitterions1 aZhurov, Konstantin O.1 aCorminboeuf, Clémence1 aTsybin, Yury O.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Mar. 20, v. 118, no. 11 p.2985-2992dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp500512a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002700169245013300196300001800329520111500347592002801462650002201490650002701512650002301539650001101562650002101573650002101594650001501615650001501630650001501645650001201660650001101672650001301683650003901696650002401735650005701759650003401816650001201850650002101862650003101883650001601914650003101930650003101961650002301992650002302015650001702038700002302055700002802078700003002106773009702136856008602233852000902319655001202328IND4447193120221123031558.0141110e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444719312DNAL7 a207391802pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.07.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco-Alvarez, Nancy10aEnhanced hexadecane degradation and low biomass production by Aspergillus niger exposed to an electric current in a model system  ap. 1509-1515.  aThe effects of an electric current on growth and hexadecane (HXD) degradation by Aspergillus niger growth were determined. A 450-mL electrochemical cell with titanium ruthenium-oxide coated electrodes and packed with 15g of perlite (inert biomass support) was inoculated with A. niger (2.0×10⁷ spores (g of dry inert support)⁻¹) and incubated for 12days (30°C; constant ventilation). 4.5days after starting culture a current of 0.42mAcm⁻² was applied for 24h. The current reduced (52±11%) growth of the culture as compared to that of a culture not exposed to current. However, HXD degradation was 96±1.4% after 8days whereas it was 81±1.2% after 12days in control cultures. Carbon balances of cultures not exposed to current suggested an assimilative metabolism, but a non-assimilative metabolism when the current was applied. This change can be related to an increase in total ATP content. The study contributes to the knowledge on the effects of current on the mycelial growth phase of A. niger, and suggests the possibility of manipulating the metabolism of this organism with electric current.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahexadecane 3ametabolism 3aperlite 3aspores 3atitanium 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAlkanesxmetabolism 2aAspergillus nigerxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aElectricity 2aElectrochemical Techniques 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aModels, Biological 2aOxygen Consumption 2aTime Factors1 aGonzález, Ignacio1 aDamian-Matsumura, Pablo1 aGutiérrez-Rojas, Mariano0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Jan., v. 102, no. 2 p.1509-1515dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.07.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113024002200148040001800170100002200188245010100210300001800311500001500329506007600344520060900420592002801029506003701057650002001094650001101114650001001125650002901135650001401164650002501178650006001203650001201263650002101275650003701296650001801333650002801351650002001379650001401399650002701413650002201440653002401462700002001486700002401506700001701530700001501547773009801562856004801660852000901708655001201717IND50068111620221207095852.0130726e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006811162DNAL7 a235085492pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-013-1666-y2doi7 aPMC58747962pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeverini, Alberto10aGenome sequence of a chimpanzee herpesvirus and its relation to other primate alphaherpesviruses  ap. 1825-1828.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study reports the complete genome sequence of chimpanzee herpesvirus (ChHV), an alphaherpesvirus isolated from a chimpanzee.

Of the 650 soils in the National Soil Survey database classified as Spodosols, 47 contain sufficient ortstein to be classified in the ortstein rupture-resistance class; another 42 soils contain materials that are <50% cemented and, therefore, not officially recognized as ortstein. Well-developed ortstein averages 41 cm in thickness and is moderately cemented, dense (bulk density 1.60 g cm⁻³), massive, very firm to extremely firm, predominantly in sandy particle-size classes, and may contain living roots. Because soils with and without ortstein often occur on the same landforms, soils containing >5% ortstein (89 series) were compared with geographically associated and competing soil series (59) that lack ortstein, using analysis of variance. Soils with ortstein occur on lesser slopes (p = 0.001) and at lower elevations (p = 0.015) than soils without ortstein. The lower depth boundary and thickness of the spodic horizon were significantly greater (p = 0.001) in soils with ortstein than in those without ortstein. The data suggest that soil water transporting cementing materials (Fe, Al, Si, and dissolved organic C) moves more slowly in landscape positions where ortstein eventually forms than in those where it is absent. However, ortstein is not restricted to soils with poor drainage as only 39% of the soils with ortstein have an aquic soil moisture regime. From a weight-of-evidence assessment, ortstein is cemented by Al-organic complexes and short-range-order compounds, and placic horizons are cemented by Fe as ferrihydrite or as Fe-organic complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodosols 3aaluminum 3aanalysis of variance 3abulk density 3adatabases 3adissolved organic carbon 3adrainage 3aferrihydrite 3airon 3alandforms 3alandscapes 3aparticle size 3aroots 3asilicon 3asoil surveys 3asoil water 3aweight-of-evidence 3aFlorida 3aMichigan0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 3 p.994-1005dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2010.02143Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03395naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100003400189245018000223300001400403520217200417592002802589653003702617653001402654653001502668653003002683700001302713700001702726700003102743700001802774700002002792700002202812773010802834856008202942852000903024655001203033IND60569322720221118115129.0170710e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056932272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ctro.2017.03.0042doi7 aPMC58339212pmcid7 a295942072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoganadane, Gokoulakrichenane10aPatterns of loco regional failure in women with breast cancer treated by Postmastectomy Conformal Electron Beam Radiation Therapy (PMERT): Large scale single center experience  ap. 46-50.  aTo evaluate loco regional control and describe the patterns of loco regional failure in women with breast cancer irradiated by a previously described post-mastectomy highly conformal electron beam radiotherapy technique.We included all women irradiated by PMERT for non-metastatic breast cancer (BC) between 2007 and 2011 in our department. All cases of bilateral BC were excluded. All patients who experienced loco regional recurrence have been studied. Mapping patterns of regional recurrences was also performed and compared with the ESTRO and RTOG Guidelines of volume definition and delineation guidelines.Among the 796 women included, 10.1% were triple-negative (TN) and 18.8% were HER2-positive and 24.6% of them had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT). Internal mammary chain (IMC), supraclavicular (Level IV), infraclavicular (Levels III and II) and axillary LN (Level I) were treated in 85.6%, 88.3%, 77.9% and 14.9% of cases, respectively. With a median follow-up of 64months (range: 6–102), 5-year locoregional (RFS and OS were 90% (95% CI: 88.1–92.4) and 90.9% (95% CI: 88.9–93), respectively. Twenty-three patients (2.9%) presented locoregional recurrences. Most of them presented aggressive biological features with grade III tumors in 17 patients (74%) with high mitotic index in 16 cases (70%) and triple negative tumors in 12 (52%). Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was observed in 11 cases (48%). In 14 cases the locoregional recurrences were diagnosed at the same time as the metastatic disease whereas 4 patients presented distant metastases secondarily. Local (Chest wall) recurrences occurred in 13 cases (56%) with the coverage by the isodose of 47.5Gy (isodose 95%). Fifteen regional recurrences (lymph nodes) were observed in 13 patients. Only 3 regional recurrences occurred within irradiated volumes and 12 regional recurrences occurred outside irradiated areas.In presented series, the local recurrences were related mostly to the tumor biological aggressivity and radio resistance. Small number was caused by geographical miss.

W.10aEffects of Deproteinized Alfalfa Juice Applied to Alfalfa - Bromegrass, Bromegrass, and Corn  ap. 685-689.  aepub  aNutrient and dry matter losses when harvesting alfalfa (Medicago sativa L) in humid areas of the U.S. are often 15 to 30% or more. A harvesting system designed to minimize these losses, in which standing alfalfa is chopped in the field, pressed to reduce moisture, and the juice processed to extract protein, has been under investigation. When alfalfa is processed in this manner, the products are a pressed forage that is ensiled, a protein concentrate feed, and deproteinized alfalfa juice (DAJ). The DAJ constitutes over half of the weight of the harvested green alfalfa and must be disposed of to avoid pollution problems. Alfalfa requires a high level of soil fertility to produce maximum yields of forage. DAJ contains relatively large amounts of N and K, as well as smaller amounts of P, Ca, Mg, and micro-elements. The objective of these field experiments was to determine the effects of DAJ from first crop alfalfa applied as a fertilizer. DAJ was applied at annual rates of 0, 0.625, 1.25,. and 2.5 cm to an alfalfa-bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) mixture, pure bromegrass, and corn (Zea mays L.). Increased yields of all three crops were obtained with the annual application of 1.25 cm of DAJ. Plant damage and yield reductions occurred to alfalfa and corn when DAJ was applied at rates of 2.5 cm, with only minor damage to bromegrass. Per hectare yields of crude protein were increased by fertilizing with DAJ. Available P and exchangeable K in the soil generally increased with each increment of DAJ applied, and pH was maintained at satisfactory levels as a result of Ca and Mg additions from DAJ. It was concluded that DAJ applied at rates up to 1.25 cm annually can increase production of alfalfa, bromegrass, and corn. Rates higher than this results in injury or damage to plants, the cause of which has not been ascertained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus inermis 3aMedicago sativa 3aZea mays 3aalfalfa 3aapplication rate 3acalcium 3acorn 3acrop production 3acrops 3acrude protein 3aexchangeable potassium 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3aharvesting 3ajuices 3amagnesium 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplant damage 3apollution 3aprotein concentrates 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3aUnited States1 aSmith, Dale1 aWalgenbach, R.

The study involved three growth experiments: (E1) diets containing 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5% of FO, respectively; (E2) diets in which FO was serially replaced by 25, 50, 75 and 100% FlaxO, respectively; and (E3) diets in which FO was serially replaced by 25, 50, 75 and 100% CO, respectively. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, abalone fed a diet supplemented with 1.5% FO showed a significantly higher (121.2 ± 1.1 mg day⁻¹) daily growth rate of weight (DGRw) compared to control (70.1 ± 1.71 mg day⁻¹). In Experiment 2, abalone fed 1.5% FO diet and diets containing 25–75% FlaxO showed no significant differences in DGRw. The diet containing 100% FlaxO showed significantly lower (63.3 ± 6.7 mg day⁻¹) DGRw. In Experiment 3, abalone fed diets containing 25% and 50% CO showed similar DGRw as those fed a 1.5% FO diet. The diet containing 75% and 100% CO showed significantly lower (63.7 ± 5.0 to 95.4 ± 5.1 mg day⁻¹) DGRw. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with 1.5% of dietary FO can improve growth performance in cultured abalone. It is feasible to replace 75% of dietary FO with FlaxO and 50% of dietary FO with CO, without negative effect on growth performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola oil 3afeed supplements 3afish oils 3agrowth performance 3alinseed oil 3amollusc culture 3avegetable oil 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxpharmacology 2aDietary Supplements 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxpharmacology 2aFish Oilsxpharmacology 2aLinseed Oilxpharmacology 2aMolluscaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects1 aLewandowski, Paul A1 aSu, Xiao Q0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2013 Apr., v. 93, no. 6 p.1389-1396dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5905  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002700167245011200194300001600306500000900322520199200331592002802323650001802351700001602369700001602385773012202401852000902523856009702532655001202629991594293640742620221116224623.0191122e197707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790948012DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1977.00021962006900040041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalgenbach, Richard P.10aGrowth and Chemical Composition of Alfalfa Fertilized in Greenhouse Trials with Deproteinized Alfalfa Juice  ap. 690-694.  aepub  aAlfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) needs adequate fertilization to maintain herbage yields. The deproteinized alfalfa juice (DAJ) remaining after the protein is extracted from green alfalfa has been used to fertilize alfalfa and other crops. However, plant damage occurred when the DAJ was applied at depths greater than 1.25 cm. The purpose of this greenhouse study with alfalfa was to observe more closely the possible causes of plant damage when DAJ is applied as fertilizer. DAJ was applied to alfalfa stubble after herbage harvest, and the alfalfa was cut three times at 24-day intervals. Alfalfa plants were growing in Piano silt loam soil (Typic Argiudoll) in Exp. 1, and in Miami silt loam soil (Typic Hapludalf) in Exp. 2. In Exp. 1, DAJ rates were 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 cm, and in Exp. 2, rates were 0, 0.16, 0.31, 0.62, 1.25, and 2.50 cm. Treatments also included two rates of K as K₂SO₄ and the ashed equivalent (AE) of 5.0 cm DAJ in Exp. 1 and of 1.25 cm in Exp. 2. Alfalfa plants fertilized with DAJ at rates of 1.25 cm or higher showed chlorotic symptoms and growth retardation. Only a few plants survived at the 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 cm rates. Plants fertilized with K₂SO₄ and with AE of DAJ grew normally. First-harvest and overall herbage yields were imilar to those of the control, except for significantly lower yields at 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 cm rates in Exp. 1. Concentratious of N, K, Cl, and Mn in first-harvest herbage generally were increased by DAJ treatments, while other elements were decreased or were similar to control herbage. Soil salt indexes (conductivity of soil solution) increased with each increase in DAJ, but initial plant damage at high DAJ levels did not appear to be due to salt accumulation nor to any elemental toxicity. It is concluded that unknown-phytotoxius contained in the DAJ or produced as microfloral breakdown products are the probable causes of plant damage. Further work is needed to identify these phytotoxic substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphytotoxicity1 aSmith, Dale1 aReam, H.

Our hypothesis was that SW1, as measured on the scales of adult Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), is a proxy for ocean productivity on the continental shelf, a rearing area for young salmon and groundfish. Less negative TC index values are the result of a cool late summer followed by a warm spring, conditions favorable for groundfish YCS. In the GOA, SW1 was a positive predictor of age‐1 pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), but not age‐2 sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) YCS, indicating that the growth of the Karluk River sockeye salmon that enter Shelikof Strait is a proxy for ocean conditions experienced by age‐0 pollock. Contrary to our hypotheses, the TC index was a negative predictor of GOA pollock YCS; and the SW1 a negative predictor of EBS pollock and cod YCS since the 1980s. Recent fisheries oceanography survey results provide insight into possible mechanisms to support the inverse SW1 and YCS relationship. For the EBS, the TC index was a significant positive predictor for pollock and cod YCS, supporting the hypothesis that a cool late summer followed by a warm spring maximizes the over‐wintering survival of pollock and cod (Gadus macrocephalus), especially since the 1980s. The TC and SW1 index showed value for the assessment of pollock and cod, but not sablefish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus nerka 3arivers 3aoceans 3asurveys 3aGadus macrocephalus 3apollock 3aspring 3aoceanography 3asummer 3asalmon 3aecosystems 3atemperature 3acod (fish) 3afisheries 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3aAnoplopoma fimbria 3aBering Sea 3aGulf of Alaska 0aTheragra chalcogramma1 aSTOKES, HOUSTON H.1 aScarnecchia, Dennis L.,0 tFisheries oceanography.g2012 July, v. 21, no. 4 p.307-319dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1054-60067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2419.2012.00626.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100003100142245007900173300001800252500000900270520169600279592002801975650001302003650001602016650002602032650001102058650001102069650001902080650001002099650001902109650001802128650001902146650001502165700001402180700001602194773015902210852000902369856007902378655001202457IND4459640020221120215722.0191126e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445964002DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2010.00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanjurjo, M.

To focus on the origin and role of SWEF in soil genesis, we investigated physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties of SWEF, fine earth, and rock fragments (ranked according to their size as 2–4 mm, 4–10 mm, and >10 mm) of volcanic Entisols. These soils were chosen because they formed from highly porous rock fragments whose anfractuosities and vesicles may be niches in which formation, accumulation, and modification of fine particles is favored. Results suggested that in the soil profiles studied, the SWEF, being more weathered than the fine earth, was not a transitional material between rock fragments and fine earth, as found in other cases. The genesis of the SWEF seemed to happen inside the vesicles of the rock fragments, where fine materials produced by weathering of the vesicle walls, derived from roots colonizing vesicles and carried through illuviation, can accumulate. In the vesicles, mineral and organic matter underwent alteration and evolution, probably favored by the presence of an active microbial community. Conversely, the evolution of the fine earth occurred outside the clasts, where it experienced different weathering conditions. With time, the weathering processes inside the vesicles caused the breakdown of the vesicle walls, facilitating the progressive reduction of the clasts size and the consequent mixing of SWEF with the fine earth. The processes that were responsible for the formation and evolution of the SWEF could be considered a pedogenic driving force.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntisols 3ailluviation 3amicrobial communities 3amixing 3aniches 3aorganic matter 3aroots 3asoil formation 3asoil profiles 3avolcanic soils 3aweathering1 aCorti, G.1 aAgnelli, A.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 3 p.1019-1031dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2010.00043Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02872naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012400167300001600291520123100307592002801538650001001566650002601576650001401602650001401616650001901630650001001649650001501659650002101674650001001695650002701705650001001732650001401742650001301756650001901769651001201788653001701800653001801817653001401835653003101849653001201880653001101892653002501903653001701928653001401945653001201959700002001971700002701991700002002018700001902038700001802057773012702075856008302202852000902285655001202294IND60601574220181023000000.0180706e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060157422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2014.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbouda, Yahia10aÉvaluation de la qualité bactériologique des aliments servis à l’hôpital de Sousse (Tunisie) entre 2005 et 2010  ap. 164-170.  aThe study aimed to investigate the contamination of foodstuffs and food served to patients in Farhat-Hached Teaching Hospital, Sousse (Tunisia) and to identify the different incriminated bacteria.Between 2005 and 2010, we appraised 628 samples. Samples were collected throughout the food chain (261 samples of food and 166 surfaces, 130 samples on equipment and materials and 71 on the hands). Results are interpreted according to the standards and legal requirements of the Official Journal of the French Republic.The average proportion of bacteriological contamination was 30%. The distribution of non-compliance for each of the four phases of meal preparation decreased gradually from 2005. Many types of bacteria were implicated: flora aerobic mesophilic, total and fecal coliforms, sulphite-reducing anaerobes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella.According to this study, the risk of foodborne collective illness seems intense. It is therefore mandatory to proceed with the implementation of an approach to reduce the risk of contamination through, inter-alia, the application of good hygiene practices to work towards the implementation of the food safety system preventive (ISO 22000) based on the principles of HACCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHACCP 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanaerobes 3aequipment 3afecal bacteria 3aflora 3afood chain 3afood preparation 3afoods 3agood hygiene practices 3ahands 3ahospitals 3apatients 3arisk reduction 3aTunisia 0aAlimentation 0aMicrobiologie 0aNutrition 0aRestauration hospitalière 0aTunisie 0aSupply 0aHospital restoration 0aMicrobiology 0aNutrition 0aTunisia1 aBouafia, Nabiha1 aMaḥjūb, Muḥammad,1 aBannour, Wadiaa1 aMzoughi, Ridha1 aNjah, Mansour0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2014 Sept., v. 28, no. 3 p.164-170dElsevier SASwJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2014.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01231naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245003800179520026200217592002800479650002200507650001300529650001000542653000800552653000800560653002300568653002000591653001500611653000900626653001200635700002100647700002000668773009800688856008600786852000900872655001200881IND60696963220221119183212.0200614e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069696322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2020.1092602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez-Perez, Adrian10aMusic sentiment and stock returns  aWe develop a novel measure of investor sentiment based on the valence of songs that individuals listen to.

Since physiological characteristics of a barley plant having high N utilization efficiency (grain yield/supplied N) have not been fully elucidated, grain yields and chemical components of Herta barley (Horedum distichon L.) frotn hydroponic cultures with high and low N supply for different growth periods were determined. A high rate of N at 75 ppm was applied for 0 (cheek), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 12 weeks after emergence and low rate of N at 20 ppm for the remaining period to maturity. The highest grain yield and N utilization efficiency occurred by supplying the high rate of N for 5 weeks after emergence. In the primary tiller of the productive and efficient plant at 9 weeks after emergence the leaf-to-stem-N ratio was approximately 7:3, and the P concentrations of the fifth leaf was twice as high as of the second top leaf. This study suggests that an ideal N supply would involve applications of a low rate of N for l week after emergence, a high rate of N for the following 4 or 5 weeks until the first node of the stem becomes visible on the primary tiller and then a low rate of N for the remaining period to maturity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aNPK fertilizers 3abarley 3agrain yield 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3anutrient use efficiency1 aMacLeod, L.

Vertical profiles of these concentrations are routinely collected to obtain information on nutrient dynamics, and simple codes have been developed to analyze these profiles and determine the magnitude and distribution of reaction rates within sediments. However, existing publicly available codes do not consider the potential contribution of water flow in the sediments to nutrient transport, and their applications to field sites with significant water-borne nutrient fluxes may lead to large errors in the estimated reaction rates. To fill this gap, the present work presents GRADIENT, a novel algorithm to evaluate distributions of reaction rates from observed concentration profiles. GRADIENT is a Matlab code that extends a previously published framework to include the role of nutrient advection, and provides robust estimates of reaction rates in sediments with significant water flow. This work discusses the theoretical basis of the method and shows its performance by comparing the results to a series of synthetic data and to laboratory experiments. The results clearly show that in systems with losing or gaining fluxes, the inclusion of such fluxes is critical for estimating local and overall reaction rates in sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3anutrient transport 3asediments 3asolutes 3asurface water 3awater flow 3awater resources1 aDe Falco, Natalie1 aArnon, Shai0 tAdvances in water resources.g2018 Feb., v. 112 p.72-82dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245018100169300001600350520159800366592002801964650001601992650000902008650001402017650001802031650001402049650001702063650002002080650001502100650001202115650001502127650002602142650001402168650001502182650002302197650001302220650001502233650001902248650001802267650002102285650001302306653002002319653001702339653001902356653001502375653001902390653001602409653001802425653001302443773012702456856008302583852000902666655001202675IND60601574420181023000000.0180706e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060157442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2014.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThibault, Ronan10aTexte long argumentaire – CHAMP 7 – Nutrition parentérale en réanimation.

As a consequence of their use in building materials and fabrics, unreacted nonpolymeric PFASs might enter the environment by evaporation or urban run-off. Since the PFAS content of building materials and industrial fabrics is hardly investigated, studies have to be performed in order to assess their total PFAS load. Building material samples (n = 23) and fabric samples (n = 28) were collected and their PFAS content was investigated. A total of 29 PFASs were analyzed (chain length in the range of C₄–C₁₄). PFASs of diverse chain lengths were detected in 53% of the analyzed samples. The sum of PFASs for awning materials and coating samples were amongst the highest. Furthermore, PFASs were detected in the majority of fabrics for maritime applications, public transport seat covers and fluoropolymer facade materials. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to investigate the PFAS concentrations in fabrics for maritime applications, fluoropolymer facade materials and coatings for architectural purposes. Thus, new sources of PFASs were identified that might lead to release of PFASs into the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3aconstruction materials 3aevaporation 3afabrics 3aperfluorocarbons 3arunoff1 aLebertz, Stephan1 aKnepper, T.

Aerated water columns above intact soil cores increased in SRP concentration (up to 73 µµg L⁻⁻¹) over 28 days, whereas the water column in cores containing soil and a Typha litter layer showed no concentration increase (remained < 5 µµg SRP L⁻⁻¹). In the absence of soil, phosphorus (P) uptake by leaf litter and associated microbial biomass occurred rapidly under oxic conditions (max. 24-hr. uptake, 524 ±± 90 µµg P g⁻⁻¹ dry litter d⁻⁻¹), but uptake was slower and less complete under hypoxic conditions. At the highest tested initial P concentration of 1 mg L⁻⁻¹, P uptake by litter under hypoxic conditions (< 0.5 mg O₂ L⁻⁻¹) was 41%% of the oxic rate, or 216 ±± 42 µµg P g⁻⁻¹ dry litter d⁻⁻¹. Differences between hypoxic and oxic P uptake rates, however, were not observed at initial SRP concentrations of 100 µµg L⁻⁻¹ or less. Our results suggest that leaf litter may be important to mitigating soil P release.  aPublisher supplied data 0adecomposition 0ahypoxic 0amicrobial biomass phosphorus 0aoxic 0atreatment wetlands1 aDierberg, Forrest E.1 aDeBusk, Thomas A.1 aWhite, John R.0 tWetlands.g2008 Sept., v. 28, no. 3 p.817-826dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F07-194.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245008700200500002000287520164100307592002801948596008901976596005702065650001402122650001802136650001602154650001102170650002702181650001502208650003002223650002502253650001602278650002902294651001302323700006102336700002202397700002102419700002402440700002902464773012102493856007502614852000902689655001202698IND60789269720221121015732.0220819e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078926972DNAL7 a10.1002/vzj2.201342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyatt, Briana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3393-115710aMesoSoil v2.0: An updated soil physical property database for the Oklahoma Mesonet  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil moisture data from the Oklahoma Mesonet have been used in numerous fields within the Earth sciences, including agriculture, hydrology, and meteorology. Soil matric potentials measured by heat dissipation sensors at Oklahoma Mesonet stations have been converted to soil volumetric water content estimates using soil water retention curve parameters estimated by the Rosetta pedotransfer function. Recently, an improved version of Rosetta, Rosetta3, was released. Informed by this new pedotransfer function and soil sampling at additional locations, an improved version of the Oklahoma Mesonet soil physical property database, MesoSoil v2.0, has been created. This article presents this new soil database, compares soil water retention parameters estimated using Rosetta3 with those derived from the original Rosetta model, and describes the effects of changes in those parameters on estimated volumetric water content. Using the Rosetta3 model led to changes in the estimated water retention parameters, most notably decreases in the parameter α, which is related to the inverse of the air‐entry potential. These changes resulted in volumetric water content estimates that differed from those based on Rosetta1, with mean absolute differences averaging 0.02 cm³ cm–³ across all site‐years and the greatest differences occurring during wet periods. The mean volumetric water content estimated using the Rosetta3 parameters across more than 100 sites was not significantly different from that determined by soil sampling.

The experimental pozzolans are fly ash (FA) and silica fume (SF), and the performance metrics are compressive strength, abrasion resistance, and resistance to lactic and sulfuric acids. There are nine experimental concrete mix designs: concrete without floor hardener (conventional concrete or non-CFH), concrete with floor hardener (CFH), concrete with 15%, 30%, 45% fly ash, and concrete with silica fume and fly ash (CSF4FA26, CSF6FA24, CSF8FA22, CSF10FA20). In acid resistance tests, a groove was cut across the specimen surface to simulate floor spallation. The results showed that the CFH floor had the highest abrasion and acid resistance but suffered from severe acid damage under spallation conditions. Meanwhile, the CSF10FA20 floor had the highest compressive strength and acid resistance under spallation conditions. The statistical analysis indicated that the pozzolanic materials significantly improved the performance metrics of concrete mix designs (p<0.05), compared with the non-CFH mix design (control). The construction costs of CSF-FA floors (THB 118 – 121) and non-CFH floor (THB 116) were comparable, but they were considerably lower than that of CFH floor (THB 196). The acid resistance of CSF-FA floors was higher than that of non-CFH and CFH floors. As a result, the CSF-FA concrete mix designs should be adopted for the construction of swine house floor due to longer durability and better investment return, in comparison with non-CFH and CFH floors which are commonly used in small- and industrial-scale swine farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabrasion resistance 3aacid tolerance 3aagriculture 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3adurability 3afly ash 3asilica 3astatistical analysis 3aswine 3aswine housing1 aU-Tapao, Chalida0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2020, v. 36, no. 6 p.839-846dAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.140253Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245007000162300001600232500001400248520132100262592002801583650001501611650002701626650001001653650001501663650001601678650001901694650002401713650002101737650001401758700002101772700002101793773009401814856007201908852000901980655001201989IND60689973620221119223539.0200424e20081101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068997362DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.73662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, Jennifer L.10aFly-TILL: Reverse genetics using a living point mutation resource  ap. 300-302.  aNAL-light  aMutagenesis with ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) has been the standard for traditional genetic screens, and in recent years has been applied to reverse genetics. However, reverse-genetic strategies require maintaining a viable germline library so that mutations that are discovered can subsequently be recovered. In applying our TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) method to establish a Drosophila reverse-genetic service (Fly-TILL), we chose to screen the Zuker lines, a large collection of EMS-mutagenized second- and third-chromosome balanced lines that had been established for forward-genetic screening. For the past four years, our Fly-TILL service has screened this collection to provide ~150 allelic series of point mutations for the fly community. Our analysis of >2000 point mutations and indels has provided a glimpse into the population dynamics of this valuable genetic resource. We found evidence for selection and differential recovery of mutations, depending on distance from balancer breakpoints. Although this process led to variable mutational densities, we have nevertheless been able to deliver valuable mutations in genes selected by Fly-TILL users. We anticipate that our findings will help guide the future implementation of point-mutation resources for the Drosophila community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3agenes 3agerm cells 3amutagenesis 3apoint mutation 3apopulation dynamics 3areverse genetics 3ascreening1 aTill, Bradley J.1 aHenikoff, Steve,0 tFly.g2008 Nov. 1, v. 2, no. 6 p.300-302dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.73663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03745naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245012000205500002000325520181400345592002802159596009202187596009302279596005302372650001302425650001102438650002002449650001202469650002502481650001502506650001302521650000902534650001502543650001602558650001602574651001102590700006602601700006302667700006002730700006702790700007102857700006902928700006102997773012103058856007503179852000903254655001203263IND60789269820221121024226.0220819e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078926982DNAL7 a10.1002/vzj2.201452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbosa, Luís Romero1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1104-262310aDynamic groundwater recharge simulations based on cosmic‐ray neutron sensing in a tropical wet experimental basin  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough cosmic‐ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is probably the most promising noninvasive proximal soil moisture measurement technique at the field scale, its application for hydrological simulations remains underexplored in the literature so far. This study assessed the use of CRNS to inversely calibrate soil hydraulic parameters at the intermediate field scale to simulate the groundwater recharge rates at a daily timescale. The study was conducted for two contrasting hydrological years at the Guaraíra experimental basin, Brazil, a 5.84‐km², a tropical wet and rather flat landscape covered by secondary Atlantic forest. As a consequence of the low altitude and proximity to the equator low neutron count rates could be expected, reducing the precision of CRNS while constituting unexplored and challenging conditions for CRNS applications. Inverse calibration for groundwater recharge rates was used based on CRNS or point‐scale soil moisture data. The CRNS‐derived retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity were consistent with the literature and locally performed slug tests. Simulated groundwater recharge rates ranged from 60 to 470 mm yr–¹, corresponding to 5 and 29% of rainfall, and correlated well with estimates based on water table fluctuations. In contrast, the estimated results based on inversive point‐scale datasets were not in alignment with measured water table fluctuations. The better performance of CRNS‐based estimations of field‐scale hydrological variables, especially groundwater recharge, demonstrated its clear advantages over traditional invasive point‐scale techniques. Finally, the study proved the ability of CRNS as practicable in low altitude, tropical wet areas, thus encouraging its adoption for water resources monitoring and management.  aPublisher supplied data  a60043/2019‐0cBrazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development  a433801/2018‐2cBrazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development  aCRP D1.20.14cInternational Atomic Energy Agency 3aaltitude 3abasins 3adata collection 3aforests 3agroundwater recharge 3alandscapes 3aneutrons 3arain 3asoil water 3avadose zone 3awater table 3aBrazil1 aCoelho, Victor Hugo R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6669-48561 aScheiffele, Lena M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3621-680X1 aBaroni, Gabriele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2873-71621 aRamos Filho, Geraldo M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7819-25111 aMontenegro, Suzana M.

Abstract. The configuration of cooling systems in commercial holding sheds, where live broilers wait in cage modules for slaughter, varies between processing plants, with cooling system efficacies largely unknown. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to simulate airflow through cage modules in a poultry trailer in a typical holding shed configuration. Three alternative design configurations were simulated in order to better understand the air velocity profiles and to explore potential improvements for better cooling performance. Experimental data were collected within modules in a poultry trailer, parked in an existing commercial holding shed during warm summer conditions. Results from the CFD model had reasonable agreement with measured field data. Simulated air velocities were mostly within one standard deviation of measured values. Simulation of airflow through modules in the base configuration showed that less than 32% of airflow from the fans actually penetrated through the bird-occupied space. Module tiers experienced different airflow penetration due to the ad hoc positioning/alignment of the fans relative to the modules. In the base industry configuration, fans were in fixed positions and the number of fans and their centerline discharge axes did not align with the modules on the trailer. Regions not aligned with the faces of the fans, such as the uppermost and bottommost tiers, and horizontal locations offset from the fans, received the least airflow through the modules. Sections of modules experienced lower air velocity with increasing distance from the fans. Simulation of Design Alternative 2 (which added additional fans so that a fan was centered on each row) predicted an improved fan airflow of 3.08 and 3.05 kg s-1 through the cages in two adjacent rows, compared to 1.52 and 2.15 kg s-1 predicted for the original configuration. The increased air velocity using the alternative design illustrates the potential improvement and need to further optimize the design of these holding sheds. This research showed that a CFD model is an effective tool to simulate airflow conditions on poultry trailers in holding sheds to explore various holding shed cooling configurations and strategies.

However, whether wetland forests follow the same species differentiation patterns is not well known. In this paper we analyze the relationship among species occurrences and selected soil characteristics, particularly salinity and acidity, in several wetland plant communities. Plant specimens were collected and soil samples analyzed for exchangeable cations, chloride, and organic carbon. Statistical methods were applied to assess ββ-diversity and to detect relationships between patterns of floristic variation and spatial variations of the soil conditions. ββ-diversity was high among vegetation communities. Edaphic conditions were heterogeneous, and landward gradients were present only for salinity and some exchangeable bases. This resulted in a lack of a straightforward relationship of vegetation patterns to salinity. More than 30%% of the reported species covaried with at least one of the three acidity-related variables, suggesting that some tolerance to deleterious effects of H⁺⁺ and Al³⁺⁺ at pH values < 4 is likely. Thus, in contrast to what we might expect in deltaic regions, acidity rather than salinity was the major factor driving species organization. However, variation of these soil characteristics taken together accounted for only 40%% of floristic differences among communities.  aPublisher supplied data 0aexchangeable cations 0aorganic carbon 0asoil acidity 0asoil salinity 0aspecies similarity 0atropical diversity 0awetland1 aLaseras, Pilar Lóópez0 tWetlands.g2008 Sept., v. 28, no. 3 p.616-631dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F07-50.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012500159300002000284520036900304592002800673650001500701650001500716650001300731650001700744650000900761650001500770650001700785650001100802700002100813700002000834700001800854700001800872700002000890700001800910700001300928700001700941700001600958700002200974700002000996773012401016856007401140852000901214655001201223IND60664706520221119174824.0190912e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066470652DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45016c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShieh, Fa-Kuen10aSize-adjustable annular ring-functionalized mesoporous silica as effective and selective adsorbents for heavy metal ions  ap. 25686-25689.  aAnnular rings with controllable sizes are successfully created on the surface of COOH-functionalized mesoporous silica (namely, XC-CAR-10, where X represents the number of carbons in the diamines used) for the adsorption of metal ions.

Several best management practices can reduce transport of sediments into wetlands, including the establishment of vegetative buffers. We summarize the sources, transport dynamics, and effect of sediments, nutrients, and contaminants that threaten wetlands and the current knowledge of design and usefulness of grass buffers for protecting isolated wetlands. Buffer effectiveness is dependent on several factors, including vegetation structure, buffer width, attributes of the surrounding watershed (i.e., area, vegetative cover, slope and topography, soil type and structure, soil moisture, amount of herbicides and pesticides applied), and intensity and duration of rain events. To reduce dissolved contaminants from runoff, the water must infiltrate the soil where microbes or other processes can break down or sequester contaminants. But increasing infiltration also diminishes total water volume entering a wetland, which presents threats to wetland hydrology in semi-arid regions. Buffer effectiveness may be enhanced significantly by implementing other best management practices (e.g., conservation tillage, balancing input with nutrient requirements for livestock and crops, precision application of chemicals) in the surrounding watershed to diminish soil erosion and associated contaminant runoff. Buffers require regular maintenance to remove sediment build-up and replace damaged or over-mature vegetation. Further research is needed to establish guidelines for effective buffer width and structure, and such efforts should entail a coordinated, regional, multi-scale, multidisciplinary approach to evaluate buffer effectiveness and impacts. Direct measures in ““real-world”” systems and field validations of buffer-effectiveness models are crucial next steps in evaluating how grass buffers will impact the abiotic and biotic variables attributes that characterize small, isolated wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 0acontaminants 0agrass buffer 0aherbaceous buffer 0ainfiltration 0aplaya1 aMelcher, Cynthia P.1 aHaukos, David A.0 tWetlands.g2008 Sept., v. 28, no. 3 p.594-604dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F07-84.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245009200199500002000291520185800311592002802169650001302197650002802210650001602238650001502254650002702269650002102296650001102317650001302328650002802341650001502369650001202384650001602396700006002412700005902472773012102531856007502652852000902727655001202736IND60789270420221116212959.0220819e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078927042DNAL7 a10.1002/vzj2.201692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, David P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4746-713710aUnreconciled effects of salinity on draining and wetting functions in unsaturated soils  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn a sequence of one‐step outflow–inflow experiments, this study examines the effects of salinity on soil hydraulic properties with the goal of developing a better understanding of how to predict salinity's impacts on soils. The results of this study are compared with estimates obtained using the Hydrus‐1D model for soil water and solute transport. The model assumes a decline in hydraulic conductivity (K), caused by solution chemistry, is constant over the entire hydraulic conductivity function [K(θ)] and equal to a constant reduction factor established at saturation. In contrast with the model assumptions, the results of this study show an increase in the solution chemistry's effect on K with decreasing soil moisture (θ). These findings demonstrate that current models that exclude solution chemistry, or models that assume a constant K reduction for the entire K(θ) function, may be overestimating drainage, recharge, or bare soil evaporation. This research used undisturbed soil cores and simulated irrigation water with decreasing electrical conductivity (EC) from 20 to 0.25 dS m–¹ and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) held constant. Changes in K(θ) were observed only after dropping below an EC of 1.5 dS m–¹, which is consistent with past studies. At reduced soil water contents, however, K(θ) decreased by up to five orders of magnitude relative to native soils. A second experiment was conducted that increased the SAR from 4 to ≥20, held EC constant at 0.65 dS m–¹, and displayed only moderate reductions in K(θ), although K was reduced proportionally more at reduced soil water contents. Therefore, based on the observed results, an integrated K(EC,θ) and K(SAR,θ) model is needed to better predict salinity effects on soil hydraulic properties and is increasingly important as freshwater resources decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3aelectrical conductivity 3aevaporation 3afreshwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3airrigation water 3amodels 3asalinity 3asodium adsorption ratio 3asoil water 3asolutes 3avadose zone1 aButters, Greg L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6045-59851 aGarcia, Luis A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1712-30530 tVadose zone journal.g2021 Nov., v. 20, no. 6 p.e20169-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.201693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245008000158500001900238520139700257536002601654592002801680650001701708650002201725650002501747650001401772650001501786651001401801653003001815653003301845653001601878700001901894700001901913700001801932773011301950856007602063852000902139655001202148IND60735904320221121034924.0210429e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073590432DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.9.e650232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelbin, L.,14aThe Atlas of Living Australia: History, current state and future directions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is Australia’s national biodiversity database, delivering data and related services to more than 80,000 Australian and international users annually.

Environmental metabolomic has emerged to investigate the sublethal effects of ECs. However, lacking noninvasive and real-time sample pretreatment techniques restricts its development in environmental toxicology. Hence, in this study, a real-time and in vivo untargeted analytical technique towards microbial endogenous metabolites was developed via a novel composite solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber of ZIF-67 and polystyrene to realize the high-coverage capture of living gut microbial metabolites. To reveal the exposure risks of typical antibiotic − norfloxacin (NFX) to gut bacteria, four representative bacteria were exposed to NFX at environmentally relevant levels. Using the proposed SPME fiber, 70 metabolites were identified to obtain an apparent metabolic separation feature between control and NFX-treated (10 ng/mL) microbial groups, which revealed that the low environmental relevant concentration of NFX would affect normal metabolism of gut bacteria. Additionally, NFX exhibited species-specific toxic effects on microbial growth, especially Escherichia coli displaying a distinct dose-dependent trend. Antioxidative enzymatic activities results demonstrated that beneficial bacteria maintained the state of oxidative stress while symbiotic bacteria suffered from oxidative stress injury under NFX contamination, further corroborating its impact on human intestinal health. This study highlights the suitability of in vivo SPME in the field of metabolite extraction and simultaneously possesses a brilliant application foreground in the environmental metabolomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanalytical methods 3aantibiotics 3adose response 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironment 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amicrobial growth 3anorfloxacin 3aoxidative stress 3apolystyrenes 3asolid phase microextraction 0aIn vivo solid-phase microextraction 0aNorfloxacin 0aGut bacteria 0aEnvironmental metabolomics 0aOxidative stress1 aFang, Shuting1 aXiang, Zhangmin1 aLiu, Shuqin1 aOuyang, Gangfeng0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 845 p.157335-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245014000198500002000338520158000358592002801938650001501966650001201981650001201993650001302005650002102018650002002039650001102059650001602070650001802086700002402104700001702128700001402145700001702159700001802176773012102194856007502315961001302390852000902403655001202412IND60789270520221116213019.0220819e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078927052DNAL7 a10.1002/vzj2.201582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeyfried, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8081-071310aSlope and aspect controls on soil climate: Field documentation and implications for large‐scale simulation of critical zone processes  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil climate, as quantified by soil temperature (TS) and water content (θ), exerts important controls on critical zone processes. It may be sensitive to variations in local slope and aspect (SA), but this attribute remains poorly quantified at the local scale and unresolved in large‐scale models. Estimation of SA effects on soil climate across multiple scales may facilitated using topographically modified, incoming clear‐sky solar radiation (SR,CS,T). We established six paired automated soil climate monitoring stations on opposing north‐facing (NF) and south‐facing (SF) slopes (4 yr) and collected spatial TS and θ data within the hectare surrounding four stations (2 yr) to measure SA effects on soil climate. Results were compared with physically based simulations and evaluated in the context of SR,CS,T. Spatial θ data were more variable than Ts, and both were consistent with values from continuous monitoring stations. On average, the SF TS was much greater (4.7 °C) and the annual summer drought longer (36 d) than on the adjacent NF aspect. Seasonal variations of TS and θ were different from each other and also different from SR,CS,T. Local conditions, including snow cover, precipitation patterns, and soil properties, largely controlled seasonal variations of TS and θ, which cannot be predicted from SR,CS,T. This indicates that realistic simulation of many critical zone processes requires high‐resolution inputs. Simulations captured first‐order SA effects and could be useful for estimating SA effects in lieu of field monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aclimate 3adrought 3asnowpack 3asoil temperature 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3avadose zone 3awater content1 aFlerchinger, Gerald1 aBryden, Sage1 aLink, Tim1 aMarks, Danny1 aMcNamara, Jim0 tVadose zone journal.g2021 Nov., v. 20, no. 6 p.e20158-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.201583Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011800164520161000282592002801892650001601920650001501936650001401951650001201965650001701977650002401994650001002018650001802028650002102046650001702067650001902084650001602103650001102119650001702130650001502147653000802162653001102170653000802181653000802189653000802197653000802205653000702213653000602220653000702226653000802233653001402241653003002255653002602285700001602311700001702327700001402344700001202358700005802370773009502428856008202523852000902605655001202614IND60759079320221120153650.0211219e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075907932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhaolan10aComparing the effects of polystyrene microplastics exposure on reproduction and fertility in male and female mice  aMicroplastics (MPs) may have an impact on the reproductive development of humans and mammals. However, any effects of MPs exposure on male and female reproductive systems and fertility are still ambiguous. In this study, male and female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to saline or 0.1 mg/d polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) for 30 days or 44 days to determine the effects of MPs on reproductive systems, following which some of the mice were caged for 10 days to mate to test fertility. Another group of mice were given fluorescent PS-MPs to determine the accumulation of MPs. The results show that PS-MPs exposure resulted in more significant accumulation and oxidative stress in the ovary than in the testis. In male mice, the number of viable epididymis sperm and spermatogenic cells in the testes after PS-MPs exposure was significantly reduced, and the rate of sperm deformity increased. In female mice, PS-MPs exposure induced a decrease in ovary size and number of follicles. After exposure to PS-MPs, the levels of Follicle stimulating hormone, Luteinizing hormone and testosterone were reduced, and the estradiol levels increased in the serum of male mice, while the changes in these hormone levels of female mice was the opposite. The mice exposed to PS-MPs had a reduced pregnancy rate and produced fewer embryos. These findings suggest that exposure to PS-MPs damaged the testes and ovaries, induced oxidative stress, altered the serum hormone levels, and induced changes in reproduction and fertility. Female mice appear to be more susceptible to MPs in reproduction and fertility than male mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aepididymis 3aestradiol 3afemales 3afluorescence 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3amicroplastics 3aoxidative stress 3apolystyrenes 3apregnancy rate 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atoxicology 0aMPs 0aPS-MPs 0aROS 0aGSH 0aMDA 0aFSH 0aLH 0aT 0aE2 0aH&E 0aFertility 0aPolystyrene microplastics 0aReproductive toxicity1 aWang, Yunyi1 aWang, Shuwei1 aXie, Jing1 aHan, Qi1 aChen, Mingqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6430-75760 tToxicology.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 465 p.153059-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01851naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245005800159300001800217520084900235592002801084650001801112650002601130650002501156650002601181650002201207700002401229700001901253700002101272700001701293773013101310856007501441852000901516655001201525IND60538546120221122034924.0160815e20120523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053854612DNAL7 a10.1021/ja211790u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMentovich, Elad10aDoped Biomolecules in Miniaturized Electric Junctions  ap. 8468-8473.  aControl over molecular scale electrical properties within nano junctions is demonstrated, utilizing site-directed C₆₀ targeting into protein macromolecules as a doping means. The protein molecules, self-assembled in a miniaturized transistor device, yield robust and reproducible operation. Their device signal is dominated by an active center that inverts affinity upon guest incorporation and thus controls the properties of the entire macromolecule. We show how the leading routes of electron transport can be drawn, spatially and energetically, on the molecular level and, in particular, how the dopant effect is dictated by its “strategic” binding site. Our findings propose the extension of microelectronic methodologies to the nanometer scale and further present a promising platform for ex situ studies of biochemical processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3abiochemical compounds 3abiochemical pathways 3aelectrical properties 3aelectron transfer1 aBelgorodsky, Bogdan1 aGozin, Michael1 aRichter, Shachar1 aCohen, Hagai0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 May 23, v. 134, no. 20 p.8468-8473dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja211790u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245006500162300002000227520119300247592002801440650001301468650001101481650001401492650001201506650001501518650001001533700002301543773012801566856007501694852000901769655001201778IND60534411220221118052318.0160802e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053441122DNAL7 a10.1021/es301093a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, Daniel R.,10aReusing Steel and Aluminum Components at End of Product Life  ap. 10334-10340.  aReusing steel and aluminum components would reduce the need for new production, possibly creating significant savings in carbon emissions. Currently, there is no clearly defined set of strategies or barriers to enable assessment of appropriate component reuse; neither is it possible to predict future levels of reuse. This work presents a global assessment of the potential for reusing steel and aluminum components. A combination of top-down and bottom-up analyses is used to allocate the final destinations of current global steel and aluminum production to product types. A substantial catalogue has been compiled for these products characterizing key features of steel and aluminum components including design specifications, requirements in use, and current reuse patterns. To estimate the fraction of end-of-life metal components that could be reused for each product, the catalogue formed the basis of a set of semistructured interviews with industrial experts. The results suggest that approximately 30% of steel and aluminum used in current products could be reused. Barriers against reuse are examined, prompting recommendations for redesign that would facilitate future reuse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acarbon 3aemissions 3aexperts 3ainterviews 3asteel1 aAllwood, Julian M.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 Sept. 18, v. 46, no. 18 p.10334-10340dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes301093a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01320naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011900160300001800279520033200297592002800629650001700657650000900674650000900683650001800692650001500710650001100725650001300736700002000749700002000769773012200789856007400911852000900985655001200994IND60664706820221119174732.0190912e20140206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066470682DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45019h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhong-Xia10aLabel-free detection of sulfide ions based on fluorescence quenching of unmodified core–shell Au@Ag nanoclusters  ap. 9825-9829.  aBased on the principle of fluorescence quenching, by the interaction between S²⁻ ions and the Ag atoms/ions on the surface of the core–shell Au@Ag NCs, we propose a simple label-free method for the detection of S²⁻ ions with high selectivity and sensitivity by using fluorescent core–shell Au@Ag NCs in aqueous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3agold 3aions 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3asilver 3asulfides1 aZheng, Chun-Lan1 aDing, Shou-Nian0 tRSC advances.g2014 Feb. 06, v. 4, no. 19 p.9825-9829dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra45019h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010500160300001800265520073100283592002801014650002801042650001301070650001201083650001301095650002001108700002101128700002701149700002401176700002201200700002201222700002301244700002301267700001901290700001901309773013101328856007501459852000901534655001201543IND60538546220221122035105.0160815e20120523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053854622DNAL7 a10.1021/ja211869u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilner, Emily

The structure and morphology of these solutions were then investigated by small-angle neutron scattering. We found that >95 vol % of the solute is present as single-layer graphene sheets. These charged sheets are flat over a length scale of >150 Å in solution and are strongly solvated by a shell of solvent molecules. Atomic force microscopy on drop-coated thin films corroborated the presence of monolayer graphene sheets. Our dissolution method thus offers a significant increase in the monodispersity achievable in graphene solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3agraphene 3asolutes 3asolvents 3atetrahydrofuran1 aSkipper, Neal T.1 aHoward, Christopher A.1 aShaffer, Milo S.

The various matrices generated behave differently in phylogenetic analyses as a function of the e-value employed. Based on an optimality criterion that maximizes internal corroboration of information, we show that values of e-105 to e-125 extract the most internally consistent phylogenetic signal. Functional class of most genes and gene families can be accurately determined based on the D. melanogaster genome annotation. We used the gene ontology (GO) system to create partitions based on gene function. Several measures of phylogenetic congruence (diagnosis, consistency, partitioned support , hidden support) for different higher and lower level GO categories, were used to mine the data set for genes and gene families that show strong agreement or disagreement with the overall combined phylogenetic hypothesis. We propose that measures of phylogenetic congruence can be used as criteria to identify loci with related GO terms that have a significant impact on cladogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abiological speciation 3adata collection 3agene ontology 3agenes 3ainformation 3aloci 3aphylogeny1 aLee, Ernest K.1 aO'Grady, Patrick M.1 aDeSalle, Rob0 tFly.g2008 Nov. 1, v. 2, no. 6 p.291-299dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.74813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010100168520203500269592002802304650001002332650001702342650002002359650001802379650001402397650001902411650002502430650001902455650001102474650001402485650001902499650000902518650002202527650002102549650001502570653000902585653002902594653002702623653002202650653001102672700002302683700002302706700002102729700002302750700002402773773009502797856008202892852000902974655001202983IND60759079420221120153721.0211219e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075907942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFragki, Styliani10aIntegrating in vitro chemical transplacental passage into a generic PBK model: A QIVIVE approach  aWith the increasing application of cell culture models as primary tools for predicting chemical safety, the quantitative extrapolation of the effective dose from in vitro to in vivo (QIVIVE) is of increasing importance. For developmental toxicity this requires scaling the in vitro observed dose-response characteristics to in vivo fetal exposure, while integrating maternal in vivo kinetics during pregnancy, in particular transplacental transfer. Here the transfer of substances across the placental barrier, has been studied using the in vitro BeWo cell assay and six embryotoxic compounds of different kinetic complexity. The BeWo assay results were incorporated in an existing generic Physiologically Based Kinetic (PBK) model which for this purpose was extended with rat pregnancy. Finally, as a “proof of principle”, the BeWo PBK model was used to perform a QIVIVE based on developmental toxicity as observed in various different in vitro toxicity assays. The BeWo results illustrated different transport profiles of the chemicals across the BeWo monolayer, allocating the substances into two distinct groups: the ‘quickly-transported’ and the ‘slowly-transported’. BeWo PBK exposure simulations during gestation were compared to experimentally measured maternal blood and fetal concentrations and a reverse dosimetry approach was applied to translate in vitro observed embryotoxicity into equivalent in vivo dose-response curves. This approach allowed for a direct comparison of the in vitro dose-response characteristics as observed in the Whole Embryo Culture (WEC), and the Embryonic Stem Cell test (cardiac:ESTc and neural:ESTn) with in vivo rat developmental toxicity data. Overall, the in vitro to in vivo comparisons suggest a promising future for the application of such QIVIVE methodologies for screening and prioritization purposes of developmental toxicants. Nevertheless, the clear need for further improvements is acknowledged for a wider application of the approach in chemical safety assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acell culture 3achemical safety 3adose response 3adosimetry 3aembryo culture 3aembryonic stem cells 3aembryotoxicity 3amodels 3apregnancy 3aprioritization 3arats 3asafety assessment 3atoxic substances 3atoxicology 0aBeWo 0aTransplacental transport 0aDevelopmental toxicity 0aGeneric PBK model 0aQIVIVE1 aHoogenveen, Rudolf1 avan Oostrom, Conny1 aSchwillens, Paul1 aPiersma, Aldert H.1 aZeilmaker, Marco J.0 tToxicology.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 465 p.153060-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009900156300002000255500001500275520105500290592002801345650002201373650001701395650001301412650001501425650001801440650002001458650001701478650002801495650001401523650001301537650002501550650002101575650001801596653001701614700001901631700001701650700002001667700001601687700001201703700001301715773014301728856007301871852000901944655001201953IND60534411320221118052236.0160802e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053441132DNAL7 a10.1021/es30115782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Wenhong10aDifferential Oxidative Stress of Octahedral and Cubic Cu2O Micro/Nanocrystals to Daphnia magna  ap. 10255-10262.  a2019-12-06  aThis study attempts to understand the impact of different shapes of an individual micro/nanomaterial on their biotoxicities to aquatic organisms. Two differently shaped Cu₂O micro/nanocrystals (cubes and octahedrons with side lengths of 900 nm) were exposed to Daphnia magna for 72 h, afterward several antioxidant biomarkers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in D. magna were measured. We demonstrated the differential influences of two crystallographic Cu₂O nanocrystals on the antioxidant process. Specifically, octahedral Cu₂O nanocrystals showed a higher level of oxidative stress, possibly because of its larger surface area and higher reaction activity of the octahedron. The biomarker results further showed that the oxidative stress and antioxidant mechanism process involved three stages-antioxidant response, oxidation inhibition, and antioxidant inactivation. Furthermore, the accumulation of MDA was mainly responsible for the ROS-induced toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3asurface area 3acatalase 3abiomarkers 3acuprous oxide 3amalondialdehyde 3ananocrystals 3areactive oxygen species 3aoxidation 3atoxicity 3aantioxidant activity 3aoxidative stress 3aDaphnia magna 0aantioxidants1 aWang, Xiaolong1 aCui, Minming1 aZhang, Dongfeng1 aZhang, Yuan1 aYu, Tao1 aGuo, Lin0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 Sept. 18, v. 46, no. 18 p.10255-10262dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es30115783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016200159300002000321520145400341592002801795650002601823650001101849650002101860650002701881650001601908650001301924650001601937650003201953700001801985700001602003700001702019700001602036700001902052700001902071773012402090856007402214852000902288655001202297IND60641098420221120091201.0190505e20160816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064109842DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17096j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Bright10aEffect of alkyl chain topology on the structure, optoelectronic properties and solar cell performance of thienopyrroledione-cored oligothiophene chromophores  ap. 77655-77665.  aWe have investigated a series of oligothiophenes containing a central thienopyrroledione group with rhodanine, dicyanovinyl and octylcyanoacrylate end-capping groups. For each end capping group, two alkyl chain configurations were explored by appending n-octyl chains to the oligothiophenes in both proximal and distal topologies. Substitution of different alkyl topologies and end-capping groups altered not only intramolecular conformations but also intermolecular interactions, thus affecting frontier molecular orbitals and bulk properties such as optical, thermal transitions, solid state packing, and device properties. The electronic properties of the materials were probed in field effect transistors (FETs), single carrier diodes and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell devices. FET devices revealed that all materials behaved as p-type semiconductors with mobilities in the range of 10⁻⁵ to 10⁻³ cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹. In solar cell devices, we observed that the optimal end capping group was rhodanine, while the optimal alkyl chain configuration was the proximal configuration. The rhodanine capped molecule with proximal alkyl chain isomerism led to a power conversion efficiency of ∼2%. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering studies of this series of molecules revealed a strong tendency to undergo edge-on packing with no π–π stacking in the vertical direction, which may limit their performance in BHJ solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical interactions 3adiodes 3aphase transition 3askeletal isomerization 3asolar cells 3atopology 3atransistors 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aYum, Seungjib1 aJang, Bomee1 aKim, Jihyeon1 aKim, Taehyo1 aKim, Jin Young1 aWoo, Han Young0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 16, v. 6, no. 81 p.77655-77665dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17096j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04021naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011700177300001600294500001900310520231900329592002802648650001502676650001302691650001102704650001102715650002802726650001502754650002802769650002302797650001102820650002102831650001102852650001102863650001202874650001602886650001702902650001502919651001102934651001802945653003002963653002302993653002403016653001803040653002403058700002703082700002903109700002603138700003503164700003003199773013203229856008503361852000903446655001203455IND60735904620221121023858.0210429e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073590462DNAL7 a10.3897/neotropical.16.e605792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHentges, Sirlei Maria10aStructure of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities in streams of a sub-basin in the Pampa Biome, Southern Brazil  ap. 249-271.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Piratinim River is located in the northwest of Rio Grande do Sul, and represents an important effluent from the Uruguay River, with streams located far from urbanized areas, in conditions similar to those of environmental integrity, but under the influence of agricultural activities. In this study, we aim at investigating the structure of the aquatic macroinvertebrate community in streams of the Piratinim river basin by observing both spatial and local scales. The sampling was carried out in six streams distributed in three regions (upper, middle and lower) of the basin, thus exploring its upstream, intermediate and downstream stretches, during spring and autumn. Macroinvertebrates were collected using aquatic dipnets and were identified at the family level; trophic-functional categories were established according to the classification adapted to the state of Paraná. The spatial and temporal variations of the groups and of the biotic attributes (density, richness, diversity and equitability) were subjected to Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests and a posteriori Dunn’s tests. The abiotic variables were obtained to verify possible influence on the composition of the macroinvertebrate community, evaluated through a Canonical Correspondence Analysis. We sampled 11,564 macroinvertebrate individuals from 72 taxa, and found a predominance of the collector-filter trophic group. Abundance and richness were different between streams; the highest densities were found in the streams located in the upper region of the watershed (Chuní and Itú). The highest taxon richness was found in the lower region of the watershed (Guaracapa stream), and the lowest richness was found in the two streams for the intermediate region (Santana and Ximbocu). Diversity and equitability did not vary; temporal variations were not found. Canonical correspondence analysis explained 31.7% of the data variability. The main environmental variables that influenced macroinvertebrates distribution were temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, altitude and extension of the riparian forest. Seasonality and the longitudinal gradient along the basin represented determining factors for the structure and distribution of the macroinvertebrate community in the tributary streams of the Piratinim River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aaltitude 3aautumn 3abasins 3acorrespondence analysis 3aecosystems 3aelectrical conductivity 3amacroinvertebrates 3aoxygen 3ariparian forests 3arivers 3aspring 3astreams 3atemperature 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3aBrazil 3aUruguay River 0aenvironmental descriptors 0alotic environments 0aPiratinim watershed 0ariver ecology 0aseasonal variations1 aMenzel, Tieli Cláudia1 aLoebens, Cristiane Maria1 aSiveris, Samuel Elias1 aReynalte-Tataje, David Augusto1 aStrieder, Milton Norberto0 tNeotropical Biology and Conservation.g2021 Apr. 21, v. 16, no. 2 p.249-271dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27346x2236-37777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neotropical.16.e605793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245010100159300001600260500001400276520213000290592002802420650002802448650001702476650002502493650001602518650001302534650002102547650001402568650000902582650001102591650001302602650001302615650002002628650003102648650002002679650001302699700002502712700002202737700001602759700001702775700002402792700002002816700001702836773009502853856007202948852000903020655001203029IND60689974720221119223045.0200424e20090415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068997472DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.78312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarkas, Róbert,10aExploring some of the physico-chemical properties of the LAMMER protein kinase DOA of Drosophila  ap. 130-142.  aNAL-light  aMembers of the highly conserved LAMMER family of protein kinases have been described in all eukaryotes. LAMMER kinases possess markedly similar peptide motifs in their kinase catalytic subdomains that are responsible for phosphotransfer and substrate interaction, suggesting that family members serve similar functions in widely diverged species. This hypothesis is supported by their phosphorylation of SR and SR-related proteins in diverged species. Here we describe a 3-dimensional homology model of the catalytic domain of DOA, a representative LAMMER kinase, encoded by the Drosophila locus Darkener of apricot (Doa). Homology modeling of DOA based on a Sky1p template revealed a highly conserved structural framework within conserved core regions. These adopt typical kinase folding like that of other protein kinases. However, in contrast to Sky1p, some structural features, such as those in helix C suggest that the DOA kinase is not a constitutively active enzyme but requires activation. This may occur by phosphorylation within an activation loop that forms a broad turn and in which interactions between the side chains occur across the loop. The fold of the activation loop is stabilized through interactions with residues in the C-terminal tail, which is not part of the conserved kinase core and is variable among protein kinases. Immediately following the activation loop in the segment between the 9 sheet and helix F is a P+1 loop. The electrostatic surface potential of the DOA substrate binding groove is largely negative, as it is in other known SR protein kinases, suggesting that DOA substrates must be basic. All differences between D. melanogaster and other Drosophila species are single amino acid changes situated in regions outside of any -helices or -sheets, and after modeling these had absolutely no visible effect on protein structure. The absence of evolved amino acid changes among 12 Drosophila species that would cause at least predictable changes in DOA structure indicate that evolution has already selected evolved mutations for having minimal effect on kinase structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aactive sites 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aapricots 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3aloci 3amodels 3amutation 3apeptides 3aphosphorylation 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprotein kinases 3aproteins1 aKovacikova, Michaela1 aLiszekova, Denisa1 aBeno, Milan1 aDanis, Peter1 aRabinow, Leonard J.1 aChase, Bruce A.1 aRaška, Ivan0 tFly.g2009 Apr. 15, v. 3, no. 2 p.130-142dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.78313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013300169520151900302592002801821650002201849650002301871650001401894650002501908650002801933650001501961650001601976650001201992650001402004650001502018650001702033650003002050650001002080651002502090653001802115653002602133653004002159653002502199653002902224700002602253700002602279700001902305700001902324700002002343700002002363700006502383700002002448700002002468700005802488773011302546856008502659852000902744655001202753IND60659347620221117045913.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065934762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1049242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnnami, Mounia10aGrowth-defense tradeoffs and source-sink relationship during both faba bean and lentil interactions with Orobanche crenata Forsk  aOrobanche crenata Forssk., a root holoparasitic weed, represents a major biotic threat of legumes in the Mediterranean region. O. crenata could reduce the yield up to 90%. In this study, the effect of O. crenata on biomass production and partitioning of some faba bean and lentil cultivars were investigated through pot assays. During the first stage of infection, reductions in host biomass were observed on susceptible and resistant faba bean cultivars (53.84 and 27.02%, respectively for Lobab and Misr 3) and on susceptible lentil cultivar (Zaaria). However, during the last stage (host plant maturity), combined biomasses of susceptible faba bean (35.69 g) and lentil (8 g) cultivars were similar to those of non-infested plants (32.45 and 6.62 g, respectively). Considering biomass partitioning over the various host parts, O. crenata parasitism on susceptible faba bean and lentil cultivars greatly increased host root dry mater, but delayed and reduced host reproduction. The relative weight of parasite and host organs were also studied. Thus, a marked decrease of root relative weight was observed during the last developmental stages (up to 63%) accompanied simultaneously with the increase of relative parasitic weight (35.87%). Results suggested that legumes-O. crenata interactions were governed by growth-defense tradeoffs during the early stage of infection, whereas source-sink relationships explained the dry weight diversion from host to parasite during the last phases of the interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrobanche crenata 3abiomass production 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3adry matter partitioning 3afaba beans 3ahost plants 3alentils 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3areproduction 3asource-sink relationships 3aweeds 3aMediterranean region 0aVicia faba L. 0aLens culinaris Medik. 0aSusceptible and resistant cultivars 0aBiomass partitioning 0aSource-sink relationship1 aMbasani-mansi, Joseph1 aBriache, Fatima Zahra1 aOussible, Nada1 aGaboun, Fatima1 aGhaouti, Lamiae1 aBelqadi, Loubna1 aGhanem, Michel Edmond1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0626-76221 aAberkani, Kamal1 aWestwood, James1 aMentag, Rachid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2040-637X0 tCrop protection.g2020 Jan., v. 127 p.104924-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1049243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015600167520149800323592002801821650002501849650001701874650001101891650001501902650002101917650002701938650001201965650001401977653000901991653003602000653002002036653002102056700001302077700001602090700001502106700001802121773011402139856008602253852000902339655001202348IND60773126220221121060007.0220523e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yihua10aNew insights into ferric iron-facilitated UV254 photolytic defluorination of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA): Combined experimental and theoretical study  aUV/Fe³⁺-facilitated PFOA defluorination was often reported and recognized to proceed through a “ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)” mechanism in the literatures. Sufficient Fe³⁺ supply is important for sustaining the LMCT reaction pathway. In this study, an interesting “excessive defluorination” was observed, even the continuous Fe³⁺ supply was cut off, implying a parallel mechanism strengthening PFOA defluorination. Based the results of intermediate products detection, ¹⁹F NMR analysis, and exploration of electron density alternation, transition energy evolution, and bonds characteristics, remarkable electron density perturbation in [PFOA-Fe]²⁺ was revealed. This effect was triggered by the complexation between PFOA anion and Fe³⁺, diminishing electron shielding on the perfluorinated carbon chain. Hence, the dissociation energy of C–C bonds was reduced by maximally 53% (C4-C5). Once attacked by high-flux UV₂₅₄ photons, the perfluorinated carbon chain underwent scission, and subsequent defluorination was achieved via hydrolysis reactions. This parallel mechanism cooperated with the LMCT mechanism, leading to the observed “excessive defluorination.” The degree of UV/Fe³⁺-synergized PFOA defluorination depended on UV₂₅₄ photon flux and Fe³⁺ dosage. High UV₂₅₄ intensity guaranteed fast defluorination kinetics. A [Fe³⁺]/[PFOA] molar ratio near 1 showed the best UV/Fe³⁺ synergic effect on PFOA defluorination.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adissociation 3aenergy 3ahydrolysis 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aphotons 3asynergism 0aPFOA 0aUV254 photolytic defluorination 0aFe3+ complexing 0aElectron density1 aMa, Hang1 aZhu, Jiaxin1 aGu, Yurong1 aLiu, Tongzhou0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 15, v. 434 p.128865-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008900156300001800245520063100263592002800894650001800922650001800940650001900958650001100977650002100988650001601009650002101025700002001046700002501066700001801091700002001109700001701129700002401146700002501170700002501195773012101220856007401341852000901415655001201424IND60664707020221119174816.0190912e20131128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066470702DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45021j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArun, T.

This paper examines the sustainability of augmented freshwater availability in mountain headwater streams for water supply under baseline and future climate change scenarios using an integrated modeling approach. The climate change data in the 2040s (2030–2059), under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, were downscaled for the impact assessment. In the region, climate change raises the average precipitation by 5–7% and the temperature by 13–15% in the 2040s. SWAT–MODFLOW model, integrating Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT2012) and finite-difference Modular Groundwater Flow (MODFLOW) models in a single package, was used to assess the water balance. Results show that extracting a minimum of 16.2 m³/day from the sand storage and 30 m³/day from the aquifer was possible without affecting the groundwater table and water yield. The average annual catchment recharge was 6% of the precipitation under the baseline simulation. Climate change is projected to reduce the average water yield and groundwater recharge by 26% and 19%, respectively. However, the water supply-demand is significantly small compared to the exploitable rate of water in the area. This study was based on limited data, and therefore the findings need to be interpreted with caution, though the model output was validated using satellite products. Construction of a series of sand dams is suggested to maximize the benefit under the potential climate change and water supply-demand increase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aaquifers 3aclimate change 3afreshwater 3agroundwater flow 3agroundwater recharge 3aresearch 3asand 3asatellites 3asoil 3atemperature 3awater conservation 3awater supply 3awater table 3awater yield 3awatersheds 0aHeadwater stream 0aSand dam 0aKorea 0aSWAT–MODFLOW 0aWater conservation 0aClimate change1 aChung, Il-Moon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0163-73051 aKim, Min-gyu,1 aChang, Sun Woo0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2022 June, v. 10, no. 2 p.293-307dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water & Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iswcr.2021.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009400166300001800260520164000278592002801918650001601946650001401962650002001976650002001996650001002016650001602026650002002042650002102062650002002083650001702103650003902120650001402159650000902173650002102182650001502203650001302218650001402231650002002245650001302265650003702278700001902315700003002334700002402364700002302388700002602411773012902437856007402566852000902640655001202649IND60702347220221123024951.0200717e20200716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070234722DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay00358a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKannan, Sanjeev Kumar12aA review on chemical and electrochemical methodologies for the sensing of biogenic amines  ap. 3438-3453.  aBiogenic amines (BA) are biomolecules of low molecular weight with organic basic functionalities (amine group) that are formed by the microbial decarboxylation of amino acids of fermented food/beverages. Hence BAs are an important indicator in estimating the freshness and quality of meat, seafood, and industrial food products with high protein content. The reaction of BAs with nitrites available in certain meat products forms nitrosoamine, a carcinogenic compound. Hence BAs are in general considered to be a food hazard and monitoring the level of BAs in food samples becomes crucial as their high concentrations may lead to health problems. This review offers an overview of the available chemical and electrochemical methods that are typically used for the sensing of BAs in food samples. Certain compounds are known to selectively interact with BAs via chemical or non-covalent interactions and these interactions are often accompanied by fluorescence or visible color changes (sometimes visual detection) that could be monitored/assessed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer or UV-vis spectrophotometer (colorimetric methods). The colorimetric methods are limited by sensitivity and selectivity as they are based on straight-forward chemical reactions. In the case of electrochemical sensing of BAs, mediators are often used which undergo oxidation/reduction to produce intermediates that could interact with BAs accompanied by changes in their electrochemical potential. Overall, this review summarizes the available chemical and electrochemical strategies towards the sensing of BAs with a discussion on further prospects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abeverages 3abiogenic amines 3acarcinogenicity 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adecarboxylation 3aelectrochemistry 3afermented foods 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afreshness 3ameat 3amolecular weight 3amonitoring 3anitrites 3aoxidation 3aprotein content 3aseafoods 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aAmbrose, Bebin1 aSudalaimani, Sudalaimuthu1 aPandiaraj, Manickam1 aGiribabu, Krishnan1 aKathiresan, Murugavel0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 July 16, v. 12, no. 27 p.3438-3453dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00358a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014300172520107400315592002801389650001701417650001701434650002301451650001401474650001901488650001501507653001901522653002001541653002301561653002501584653002701609653001301636700001601649700002201665700001601687700002001703773010301723856008501826852000901911655001201920IND60783870220221120052147.0220905e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078387022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.1017552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aĐidelija, Muamer10aSegmentation scale parameter influence on the accuracy of detecting illegal landfills on satellite imagery. A case study for Novo Sarajevo  aIllegal waste dumping has been widely regarded as one of the biggest source of environmental damage. Illegal landfills are a prevailing problem existing in a large number of countries. To control and better manage illegal landfills, it is necessary to know the current locations and contents of illegal landfills. This could increase efficiency in illegal landfill management and preserve the biodiversity and ecological balance. Remote sensing methods have been proven extremely effective in detecting potential illegal landfill sites. This paper investigates the relationship between the segmentation scale parameter and the detection accuracy of illegal landfill sites in urban areas that are not covered by vegetation or buried in the ground. The research showed that there is an optimal scale parameter (SP = 20) value for the used satellite image Pléiades 1B and area of interest (Novo Sarajevo municipality). The scale parameter's stated value gives maximum Kappa values and Overall accuracy coefficients for detected illegal landfills on the satellite image.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aecological balance 3alandfills 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 0aRemote sensing 0aScale parameter 0aImage segmentation 0aImage classification 0aIllegal waste landfill 0aSarajevo1 aKulo, Nedim1 aMulahusić, Admir1 aTuno, Nedim1 aTopoljak, Jusuf0 tEcological informatics.g2022 Sept., v. 70 p.101755-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.1017553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013300173520081900306592002801125650001001153650001501163650002301178650002301201650002301224650002701247650001301274650002201287653001801309653001701327653003101344653003301375700002201408700005801430700002301488700002401511700001901535700002501554773010901579856008501688852000901773655001201782IND60679588520221118212709.0200217e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067958852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2019.1515432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPresnukhina, Sofia10aEntry into (E)-3-(1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)acrylic acids via a one-pot ring-opening/ring-closing/retro-Diels-Alder reaction sequence  aA simple and convenient one-pot method is reported for the synthesis of (E)-3-(3-aryl(heteroaryl, alkyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole-5-yl)acrylic acids utilizing readily accessible or commercially available substituted benzamidoximes and inexpensive exo-3,6-epoxy-1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride.

The pigments’ recovery from the extract was performed using 5kDa and 10kDa ultra-filtration membranes. Results showed that increasing the extraction temperature in the range of 40–60°C was proportional to chlorophyll extraction efficiency, while the maximal carotenoid yield was achieved at 50°C. Ultrasonic power (from 100W to 300W) facilitated the extraction of both chlorophylls and carotenoids. Results from ultra-filtration showed that most pigments (>90%) were available in permeate through 10kDa membrane, while 5kDa membrane partially retained the pigments. Filtration resistance was quantified with resistance-in-series’ model, showing that the cake layer was the most important fouling resistance during filtration. Threshold flux at different rotation speeds (200 and 600rpm) was determined by trans-membrane pressure stepping tests, which were around 10 and 14.5L/m2h, respectively.

Dog owners first completed a questionnaire about their relationship with their dogs (N = 98). Then, dogs were tested in a detour test: a control group without demonstration, a group where the owner demonstrated the task and another group where the experimenter demonstrated the task. Finally, the dogs participated in two behaviour tests measuring their tractability and possessiveness. The two principal components from the questionnaire (called “overactive” and “irritable”) did not show significant association with dogs’ detour performance in the control group. “irritable” dogs performed better in the unfamiliar demonstrator group. These more persistent, goal-oriented dogs also looked back less at their owners during the detour. In the individual problem-solving context, the factor “overactive” had a similar effect on looking back at the owner, suggesting that the items of this component primarily are not connected to the dog–human relationship. Our results indicate that dog–human relationship has an integral role in the complex social behaviour of dogs, which warrants for the need of further empirical testing of the associations between social dynamics in dogs and their relationship with humans, including problem behaviours.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3apet ownership 3aproblem solving 3aquestionnaires 3asocial behavior1 aRieger, Gabriella 1 aVékony, Kata 0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110409613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245007000211506011700281506007600398520161200474592002802086506003702114650001202151650001802163650001102181650001002192653002602202653002802228653002302256653002502279653002302304700003002327700002502357700006202382773010902444856008802553852000902641655001202650IND60786000020221207080702.0220824e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078600002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.1042862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jingjing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8388-915310aOn the localization of chemical reactions in multicontinuum media  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReactive transport (RT) through heterogeneous media, may cause chemical heterogeneity if water flux is slow through portions of the medium. In such cases, chemical localization (i.e., the occurrence of reactions that would not occur in well mixed media) may develop, which is especially relevant for biochemical reactions occurring in biofilms. The objective of this work is to study the conditions for chemical localization. We represent the impact of heterogeneity by means of the non-local multirate mass transfer (MRMT) model, which views the porous media as consisting of one mobile and many immobile zones. A dimensional analysis of the governing equations shows that the problem is characterized by reaction times and the distribution of residence times in immobile zones, relative to transport time. To analyze the interplay between them, we simulated simple RT problems in multicontinuum media. Results indicate that immobile zones with residence times much smaller than transport can be lumped together with the mobile zone by modifying the reaction rates, which reduces computations. More importantly, reactions driven by species that are not present in the inflowing water but are the result of previous reactions will take place preferentially in immobile zones, whose residence time is comparable to or larger than reaction times. In fact, daughter species may take a long time and distance to build up. That is, daughter species will not be largest near the inflow, where parent species display largest concentrations, but further downstream at isolated (long residence times) immobile zones.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiofilm 3amass transfer 3amodels 3awater 0aChemical localization 0aMultirate mass transfer 0aReactive transport 0aMulticontinuum media 0aNumerical modeling1 aCarrera Ramírez, Jesús,1 aSaaltink, Maarten W.1 aValhondo, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4009-54760 tAdvances in water resources.g2022 Sept., v. 167 p.104286-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.1042863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01475naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245007400180520041200254592002800666650001100694650001500705650002300720650001300743650001400756653002300770653002200793653001400815700002600829700002100855700005800876773010900934856008501043852000901128655001201137IND60679588720221120083048.0200217e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067958872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2019.1515522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercado-Marin, Eduardo V.10aMagnesium ethoxide mediated lactone aminolysis with aminoheterocycles  aA mild method for the aminolysis of lactones with aminoheterocycles in the presence of magnesium ethoxide is described.

In this work, penicillinase, a kind of β-lactamase, was immobilized into zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) by self-assembly method and the catalytic performance of the β-lactamase@ZIF-8 porous materials for degradation of penicillins has been investigated by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The results illustrated that the catalytic activity of the encapsulated enzyme was significantly enhanced comparing with that of free enzyme. Meanwhile, the β-lactamase@ZIF-8 exhibited excellent stability under denaturing conditions including high temperature, organic solvent and the enzyme inhibitor. The catalytic degradation mechanism of the β-lactamase@ZIF-8 for penicillins has been probed and verified, and it has been found that the Zn (II) ion on ZIF-8 frameworks could form the complex with the target molecule, which weakened the bond of the four-membered β-lactam ring in the penicillin molecule, and thus enhanced the degradation efficiency of the enzyme. This work provided a promising strategy for eliminating the penicillin residues in water environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactamase 3abiodegradation 3acatalytic activity 3aencapsulation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3amass spectrometry 3apenicillins 3apollution 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aDegradation 0aPenicillins 0aZIF-8 frameworks 0aβ-lactamase 0aHPLC-MS/MS1 aHu, Dehua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1386-91031 aLiu, Hailing1 aWang, Xiangfeng1 aLiu, Yuan1 aXia, Qianshu1 aDeng, Suimin1 aHao, Yun1 aJin, Yuhao1 aXie, Mengxia0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 July 15, v. 414 p.125549-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1255493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245008800176520156000264592002801824650001701852650001501869650001101884650002201895650001101917650002601928650001201954650001201966650001101978650001901989650001602008651001202024653002302036653001802059653001302077653001702090700002702107700002002134700002502154773011702179856008302296852000902379655001202388IND60783870520221120052217.0220905e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078387052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2022.1276852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoia, Nicoleta Larissa14aThe green walk—An analysis for evaluating the accessibility of urban green spaces  aThe importance of urban green spaces in providing ecosystem services to the population is increasingly being recognised by scientists, policy makers and the general public. Across cities, urban planners are seeking to reconcile the location of urban green spaces and accessibility of the public. The main aim of our paper is to assess the accessibility of urban green spaces and to identify perceived benefits along the travel route to urban green spaces, starting from a selected case study in Romania. We started from a spatial analysis of a service area for an urban park in Bucharest (Tineretului). With the help of network analyst in ArcGis Pro we established the boundaries of the service area (using urban park boundaries, street network, traffic restrictions) and applied two methods of travel to the park (walking and cycling). We applied a survey to 202 respondents, collecting information on the routes and methods of reaching the park, as well as the perceived benefits and disservices of selecting the preferred method and route. The main results revealed different patterns delimited by a number of criteria: age (elder population preferred public transport and shaded routes), income (people with higher incomes selected travelling by car and accessing elements with parking facilities), group structure (people with children selected routes perceived as safe). This type of analyses can represent useful instruments for urban planners in developing and managing urban green spaces in close relation with neighbouring spaces and facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3apeople 3apublic transportation 3asurveys 3atraffic 3atravel 3aurban forestry 3aurban parks 3aRomania 0aUrban green spaces 0aAccessibility 0aBenefits 0aService area1 aNiță, Mihai Răzvan,1 aPopa, Ana Maria1 aIojă, Ioan Cristian0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2022 Sept., v. 75 p.127685-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.1276853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245014400164300001800308520191300326592002802239650004402267650002202311650001602333650002002349650002102369650003702390650002802427650002002455650001902475650001802494650001802512650000702530650002202537650001602559650003302575650001902608650002402627650002602651650002102677650003702698650000902735700002202744700002302766700001802789700001802807773012902825856007402954852000903028655001203037IND60702347620221123024852.0200717e20200716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070234762DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay00735h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Mohammed M.10aFabrication of an ultra-sensitive para-nitrophenol sensor based on facile Zn-doped Er₂O₃ nanocomposites via an electrochemical approach  ap. 3470-3483.  aIn this study, a semiconductor-doped nanocomposite material (Zn-doped Er₂O₃ nano-composites) was prepared via a single-step wet-chemical technique at alkaline pH. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV/Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (XEDS), and X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD) were applied to determine the structural and morphological properties of the Zn-doped Er₂O₃ nanocomposite. A thin layer of aggregated Zn-doped Er₂O₃ nanocomposite was fabricated on the flat surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with 5% ethanolic Nafion as conducting coating binder for the development of a selective and sensitive p-nitrophenol (para-NP) capturing electrochemical probe for environmental remediation. After the fabrication of the sensor, a novel current–potential (I–V) electrochemical approach was applied to determine its selectivity and sensitivity together with all the necessary analytical parameters against para-NP. Moreover, the calibration plot was found to be linear with the linear dynamic range (LDR) of para-NP concentration. The limit of detection (LOD) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (S/N ∼ 3) and sensitivity were also calculated to be 0.033 ± 0.002 pM and 28.481 × 10⁻² μA μM⁻¹ cm⁻², respectively, based on the gradient of the calibration plot, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was determined to be 0.11 ± 0.02 pM. This work demonstrates a well-known approach for the first time that can be used for the development of efficient electrochemical sensors. These sensors based on semiconductor doped nanomaterials embedded onto the GCE for the detection of toxic chemicals in an aqueous system as an environmental remediation.

Understanding the impact of these factors on wheat quality is important for processors and especially bakers to maintain and meet the requirements of industrial specifications. Different traits were evaluated: starch content, distribution of starch granules, percentage of amylose and amylopectin and their molecular characteristics (weight-average molar mass, number-average molar mass, polydispersity and gyration radius). Genetic, environment and their interaction had significant effects on all parameters. The relative magnitude of variance attributed to growth conditions, for most traits, was substantially higher (21% to 95%) than that attributed to either genotype (2% to 73%) or G × E interaction (2% to 17%). The largest environmental contribution (95%) to total variance was found for starch dispersity. The highest genetic influence was found for the percentage of A-type starch granules. G × E interaction had relatively little influence (≍7%) on total phenotypic variance. All molecular characteristics were much more influenced by environment than the respective percentages of amylose and amylopectin were. This huge difference in variance between factors obviously revealed the importance of the effect of growing conditions on characteristics of cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abreads 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype 3amolecular weight 3aphenotypic variation 3apolymers 3astarch granules 3avariance 3awheat1 aMéléard, Benoît 1 aDaaloul, Olfa 1 aGrignon, Guénolé 1 aBranlard, Gérard 1 aAussenac, Thierry 0 tFoods.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100202053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006800172300001600240520089100256592002801147650002001175650001101195650001301206650003301219650001201252653001101264653001101275653001501286653001901301653001101320653000901331700001901340700002001359700002101379773011201400856008701512852000901599655001201608IND60096633820221121054908.0221004e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009663382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2011.11.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Ghandoor, A.10aEnergy and exergy utilizations of the Jordanian SMEs industries  ap. 682-687.  aThis study presents detailed analysis of the energy and exergy utilizations of the Jordanian Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by considering the flows of energy and exergy through the main end uses in the Jordanian industrial sector. To achieve this purpose, a survey covering 180 facilities was conducted and energy consumption data was gathered to establish detailed end-use balance for the Jordanian industrial sector. The energy end-use balance provides a starting point to estimate the site and embodied energy and exergy efficiencies. The average site energy and exergy efficiencies of the Jordanian SMEs industries sector are estimated as 78.3% and 37.9% respectively, while the embodied energy and exergy efficiencies are estimated as 58.9% and 21.2% respectively.

RESULTS: A dominant strain known as LZ2 with high activity of hydrolyzing starch was isolated from Luzhou Daqu, a Chinese traditional fermentation starter. The LZ2 was identified as Aspergillus oryzae by 18S rDNA sequence analysis. Glucoamylase from LZ2, named as GA-LZ2, was purified to homogeneity and showed a single band with expected molecular mass of 60 kD. The GA-LZ2 effectively degraded amylose, rice starch and wheat starch. Optimal temperature and pH value of enzyme were 60 °C and pH 4.0 respectively. The GA-LZ2 displayed significant thermal stability and pH stability at moderate temperature and low pH. Intriguingly, the thermostability was enhanced in the presence of starch. In addition, GA-LZ2 exhibited insensitivity to glucose, independence of metal ions and tolerance to organic solvents. The GA-LZ2 retained complete activity in the presence of 100 mM glucose and 5% ethanol and methanol. CONCLUSION: Glucoamylase GA-LZ2 displayed broad substrate specificity, strong stability and tolerance, suggesting that GA-LZ2 carry potential for industrial application in bioethanol production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aamylose 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3aglucose 3aindustrial applications 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3anucleotide sequences 3apH stability 3arice starch 3asequence analysis 3asubstrate specificity 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3awheat starch1 aYang, Lianli1 aLuo, Lunan1 aTang, Shichao1 aWang, Qiang0 tBiotechnology letters.g2020 Nov., v. 42, no. 11 p.2345-2355dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-020-02956-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009500169520134300264592002801607650001501635650001501650650002101665650001801686650003001704650001101734650001401745650001701759653000801776653000901784653000801793653000801801653000801809653000901817653000901826653000701835653000801842653000801850653001101858653001301869653000901882653000801891653000801899653001801907653001301925653000901938653002501947653003601972700001302008700001602021700001702037700001502054700001502069700001402084700001402098700001502112773011402127856008602241852000902327655001202336IND60730074320221119035337.0220802e20210805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073007432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1255512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Jingjing14aThe difference in the adsorption mechanisms of magnetic ferrites modified carbon nanotubes  aVarious ferrites modified carbon nanotubes (MFe₂O₄/CNTs; M = Co, Cu, Mn) were synthesized and characterized using TEM-EDS, FTIR, BET, TG-DTA, VSM, and XRD. MFe₂O₄/CNTs were used as adsorbents for removing ciprofloxacin (CIP), and the adsorption mechanism was revealed in a comparative manner based on the experimental results and density functional theory calculations. The adsorption capacities of CIP on MFe₂O₄/CNTs were 63.32 (Co), 61.60 (Cu), and 46.35 (Mn) mg/g, respectively. Different M components of MFe₂O₄ affected the adsorption behavior of CIP on them, while the specific surface area and total pore volume showed no significant impact. The investigation on the adsorption energy and the bond formation indicated that CIP was more favorably captured by CoFe₂O₄/CuFe₂O₄ than MnFe₂O₄. The local density of states of metal atoms and O atoms (from the ketone or carboxyl groups of CIP) showed that the d-band centers of Co and Cu atoms were above the Fermi level, while that of Mn was below the Fermi level, providing the fundamental understanding of the promoted O adsorption on CoFe₂O₄ and CuFe₂O₄ and restrained adsorption on MnFe₂O₄. This observation was supported by the electron localization function in terms of the stronger charge density overlap between Co-O/Cu-O than that of Mn-O.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3aciprofloxacin 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3amagnetism 3asurface area 0aCIP 0aCNTs 0aDFT 0aDOS 0aELF 0aFTIR 0aLDOS 0aMO 0aPBE 0aTEM 0aTG-DTA 0aUV–vis 0aVASP 0aVSM 0aXRD 0aCiprofloxacin 0aFerrites 0aCNTs 0aAdsorption mechanism 0aDensity functional theory (DFT)1 aDeng, Yi1 aPan, Siyuan1 aKorna, Ramon1 aWen, Jiayi1 aYuan, Nadi1 aWang, Kun1 aLi, Haipu1 aYang, Ying0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Aug. 05, v. 415 p.125551-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1255513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245009900160500001900259520144300278592002801721650001501749650001301764650001101777650001801788650001301806650002901819650002701848650001301875650001501888650001601903650002201919700002301941700002201964700002201986773012002008856007502128852000902203655001202212IND60735062820221121225623.0210423e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073506282DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110409592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seungmee 10aUse of Omics Data in Fracture Prediction; a Scoping and Systematic Review in Horses and Humans  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite many recent advances in imaging and epidemiological data analysis, musculoskeletal injuries continue to be a welfare issue in racehorses. Peptide biomarker studies have failed to consistently predict bone injury. Molecular profiling studies provide an opportunity to study equine musculoskeletal disease. A systematic review of the literature was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines to assess the use of miRNA profiling studies in equine and human musculoskeletal injuries. Data were extracted from 40 papers between 2008 and 2020. Three miRNA studies profiling equine musculoskeletal disease were identified, none of which related to equine stress fractures. Eleven papers studied miRNA profiles in osteoporotic human patients with fractures, but differentially expressed miRNAs were not consistent between studies. MicroRNA target prediction programmes also produced conflicting results between studies. Exercise affected miRNA profiles in both horse and human studies (e.g., miR-21 was upregulated by endurance exercise and miR-125b was downregulated by exercise). MicroRNA profiling studies in horses continue to emerge, but as yet, no miRNA profile can reliably predict the occurrence of fractures. It is very important that future studies are well designed to mitigate the effects of variation in sample size, exercise and normalisation methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3aexercise 3ahumans 3ameta-analysis 3amicroRNA 3amusculoskeletal diseases 3amusculoskeletal system 3apeptides 3aprediction 3asample size 3asystematic review1 aBaker, Melissa  E.1 aClinton, Michael 1 aTaylor, Sarah  E.0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110409593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04232naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245015400183300001800337500001900355520183100374592002802205596007502233596007502308596007502383596007502458596007702533596007702610596007502687596007502762650002102837650001702858650001302875650001802888650001502906650001602921650001402937650001602951650001002967650001902977650001302996650002103009650001803030650001503048650002503063650001603088700002203104700002903126700003303155700002903188700003103217700002603248700002503274700002103299700007203320773012203392856008303514852000903597655001203606IND60711432520221120194146.0210204e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071143252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-020-02955-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Moura, Werner Alfinito Feio10aFunctional and structural evaluation of the antileukaemic enzyme L-asparaginase II expressed at low temperature by different Escherichia coli strains  ap. 2333-2344.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAcute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) affects lymphoblastic cells and is the most common neoplasm during childhood. Among the pharmaceuticals used in the treatment protocols for ALL, Asparaginase (ASNase) from Escherichia coli (EcAII) is an essential biodrug. Meanwhile, the use of EcAII in neoplastic treatments causes several side effects, such as immunological reactions, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, depression, and coagulation abnormalities. Commercial EcAII is expressed as a recombinant protein, similar to novel enzymes from different organisms; in fact, EcAII is a tetrameric enzyme with high molecular weight (140 kDa), and its overexpression in recombinant systems often results in bacterial cell death or the production of aggregated or inactive EcAII protein, which is related to the formation of inclusion bodies. On the other hand, several commercial expression strains have been developed to overcome these expression issues, but no studies on a systematic evaluation of the E. coli strains aiming to express recombinant asparaginases have been performed to date. In this study, we evaluated eleven expression strains at a low temperature (16 °C) with different characteristics to determine which is the most appropriate for asparaginase expression; recombinant wild-type EcAII (rEcAII) was used as a prototype enzyme and the secondary structure content, oligomeric state, aggregation and specific activity of the enzymes were assessed. Structural analysis suggested that a correctly folded tetrameric rEcAII was obtained using ArcticExpress (DE3), a strain that co-express chaperonins, while all other strains produced poorly folded proteins. Additionally, the enzymatic assays showed high specific activity of proteins expressed by ArcticExpress (DE3) when compared to the other strains used in this work.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013/08617-7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2014/22039-9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2011/13500-6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2016/19245-1cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/19942‐7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/20291‐0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/25272-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2019/04054-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aEscherichia coli 3aasparaginase 3abacteria 3abiotechnology 3acell death 3achaperonins 3achildhood 3acoagulation 3adrugs 3ahepatotoxicity 3aleukemia 3amolecular weight 3aneurotoxicity 3aprototypes 3arecombinant proteins 3atemperature1 aSchultz, Leonardo1 aBreyer, Carlos Alexandre1 ade Oliveira, Ana Laura Pires1 aTairum, Carlos Abrunhosa1 aFernandes, Gabriella Costa1 aToyama, Marcos Hikari1 aPessoa-Jr, Adalberto1 aMonteiro, Gisele1 aOliveira, Marcos Antonio de,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1192-72960 tBiotechnology letters.g2020 Nov., v. 42, no. 11 p.2333-2344dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-020-02955-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245010100172300001800273520147900291592002801770650001801798650002201816650002101838650002201859650001601881650002001897650002101917650001201938650002501950650004301975650001602018650001402034650001902048650000902067650001902076650001802095650002602113650002002139700002102159700004002180773012902220856007402349852000902423655001202432IND60702347920221123024906.0200717e20200716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070234792DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay00933d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillyam, Shella Jeniferiani10aβ-Cyclodextrin/Fe₃O₄ nanocomposites for an electrochemical non-enzymatic cholesterol sensor  ap. 3454-3461.  aA sensitive, specific, and miniaturized non-enzymatic cholesterol sensor was prepared based on the competition of inclusion complex formation between β-cyclodextrin (BCD) and cholesterol, and between BCD and methylene blue (MB). BCD was immobilized on the surface of Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles instead of the electrode surface to increase the kinetic rate and enhance the sensitivity of the sensor. Furthermore, the use of magnetic nanocomposites and a screen-printed carbon electrode reduces the overall analysis time and simplifies the sample measurement procedures, making the sensor suitable for point-of-care analysis. The electrochemical measurement results of MB, released from the reactions between BCD and solutions containing various concentrations of cholesterol were used as the input signal to calculate the cholesterol concentrations. A good linearity as well as an excellent accuracy and repeatability in the concentration range of 0–150 μM with an estimated limit of detection of 2.88 μM could be achieved by using the amperometric technique at a constant potential of −0.43 V. The sensor showed a good selectivity in the presence of 1 mM concentrations of interfering agents, including NaCl, CaCl₂, glycine, glucose, and ascorbic acid. Furthermore, a validation performed for cholesterol determination in milk samples was in agreement with the measurements performed by using the HPLC method, suggesting that the developed sensor is reliable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acalcium chloride 3acarbon electrodes 3acholesterol 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aglucose 3aglycine (amino acid) 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3amethylene blue 3amilk 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apoint-of-care systems 3asodium chloride1 aSaepudin, Endang1 aIvandini, Tribidasari Anggraningrum0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 July 16, v. 12, no. 27 p.3454-3461dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00933d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03706naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245013500165500001400300520240600314592002802720650002302748650000802771650001002779650001302789650002102802650000702823650001602830650001302846650001802859650001302877650002302890650001502913650001202928650001602940650001202956650003402968700002103002700002003023773011903043856007703162961001203239852000903251655001203260IND60729257720221120152953.0210228e20210126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072925772DNAL7 a10.3390/foods100202502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsteves, Eduardo 10aEffects of Vacuum and Modified Atmosphere Packaging on the Quality and Shelf-Life of Gray Triggerfish (Balistes capriscus) Fillets  aNAL-light  aSeafood products are perceived as healthy foods. However, several species of seafood are still not fully utilized for different reasons or can be valued outside the original locale, if issues with the short shelf-life and/or the preparation/presentation form are overcome, e.g., gray triggerfish, Balistes capriscus. Consumed mostly fresh, its flesh is of excellent quality. We studied the effect of different types of packaging (in air (AIR), vacuum (VP), and modified atmosphere (MAP)) on physicochemical (color and texture, pH, and total volatile basic nitrogen), microbiological (total viable count, psychrotrophic, sulphide-reducing bacteria, and acid-lactic bacteria), and sensory qualities, and shelf-life of gray triggerfish fillets stored at refrigeration temperature for 15 days. The samples were analyzed on days 0 (fresh fish), 5, 10 (8 and 12 for sensory analysis), and 15 after filleting and packaging. During the trial, fillets became lighter (increased L*) and yellower (b* >> 0) with time of storage. Distinct patterns were observed for pH among treatments. Unexpectedly, the increasing trend observed in the texturometer-derived hardness of VP and MAP fillets, contrasted with the sensory assessment, wherein panelists perceived a clear softening of fillets. VP delayed and MAP inhibited the increase in TVB-N contents of fillets compared to fillets packed in AIR. Total viable count and psychrothropic bacteria of fillets in AIR exceeded the conventional limit of 7 log(CFU/g) on day 10, while in fillets packed in VP and MAP, their abundance remained below that limit during the trial. The organoleptic attributes of fillets perceived by a sensory panel changed significantly in all treatments during the storage trial. Willingness to consume the fillets decreased constantly in AIR and MAP, but not in VP fillets. Considering primarily sensory, but also biochemical and microbiological parameters, namely panelists’ rejection, total volatile basic nitrogen content, and total viable count and psychrotrophic bacteria abundance, the shelf-life of fillets packed in air was eight days. Vacuum and modified atmosphere packaging extended the shelf-life to 15 and 12 days, and thus can add value to this product. Future research regarding the VP and MAP of gray triggerfish fillets could involve the optimization of mixtures of gases use and/or the application of combined processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalistes capriscus 3aair 3acolor 3ahardness 3anitrogen content 3apH 3aplate count 3araw fish 3arefrigeration 3aresearch 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3astorage 3atemperature 3atexture 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen1 aGuerra, Luis A.,1 aAníbal, Jaime 0 tFoods.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100202503Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/DA  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245016600173520122800339592002801567650002701595650002001622650001701642650001601659650001001675650001601685650001801701650001101719650001001730650001701740650000701757650001801764650002001782650001801802650002601820650001801846650002901864650000901893650001401902700003201916700002701948700002501975700002202000700002502022700002902047700002502076700002602101773012502127856008302252852000902335655001202344IND60751497220221120062507.0210925e20210811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075149722DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70301492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOryza.S, Mutyarsih 10aPhysico-Chemical Characteristics and Amino Acid Content Evaluation of Citric Acid by-Product Produced by Microbial Fermentation as a Potential Use in Animal Feed  aThe production of citric acid produces 70% waste product or by-product. This by-product is produced by microbial fermentation which could be used as an alternative raw material for animal feed because it still contains citric acid, which could help to reduce pathogenic bacteria. The objective of this study is to evaluate the physical and chemical value of citric acid by-product from rice (CABR) to compare the properties with those of rice bran and broken rice and to determine its potential as an alternative energy source in animal feed. The chemical composition of CABR was calculated using proximate analysis. The color of CABR was darker, and the bulk density value was 549.65 (g/L) (p < 0.05). With free flow, the angle of repose was 40°, and the particle size had less polygonal starch granules. CABR had a low pH of 4.77 and contained 19.80% crude protein, 11.97% crude fiber, and 4005.72 kcal/kg of energy. CABR had a higher crude protein value than broken rice and rice bran and a higher gross energy value than broken rice but less than rice bran. It also had a higher crude fiber value (p > 0.05). The results suggest that CABR could be utilized as an energy and protein source for animal feed formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3aangle of repose 3abulk density 3acitric acid 3acolor 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3aenergy 3afeeds 3afermentation 3apH 3aparticle size 3aprotein sources 3aprotein value 3aproximate composition 3araw materials 3arenewable energy sources 3arice 3arice bran1 aWongtangtintharn, Sawitree 1 aTengjaroenkul, Bundit 1 aCherdthong, Anusorn 1 aTanpong, Sirisak 1 aBunchalee, Pasakorn 1 aPootthachaya, Padsakorn 1 aReungsang, Alissara 1 aPolyorach, Sineenart 0 tFermentation.g2021 Aug. 11, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70301493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245010800179520139200287592002801679650002301707650002401730650003201754650002301786650002101809650001901830650001901849650001301868650001201881650001101893650002201904650000701926650001501933650001601948650000901964650002401973650003701997650000902034653002302043653001202066653002202078653001902100653001702119700006002136700005902196700005902255700005902314700003102373700002002404700002002424773011402444856008602558852000902644655001202653IND60730074520221119035324.0211206e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073007452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1255532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandotto Carniel, Fabio10aGraphene environmental biodegradation: Wood degrading and saprotrophic fungi oxidize few-layer graphene  aThe environmental biodegradability profile of graphene related materials (GRMs) is important to know in order to predict whether these materials will accumulate in soil or will be transformed by primary decomposers. In this study, few-layer graphene (FLG) was exposed to living and devitalized axenic cultures of two white-rot basidiomycetes (Bjerkandera adusta and Phanerochaete chrysosporium) and one soil saprotrophic ascomycete (Morchella esculenta) with or without lignin, for a period of four months. Over this time, the increase of fungal biomass and presence of H₂O₂ and oxidizing enzymes [laccase/peroxidase and lignin peroxidase (LiP)] in growth media was assessed by gravimetric and spectrophotometric measurements, respectively. Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to compare the structure of FLG before and after incubation. All of the test fungi decreased pH in growth media and released H₂O₂ and laccase/peroxidase, but only basidiomycetes released LiP. Independent of growth media composition all fungi were found to be capable to oxidize FLG to a graphene oxide-like material, including M. esculenta, which released only laccase/peroxidase, i.e. the most common enzymes among primary decomposers. These findings suggest that FLG involuntarily released into terrestrial environments would likely be oxidized by soil microflora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBjerkandera adusta 3aMorchella esculenta 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3afungal biomass 3agraphene 3alaccase 3alignin 3alignin peroxidase 3apH 3aperoxidase 3asaprotrophs 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awood 0aFungal decomposers 0aLaccase 0aLignin peroxidase 0aRaman analysis 0a2d materials1 aFortuna, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4669-33701 aZanelli, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6684-71891 aGarrido, Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4263-09891 aVázquez, Ester1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3223-80241 aGonzález, Viviana Jehová1 aPrato, Maurizio1 aTretiach, Mauro0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 July 15, v. 414 p.125553-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1255533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002600139245012500165300001800290500001500308520086800323592002801191650002001219650002101239650002001260650001501280650001301295650002601308650002101334650001501355650002001370650002001390650002201410650002601432650001001458650000701468650002301475650002601498650001701524650001601541651002001557653001601577653001401593653001201607653001001619700001801629700002501647773010601672856007701778852000901855655001201864IND4388928320221120193305.0151127e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438892832DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-06-092.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChauhan, Bhagirath S.10aInfluence of environmental factors on seed germination and seedling emergence of Oriental mustard (Sisymbrium orientale)  ap. 1025-1031.  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of environmental factors on seed germination and seedling emergence of Oriental mustard were studied in laboratory and field experiments. Seed germination was stimulated by light; however, some germination occurred in the dark. In light/dark, potassium nitrate at 0.02 M stimulated germination of 1-mo-old seed to a maximum level of 45%% as compared with the control (18%%). Oriental mustard germination was inhibited by high levels of salt and osmotic stress. Seed germination was greater than 50%% over a pH range of 4 to 10. Seedling emergence of 4- to 5-mo-old seeds was highest when present on the soil surface (70%%) but declined with depth, and no seedlings emerged from a soil depth of 10 mm. In the field, seedling emergence was greater under no-till than minimum tillage systems.Nomenclature: Oriental mustard, Sisymbrium orientale L.

The sensitivity of reservoir stratification as an indicator of reservoir sensitivity also was analysed. Model simulations indicated the reservoir was more sensitive to changes during the warm‐dry season than at other times. Both indexes (normalized algal mass and dissolved oxygen mass) were more sensitive to changes in air temperature (climate change) and nitrogen loading (development) than to changes in flow. The sensitivity to air temperature was similar to, but generally less than, the sensitivity to nutrient inflow. At the bounding values for change (3 °C for temperature; 50% increase in nitrogen loading), the algae mass sensitivities were 0.15 mg L⁻¹per 3 °C and 0.2 mg L⁻¹per 50% nitrogen load increase, and the dissolved oxygen mass sensitivities were 0.7 mg L⁻¹per 3 °C and 2.0 mg L⁻¹per 50% load increase. Changes in air temperature and nitrogen loadings affect the reservoir in different ways, air temperature mostly changing the timing of the algal growth with little change in peak values, while nutrient loadings change the peak values with little change in the timing. While the sensitivities are similar, the total algal mass change is significantly larger for nitrogen loading, compared to air temperature changes. These results imply global climate change effects can be partially mitigated by implementing management measures in the surrounding watersheds to minimize nutrient inflows, especially nitrogen in the case of Aguamilpa Reservoir.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3asimulation models 3awater quality 3alakes 3anitrogen 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3awatersheds 3apollution load 3adissolved oxygen 3aclimate 0aAlgae1 aObregon, Oliver1 aNelson, E.

The aim of this work is to set up promising wind farms that are able to feed electricity to the Jordanian distribution authority with excellent percentage of clean energy. There are some particular locations in Jordan where the wind potential is very promising for economical electrical power generation. Four of these promising locations are investigated in this paper for the possibility of building and investing 100MW wind turbine in each of these four locations. The environmental data needed to perform the present study are obtained from the local Meteorological department. The suggested wind turbines to be implemented in each of the four locations are selected from the international rating and specification catalogues of wind turbine manufacturers. This study reveals that the total rated wind power that can be generated from the four selected wind farms is 136MW. On the other hand, the expected total energy that can be produced from the four selected wind farms is 18.9×10³GWh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3apower generation 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines 3aJordan 0aWind energy potential 0aJordan 0aWind power 0aGeneration0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Jan., v. 65 p.704-708dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2011.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245012700131300001600258520159300274592002801867650002601895650001101921650001001932650001401942650002601956650000901982650001901991650001102010650001002021650002202031650001502053650001002068650001602078650001402094650001102108650001002119650001502129653001902144653001702163653002202180653002202202653001502224700002402239773014102263852000902404655001202413IND60126577820221120060646.0151124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012657782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos, Manuel10aAttract-and-Kill and Other Pheromone-Based Methods to Suppress Populations of the Indianmeal Moth (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)  ap. 473-480.  aThree attract-and-kill formulations, a gel, a wax panel, and a plastic cylinder were tested in simulated warehouses at three densities of devices and at three densities of moths, Plodia interpunctella Hübner, per room. Wax panels and the cylinder formulations suppressed all the densities of moths with only one device per room. Two field experiments were then conducted during 2005 and 2006 in replicated commercial pet food and grocery stores that harbored natural populations of P. interpunctella. In the summer of 2005, the wax panel formulation suppressed adult male response to monitoring traps and also reduced the numbers of larvae in food bait oviposition cups after the first month of being established. This suppression was maintained until the third month. The second field experiment in 2006 compared three pheromone-based methods of moth suppression in buildings with moth populations in untreated buildings. The mass-trapping treatment showed the lowest adult moth capture after the first month of the experiment until the end of the third month. However, this treatment was similar statistically to use of attract-and-kill panels, mating disruption, and untreated control establishments in most of the weeks. Monitoring of larvae in food cups revealed the pheromone- based methods were not significantly different from each other, but that they suppressed moth populations in most of the weeks when compared with untreated control buildings. This research shows potential for successful pheromone-based suppression methods for Indianmeal moths in commercial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlodia interpunctella 3aadults 3abaits 3abuildings 3afield experimentation 3agels 3agrocery stores 3alarvae 3amales 3amating disruption 3amonitoring 3amoths 3aoviposition 3apet foods 3asummer 3atraps 3awarehouses 0astored product 0aattracticide 0amale annihilation 0amating disruption 0apyrethroid1 aPhillips, Thomas W.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2014 Feb., v. 107, no. 1 p.473-480dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011200172300001800284520136500302592002801667650001601695650001101711650002501722650002701747650002701774650001001801650001701811650002001828650002601848650001801874650001001892650001601902653003801918653004601956653000902002653001602011653001302027700002402040700002302064700001702087700002802104700002502132773011602157856008602273852000902359655001202368IND60597517420221122055251.0201209e20180920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059751742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.2772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaisi, Nawaf I.10aConstruction material properties of high temperature arc gasification slag as a portland cement replacement  ap. 1266-1272.  aThis study investigates a potential beneficial reuse application for high-temperature arc gasification slag (HTAG), a waste product of electricity generated using municipal solid waste as fuel. The potential for the beneficial use of this material for a partial replacement for portland cement was investigated at four levels of replacement (5, 20, 35, and 50%). The heat of hydration was measured for the reference and slag samples by isothermal conduction calorimetry. Results from the study demonstrate that at low replacement percentages the total heat evolution and the compressive strength of the control cement and slag-cement blends are similar. The compressive strength of mortars amended with pulverized and finely milled HTAG slag was measured at 7, 28 and 56 days and the results demonstrate that low replacement percentages (5%) of portland cement with HTAG slag produces comparable strength. Significant decreases in strength and heat were seen when higher replacement percentages (20–50%) were used, however these decreases were partially offset using finer slag. Although the activity index of the slag was relatively low compared to portland cement, an increased activity index can be reached by decreasing the average particle size, suggesting that properly processed HTAG slag does offer potential as a supplementary cementitious material.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3acement 3acompression strength 3aconstruction materials 3aelectricity generation 3afuels 3agasification 3aheat production 3amunicipal solid waste 3aparticle size 3aslags 3atemperature 0aHigh temperature arc gasification 0aSupplementary cementitious material (SCM) 0aSlag 0aCalorimetry 0aPozzolan1 aRoessler, Justin G.1 aWatts, Benjamin E.1 aParis, Jerry1 aFerraro, Christopher C.1 aTownsend, Timothy G.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Sept. 20, v. 196 p.1266-1272dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.05.2773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245009900181520130700280592002801587650002401615650002301639650002001662650001301682650001201695650001601707650001201723650002101735650000701756650002501763650001201788700002801800700002701828700003001855700002601885700002101911773012501932856008302057852000902140655001202149IND60751497420221120160802.0210925e20210813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075149742DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation70301512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Paola Monteiro10aProduction of L (+) Lactic Acid by Lactobacillus casei Ke11: Fed Batch Fermentation Strategies  aLactic acid and its derivatives are widely used in pharmaceutical, leather, textile and food industries. However, until now there have been few systematic reports on fed-batch fermentation for efficient production and high concentration of l-lactic acid by lactic acid bacteria. This study describes the obtainment of L (+) lactic acid from sucrose using the Lactobacillus casei Ke11 strain through different feeding strategies using an accessible pH neutralizer such as CaCO₃. The exponential feeding strategy can increase lactic acid production and productivity (175.84 g/L and 3.74 g/L/h, respectively) with a 95% yield, avoiding inhibition by high initial substrate concentration and, combined with the selected agent controller, avoids the cellular stress that could be caused by the high osmotic pressure of the culture media. The purification of the acid using charcoal and celite, followed by the use of a cation exchange column proved to be highly efficient, allowing a high yield of lactic acid, high removal of sugars and proteins. The described process shows great potential for the production of lactic acid, as well as the simple, efficient and low-cost purification method. This way, this work is useful to the large-scale fermentation of L. casei Ke11 for production of l-lactic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus casei 3abatch fermentation 3acation exchange 3acharcoal 3afabrics 3alactic acid 3aleather 3aosmotic pressure 3apH 3apurification methods 3asucrose1 aSantos, Larissa Provasi1 aCoelho, Luciana Fontes1 aAvila Neto, Paulo Marcelo1 aSass, Daiane Cristina1 aContiero, Jonas 0 tFermentation.g2021 Aug. 13, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation70301513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01893naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009300165520057800258592002800836650001100864650001100875650001200886650002300898650002300921650002000944650001200964650002100976650002200997650004401019650000701063650001401070650002001084653000901104653002201113653001501135653001401150700001601164700001601180700001601196700001901212773011001231856008501341852000901426655001201435IND60679589320221122080617.0200221e20200305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067958932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2019.1515582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fangji12aA simple and efficient fluorescent probe for detecting Ba2+ and its various applications  aThis paper designed and synthesized a simple fluorescent probe L to detect Ba²⁺ based on pyridoxal and picolinylhydrazide, which was characterized by ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR and HRMS.

This gas production may be affected by the headspace volume in the incubation bottle and by the overhead pressure measurement and release (OHPMR) frequency. The biogas and methane yields of cellulose, barley, silage and slurry were compared with three incubation bottle headspace volumes (50, 90 and 180ml; constant 70ml total medium) and four OHPMR frequencies (daily, each third day, weekly and solely at the end of experiment). The methane yields of barley, silage and slurry were compared with those from an automated volumetric method (AMPTS). Headspace volume and OHPMR frequency effects on biogas yield were mediated mainly through headspace pressure, with the latter having a negative effect on the biogas yield measured and relatively little effect on methane yield. Two mBMP treatments produced methane yields equivalent to AMPTS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abarley 3abiogas 3acellulose 3acrop yield 3aheadspace analysis 3amethane 3amethane production 3asilage 3aslurries 0aABAI 0aAD 0aAFBI 0aAMPTS 0aANOVA 0aBMP 0aF 0aIWA 0ak 0amBMP 0aNA 0aOHPMR 0aP 0aP day 0aPMax 0aSEM 0aT50 0aTS 0aU 0aV 0aVS 0aλ 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aBiogas 0aHeadspace volume 0aMethane 0aPressure release frequency1 aVoelklein, M.A.1 aMurphy, J.D.1 aGrant, J.1 aO'Kiely, Padraig,0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Aug., v. 238 p.633-642dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01584naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245015800209300001600367506007600383520030200459592002800761506003700789650003300826650001400859650001100873650001100884650002800895700002100923700002000944700002500964700002200989773011301011856007701124852000901201655001201210IND60172027520221207122132.0150602e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017202752DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.113.2344682doi7 aPMC40448582pmcid7 a245963282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheung, C.Y.

In order to obtain ecological information regarding the gold-spotted pond frog’s habitat environment and biological interactions, we applied stable isotope analysis to quantify the ecological niche space (ENS) of frogs including black-spotted pond frogs (P. nigromaculatus) and bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) within the food web of two different habitats—an ecological wetland park and a rice paddy. The gold-spotted pond frog population exhibited a broader ENS in the ecological wetland park than in the rice paddy. According to the carbon stable isotope ratios, gold-spotted pond frogs mainly fed on insects, regardless of habitat type. However, the results comparing the range of both carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes showed that gold-spotted pond frogs living in the rice paddy showed limited feeding behavior, while those living in the ecological wetland park fed on various food sources located in more varied trophic positions. Although the ENS of the gold-spotted pond frog was generally less likely to be overlapped by that of other frog species, it was predicted to overlap with a high probability of 87.3% in the ecological wetland park. Nevertheless, gold-spotted pond frogs in the ecological wetland park were not significantly affected by the prey competition with competitive species by feeding on other prey for which other species’ preference was low. Since these results show that a habitats’ food diversity has an effect on securing the ENS of gold-spotted pond frogs and prey competition, we recommend that the establishment of a food environment that considers the feeding behavior of gold-spotted pond frogs is important for the sustainable preservation of gold-spotted pond frogs and their settlement in alternative habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3acarbon 3afood webs 3afrogs 3aniches 3anitrogen 3apaddies 3aprobability 3arice 3astable isotopes 3awetlands 3aSouth Korea1 aChang, Kwang-Hyeon 1 aJin, Mei-Yan 1 aSuh, Jong-Mo 1 aYoon, Ju-Duk 1 aShin, Kyung-Hoon 1 aPark, Su-Gon 1 aChang, Min-Ho 0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110409673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012600164300001600290520098500306592002801291650002001319650001301339650002501352650002201377650000901399650002301408650002201431650001301453650000701466650001601473700002201489700002501511700001901536773011301555852000901668856008101677930003301758945002501791946001101816655001201827IND4405772220221119185437.0160903e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440577222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-008-9626-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZubair, Ammara10aKinetic and Equilibrium Modeling for Cr(III) and Cr(VI) Removal from Aqueous Solutions by Citrus reticulata Waste Biomass  ap. 305-318.  aThe pulp left after the extraction of juice from Citrus reticulate (kinnow), is a waste material, which was used as a potential sorbent for Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in the present study. The effect of experimental parameters such as pH, biosorbent dosage, biosorbent particle size, initial metal concentrations, temperature, shaking speed and sorption time on the Cr removal is apparent from the obtained results. The Freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic models fitted well to the data of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) biosorption by Citrus reticulata waste biomass. Effect of several pretreatments such as gases, natural coagulant and many other chemicals on Cr(III) and Cr(VI) sorption capacity of Citrus reticulata waste biomass was first time analyzed in the present study. The metal sorption capacity of Citrus reticulata waste biomass after a specific pretreatment was not only related to the nature of chemical but also strongly dependent on the oxidation state of the metal.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater pollution 3achromium 3awastewater treatment 3aCitrus reticulata 3apulp 3asorption isotherms 3auptake mechanisms 3akinetics 3apH 3atemperature1 aBhatti, Haq Nawaz1 aHanif, Muhammad Asif1 aShafqat, Faiza0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2008 June, v. 191, no. 1-4 p.305-318dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9626-y3Available from publisher's site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02048naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245012100160500001900281520098100300592002801281650002201309650002001331650001901351650001401370650001001384650001901394650001401413700002601427700002601453700002701479773012001506856007501626852000901701655001201710IND60735063320221122053035.0210423e20210331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073506332DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110409682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernau, Maren 10aDetection of Local Tissue Reactions after Anti-GnRF Injection in Male Pigs Assessed Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed at evaluating the local tissue reaction of an anti-GnRF product, which is used for the so called “immunocastration” in male pigs. A total of 34 pigs were injected two times (including a booster injection) with an anti-GnRF product. Injection was performed using the prescribed safety vaccinator. Injection sites were evaluated three times post injection using magnetic resonance imaging. Two examinations were performed after the first injection and one after the booster. The local tissue reaction was evaluated three-dimensionally by semi-automatic analyses, by linear measurements of injection depth and length, and by scoring the kind of tissue affected. Results showed a long-lasting reaction in affected muscle tissue. Therefore, needle length should be discussed, and an evaluation of the injection site after slaughter should be performed include behavioural scorings post injection to evaluate the impact on animal well-being and carcass quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal well-being 3acarcass quality 3ainjection site 3amagnetism 3amales 3amuscle tissues 3aslaughter1 aSchwanitz, Sebastian 1 aKreuzer, Lena  Sophie1 aScholz, Armin  Manfred0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110409683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007700169300001600246520108100262592002801343650004401371650002201415650001601437650002801453650002501481650001701506650001201523650001601535650001301551650003401564650003301598653001501631653001601646653001701662653004601679653001801725700001501743700001701758700001501775700001401790700001601804773010701820856008701927852000902014655001202023IND60568124720221120111745.0190409e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056812472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.04.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiqing10aPretreatment of corn stover by solid acid for d-lactic acid fermentation  ap. 490-495.  aSolid acid is a new acid that is safe and green, which has been widely used in the fields of acid pickling. In this study, we adopted solid acid to pretreat corn stover and used the pretreated corn stover in the fermentation of d-lactic acid. Finally, we obtained optimal conditions for the pretreatment of corn stover by solid acid: digestion temperature of 120°C, digestion time of 80min, and solid acid concentration of 1.5%. Then adding cellulase of 30FPU/g, the conversion rate of glucose reached 71.06% after enzymatic hydrolysis for 72h. In addition, the changes of corn stover structure after pretreatment were further represented by using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). At the same time, we used the pretreated corn stover as fermentation substrate and Lactobacillus. delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus as the starting strain to produce d-lactic acid. The yield reached 18g/L, with the optical purity being 99%e.e.

Sponge cakes with 0, 25, 50 and 75% sucrose replacement (SR) using a combination of inulin and Rebaudioside A (Reb A) were prepared. Sensory acceptance testing (SAT) was carried out on samples. Following experimental results, four more samples were prepared where fat was replaced sequentially (0, 25, 50 and 75%) in sucrose-replaced sponge cakes using pureed butter beans (Pbb) as a replacer. Fat-replaced samples were investigated using sensory (hedonic and intensity) and physicochemical analysis. Texture liking and overall acceptability (OA) were the only hedonic sensory parameters significantly affected after a 50% SR in sponge cake (p < 0.05). A 25% SR had no significant impact on any hedonic sensory properties and samples were just as accepted as the control sucrose sample. A 30% SR was chosen for further experiments. After a 50% fat replacement (FR), no significant differences were found between 30% sucrose-replaced sponge cake samples in relation to all sensory (hedonic and intensity) parameters investigated. Flavour and aroma intensity attributes such as buttery and sweet and, subsequently, liking and OA of samples were negatively affected after a 75% FR (p < 0.05). Instrumental texture properties (hardness and chewiness (N)) did not discriminate between samples with increasing levels of FR using Pbb. Moisture content increased significantly with FR (p < 0.05). A simultaneous reduction in fat (42%) and sucrose was achieved (28%) in sponge cake samples without negatively affecting OA. Optimised samples contained significantly more dietary fibre (p < 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3abutter 3achewiness 3adietary fiber 3aflavor 3ahardness 3ainulin 3anutritive value 3aodors 3asponge cakes 3asucrose 3atexture 3awater content1 aTyuftin, Andrey  A.1 aKilcawley, Kieran  N.1 aGallagher, Eimear 1 aO’Sullivan, Maurice  G.1 aKerry, Joseph  P.0 tFoods.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100202543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245012100176500002200297506011700319506007600436520111400512592002801626506003701654650001701691650001101708650001601719650001001735650001501745650001701760650002401777650002601801650002801827650001501855650001301870650002401883650001101907650001601918650001901934650001101953651001001964653002401974653003401998653002002032653003102052653002402083653002802107700001702135700006002152773012702212856008302339852000902422655001202431IND60783871320221207065346.0220809e20220718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078387132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejar.2022.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd El Fatah, Hesham M.10aSeasonal dynamics and ecological drivers of Prorocentrum micans Ehrenberg dinoflagellate blooms in Qarun Lake, Egypt  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe morphological description of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum micans, based on light and SEM microscopy, population dynamics, environmental drivers and seasonal abundance fluctuations were recorded in Qarun Lake during different seasons during the period from 2018 to 2019. The highest bloom of P. micans was observed in summer and autumn, but it declined in winter. This blooming was highly correlated to the increased water salinity and temperature. The seasonal cellular changes included partial deterioration of the cytoplasmic organelles that was observed in autumn, and many ruptured individuals with chlorophyll leakage in winter. As for the cellular proteins, many polypeptides were significantly down-regulated downstream from summer to winter. Induction of protein phosphorylation steady state was found in winter samples. This most likely contributed to signal transduction cascades regulating programmed cell death and abundance of the fluctuations of P. micans during seasonal changes. The proteomic study provided insights into the population dynamics and the ecological drivers of P. micans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aProrocentrum 3aautumn 3achlorophyll 3alakes 3aorganelles 3apolypeptides 3apopulation dynamics 3aprogrammed cell death 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aproteomics 3aresearch 3asignal transduction 3asummer 3atemperature 3awater salinity 3awinter 3aEgypt 0aProrocentrum micans 0aCellular seasonal alterations 0aTEM/SEM imaging 0aMolecular characterization 0aSignal transduction 0aProtein phosphorylation1 aM.

To address this gap, we investigated how prescribed fire (conducted in both the spring and fall) and pre-treatment fuel modifications impacted individual tree damage (or injury) and mortality in nine 13–14year old mixed conifer stands in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Prior to burning, randomly selected trees were pruned to 1.8m height above ground. Randomly selected trees were also raked to reduce surrounding surface fuel. Raking fuel from trees reduced the amount of crown volume scorched for all species, but not enough trees died to determine if raking influenced probability of survival. Pruning was associated with reductions in crown consumption height and percent crown volume consumed (5% of crown volume in pruned versus <1% of crown volume unpruned, p=0.02) but was not a significant predictor of percent of crown volume scorched brown. Pruned trees had only 27% of the mortality of unpruned trees when less than half of the crown was scorched (p=0.046). However the mortality of pruned trees showed no less sensitivity to fire damage at higher levels of crown scorch (p=0.0076); in fact extremely scorched trees appeared more likely to die when pruned. Mortality differed strongly by species; giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) showed 97% post-fire survival while nearly half of sugar pines (Pinus lambertiana) died. Fires occurring in spring months killed seven times as many trees as those in autumn months. While the results demonstrate that prescribed burns can be feasible in stands as young as 13years old, the factors of post-fire damage and mortality are different compared to mature stands. Species composition, pre-fire fuel reduction treatments, and timing of prescribed burns are all important considerations for managers wanting to develop resilient young stands with prescribed fire.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus lambertiana 3aSequoiadendron giganteum 3aautumn 3aconifers 3afire intensity 3aforests 3afuels 3afuels (fire ecology) 3amanagers 3amortality 3amountains 3aplantations 3aprescribed burning 3aprobability 3apruning 3ascorch 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3atree damage 3atrees 3awildfires 3aCalifornia 3aSierra Nevada (California) 0aPrescribed fire 0aPruning 0aYoung stands 0aFire resilience 0aFuel modification 0aGiant sequoia 0aSugar pine1 aThomson, Ariel C.1 aHelmstedt, Kate J.1 aYork, Robert A.1 aPotts, Matthew D.0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 376 p.193-204dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2016.05.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003200141245012000173500001900293520129600312592002801608650001501636650002101651650001101672650001001683650001001693650001001703650002601713650003001739650003701769650001901806650001801825650001201843700002201855700002501877700002901902700003301931700002901964700002501993773012002018856007502138852000902213655001202222IND60735063520221122053050.0210423e20210331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073506352DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110409702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Hernández, Roy 10aPrevalence and Molecular Characterization of Salmonella Isolated from Broiler Farms at the Tolima Region—Colombia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSalmonella is an important animal and human pathogen responsible for Salmonellosis, and it is frequently associated with the consumption of contaminated poultry products. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Salmonella in the poultry farms and to determine the genetic relationship. A total of 135 samples collected from fifteen broiler farms, including cloacal, feed, water, environmental and farm operator faeces samples were subjected to microbiological isolation. Molecular confirmation of Salmonella isolates was carried out by amplification of the invA gene, discrimination of d-tartrate-fermenting Salmonella isolates using multiplex PCR, and subsequently analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A survey questionnaire was conducted to identify potential risk factors for Salmonella presence in broiler farms. The prevalence of Salmonella at the farm level was 26.67%, and Salmonella isolates were serotyped as S. Paratyphi B and all isolates were d-tartrate-fermenting (dT+). PFGE showed three highly similar clusters and one significantly different Salmonella isolate. S. Paratyphi B continued to be present in different links of the poultry chain in the Tolima region, and identification of its main source is necessary to control its dissemination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aanimal pathogens 3acloaca 3afarms 3afeces 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aquestionnaires 3asalmonellosis 3asurveys1 aBernal, Johan  F.1 aCifuentes, Jimmy  F.1 aFandiño, Luz  Clemencia1 aHerrera-Sánchez, María  P.1 aRondón-Barragán, Iang 1 aVerjan Garcia, Noel 0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110409703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010100169506010400270506007600374520172100450592002802171506003702199650001202236650001602248650001502264650001402279650001502293653002802308653001502336653001102351653000902362653002102371653002602392700002202418773008702440856008502527852000902612655001202621IND60786000920221207094557.0220830e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078600092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2022.1065452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMigoń, Piotr,10aLandscapes and landforms in coarse clastic sedimentary tablelands – Is there a unifying theme?  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCoarse clastic sedimentary successions cover approximately-one fourth of the continental surface and give rise to distinctive landforms at a variety of scales. Rock-mass strength differences between members of layered successions account for the presence of escarpments, typically capped by thick sandstone or conglomerate beds, usually also with mid-slope cliffs and benches reflecting variable resistance of individual members of the succession. Depending on the dip of strata, two main types of regional landscapes are plateaus and plains, or homoclinal ridges (cuestas), but higher degree of deformation may occur in the vicinity of major faults, resulting in hogback morphology. Medium-scale landforms include residual hills of various types such as mesas and buttes, rock cities and assemblages of ruiniform relief, whereas canyons and slots are common valley forms. Escarpment retreat is usually considered as an overarching concept in geomorphology of layered successions, but it does not seem to be a universal pathway of landscape evolution and even retreat itself may occur in different ways. We propose that juxtaposition of strong and weak rocks in the vertical succession is the viable unifying theme, as it has profound geomorphological implications, influencing processes and patterns of evolution at a variety of spatial scales. However, depending on lithological characteristics, mechanical and hydrogeological properties, dominant processes may vary, explaining considerable landform diversity within tablelands, even though at the grand scale stepped topography becomes a repetitive theme. Synthetic graphical presentation of morphogenetic systems on coarse clastic successions is also presented.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatenas 3adeformation 3alandscapes 3asandstone 3atopography 0aSandstone geomorphology 0aEscarpment 0aCuesta 0aMesa 0aRuiniform relief 0aMorphogenetic systems1 aDuszyński, Filip0 tCatena.g2022 Nov., v. 218 p.106545-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.1065453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245011900163500001900282520138000301592002801681650001801709650001601727650001601743650002501759650002601784650002701810650000901837650001401846650001601860650001501876650002001891650003001911650001301941650002301954650001501977700002201992700002002014773012002034856007502154852000902229655001202238IND60735063620221122053203.0210423e20210331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073506362DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110409712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantigosa, Ester 10aMicroalgae Oil as an Effective Alternative Source of EPA and DHA for Gilthead Seabream (Sparus aurata) Aquaculture  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroalgal oils (AOs) emerged recently as an alternative to fish oil and to nutritionally poorer vegetable oils for fish species. In this trial, two experimental diets containing fish oil (negative control: 2.1%; positive control: 13.8%) and two diets incorporating AO at 3.5 and 0.7% were fed to grow out gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) of 64.5 g initial body weight. After 110 days of experimental feeding, performance (final body weight mean = 147 g) and survival (>99%) were similar across treatments. The highest eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content in positive control (PC) and 3.5 AO feeds (3.11 and 2.18% of diet, respectively) resulted in the highest EPA + DHA deposition in the fillets (18.40 and 12.36 g/100 g fatty acid, respectively), which entirely reflected the dietary fatty acid profile. Feed and fillets from fish fed the AO diets had lower levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Moreover, sensory quality of AO fillets scored equally to the PC fish. Collectively, these findings offer a more resilient means for sustaining the future growth of seabream aquaculture, whilst maintaining the nutritional value of the resulting seafood. The data supports the addition of seabream to the list of aquaculture species where microalgal oil can be used as an ingredient to fulfil their challenging nutritional demands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3abody weight 3adietary fat 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afish 3afish oils 3aingredients 3amicroalgae 3anutritive value 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aseafoods 3asensory properties 3avegetables1 aBrambilla, Fabio 1 aMilanese, Luca 0 tAnimals.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110409713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245011700183300001600300520167000316592002801986650002002014650004102034650002102075650000902096650001402105650001702119650001302136650001302149650002402162650001202186650001902198650001202217650001302229650001002242650001102252650001002263650005402273650002402327650002902351650002602380650002602406650002602432650002402458650002502482650002802507650003102535650005202566650004202618650002802660700001902688700002302707700001402730773008202744856004802826961001302874852000902887655001202896IND50067421620221122111228.0130802e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006742162DNAL7 a236250162pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-013-1887-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChao, Wun S.10aIncrease in ACC oxidase levels and activities during paradormancy release of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) buds  ap. 205-215.  aThe plant hormone ethylene is known to affect various developmental processes including dormancy and growth. Yet, little information is available about the role of ethylene during paradormancy release in underground adventitious buds of leafy spurge. In this study, we examined changes in ethylene evolution and the ethylene biosynthetic enzyme ACC oxidase following paradormancy release (growth induction). Our results did not show an obvious increase in ethylene during bud growth. However, when buds were incubated with 1 mM ACC, ethylene levels were higher in growing than non-growing buds, suggesting that the levels of ACC oxidase increased in growing buds. Real-time qPCR indicated that the transcript of a Euphorbia esula ACC oxidase (Ee-ACO) increased up to threefold following growth induction. In addition, a 2.5- to 4-fold increase in ACO activity was observed 4 days after decapitation, and the Ee-ACO accounted for 40 % of the total ACO activity. Immunoblot analyses identified a 36-kD Ee-ACO protein that increased in expression during bud growth. This protein was highly expressed in leaves, moderately expressed in crown buds, stems and meristems, and weakly expressed in roots and flowers. Immunolocalization of Ee-ACO on growing bud sections revealed strong labeling of the nucleus and cytoplasm in cells at the shoot apical meristem and leaf primordia. An exception to this pattern occurred in cells undergoing mitosis, where labeling of Ee-ACO was negligible. Taken together, our results indicated an increase in the levels of Ee-ACO during paradormancy release of leafy spurge that was not correlated with an increase in ethylene synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbia esula 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3aapical meristems 3abuds 3acytoplasm 3adecapitation 3adormancy 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3aflowers 3aleaf primordia 3amitosis 3aproteins 3aroots 3ashoots 3astems 2aAmino Acid Oxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCytoplasmxmetabolism 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aEuphorbiaxphysiology 2aFlowersxenzymology 2aMeristemxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Dormancyxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymology1 aSerpe, Marcelo1 aSuttle, Jeffrey C.1 aJia, Ying0 tPlanta.g2013 July, v. 238, no. 1 p.205-215dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-013-1887-z  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01358naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245016000202300001800362500001500380506007600395520014700471592002800618506003700646650000900683650001700692650002100709650001000730650002800740653001000768700001700778773011500795856007700910852000900987655001200996IND60172028220221207122127.0150602e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017202822DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2379582doi7 aPMC40813212pmcid7 a248200232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Pichang10aUncovering Divergence of Rice Exon Junction Complex Core Heterodimer Gene Duplication Reveals Their Essential Role in Growth, Development, and Reproduction  ap. 1047-1061.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDivergence of junction complex genes in rice implicates their importance in cereal growth, development, reproduction, and adaptive evolution .  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arice 3areproduction 3agene duplication 3aexons 3aevolutionary adaptation 0agenes1 aHe, Chaoying0 tPlant physiology.g2014 July, v. 165, no. 3 p.1047-1061dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2379583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011600162520108400278592002801362650001601390650001801406650002101424650002701445650002101472653002601493653001701519653003001536653001701566653002601583700001601609700001701625700001601642700001701658773010001675856008201775852000901857655001201866IND60679589820221120042511.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067958982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2019.1784922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yushi10aSize effects of nano-rutile TiO2 on latent heat recovered of binary eutectic hydrate salt phase change material  aIn the current work, we reported the size effects of rutile TiO₂ nanoparticles on the latent heat recovered of eutectic hydrate salt (EHS) phase change material (PCM). The nanoparticles modified EHS composites were prepared with different volume loadings (0.1 %, 0.3 % and 0.5 %) of TiO₂ nanoparticles with two different sizes of 25 and 100 nm. The rheological behaviour analysis was carried out to demonstrate the dispersion stability of TiO₂ nanoparticles in EHS. The factorial experiment method has been developed to evaluate the size effects of TiO₂ nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the characterization technique, DSC was used to investigate the thermal properties. The results showed that the nanoparticles modified EHS composites incorporated with TiO₂ nanoparticles in diameter of 25 nm achieved an optimal latent heat recovered, of which the mechanism analyses were validated by SEM and FT-IR. This study will provide insights into the further improvement of thermal properties of nanoparticles modified PCM composites by means of tailoring the size of nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3alatent heat 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3arheological properties 3atitanium dioxide 0aPhase change material 0aHydrate salt 0aRutile TiO2 nanoparticles 0aSize effects 0aLatent heat recovered1 aYu, Kunyang1 aYang, Yingzi1 aJia, Minjie1 aSun, Fuzheng0 tThermochimica acta.g2020 Feb., v. 684 p.178492-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2019.1784923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010900167520140900276592002801685650002501713650001901738650003101757650001301788650002901801650002001830650001901850650001401869650001701883650001701900653002001917653003601937653002001973653003001993653001602023700001802039700002102057700001802078700001802096700002502114700001402139700001702153773011402170856008602284852000902370655001202379IND60730075220221119035451.0211206e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073007522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1255622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandts, I.10aImmuno-modulatory effects of nanoplastics and humic acids in the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax)  aPernicious effects of plastic particles, emergent contaminants worldwide, have been described in different species. In teleost species, alterations of immune function after exposure to nanoplastics (NPs) have been reported, but the interaction with cortisol – hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPI) axis has not yet been explored. Furthermore, the role of dissolved organic matter on the effects of NPs is poorly known. Thus, the aims of this research were to assess if polystyrene NPs (PSNPs) acted as a stressor on juvenile European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), interfering with the immune response, as well as to elucidate if humic acids (HA) modulated the potential effects of PSNPs. A short-term exposure to PSNPs and HA elicited an immuno-modulatory response, with an activation of steroidogenic stress-related pathways. An upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (il10, tgfb) and stress-related (mc2r, gr1) transcripts were observed after exposure to HA and PSNPs both individually and in co-exposure. No notable alteration of inflammatory markers was consistently found, which may reflect a protective anti-inflammatory effect of HA in the presence of PSNPs. Nevertheless, there seems to be a more complex interaction between both components. Overall, data show that understanding the interaction of NPs with dissolved organic substances is key to deciphering their environmental risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aacute exposure 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acortisol 3adissolved organic matter 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-10 3ajuveniles 3ananoplastics 3apolystyrenes 0aImmune response 0aTransforming growth factor beta 0aStress response 0aGlucocorticoid receptor 1 0aHead kidney1 aBalasch, J.C.1 aGonçalves, A.P.1 aMartins, M.A.1 aPereira, M.L.1 aTvarijonaviciute, A.1 aTeles, M.1 aOliveira, M.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 July 15, v. 414 p.125562-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1255623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245012300210300001200333500001900345520107600364592002801440650000801468650001501476650001201491650001201503650001201515650001201527650001201539650001401551650001901565650000701584650002301591650001901614650001501633650001301648650001301661651001201674700001801686700002101704700002101725700002301746773014001769856008301909852000901992655001202001IND60736001620221117183023.0210522e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073600162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-021-05146-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeighton, Holly D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4965-106910aSoil Water Responses to Wood Ash Addition to Acidic Upland Soils: Implications for Combatting Calcium Decline in Lakes  ap. 191.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCalcium (Ca) concentrations in lakes have declined in many regions, and concerns have been expressed that Ca levels are falling below biologically significant thresholds. Wood ash additions to soil are typically used to combat soil acidification, and it is unclear whether wood ash additions to upland soils will lead to higher Ca leaching to surface waters. In this study we applied fly ash or bottom ash at 4 Mg ha⁻¹ and 8 Mg ha⁻¹ to upland soils at replicated plots in Haliburton Forest in central Ontario and measured soil water chemistry at 3 depths over 4 years. Increases in soil water Ca concentration following application were quite modest and occurred primarily in the fly ash treatments in the upper depth (0.3 m) during the first 2 years following application. There was no concomitant increase in pH or acid-neutralizing capacity primarily because of the high sulphate leaching associated with the fly ash treatments. Overall, these results show that wood ash addition to soils at moderate doses will have little impact on soil export to lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abottom ash 3acalcium 3adecline 3aexports 3afly ash 3aforests 3ahighlands 3ahydrochemistry 3apH 3asoil acidification 3asoil pollution 3asoil water 3asulfates 3awood ash 3aOntario1 aReid, Carolyn1 aBasiliko, Nathan1 aHazlett, Paul W.1 aWatmough, Shaun A.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2021 May, v. 232, no. 5 p.191-191dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05146-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245008500209520160900294592002801903650002301931650002301954650002401977650005202001650002102053650001502074650001002089650001302099650001102112650001702123650001302140650001602153650001302169650001702182650001402199650001302213650001702226650001302243651002002256653002002276653001502296653002402311653002502335700001802360700001602378700001902394700002602413700001502439700001902454700001902473773011202492856008702604852000902691655001202700IND60758371420221122022304.0220124e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075837142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1143752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkram, Fatima1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8438-706X10aInsights into the evolutionary and prophylactic analysis of SARS-CoV-2: A review  aIn late 2019, following the emergence of a β-originated SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetic and evolutionary approaches have been demonstrated to strengthen the diagnostic and prophylactic stratagem of COVID-19 at an unprecedented level. Despite its clinical prominence, the SARS-CoV-2 gene set remains largely irrefutable by impeding the dissection of COVID-19 biology. However, many pieces of molecular and serological evidence have predicted that SARS-CoV-2 related viruses carry their roots from bats and pangolins of South East Asia. Analysis of viral genome predicts that point mutations at a rate of 10⁻⁴ nucleotides per base in the receptor-binding domain allow the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants at regular intervals. Research in the evolution of molecular pathways involved in emergence of pandemic is critical for the development of therapeutics and vaccines as well as the prevention of future zoonosis. By determining the phyletic lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants and those of the conserved regions in the accessory and spike proteins of all the SARS-related coronaviruses, a universal vaccine against all human coronaviruses could be formulated which would revolutionize the field of medicine. This review highlighted the current development and future prospects of antiviral drugs, inhibitors, mesenchymal stem cells, passive immunization, targeted immune therapy and CRISPR-Cas-based prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2. However, further investigations on Covid-19 pathogenesis is required for the successful fabrication of successful antivirals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aPholidota (mammals) 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral agents 3adissection 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3amedicine 3anucleotides 3apandemic 3apathogenesis 3aphylogeny 3avaccines 3aviral genome 3azoonoses 3aSouth East Asia 0aAntiviral drugs 0aCRISPR-Cas 0aSARS-CoV-2 variants 0aPhylogenetic lineage1 aIkram-ul-Haq,1 aAqeel, Amna1 aAhmed, Zeeshan1 aShah, Fatima Iftikhar1 aNawaz, Ali1 aZafar, Javaria1 aSattar, Rukhma0 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 Feb., v. 300 p.114375-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1143753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001700187245016000204300001800364506007600382520023100458592002800689506003700717650002900754650001000783650001900793650001100812650001300823650002500836650001300861650002300874651001300897700001400910700001600924700001800940700001400958700001400972700001400986700001801000700002101018700001801039700001501057700001901072773012701091856008001218852000901298655001201307IND60117758220221207124323.0141126e20141031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011775822DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00875-142doi7 aPMC41555892pmcid7 a251895842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKropp, K.

The materials are characterized using the adsorption of nitrogen, SEM/EDX, and potentiometric titration. Their electrochemical performance was measured in two and three electrode cells in H₂SO₄ as an electrolyte. Activation results in a significant increase in the capacitance owing to the development of porosity and an increase in the surface oxygen content. To account for the beneficial effect of the volume of pores smaller than 0.7 nm on the double layer capacitance and of surface wettability on ion transfer to these pores, a charge storage accessibility factor, CSAF, was proposed as a product of the volume of pores smaller than 0.7 nm and surface oxygen content. The results indicate that there is a dependence between CSAF and the energy storage in carbon-based supercapacitors provided that the electrical double layer capacitance in small pores is the predominant mechanism of charge storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acapacitance 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene 3ananopores 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aporosity 3apotassium hydroxide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfuric acid 3atitration 3awettability 0aCapacitance 0aNanoporous carbon 0aGraphene/carbon composite 0aConductivity 0aPorosity1 aKoscinski, Mikolaj1 aŚliwińska-Bartkowiak, Małgorzata,1 aBandosz, Teresa J.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2013 Aug. 05, v. 1, no. 8 p.1024-1032dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc400092g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03745naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245019600204520220600400592002802606650001902634650001402653650001802667650000902685650002002694650001502714650001102729650001402740650001602754650001802770650001402788651001102802651001202813653002202825653001702847653002102864653002602885653001902911653002102930653003102951700002502982700001303007700001703020700001703037773010703054856008103161852000903242655001203251IND60694856420221121122806.0200514e20200514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069485642DNAL7 a10.1017/S0022149X200003712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtopkin, D.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8417-342410aNew species of Parasaccocoelium (Haploporidae) and new genus Pseudohaplosplanchnus (Haplosplanchnidae) from mullet fish in the Far East of Russia and Vietnam: morphological and molecular data  aA description and the molecular characterization of two new species in the Haploporidae and Haplosplanchnidae families are provided herein. Parasaccocoelium armatum n. sp. was collected from the intestine of a Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758 from the Primorsky region, Russia, and Pseudohaplosplanchnus catbaensis n. g. n. sp. was collected from Moolgarda seheli (Forsskål, 1775) in the coastal waters of Cat Ba Island, Vietnam. The morphological features of P. armatum n. sp. closely resemble those of Parasaccocoelium polyovum, but these species differ from one another by hermaphroditic sac and vitellaria area length and by maximal egg size. The main difference between P. armatum n. sp. and P. polyovum is the presence of an armed hermaphroditic duct in the new species. Molecular data support the case for inclusion of the studied trematodes in P. armatum n. sp. Worms P. catbaensis n. g. n. sp. from the mullet from Vietnam are morphologically close to Haplosplanchnus (Haplosplosplanchninae). The only difference between P. catbaensis n. g. n. sp. and species of Haplosplanchnus is the presence of few (1–7) large eggs, measuring 135–142 × 92–104 μm, versus numerous small eggs with a maximal size of 75 × 50 μm. Phylogenetic analysis showed that there is a contradiction between the morphological similarity of the worms and their position in the Haplosplanchnidae system, based on the genetic data. Results of this study indicate that P. catbaensis n. g. n. sp. is genetically distant from other representatives of Haplosplanchnus, despite their morphological similarity. According to the molecular data, P. catbaensis n. g. n. sp. is close to Hymenocotta mulli Manter, 1961 (Hymenocottinae). However, these species are considerably different to each other morphologically. Molecular data argue for the possibility of establishing a new subfamily for P. catbaensis n. g. n. sp. However, considering earlier studies of Haplosplanchnidae, we support the view that creating new subfamilies within this family is unreasonable because of the lack of molecular data for most haplosplanchnid species, which are necessary to resolve the problematic systematics and phylogeny of this family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMugil cephalus 3aTrematoda 3acoastal water 3aeggs 3ahermaphroditism 3aintestines 3amullet 3anew genus 3anew species 3anew subfamily 3aphylogeny 3aRussia 3aVietnam 0aHaplosplanchnidae 0aHaploporidae 0aParasaccocoelium 0aPseudohaplosplanchnus 0amolecular data 0aRussian Far East 0aphylogenetic relationships1 aBesprozvannykh, V.V.1 aHa, D.N.1 aNguyen, V.H.1 aNguyen, V.T.0 tJournal of helminthology.g, v. 94 p.e154-dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X200003713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245016400202300001600366520149100382592002801873650004401901650002601945650002001971650002501991650001602016650001302032650001502045650002302060650001002083650002102093650002602114650001202140650002202152650002402174650001502198650001602213650001702229650001902246650004402265650001402309650001502323650001302338650002102351653001702372653001602389653001802405653001302423700002902436700002302465700002402488700002102512700002202533700002202555700002402577773011702601856008102718852000902799655001202808IND60694856520221121122748.0200514e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069485652DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820200003722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmi, Taher1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4247-444510aNovel chloroquine loaded curcumin based anionic linear globular dendrimer G2: a metabolomics study on Plasmodium falciparum in vitro using ¹H NMR spectroscopy  ap. 747-759.  aDue to side-effects and inefficiency of the drugs used in malaria treatment, finding alternative medicine with less side-effects has attracted much attention. In this regard, in the present study, nanocomposite synthesized and its effects on the metabolites of P. falciparum were investigated. Subsequent to synthesis of nanocomposites, characterization was carried out using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and Fourier-transform infrared tests. Solubility and drug release were measured and its toxicity on Vero cell was assessed using the MTT assay. The antiparasitic effect of the nanocomposite on the metabolites of P. falciparum was investigated by ¹H NMR spectroscopy. Among synthesized nanocomposites, the average size of 239 nm showed suitable solubility in water as well as slow drug release. The MTT assay showed no toxicity for Vero cell lines. Concentrations of 2.5 μg mL⁻¹ of nanocomposite eliminated 82.6% of the total parasites. The most effected metabolic cycles were glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. In this study, ¹H NMR spectroscopy was used with untargeted metabolomics to study the effect of the nanocomposite on P. falciparum. Playing an essential role in understanding drug-target interactions and characterization of mechanism of action or resistance exhibited by novel antiprotozoal drugs, can be achieved by targeting metabolic using LC-MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aadverse effects 3aalternative medicine 3achloroquine 3acurcumin 3adendrimers 3adicarboxylic acids 3adrugs 3alight scattering 3aliquid chromatography 3amalaria 3amass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3ananocomposites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparasites 3asolubility 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 0aDendrimer G2 0ametabolomic 0ananocomposite 0aProtozoa1 aShafiee Ardestani, Mehdi1 aHajialiani, Fateme1 aMotevalian, Manijeh1 aMohamadi, Maryam1 aSadeghi, Sedigheh1 aZamānī, Zahrā,1 aTabatabaie, Fatemeh0 tParasitology.g2020 June, v. 147, no. 7 p.747-759dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200003723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006200144245011200206300002000318500001900338520185900357592002802216650001402244650001102258650001902269650000902288650001102297653001502308653001802323653001202341653001402353653001802367653001202385700001502397700006002412700001902472700001902491700001902510700002102529773014202550856007802692852000902770655001202779IND60718703420210831000000.0201125e20201116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071870342DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c154282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKüffner, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4762-476410aNanoparticle Wetting Agent for Gas Stream-Assisted Blade-Coated Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules  ap. 52678-52690.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLab-scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 25.2%. However, a reliable transfer of solution processing from spin coating to scalable printing techniques and a homogeneous deposition on large substrate sizes is challenging also caused by dewetting of the perovskite precursor solution on highly hydrophobic subjacent materials. In this work, we report the utilization of blade-coated nonconductive silicon oxide (SiO₂) nanoparticles (NPs) as wetting agent for the precursor solution to enable the deposition of a homogeneous perovskite layer on the nonwetting hole transport layer (HTL). The NPs enhance the HTL surface energy, thus, wetting and homogeneous spreading of the precursor solution is strongly improved so that pinholes in the perovskite layer are avoided. In addition, we apply this concept for the first time for gas stream-assisted blade coating of PSCs and modules in the inverted (p-i-n) device architecture with poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) as HTL on large-area substrates. To prevent void formation at the HTL interface of gas stream-assisted blade coated perovskite layers, the effect of blending small amounts of lead chloride (PbCl₂) in the perovskite precursor solution is investigated, which also improves reproducibility and device performance. Following these optimizations, blade coated PSCs with 0.24 cm² active area achieve up to 17.9% PCE. Furthermore, to prove scalability, we show enlarged substrates of up to 9 × 9 cm² and analyze the homogeneity of the perovskite layer in blade coating direction. Moreover, by implementing the blade coated NP wetting agent, we fabricate large-area modules with a maximum PCE of 9.3% on 49.60 cm² aperture area. This represents a further important step bringing solution-processed inverted PSCs closer to application.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3alead 3asilica 0aperovskite 0ananoparticles 0awetting 0aupscaling 0ablade coating 0amodules1 aWahl, Tina1 aSchultes, Moritz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8921-10551 aHanisch, Jonas1 aZillner, Julia1 aAhlswede, Erik1 aPowalla, Michael0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Nov. 16, v. 12, no. 47 p.52678-52690dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c154283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008000168520184300248592002802091650001802119650001902137650001202156650001602168650002002184650000902204650001602213653002302229653001402252653001202266653002802278653001202306700002102318700001902339700002202358773010202380856008502482852000902567655001202576IND60747207020221121222828.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074720702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1046682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilder, Thore10aNetwork analysis of tail-biting in pigs – indirect effect on tail posture  aTail-biting in pigs compromises animal health and animal welfare, thus, early indicators of an outbreak must be discovered before severe tail lesions occur. Tail posture is one of these promising indicators. The individual animal's behaviour is affected by the group structure, which can be investigated using social networks. Therefore, this study analysed the effect of the group structure of tail-biting pigs on tail posture using pig-level social network parameters. Detailed behavioural observations of 6 pens with 24 undocked pigs per pen four days before a tail-biting outbreak were the data basis. The effect of ingoing network parameters (weighted in-degree, weighted ingoing closeness) on binary tail posture (0: raised, 1: lowered) was tested as covariates in generalised linear mixed models. The pen (1-6), day (t₋₁ to t₋₄), hour (10:00 h – 17:00 h), location (at the trough, not at the trough) and receiver (received tail-directed behaviour in the previous 20 min, received no tail-directed behaviour in the previous 20 min) were used as fixed effects. Additional to the fixed effect receiver (p < 0.05), the probability of a lowered tail posture increased with higher values of weighted in-degree (p < 0.05) if less than 40 min passed between the tail-biting and the tail posture observation. If the tail-biting event was 40 to 120 min before the tail posture observation, the probability of a lowered tail posture increased with higher values of weighted ingoing closeness (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the location in the pen (p < 0.05) and the interaction between pen and day (p < 0.05) affected the tail posture significantly. Thus, the group structure of tail-biting pigs has a prolonged influence on tail posture. For this reason, the tail posture is a practicable indicator of tail-biting if monitored regularly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3aanimal welfare 3aposture 3aprobability 3asocial networks 3atail 3atail biting 0aAgonistic behavior 0aIndicator 0aPiglets 0aSocial network analysis 0aWelfare1 aKrieter, Joachim1 aKemper, Nicole1 aBüttner, Kathrin0 tLivestock science.g2021 Sept., v. 251 p.104668-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1046683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008000168300001400248520135000262592002801612650002901640650001201669650001301681650001501694650001101709650001701720650001501737650003501752650001701787650000901804650001401813650001101827650002201838651001901860653001801879653001701897653001401914653001401928653001501942653002401957700001901981700001502000700001302015773010602028856008502134852000902219655001202228IND60565856020221120024708.0180904e20170308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056585602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2014.12.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarroll, J.10aApplication of palaeoecology for peatland conservation at Mossdale Moor, UK  ap. 39-47.  aIn a recent discussion of research priorities for palaeoecology, it was suggested that palaeoecological data can be applied and used to inform nature conservation practice. The present study exemplifies this approach and was conducted on a degraded blanket mire in Yorkshire, UK, in collaboration with a field-based moorland restoration agency. High-resolution, multiproxy palaeoecological analyses on a peat core from Mossdale Moor reconstructed mid to late-Holocene vegetation changes. Humification, pollen, plant macrofossil and charcoal analyses carried out throughout the peat profile show marked changes in species composition and indicate their potential causes. Results suggest that human clearance in the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition may have initiated peat growth at Mossdale Moor, making this landscape ‘semi-natural’ in its origin. Further human-induced changes are identified at 1300 cal years BP, most likely clearance by fire, and between 20 and 0 cm depth where a substantial charcoal increase is interpreted as recent (<400 years) management practices using burning to encourage browse on the moor. The long-term ecological history of the moor, derived using palaeoecological techniques, will be used to inform conservation practice and to help set feasible targets for restoration and conservation at Mossdale Moor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aburning 3acharcoal 3aheathlands 3ahumans 3ahumification 3alandscapes 3anatural resources conservation 3apaleoecology 3apeat 3apeatlands 3apollen 3aspecies diversity 3aUnited Kingdom 0aPalaeoecology 0aConservation 0aPeatlands 0aYorkshire 0aMultiproxy 0aMoorland management1 aChambers, F.M.1 aWebb, J.C.1 aThom, T.0 tQuaternary international.g2017 Mar. 08, v. 432 p.39-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.12.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011200169300001600281520172500297592002802022650001402050650001302064650001002077650002402087650000902111650001602120650001202136650001802148650002402166650002502190700002002215700001602235700002302251700002402274700002002298773009602318856008602414990002302500852000902523655001202532IND60091974920221118235618.0141103e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009197492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlessi, T.10aDevelopment and testing of PCM doped cool colored coatings to mitigate urban heat island and cool buildings  ap. 570-576.  aIn this study the performance of organic PCMs used as latent heat storage materials, when incorporated in coatings for buildings and urban fabric, is investigated. Thirty six coatings of six colors containing different quantities of PCMs in different melting points were produced. Accordingly, infrared reflective (cool) and common coatings with the same binder system and of the same color were prepared for a comparative thermal evaluation. The samples were divided in six groups of different color and eight samples each: three PCM coatings of different melting temperatures (18 °C, 24 °C, 28 °C) each one of two different PCM concentrations (20% w/w, 30% w/w), an infrared reflective and a common coating of matching color. Surface temperature of the samples was recorded at a 24 h basis during August 2008. The results demonstrate that all PCM coatings present lower surface temperatures than infrared reflective and common coatings. Analysis of the daily temperature differences showed that peak temperature differences occur between PCM and common or cool coatings from 7 am to 10 am. Investigating the temperature gradient revealed that for this time period the values for PCM coatings are lower compared to infrared reflective and common. From 10 am to 12 pm, temperature gradients for all coatings have similar values. Thus coatings containing PCMs store heat in a latent form maintaining constant surface temperatures and discharge with time delay. PCM doped cool colored coatings have the potential to enhance thermal inertia and achieve important energy savings in buildings maintaining a thermally comfortable indoor environment, while fighting urban heat island when applied on external surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acoatings 3acolor 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3aheat island 3amelting 3amelting point 3asurface temperature 3atemperature profiles1 aSantamouris, M.1 aSynnefa, A.1 aAssimakopoulos, D.1 aDidaskalopoulos, P.1 aApostolakis, K.0 tBuilding and environment.g2011 Mar., v. 46, no. 3 p.570-576dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.09.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015400167500002200321520159000343592002801933650002201961650001501983650001501998650001302013650001702026650001802043650002502061650002102086650001902107650001002126653002402136653001902160653001902179653002902198653003202227700001802259773012402277856008502401852000902486655001202495IND60747207120221121222819.0210813e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074720712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyagi, Parul10aComparative study of the pharmacological, phytochemical and biotechnological aspects of Tribulusterrestris Linn. and Pedalium murex Linn: An overview  aPre-press version  aTreatment and management of various diseases are cured by use of herbal remedies, which are worked in the numerous medicinal systems.

This review paper will be helpful for further research on T. terrestris and P. murex with an understanding of pharmacological and phytochemical aspects besides the biotechnological, and nanotechnological approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3aendophytes 3aflavonoids 3anitrates 3aplant growth 3aplant tissues 3arhizosphere bacteria 3asteroid saponins 3atissue culture 3aurine 0aTribulus terrestris 0aPedalium murex 0aPhytochemistry 0aPharmacological activity 0aBiotechnological approaches1 aRanjan, Rajiv0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2021 July 21, dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245011200157300002000269500001900289520175300308592002802061650001802089650003402107650001302141650001502154650001402169650001102183650002202194650001602216653001102232653001702243653001902260653002102279700001402300700006702314700001902381700006202400773014202462856007802604852000902682655001202691IND60718703520221119045548.0201125e20201111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071870352DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c154582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Si10aUnveiling Temperature-Induced Structural Domains and Movement of Oxygen Vacancies in SrTiO₃ with Graphene  ap. 52915-52921.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHeterointerfaces coupling complex oxides exhibit coexisting functional properties such as magnetism, superconductivity, and ferroelectricity, often absent in their individual constituent. SrTiO₃ (STO), a canonical band insulator, is an active constituent of such heterointerfaces. Temperature-, strain-, or mechanical stress-induced ferroelastic transition leads to the formation of narrow domains and domain walls in STO. Such ferroelastic domain walls have been studied using imaging or transport techniques and, often, the findings are influenced by the choice and interaction of the electrodes with STO. In this work, we use graphene as a unique platform to unveil the movement of oxygen vacancies and ferroelastic domain walls near the STO surface by studying the temperature and gate bias dependence of charge transport in graphene. By sweeping the back gate voltage, we observe antihysteresis in graphene typically observed in conventional ferroelectric oxides. Interestingly, we find features in antihysteresis that are related to the movement of domain walls and of oxygen vacancies in STO. We ascertain this by analyzing the time dependence of the graphene square resistance at different temperatures and gate bias. Density functional calculations estimate the surface polarization and formation energies of layer-dependent oxygen vacancies in STO. This corroborates quantitatively with the activation energies determined from the temperature dependence of the graphene square resistance. Introduction of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layer, of varying thicknesses, between graphene and STO leads to a gradual disappearance of the observed features, implying the influence of the domain walls onto the potential landscape in graphene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3aelectric potential difference 3agraphene 3alandscapes 3amagnetism 3aoxygen 3asuperconductivity 3atemperature 0aSrTiO3 0adomain walls 0aantihysteresis 0aoxygen vacancies1 aChen, Xin1 aDuijnstee, Elisabeth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7002-15231 aSanyal, Biplab1 aBanerjee, Tamalika1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6848-04670 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Nov. 11, v. 12, no. 47 p.52915-52921dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c154583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005200152245011400204520193600318592002802254650002302282650005202305650002002357650002602377650001002403650001202413650001302425650001302438650004302451650001202494651001602506651001902522653001502541653004402556653003202600700005502632700001402687700001702701700006002718773011202778856008702890852000902977655001202986IND60758371720221122021907.0220124e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075837172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1143782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGard, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9182-898610aValidation and verification of the GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RealAmp kit on the ELITe InGenius® instrument  aThroughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a rapid identification of the virus was essential to quickly recognize positive cases and limit further spread by applying appropriate infection prevention. Many diagnostic laboratories use a multiplex Real-Time PCR assay, as they are not only highly sensitive but also specific. Currently, there are several assays and platforms in the market available which target different SARS-CoV-2 genes. The aim of this study was to validate and verify the GeneFinder™ COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit on the ELITe InGenius® instrument and compare to the national reference method.GeneFinder™ COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit was evaluated against the routine WHO in- house Real-Time PCR assay, which is also the national reference method in the Netherlands and used in our laboratory. The sensitivity was tested using the analytical panel from Qnostics (Glasgow, United Kingdom) and the specificity was tested with patient material comprising of other seasonal respiratory viruses. In addition, 96 clinical samples initially analyzed by routine Real-Time PCR were tested using the GeneFinder™ COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit on the ELITe InGenius® instrument.The GeneFinder™ COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit had a similar performance compared to routine in-house testing, with a limit of detection of 500 dC/mL for the RdRp-gene and E gene. Meanwhile, the N gene showed a limit of detection of 50 dC/mL. The SARS-CoV-2 test was highly specific and detected no other respiratory viruses. The results of the clinical samples were comparable between both assays with similar Ct values observed for the in-house Real-Time-PCR and the GeneFinder™ COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit for the N gene.The GeneFinder™ COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit on the ELITe InGenius® instrument had an appropriate sensitivity and specificity that could be used in small scale laboratories or during night shifts where accurate diagnostics are crucial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenes 3amarkets 3apandemic 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3aNetherlands 3aUnited Kingdom 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aGeneFinder™ COVID-19 PLUS RealAmp kit 0aELITe InGenius® instrument1 aFliss, M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1117-40791 aBosma, F.1 ater Veen, D.1 aNiesters, H.G.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1758-04300 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 Feb., v. 300 p.114378-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.1143783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01790naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001700187245015400204300001800358506007600376520034100452592002800793506003700821650002600858650001900884650001200903650001100915650002000926650001600946650002500962650001100987700001900998700001901017700002001036700001501056700001801071700001801089700002101107773012701128856008001255852000901335655001201344IND60117758520221207124330.0141126e20141030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011775852DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00878-142doi7 aPMC41751952pmcid7 a252917602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaika, Azusa10aDraft Genome Sequence of the Yeast Pseudozyma antarctica Type Strain JCM10317, a Producer of the Glycolipid Biosurfactants, Mannosylerythritol Lipids  ap. e00878-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe basidiomycetous yeast Pseudozyma antarctica is known as a producer of industrial enzymes and the extracellular glycolipids, mannosylerythritol lipids.

The factors affecting the bio-beta-carotene production from Dunaliella salina microalgae have been investigated in this study. First, the different usages of Dunaliella salina, especially for the production of beta-carotene, are described. Then, the factors affecting the process of obtaining beta-carotene from Dunaliella salina in the culture system, culture conditions, and downstream processes are investigated. Investigations show that application of airborne photo-bioreactor culture system improves the mechanism of production. It was found that among the culture conditions, the parameters such as ambient salinity, temperature, and intensity of illumination are the most effective ones. The optimal values for these parameters, the highest cellular density of Dunaliella salina and the highest beta-carotene production are determined. The extraction step is known as the most critical step in the downstream processes of beta-carotene production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDunaliella salina 3abeta-carotene 3alighting 3amicroalgae 3aphotobioreactors 3asalinity 3atemperature 0aBeta-carotene 0aDunaliella salina 0aExtraction 0aMicroalgae 0aOptimal condition1 aHallajisani, Ahmad1 aAlizadehdakhel, Asghar1 aNouralishahi, Amideddin1 aGolzary, Abooali0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Oct., v. 29 p.101771-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1017713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012200163300001600285520190000301592002802201650001102229650001402240650001402254650001002268650001002278650001202288650001102300650002302311650002302334650001102357650001102368650001602379650001602395651001602411700002002427773009802447856007302545852000902618655001202627IND60403269620221120211050.0150831e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040326962DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.122382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGimpsey, Vicky J.10aIn a world of white, flower colour matters: A white–purple transition signals lack of reward in an alpine Euphrasia  ap. 701-708.  aThe New Zealand alpine flora displays a range of unusual characteristics compared with other alpine floras, in particular the high frequency of species with small white flowers. The presence of both white and bright purple flowers on the same plant in the New Zealand alpine annual creeping eyebright (Euphrasia dyeri Wettst.) provides an ideal opportunity to investigate the significance of flower colour in an environment where coloured flowers are rare. The relationships among flower age, gender phase, reward availability and petal colour were assessed in natural populations of E. dyeri. The effect of pollination on flower colour was tested using hand pollination of bagged flowers. Direct observations and videos of flowers were used to assess patterns of flower visitation by native and introduced pollinators. Unpollinated white E. dyeri flowers changed from white to purple within 6 days. However, pollination of white flowers triggered a significantly faster colour change, typically within 1–2 days. White flowers had receptive stigmas, large amounts of lipid‐rich pollen and small amounts of nectar, whereas stigmas of purple flowers are not receptive and flowers did not provide pollen or nectar rewards. Flowers were mainly visited by native syrphid flies. Both native syrphids and introduced Bombus bees showed a marked avoidance of purple flowers, tending to preferentially visit white flowers. Our study suggests that flower colour change from white to bright purple in E. dyeri functions to direct pollinators to rewarding, receptive flowers. As many Euphrasia L. species are described as having variably coloured flowers, this mechanism may be more widespread in the genus. Furthermore, our results add to the growing evidence that the dominance of white flowers in the New Zealand alpine is not simply due to a lack of colour discrimination among pollinators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aEuphrasia 3aSyrphidae 3acolor 3aflora 3aflowers 3agender 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3anectar 3apollen 3apollination 3apollinators 3aNew Zealand1 aLord, Janice M.0 tAustral ecology.g2015 Sept., v. 40, no. 6 p.701-708dBlackwell Science Asiax1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.122383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245013100208520213500339592002802474650001602502650001202518650002802530650001102558650002302569650001402592650002202606650002102628650001202649650001702661651001002678653002502688653002902713653001602742653001602758653001302774700001702787700001302804700002002817700001902837773011002856856008802966852000903054655001203063IND60731504120221118005521.0210708e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073150412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hai-Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2425-781510aSpatiotemporal variation of benthic biodiversity under persistent and extreme human disturbances in the Xiamen sea area, China  aThis study uses benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators to analyze the variational characteristics of benthic biodiversity under persistent environmental pressures, such as rapid economic and population growth, large-scale urbanization, rapid tourism development, intensified port activities, and extreme human disturbances such as reclamation and dredging, in the Xiamen sea area during 1980–2016. From 1980 to 1990, benthic biodiversity in the area generally remained high, with a species richness of 13, individual abundance of 584 ind/m², biomass of 79.58 g/m², and a Shannon diversity index (H′) of 3.26. Under persistent environmental pressure, this biodiversity significantly declined from 2005 to 2007, but improved during 2013–2016 as a result of measures such as establishing reserves, prohibiting aquaculture, and controlling the inflow of pollutants. Under the extreme disturbance caused by reclamation, the average species richness, individual abundance, and H′ of the Tong'an Bay (TB) and the Dadeng sea area (DS) declined considerably. The DS closer to the open sea experienced a benthic biodiversity decrease (25.2% on average) that was significantly less than the decrease in the semi-enclosed TB with a smaller area (55.8% on average), which stopped declining after the sharp drop in the first year after reclamation. This contrasts with TB, where benthic biodiversity six years after reclamation remained considerably lower than before reclamation. However, the decrease in the local total species richness caused by reclamation can be recovered, regardless of whether it is in the open DS or the semi-enclosed TB. Under the extreme disturbance of dredging, individual abundance and biomass in the dredging areas were significantly lower than the average for the study area in 2005–2012. However, following the completion of dredging in 2012, benthic biodiversity noticeably increased in 2013–2016 to higher than the average of the area, indicating that dredging could improve the quality of benthic habitats and increase benthic biodiversity in sea areas with heavy sedimentation and pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3abiomass 3acoastal zone management 3ahumans 3amacroinvertebrates 3apollution 3apopulation growth 3aspecies richness 3atourism 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aBenthic biodiversity 0aSpatiotemporal variation 0aDisturbance 0aReclamation 0aDredging1 aFu, Shi-Feng1 aWu, Jian1 aCai, Xiao-Qiong1 aChen, Qing-Hui0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 June 15, v. 207 p.105556-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013500167300001600302520173600318592002802054650001502082650001902097650002202116650001302138650001602151650002502167650001402192650001402206650001602220650001802236650001402254650001902268650001002287650001102297650002302308650001902331700002002350700002002370700002002390700001702410700002302427773012002450856008202570852000902652655001202661IND60736002020221117183034.0210729e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073600202DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293210400502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChendev, Yu. G.10aContrasting Variants of Soil Development at Archaeological Sites on Floodplains in the Forest-Steppe of the Central Russian Upland  ap. 461-477.  aThe soils of archaeological sites on river floodplains with contrasting history of the Holocene soil evolution in the south and north of the forest-steppe zone on the Central Russian Upland have been studied. The conditions for the meadow-chernozemic soil development on the high floodplain in the lower course of the Savala River (Voronezh oblast) were most favorable in the Early Holocene (10.3–9 ka BP); 9 ka BP, the soil humus profile was two times deeper than it is today. The most intensive alluvial sedimentation (0.5 mm/yr) was typical of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene (11–8.3 ka BP), while in the Middle and Late Holocene, the rate of the upward growth of soils decreased to 0.05 mm/yr. The underdevelopment of modern chernozemic-meadow soil profiles suggests an alternation of accumulation and denudation (including deflation) of fine-earth particles on the soil surface in the Late Holocene. On the floodplain in the upper course of the Oka River (Orel oblast), the development of a monogenetic profile of medium-deep leached chernozems with the humus content of more than 7% and humus stocks in the upper meter of at least 450 t/ha took place in the Holocene. Before the beginning of the second millennium AD, the alluvium sedimentation rate was no more than 0.02 mm/yr; in the recent millennium, it has increased up to 1 mm/yr. The specificity of changes in the bioclimatic conditions and spatiotemporal specificity of anthropogenic disturbances of the natural environment caused the metachronous Holocene evolution of floodplain soils in the studied regions. The importance of radiocarbon dating of organic matter of uneven-aged soils for paleopedological and paleogeographic reconstructions is shown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3aHolocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3aalluvium 3aarchaeology 3acarbon radioisotopes 3adeflation 3aevolution 3afloodplains 3aforest steppe 3ahighlands 3aholocene soils 3ahumus 3arivers 3asedimentation rate 3asoil formation1 aFedyunin, I.

The current paper presents a simulation system to predict and evaluate microclimatic modifying effects of PECWs in urban locations where PECW installation is under consideration at the design stage. This simulation system is composed of a CFD simulation tool and a 3D-CAD-based thermal simulation tool. Simulation methodology of coupling the two simulation tools was developed and described in this paper. Numerical models for simulating surface temperatures and evaporation of PECWs were proposed based on analysis results of experimental data. Validation of the proposed numerical models was confirmed by comparing simulated results with measured data. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed simulation system, a case study was then performed to predict and evaluate the microclimate in a rest station where PECWs were assumed to be installed. Spatial distributions of air temperature, airflow, moisture and surface temperature in the rest station were simulated under a sunny weather condition in the summer of Tokyo. Furthermore, thermal comfort indexes (mean radiant temperature and new standard effective temperature) were used to evaluate thermal comfort in the human activity spaces of the rest station. Simulation results show that this simulation system can provide quantitative predictions and evaluations of microclimatic modifying effects resulting from the application of PECWs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aair temperature 3acase studies 3aceramics 3acooling 3aevaporation 3ahumans 3amathematical models 3amicroclimate 3aprediction 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3aurban areas 3aweather0 tBuilding and environment.g2011 Mar., v. 46, no. 3 p.584-596dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.09.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001900191245009100210300001800301520161500319592002801934650001301962650002301975650001101998650002602009650002602035650000902061650004602070650001102116650002202127650003202149650001602181700001702197700001702214700002102231700002702252773009002279856008402369990002302453852000902476655001202485IND60087479020221119203411.0141102e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008747902DNAL7 a233213022pmid7 aPMC36288092pmcid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoyer, John T.10aIndentation properties and glycosaminoglycan content of human menisci in the deep zone  ap. 6624-6629.  aMenisci are two crescent shaped fibrocartilaginous structures that provide fundamental load distribution and support within the knee joint. Their unique shape transmits axial stresses (i.e. “body force”) into hoop or radial stresses. The menisci are primarily an inhomogeneous aggregate of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) supporting bulk compression and type I collagen fibrils sustaining tension. It has been shown that the superficial meniscal layers are functionally homogeneous throughout the three distinct regions (anterior, central and posterior) using a 300μm diameter spherical indenter tip, but the deep zone of the meniscus has yet to be mechanically characterized at this scale. Furthermore, the distribution and content of GAG throughout the human meniscal cross-section have not been examined. This study investigated the mechanical properties, via indentation, of the human deep zone meniscus among three regions of the lateral and medial menisci. The distribution of GAGs through the cross-section was also documented. Results for the deep zone of the meniscus showed the medial posterior region to have a significantly greater instantaneous elastic modulus than the central region. No significant differences in the equilibrium modulus were seen when comparing regions or the hemijoint. Histological results revealed that GAGs are not present until at least ∼600μm from the meniscal surface. Understanding the role and distribution of GAG within the human meniscus in conjunction with the material properties of the meniscus will aid in the design of tissue engineered meniscal replacements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollagen 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahumans 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 2aAged 2aGlycosaminoglycansxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMaterials Testing 2aMenisci, Tibialxmetabolism 2aMiddle Aged1 aPriest, Ryan1 aBouman, Troy1 aAbraham, Adam C.1 aHaut Donahue, Tammy L.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 May, v. 9, no. 5 p.6624-6629dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.12.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010500170500002200275520152000297592002801817650001301845650002001858650002401878650000901902650001601911650001101927650001201938650001201950650001001962651001301972653001601985653002002001653002702021653002102048653002502069700001602094700001702110700001702127700001502144700001902159700001802178773012402196856008502320852000902405655001202414IND60747207320221121223011.0210820e20210802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074720732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbidullah, Syed10aConsumption of wild food plants among tribal communities of Pak-Afghan border, near Bajaur, Pakistan  aPre-press version  aThis survey was conducted to document the distribution, market potential, medicinal properties, and conservation status of wild food plants (WFPs) which are consumed by local communities of poor socioeconomic background, residing near the Pakistan-Afghan border. Data were collected via semi-structured during 2017–2020 and a total of 288 informers were interviewed in a different locality. In this survey, a total of 95 WFPs species of 39 families and 58 genera were documented. Among these WFPS, 70% of species are ethno-medicinally known. August was the peak month for the accessibility of WFPs (i.e., 17%). The most consumed parts were leaves (37%) and fruit (36%). Plant species of 36 families out of 39 were marketable and reported for the first time, which was further interrelated with taste, ethnobotanical, ethnomedicinal value, FC, and relative frequency of citation (RFC). Rhamnaceae and Rosaceae were the dominant families with the highest number of frequencies of citation (FC) and number of species. The highest FC (77) and RFC (0.267) were calculated for Ziziphus jujuba. This study presents the market potential and distribution of the WFPs for the first time in a war-affected zone. These findings would facilitate local people along the Pakistan-Afghan border and researchers to utilize WFPs to fulfill food requirements. We suggest that further pharmacological and biological assessments of these plants can contribute to economic prosperity, and increase the dietary diversity of this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosaceae 3aZiziphus jujuba 3aconservation status 3adiet 3aethnobotany 3afruits 3amarkets 3asurveys 3ataste 3aPakistan 0aWild plants 0aHuman nutrition 0aPakistan-Afghan border 0aMarket potential 0aEthnomedicinal value1 aRauf, Abdur1 aZaman, Wajid1 aUllah, Fazal1 aAyaz, Asma1 aBatool, Fatima1 aSaqib, Saddam0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2021 Aug. 02, dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245012300174300001600297500001900313520147300332592002801805650001001833650001901843650001101862650002301873651001401896700002301910700002201933700002101955773010901976856005502085852000902140655001202149IND50069157020221120150446.0130911e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006915702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00366.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCassey, Phillip10aSpatial scale and evolutionary history determine the degree of taxonomic homogenization across island bird assemblages  ap. 458-466.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is widely documented that human activities have elevated the extirpation of natural populations as well as the successful introduction to new areas of non‐native species. These dual processes of introduction and extirpation can change the similarity of communities, but the direction and magnitude these changes take are likely to depend on the manner in which introductions and extirpations occur, the spatial scale at which the changes are measured, and the initial similarity of the communities before the human‐induced drivers occurred. Here, we explore patterns of extirpation and introduction and their influence on the similarity of global oceanic island bird assemblages from four different Oceans (Atlantic, Caribbean, Indian, Pacific). We show that different historical patterns of introduction and extirpation have produced varying trends in compositional similarity both between islands within archipelagos and between islands across different archipelagos within the same ocean. Patterns of bird assemblage convergence (i.e. taxonomic homogenization) or divergence (i.e. taxonomic differentiation) among islands depended on the scale of examination, the evolutionary associations among species of the region, and the cultural history of human colonization. These factors are all likely to be leading to a series of multiple interacting processes that are shaping the complex compositional changes observed among global island bird faunas over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3ahomogenization 3ahumans 3aintroduced species 3aCaribbean1 aLockwood, Julie L.1 aBlackburn, Tim M.1 aOlden, Julian D.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2007 July, v. 13, no. 4 p.458-466dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00366.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012200167300001600289520143200305592002801737650001701765650001001782650001801792650002001810650001901830650001401849650003501863650001401898650001401912650001501926650001701941650002501958650001401983650001501997650000902012650001902021650001402040650002002054653004202074653001802116653001702134653001802151653002502169653000902194653000702203653000802210653000802218653000802226653000802234653000802242653000902250653000802259700001902267773010702286856008502393852000902478655001202487IND60629576120221119170441.0200103e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062957612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.01.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Xuelian10aRemoval of seven endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) from municipal wastewater effluents by a freshwater green alga  ap. 534-540.  aThe present endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in wastewater effluents due to incomplete removal during the treatment processes may cause potential ecological and human health risks. This study evaluated the removal and uptake of seven EDCs spiked in two types of wastewater effluent (i.e., ultrafiltration and ozonation) and effluent cultivated with the freshwater green alga Nannochloris sp. In ultrafiltration effluent cultivated with Nannochloris sp. for 7 days, the removal rate of 17β-estradiol (E2), 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), and salicylic acid (SAL) was 60%; but Nannochloris sp. did not promote the removal of other EDCs studied. The algal-mediated removal of E2, EE2, and SAL was attributed to photodegradation and biodegradation. Triclosan (TCS) underwent rapid photodegradation regardless of adding algae in the effluent with 63%–100% removal within 7 days. Triclosan was also found associated with algal cells immediately after adding algae, and thus the primary mechanisms involved were photodegradation and bioremoval (i.e., bioadsorption and bioaccumulation). After algal cultivation, TCS still has a bioaccumulation potential to pose high risks within the food web and the endocrine disrupting properties of the residual estrogens in the effluent are not eliminated. Algal cultivation can be exploited to treat wastewater effluents but the removal efficiencies of EDCs highly depend on chemical types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloris 3aalgae 3aalgae culture 3abioaccumulation 3abiodegradation 3aeffluents 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestradiol 3afood webs 3afreshwater 3ahuman health 3amunicipal wastewater 3aozonation 3aphotolysis 3arisk 3asalicylic acid 3atriclosan 3aultrafiltration 0aEndocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) 0aAlgal removal 0aAlgal uptake 0aBiotechnology 0aWastewater treatment 0aEDCs 0aE2 0aEE2 0aSAL 0aTCS 0aBPA 0aTST 0aHPLC 0aDAD1 aAcharya, Kumud0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Apr., v. 247 p.534-540dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.01.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011600170300001600286520130400302592002801606650000801634650001601642650002401658650001901682650002401701650002201725650001101747650001701758650001501775650001101790650001501801650001201816650001901828651001101847700001801858700001401876773009601890856008601986990002302072852000902095655001202104IND60091975420221118235743.0141103e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009197542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrüger, E.L.10aImpact of urban geometry on outdoor thermal comfort and air quality from field measurements in Curitiba, Brazil  ap. 621-634.  aUrban climate can have severe impacts on people who use outdoor spaces within a city. In its essence, urban climate is directly linked to the configuration of street axes, building heights and their attributes. Thus, the role of urban planners can be crucial for guaranteeing outdoor thermal comfort and air quality in open spaces. This paper presents observed and estimated relations between urban morphology and changes in microclimate and air quality within a city center. Two approaches are presented, showing results of field measurements and urban climate simulations using the ENVI-met software suite. From measured microclimatic data and comfort surveys, carried out in downtown Curitiba, Brazil, the impact of street geometry on ambient temperatures and on daytime pedestrian comfort levels was evaluated, using the sky-view factor (SVF) as indicator of the complexity of the urban geometry. The impact of street orientation relative to prevailing winds and the resulting effects of ventilation (air speed and spatial distribution) on the dispersion of traffic-generated air pollutants were additionally analyzed by means of computer simulations. Results show the impact of urban geometry on human thermal comfort in pedestrian streets and on the outcomes of pollutant dispersion scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3aambient temperature 3aclimate models 3acomputer simulation 3acomputer software 3ahumans 3amicroclimate 3aopen space 3apeople 3apollutants 3asurveys 3awind direction 3aBrazil1 aMinella, F.O.1 aRasia, F.0 tBuilding and environment.g2011 Mar., v. 46, no. 3 p.621-634dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2010.09.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245014700213520183200360592002802192650001802220650002802238650000902266650001102275650001002286650001002296650001402306650002202320650001302342650001402355650002002369650000902389650001102398650001902409653001902428653001702447653001602464700002002480700002002500773011002520856008802630852000902718655001202727IND60731504420221118005243.0210708e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073150442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Robert P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5917-013310aResource sharing and resource sparing, understanding the role of production intensity and farm practices in resource use in shrimp aquaculture  aAquaculture production is an important part of the global food supply and has equaled or surpassed fisheries production as the main source of aquatic foods. Aquaculture is a resource intensive practice that can use large amounts of land, water, energy, and cause pollution and degradation to the local environment. Intensive production practices have been criticized in the past for causing environmental harm; however recent studies have suggested that resource use may decrease with increasing production intensities at the farm level. Here we used a conceptual farm to access the impact of a few key production parameters on land, water, and energy use. A series of calculations were conducted at various production intensities with modifications made to the type of feed used and water exchange rate. The resulting relationships were then modeled with production intensity. Additionally, the effect of various feedstuffs on embodied resource coefficients was examined through varying protein and carbohydrate feedstuffs. Land and water use were found to have an asymptotic relationship with production intensity, with the most important factor in land use being production intensity and the most important factor in water use being the water exchange rate. Energy use was found to be higher with a diet that has fish meal as a protein source and at higher water exchange rates. The most land intensive diets used for shrimp contained high fish meal with rice as carbohydrate feedstuffs (0.550 ha/tonne). The most water intensive diet was no fish meal with corn as a carbohydrate (1863 m³/tonne), and the most energy intensive diet was high fish meal with corn as a carbohydrate (11.73 GJ/tonne). The results herein suggest that intensifying shrimp aquaculture could save resources based on per tonne of production basis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3acoastal zone management 3acorn 3aenergy 3afarms 3afeeds 3afish meal 3afood supply chain 3aland use 3apollution 3aprotein sources 3arice 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 0aSustainability 0aResource use 0aAquaculture1 aBoyd, Claude E.1 aDavis, D.

Since continuous culture of D. gallinae on birds is a biologically and economically costly endeavour, storage techniques for mites are urgently needed. Effects of temperature on adult and nymph survival were first studied to optimize storage conditions. Then, fecundity of D. gallinae was studied after mites were stored at optimal storage conditions. Results showed the survival rates of protonymphs (42.11%), deutonymphs (8.19%) and females (19.78%) at 5°C after 84 days were higher than those at 0, 25 and 30°C. Thereafter the fecundity and the capability of re-establishing colonies of D. gallinae were evaluated after they were stored for 40 and 80 days at 5°C. After storage, the mean number of eggs showed no statistical difference between treated (5°C for 40 or 80 days) and control groups (25°C for 7 days), while the hatching rates of eggs were in all cases above 97%. The dynamic changes of mite populations and egg numbers showed similar trends to the control group after the stored adult or nymph mites were fed on chicks. Dermanyssus gallinae can be successfully stored at 5°C for 80 days with no interference with the fecundity of mites, and the stored mites could re-establish colonies successfully. Adults and nymphs were two main stages with capability for low temperature storage. These results suggest that low temperature storage is a viable option for colony maintenance of D. gallinae under laboratory conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermanyssus gallinae 3aadults 3achicks 3aectoparasites 3aeggs 3afecundity 3ahatching 3ahens 3amites 3anymphs 3aoviposition 3apopulation growth 3astorage temperature 3asurvival rate 0alow temperature 0apoultry red mite 0astorage1 aXu, Xiaolin1 aYu, He1 aHuang, Yu1 aLi, Hao1 aWan, Qiang1 aPan, Baoliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9305-00010 tParasitology.g2020 June, v. 147, no. 7 p.740-746dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200004633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01650naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245012700205300001800332506007600350520033300426592002800759506003700787650002200824650002500846650000900871650001400880650001100894650001300905650002200918650002500940650001300965651001800978700001500996700001301011773012701024856008001151852000901231655001201240IND60117759120221207103052.0141126e20141030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011775912DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00885-142doi7 aPMC41617452pmcid7 a252126162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xuezheng10aDraft Genome Sequence of Pseudoalteromonas sp.

Metal–organic frameworks and gas hydrates are highly appealing materials for the efficient storage of industrially relevant gases, including methane. In this study, the methane storage capacity of the combination of methane hydrates and HKUST-1, a copper-based metal–organic framework, was studied using high pressure differential scanning calorimetry. The results show a synergistic effect, as the addition of HKUST-1 promoted hydrate growth, thus increasing the amount of water converted to hydrate from 5.9 to 87.2% and the amount of methane stored, relative to the amount of water present, from 0.55 to 8.1 mmol/g. The success of HKUST-1 as a promoter stems mainly from its large surface area, high thermal conductivity, and hydrophilicity. These distinctive properties led to a kinetically favorable decrease in hydrate growth induction period by 4.4 h upon the addition of HKUST-1. Powder X-ray diffraction and nitrogen isotherm suggests that the hydrate formation occurs primarily on the surface of HKUST-1 rather than within the pores. Remarkably, the HKUST-1 crystals show no significant changes in terms of structural integrity after many cycles of hydrate formation and dissociation, which results in the material having a long life cycle. These results confirm the beneficial role of HKUST-1 as a promoter for gas hydrate formation to increase methane gas storage capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3adissociation 3agas hydrate 3ahydrophilicity 3amethane 3anitrogen 3asurface area 3asynergism 3athermal conductivity 0agas hydrates 0ametal organic framework 0aHKUST-1 0agas storage1 aMajid, Ahmad AA1 aLucero, Jolie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4606-71181 aCrawford, James M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3614-60551 aCarreon, Moises A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6391-24781 aKoh, Carolyn A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3452-40320 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Nov. 13, v. 12, no. 47 p.53510-53518dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c156753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245016500177300001600342520127200358592002801630650001701658650002101675650000901696650002101705650001601726650001801742650000901760650001301769650001401782650001101796650001801807650001301825651001101838653002101849653002401870653001301894700002301907700003101930700002001961700002201981700002202003700003602025700002702061700006202088773011702150856008102267852000902348655001202357IND60694857220221117180219.0200514e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069485722DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820200004872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWopereis, Débora Borgert10aFree-living amoebae and their relationship to air quality in hospital environments: characterization of Acanthamoeba spp. obtained from air-conditioning systems  ap. 782-790.  aFree-living amoebae (FLA) are widely dispersed in the environment, can cause opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections in humans and other animals. The aim of the present study was characterize FLA obtained from air-conditioners of a public hospital in the city of Florianópolis, SC, Brazil. Fifty-four dust samples were collected of air conditioners, and were inoculated on 1.5% non-nutrient agar, overlaid with layers of Escherichia coli. Subsequently the isolates were axenised in PYG growth medium. The morphological and molecular characterization of the isolates was performed, as well as the tolerance (physiological) assays were used to evaluate the pathogenic potential. The results revealed the presence of FLA in 42 (77.8%) of the collected samples. Of these, 39 (92.9%) axenic isolates of FLA were obtained for morphological and genotypic studies. All the isolates characterized belong to the genus Acanthamoeba. Nineteen (48.7%) isolates belong to the genotype T4, 16 (41.0%) to the T5 genotype and 4 (10.3%) to genotype T11. Seven (18.0%) isolates were considered potentially pathogenic in tolerance assays. These findings require attention, considering the isolation environment and immunocompromised characteristics of many hospitalized patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba 3aEscherichia coli 3aagar 3aair conditioning 3aair quality 3aculture media 3adust 3agenotype 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3apathogenicity 3apatients 3aBrazil 0aair-conditioners 0afree-living amoebae 0ahospital1 aBazzo, Maria Luiza1 ade Macedo, Jefferson Peres1 aCasara, Fabiana1 aGolfeto, Lisléia1 aVenancio, Eduardo1 ade Oliveira, Jaquelline Germano1 aRott, Marilise Brittes1 aCaumo, Karin Silva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6857-564X0 tParasitology.g2020 June, v. 147, no. 7 p.782-790dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820200004873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001400180245008500194300001800279506007600297520147500373592002801848506003701876650001501913650001201928650002801940650001801968650002401986650001102010650002502021650001502046650001602061650001302077653002602090653002002116653001902136653001502155653001802170700001502188700002002203700001802223773013102241856007302372852000902445655001202454IND60530500020221207090641.0160721e20130903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053050002DNAL7 a10.1021/sc40004122doi7 aPMC46660282pmcid7 a266360002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kai10aTwo-Stage Experimental Design for Dose–Response Modeling in Toxicology Studies  ap. 1119-1128.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe efficient design of experiments (i.e., selection of experimental doses and allocation of animals) is important to establishing dose–response relationships in toxicology studies. The proposed procedure for design of experiments is distinct from those in the literature because it is able to adequately accommodate the special features of the dose–response data, which include non-normality, variance heterogeneity, possibly nonlinearity of the dose–response curve, and data scarcity. The design procedure is built in a sequential two-stage paradigm that allows for a learning process. In the first stage, preliminary experiments are performed to gain information regarding the underlying dose–response curve and variance structure. In the second stage, the prior information obtained from the previous stage is utilized to guide the second-stage experiments. An optimization algorithm is developed to search for the design of experiments that will lead to dose–response models of the highest quality. To evaluate model quality (or uncertainty), which is the basis of design optimization, a bootstrapping method is employed; unlike standard statistical methods, bootstrapping is not subject to restrictive assumptions such as normality or large sample sizes. The design procedure in this paper will help to reduce the experimental cost/time in toxicology studies and alleviate the sustainability concerns regarding the tremendous new materials and chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3aanimals 3aartificial intelligence 3adose response 3aexperimental design 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3atoxicology 3auncertainty 3avariance 0aDesign of experiments 0aDose−response 0aBenchmark dose 0aToxicology 0aNanomaterials1 aYang, Feng1 aPorter, Dale W.1 aWu, Nianqiang0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2013 Sept. 03, v. 1, no. 9 p.1119-1128dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc40004123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245012300173520139700296592002801693650003101721650001701752650001701769650001201786650001601798650001401814650002501828650002501853650001201878650001501890650002201905650001301927650002501940650001701965650001001982650001401992653001302006653002002019653001902039653001602058700002902074700006602103773012302169856008302292852000902375655001202384IND60747207720221121223026.0220103e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074720772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1021232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Veronica T.F.10aCharacteristics of sugarcane bagasse fibers after xylan extraction and their high-solid hydrolysis cellulase-catalyzed  aThe enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse to obtain a high efficiency conversion of polysaccharides in monosaccharides is dependent on factors related to the morphology and chemical composition. Therefore, a pre-treatment step is necessary to obtain a less recalcitrant substrate. Here, alkaline sulfite with ethanol (ASE) was employed to pretreat sugarcane bagasse aiming to produce substrates enriched in carbohydrates with greater cellulose accessibility. A xylanase stage was evaluated as a strategy to remove arabinoxylan fraction from pretreated bagasse and to verify the influence of the addition of the enzyme xylanase (5, 50, and 500 IU/g material) on the characteristics of ASE pretreated bagasse from 5 to 15% dry matter. The highest xylan extraction yield of 59% was achieved when working at 15% solids and xylanase dosage of 500 IU/g substrate. The interaction of enzyme and solid loadings was positive to arabinoxylan extraction, however the excessive removal of arabinoxylans caused changes on biomass fiber surface and a decrease in water absorption. The cellulase-catalyzed hydrolysis of ASE bagasse ASE pre-extracted by xylanase was nearly paralleled to the control sample, at 15% solids. This study shows that the enzymatic removal of xylan from pretreated bagasse provides a promising condition for the generation of the value-added product in the biorefinery process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural biotechnology 3aarabinoxylan 3abiocatalysis 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3ahydrolysis 3asugarcane bagasse 3asulfites 3avalue-added products 3awater uptake 3axylan 3axylanases 0aXylanase 0aWater retention 0aGlucan surface 0aBiorefinery1 aQuintero, Leidy Patricia1 aMilagres, Adriane M.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1133-12540 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2021 Sept., v. 36 p.102123-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1021233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04219naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007100151245015800222300001600380520274400396592002803140650001503168650001703183650002303200650001503223650002903238650001303267650001703280650001503297650002203312650000903334650001903343650001903362650001203381651001103393653002203404653002303426653003403449653002003483653001703503700001703520700001603537773010103553856008603654852000903740655001203749IND60634224820221122082255.0190410e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063422482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.02.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiftcioglu, Gulay Cetinkaya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7228-214810aEvaluation of the relationship between ornamental plants – based ecosystem services and human wellbeing: A case study from Lefke Region of North Cyprus  ap. 278-288.  aOrnamental plants and relevant horticulture practices provide essential environmental, economic, social, and aesthetic benefits for human wellbeing. However, the contribution of ornamental plants-based ecosystem services (ESs) to human wellbeing (HWB) has not yet been explored in detail. This study was carried out with the aim of contributing to this knowledge gap. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between ornamental plants based–ESs and HWB in a home garden context in Lefke Region of North Cyprus. The objectives of the study were (i) to identify the ornamental plant species cultivated in the home gardens, (ii) to evaluate the major ornamental plants-based ESs, (iii) to assess the contributions of the relevant ESs to the HWB, and (iv) to examine the interrelationship between the different categories of ESs and HWB. The conceptual framework of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and a social preference valuation approach were adopted to assess the ornamental plants-based ESs, their contributions to the components of HWB, and interrelations amongst them. A number of qualitative (e.g. semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (e.g. a questionnaire) research tools were employed to collect the relevant data. The quantitative data obtained from 170 residents were evaluated using a 0–5 Likert Scale. The field surveys revealed that the composition of ornamental plants in the home gardens consists of 233 plant species. Evaluation of the quantitative data showed that the average relative value of the ornamental plants-based ESs varies between the categories of habitat-based ESs (4,08 points) and regulating ESs (3,00 points). This finding indicates the significant role of ornamental plants for ‘habitat formation’ and ‘wildlife attraction’. The most tagged components were ‘habitats for pets’ and ‘aesthetic quality’. The ornamental plants-based ESs particularly contribute to the two components of HWB: ‘security’ (4,51 points) and ‘contact with nature’ (4,37 points). The relationship between the ESs and HWB was quantified on a 1–5 Likert scale. A high degree of correlation was found between the categories of ‘provisioning services’ and ‘basic material for a good life’ and also between the categories of ‘cultural services’ and ‘development of good social relations’ with a 4,96 points. The lowest degree of correlation was estimated to be between the categories of ‘regulating services’ and ‘development good social relations’ with a 1,01 points. The results of this study may contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between the ornamental plants-based ESs and HWB in Lefke Region and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental indicators 3ahabitats 3ahome gardens 3ainterviews 3aornamental plants 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3asocial welfare 3asurveys 3aCyprus 0aOrnamental plants 0aEcosystem services 0aEcosystem services assessment 0aHuman wellbeing 0aNorth Cyprus1 aEbedi, Sinem1 aAbak, Kazim0 tEcological indicators.g2019 July, v. 102 p.278-288dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.02.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245015900163520118300322592002801505650001301533650002001546650001901566650002301585650001501608650001301623650002501636650002601661653000901687653001001696653003101706653002601737700002601763700005801789700002001847700001701867773012801884856008402012852000902096655001202105IND60731504720221118005310.0211114e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073150472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2021.1052002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Boyan10aEvaluation and comparison of the microbial consortia enriched by gamma-caprolactone and N-Acyl homoserine lactones for effective quorum sensing disruption  aThis study proposed and compared 3 novel quorum quenching consortia (QQC) composed of abundant quorum quenching (QQ) candidates including bacteria and fungi for effective quorum sensing disruption, which were isolated by mixtures of N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) and gamma-caprolactone (GCL). AHLs removal analysis indicated that different QQC could efficiently remove specific AHLs. When utilizing AHLs, the growth rates of QQC isolated by the mixtures of AHLs were significantly higher than those utilizing acetate. It congruously suggested that these QQC had higher substrate specificities towards AHLs, indicating their sustainable QQ performance, as compared to that of the QQC enriched by GCL. There was a clear shift in the microbial community diversity and composition among QQC, which were implicated by the structure differences among GCL and AHLs as substrates in the enrichment culture. The different community assemblages within QQC were the main determinants accounting for the diverse QQ performance. Collectively, these findings offered inspiring implications for sustainable QQ bioaugmentation and biostimulation applications in membrane bioreactors (MBRs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradation 3aenrichment culture 3ahomoserine 3alactones 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrobial communities 0aAHLs 0aFungi 0aQuorum quenching consortia 0aSubstrate specificity1 aNg, Tze Chiang Albert1 aHuang, Shujuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6515-65891 aVarjani, Sunita1 aNg, How Yong0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2021 Apr., v. 159 p.105200-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2021.1052003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03826naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245018000165300001400345520225600359592002802615650002202643650001902665650001702684650001502701650002402716650001102740650001402751650001402765650001102779650003002790650001902820651001902839651001102858651001802869653001302887653002302900653001502923653001902938653001602957653002302973700001702996700001503013700001603028700001803044700001703062700001703079773010603096856008503202852000903287655001203296IND60561430220221120024638.0181002e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056143022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2016.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMi, Beibei12aA high resolution record of rare earth element compositional changes from the mud deposit on the inner shelf of the East China Sea: Implications for paleoenvironmental changes  ap. 35-45.  aA paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the East China Sea (ECS) is presented using rare earth element (REE) analysis of sediments from Core MZ02, which was retrieved from the inner continental shelf's mud area. The analytic results show that the total REEs in the fine sediment vary between 137.76 μg/g and 231.53 μg/g with an average value of 187.69 μg/g. Obvious changes were found during the process of sedimentation. By comparing with the REE compositions from the potential provenances, the ratios of (La/Sm)ucc and (Gd/Yb)ucc revealed that the sediments were mainly derived from river detrital outputs of the Changjiang (Yangtze River), Minjiang and mountainous rivers from western Taiwan Island. The contributions of terrestrial materials from these three main provenances were controlled by sea level change and the Taiwan Warm Current (TWC)-Chinese Coastal Current (CCC) system, which is mainly driven by the East Asian monsoon. The high sedimentation rate during the transgression period between the late Pleistocene and early Holocene (13000–9800 a B.P.) was caused by a well-proportioned mixed provenance from Changjiang, western Taiwanese rivers and Minjiang sediments, due to the lower sea level and the location of the foreshore-nearshore face. Because of the stronger sediment reworking and erosion at the shelf edge during the early Holocene (9800–7300 a B.P.), the strengthening summer East Asian monsoon transported the Minjiang and western Taiwanese river material northeastward, and it became the main sediment source for fine sediments in the shallow sea region of the ECS, while the Changjiang provided a relatively minor amount of detrital sediment to the shelf. The increasing strength of the TWC might have played an important role in sediment dispersal and deposition on the ECS inner shelf during the period 7300–3500 a B.P., thus mountainous river material became the dominant sediment on the shelf of the ECS. Furthermore, the results indicate that the East Asian monsoon and the weakening of the TWC were linked to an abrupt increase in Changjiang-derived terrigenous detritus material since 3500 a B.P.; the source and sink pattern during this period is consistent with the modern sedimentation environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontinental shelf 3amonsoon season 3apaleoecology 3aprovenance 3arare earth elements 3arivers 3asea level 3asediments 3asummer 3atransgressive segregation 3awater currents 3aEast China Sea 3aTaiwan 3aYangtze River 0aSediment 0aRare earth element 0aProvenance 0aEast China Sea 0aMud deposit 0aPaleoenvironmental1 aLiu, Shengfa1 aShi, Xuefa1 aLi, Xiaoyan1 aPan, Hui-Juan1 aChen, Min-Te1 aWang, Xuchen0 tQuaternary international.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 447 p.35-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2016.09.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011200164300001800276520124900294592002801543650005201571650002101623650001601644650001601660650002101676650001701697650001201714653001301726653001301739653001901752653002401771653001901795700001801814700001701832700005201849773012801901856008302029852000902112655001202121IND60708945020221118025619.0211219s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070894502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qizhang10aPotential clinical drugs as covalent inhibitors of the priming proteases of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2  ap. 2200-2208.  aIn less than eight months, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus has resulted in over 20,000,000 confirmed cases and over 700,000 deaths around the world. With the increasing worldwide spreading of this disease, the lack of effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection makes the situation even more dangerous and unpredictable. Although many forces are speeding up to develop prevention and treatment therapeutics, it is unlikely that any de novo drugs will be available in months. Drug repurposing holds the promise to significantly save the time for drug development, since it could use existing clinic drugs to treat new diseases. Based on the “steric-clashes alleviating receptor (SCAR)” strategy developed in our lab recently, we screened the library of clinic and investigational drugs, and identified nine drugs that might be repurposed as covalent inhibitors of the priming proteases (cathepsin B, cathepsin L, and TMPRSS2) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among these hits, five are known covalent inhibitors, and one is an anti-virus drug. Therefore, we hope our work would provide rational and timely help for developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral agents 3acathepsin B 3acathepsin L 3adrug development 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 0aCOVID-19 0aSCARdock 0aDrug repurpose 0aCovalent inhibitors 0aDrug screening1 aWang, Zhiying1 aZheng, Qiang1 aLiu, Sen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5182-72410 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.2200-2208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010400166300001600270520188300286592002802169650001102197650001602208650001802224650001202242650001102254650001102265650001502276650000902291650000902300650002202309650001402331650001502345650002602360650001102386650001602397650001902413650001202432700001902444700002002463700002202483773012002505856008202625852000902707655001202716IND60736002620221117183032.0210729e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073600262DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293210400982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoptsik, G. N.10aRemediation of Technogenic Barren Soils in the Kola Subarctic: Current State and Long-Term Dynamics  ap. 619-630.  aWidespread industrial pollution and its serious ecological and economic consequences make it urgent to develop and refine approaches to remediation of soils as a key ecosystem component. The long-term impact of atmospheric emissions from nonferrous metallurgy enterprises in Monchegorsk (Murmansk region) resulted in the formation of technogenic barrens with contaminated and highly degraded soils near the pollution source. During long-term monitoring, the current status and dynamics of soil properties have been assessed on permanent control plots on barrens and in birch and willow plantations after remediation performed in 2003–2008 by two methods: chemophytostabilization and covering of contaminated soils by an artificially created fertile layer. The research data of 2011, 2015, and 2018 indicate the continuing acidification of soils and their contamination by heavy metals. Despite the reduction in emissions, the concentrations of available heavy metals in the topsoil of barrens and chemophytostabilized plots do not decrease, and the constructed layers accumulate nickel, copper, cobalt, iron, cadmium, lead, and manganese. The nutrient supply of soils is steadily improved only when a fertile layer is applied. According to the results of the multivariate analysis, the soils of barrens and remediation plots are clearly separated in the space of the first two principal components as the soil properties are improved during remediation, and the positions of chemophytostabilization plots reflect the unstable improvements. Recommendations for the development of a strategy and diversification of methods for remediation of technogenic barrens should take into account different levels of soil pollution and degradation in the vicinity of nonferrous metallurgy enterprises and the need to comply with technological requirements and perform supporting measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aCola nitida 3aacidification 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aecosystems 3airon 3alead 3along term effects 3amanganese 3ametallurgy 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3aremediation 3asoil pollution 3atopsoil1 aKoptsik, S.

The gravity core MSK-12 C4 recovered a stratigraphic succession of 4.18 m beneath the seafloor representing the last ∼11.1 ka. Sedimentological analysis, micropaleontological quantitative analysis on benthic foraminiferal assemblages, tephrostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphic analysis of high resolution reflection seismic data recorded in the core site area and AMS ¹⁴C absolute age determinations allowed reconstructing the marine record of the eastern Tyrrhenian margin. Major results of the research work include the progressive sea level rise that controlled the evolution of the western shelf of Calabria during the Holocene and the identification of significant paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic events. First, a short-lived period (10.6–9.4 ka BP) characterized by a significant increase river discharge seems to reflect a major rainfall during the earliest onset of the Holocene climatic warming. Second, the occurrence of a stratigraphic gap from 8.4 to 5 ka BP possibly the result of non-deposition and/or erosion due to bottom currents. The latter should follow from a major reorganization of the deep water currents system that accompanied the climax of the Holocene warming (Holocene climatic optimum). Third, the micropaleontological evidence of the Little Ice Age (LIA) that, on the basis of the chronology adopted in this study, can be constrained between ∼1600 AD and ∼1850 AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRetaria 3aage determination 3acontinental shelf 3ageophysics 3aglobal warming 3agravity 3apaleoecology 3aquantitative analysis 3arain 3asea level 3astream flow 3awater currents 3aItaly 3aTyrrhenian Sea 0aBenthic foraminifera 0aStable isotopes 0aTyrrhenian Sea 0aPaleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstruction 0aIntegrated stratigraphy 0aLittle Ice Age1 aMolisso, F.1 aScopelliti, G.1 aCaruso, A.1 aInsinga, D.D.1 aLubritto, C.1 aPepe, F.1 aSacchi, M.0 tQuaternary international.g2017 May 22, v. 439 p.79-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2016.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007900167300001800246520142800264592002801692650002801720650001801748650002201766650001901788650001401807650001801821650001301839653001801852653001901870653002901889653002201918653000901940653001001949700005901959700005902018773012802077856008302205852000902288655001202297IND60708945220221118025614.0211219s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070894522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaver, Avelino10aDeepScratch: Single-cell based topological metrics of scratch wound assays  ap. 2501-2509.  aChanges in tissue architecture and multicellular organisation contribute to many diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Scratch wound assay is a commonly used tool that assesses cells’ migratory ability based on the area of a wound they cover over a certain time. However, analysis of changes in the organisational patterns formed by migrating cells following genetic or pharmacological perturbations are not well explored in these assays, in part because analysing the resulting imaging data is challenging. Here we present DeepScratch, a neural network that accurately detects the cells in scratch assays based on a heterogeneous set of markers. We demonstrate the utility of DeepScratch by analysing images of more than 232,000 lymphatic endothelial cells. In addition, we propose various topological measures of cell connectivity and local cell density (LCD) to characterise tissue remodelling during wound healing. We show that LCD-based metrics allow classification of CDH5 and CDC42 genetic perturbations that are known to affect cell migration through different biological mechanisms. Such differences cannot be captured when considering only the wound area. Taken together, single-cell detection using DeepScratch allows more detailed investigation of the roles of various genetic components in tissue topology and the biological mechanisms underlying their effects on collective cell migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular diseases 3acell movement 3aendothelial cells 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasms 3atissue repair 3atopology 0awound healing 0aimage analysis 0amigration tissue toplogy 0aendothelial cells 0aCDH5 0aCDC421 aRittscher, Jens1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8528-82981 aSailem, Heba Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6600-12550 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.2501-2509dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04040naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245011800180300001200298520153100310592002801841650002301869650001101892650001301903650002001916650001001936650001201946650001301958650001801971650001701989650001802006650000902024650001802033650001502051650004302066650001402109650001302123650003202136650001002168650004402178650005902222650003002281650003502311650002502346650006302371650004102434650004902475650003102524650003902555650001402594650001102608650003502619650004102654650006602695650000902761650001602770650004002786650005002826650003802876650003002914650004202944650004802986650004403034650002403078700001803102773010503120856004803225852000903273655001203282IND4487055920221123011253.0121003e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448705592DNAL7 a224267982pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-012-9389-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrews, M.10aFerritin Levels and Hepcidin mRNA Expression in Peripheral Mononuclear Cells from Anemic Type 2 Diabetic Patients  ap. 1-4.  aThis study aims to measure iron nutrition parameters and to determine the presence of anemia in obese type 2 diabetic patients and to analyze the mRNA relative abundance of genes related to inflammation, immune system, iron metabolism, and mitochondrial activity. Obese type 2 diabetic (OBDM, n = 30) and healthy subjects (Cn, n = 30) were studied. Biochemical, anthropometric, and iron nutrition parameters were determined. Peripheral mononuclear cells from type 2 diabetic and control group were challenged with high concentrations of iron (Fe) and glucose and total mRNA was isolated. The frequency of anemia among diabetic patients was 4/30. OBDM patients with or without anemia had higher levels of ferritin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein than the Cn group. mRNA relative abundance of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells was elevated in OBDM with anemia, and mRNA expression of interleukin-6 and toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 was increased in OBDM group in basal high Fe and high glucose concentrations. The expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and TLR-4 was increased in OBDM with anemia in all experimental conditions. Hepcidin mRNA expression was increased in OBDM with anemia even in basal Fe concentration, and mitofusin 2 was decreased in all experimental conditions. This study shows that obese type 2 diabetic patients have iron distribution disorders associated to their proinflammatory state, and anemic subjects have a marked elevation of hepcidin mRNA expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aanemia 3aferritin 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahepcidin 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3airon 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition 3apatients 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAdult 2aAnemiaxbloodxcomplicationsxgenetics. 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptidesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxcomplicationsxgenetics. 2aFerritinsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aGTP Phosphohydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGlucosexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aHepcidins 2aHumans 2aInflammationxbloodxgenetics. 2aInterleukin-6xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMitochondriaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNF-kappa Bxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aObesityxbloodxgenetics. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aToll-Like Receptor 4xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 2aWaist Circumference1 aArredondo, M.0 tBiological trace element research.g2012 Oct., v. 149, no. 1 p.1-4dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-012-9389-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006000167300001600227520107500243592002801318650001201346650001401358650001101372650001101383650002701394650001701421650001501438700002001453700001901473700001801492700002001510773012001530856008201650852000901732655001201741IND60736002820221117183039.0210729e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073600282DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293210400622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGendugov, V.

Therefore, it is necessary to assess the factors and intensity of soil aggregates attrition in the water flow that determine the shares of suspended and dragged particles in the sediment load. The earlier simulation of the attrition of river sediments (H. Sternberg) and soil aggregates (G.I. Shvebs) fail to fully reflect the condition of interaction between soils and slope flows. The further attempts to describe the attrition process using empirical dependences have not given any significant improvements. A fundamentally different model of particle attrition based on the laws of mechanics allows us to describe the attrition of soil aggregates broken away by water flow differentiating the total load between the bedload and suspended load. The experimental verification of the model calculations appears to be satisfactory.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedload 3amechanics 3amodels 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asoil erosion 3awater flow1 aLarionov, G.

Based on a long-term climatic dataset (during 1958–2015) from weather stations in the North China Plain (NCP), the influencing mechanism of various climatic factors on drought risk of winter wheat was quantified by using sensitivity analysis, Mann-Kendall trend test and slope estimation. The results indicated that climatic factors have changed considerably over the past six decades in the growth season of winter wheat. As a result, winter wheat suffered from severe droughts (with 350 mm of water deficit during its growth season), particularly at the jointing–heading and heading–mature stages, which were critical to crop yield formation. There were large spatial and temporal variations in drought risk and climatic change factors at different growth stages of winter wheat. Despite precipitation playing a vital role in determining the spatiotemporal patterns of drought risk, high temperature and low humidity along with other climatic factors at key growth stages of winter wheat aggravated drought risk. Particularly, temperature at nearly 90% weather stations showed a notablely upward trend, which exacerbated water deficit and drought risk of winter wheat. Given the complexity and high uncertainty of climate change, these findings provide important information for adapting crop production to future climate change and accompanied droughts while ensuring food security and agricultural sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3adrought 3afood security 3ahumidity 3arisk 3asustainable agriculture 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0adrought risk 0aspatiotemporal variations1 aCHU, Qing-quan1 aJIANG, Yu-lin1 aChen, Fu,1 aLEI, Yong-deng0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2021 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.2601-2612dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

To investigate the effect of ionic strength (IS) and heterogeneity on the transport and remobilization of graphene oxide (GO)-facilitated uranium (U(VI)) in saturated porous media, column experiments were performed by the injection of U(VI) alone and U(VI)+GO mixtures into homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media under low and high ionic strength (1 and 50 mM) conditions, and then the columns were successively flushed with background solution and DI water. Results showed that when U(VI) only was introduced into the columns, IS had little effect on the migration of U(VI) alone in both media and the presence of preferential flow in heterogeneous media slightly enhanced the mobility of U(VI). As U(VI)+GO mixtures were injected into the columns, GO showed strong mobility at low IS and high released peak at high IS. The appearance of GO significantly enhanced U(VI) transport in both media. Under low IS condition, the mobility of U(VI) was significantly enhanced at the injection phase, and the medium heterogeneity further promoted the amount of GO-sorbed U(VI) transport. At high IS, less GO-sorbed U(VI) was observed during injection phase, and a large amount of retained GO-sorbed U(VI) were released with GO remobilization during water flushing phase, and the release showed the longer-tailing phenomenon and the release amount was more pronounced in heterogeneous media. The findings in this study showed that the coupled effect of solution chemistry and media heterogeneity played important roles on GO-facilitated U(VI) transport and release in soil and groundwater system.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3agroundwater 3aionic strength 3aporous media 3apreferential flow 3asoil 3auranium 0aU(VI) 0aTransport 0aGraphene oxide 0aHeterogeneity 0aIonic strength1 aChen, Chong1 aCheng, Tao1 aShang, Jianying0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Apr., v. 247 p.668-677dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245012300207300001600330520122700346592002801573650001501601650002401616650001701640650001301657650001101670651001101681651001101692651002101703653001001724653001501734653002201749653001801771653002901789700002901818700001801847700001901865700001801884773010701902856008502009852000902094655001202103IND60561430820221120032959.0180904e20170512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056143082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2016.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaes, Hannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2424-697510aShrub and pore type classification: Petrography of travertine shrubs from the Ballık-Belevi area (Denizli, SW Turkey)  ap. 147-163.  aPetrographical and petrophysical properties of the Turkish Ballık-Belevi travertine shrubs demonstrate the necessity of reservoir oriented classifications for shrub-related lithotypes and associated pore types. The presented shrub-related lithotype classification incorporates morphology, size and fabric, which are linked to specific pore-types and sizes. The travertines show highly complex pore networks, as observed from Computed Tomography reconstructions, making them of interest for the development and optimization of pore characterization methodologies and techniques, following an upscaling approach. Porosity (3–15%) and permeability (0–505 mD) strongly vary for the Ballık-Belevi travertines. The highest porosities and permeabilities are measured for horizontal samples dominated by slightly dissolution enlarged intershrub and interdigit growth framework porosity, mostly found for dendritic shrubs. The presented shrub and pore-type classification can be applied to shrubs worldwide. Studying outcrop analogues of continental carbonates helps to better understand heterogeneities, lateral variability and properties of Pre-Salt Cretaceous continental carbonate reservoirs, offshore Brazil and Angola.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3acomputed tomography 3apermeability 3aporosity 3ashrubs 3aAngola 3aBrazil 3aTurkey (country) 0aShrub 0aTravertine 0aPre-salt analogue 0aMicrobialites 0aPore-type classification1 aMarques Erthal, Marcelle1 aSoete, Jeroen1 aÖzkul, Mehmet1 aSwennen, Rudy0 tQuaternary international.g2017 May 12, v. 437 p.147-163dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2016.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012500170500001400295520169500309592002802004650002202032650002102054650002602075650001002101650001202111650001202123650001402135650001102149650001002160650001202170650001602182650001002198650002102208650001302229650000902242650001402251653001302265653001602278653000802294653000802302653000802310653000802318653000802326653002102334653002002355653001802375700002402393700002202417700006402439773010702503856008502610852000902695655001202704IND60708945620221118025630.0210212e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070894562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hermed.2020.1003992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Heba A.10aSynergistic antifungal activity of mixtures of clove, cumin and caraway essential oils and their major active components  aNAL-light  aIncreasing resistance of microbes to available antifungals has necessitated a search for alternative natural products with antifungal properties. Combinations of essential oils (EOs) with known antifungal activities may increase antimicrobial activity, reduce side effects, and overcome resistance. This study determined the antifungal activity of basil, marjoram, clove, cumin and caraway EOs, both individually and in combination. The EOs and the major constituents of clove, cumin and caraway were screened against Candida albicans (C. albicans), and Aspergillus niger (A. niger) using a broth dilution method. Fluconazole was used as a positive control. The MICs of the mixtures of EOs were better than those of the single oils (except in the case of clove oil) especially against C. albicans (1 mg/ml) suggesting a synergistic effect against both C. albicans and A. niger (2 mg/ml) when increasing the concentration of one oil over the other two. Single active components (eugenol, carvone and cuminaldehyde) have better activity than single total oils against both organisms and showed synergistic effects when combined. In summary, mixtures of EOs or their active components had similar/better antifungal activities compared to the single oils or ingredients suggesting a synergistic effect against both C. albicans and A. niger. Clove oil was the best against both organisms while eugenol was the best against A. niger. In conclusion, the synergistic effect of the combinations of the EOs and their active components against C. albicans and A. niger could lead to decreased side effects and consequently they can be used to treat various fungal infections caused by these organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aCandida albicans 3aantifungal properties 3abasil 3acaraway 3acarvone 3aclove oil 3acloves 3acumin 3aeugenol 3afluconazole 3afungi 3aherbal medicines 3amarjoram 3aoils 3asynergism 0aA. niger 0aC. albicans 0aCFU 0aEOs 0aMIC 0aSDA 0aSDB 0aAspergillusniger 0aCandidaalbicans 0aCuminaldehyde1 aGenaidy, Mahmoud M.1 aKamel, Mohamed S.1 aAbdelwahab, Sayed F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9636-74850 tJournal of herbal medicine.g2020 Dec., v. 24 p.100399-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:21606x2210-80337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hermed.2020.1003993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007800165300001800243520104800261592002801309596003501337596006501372650001801437650002501455650002201480650001101502650002701513650000901540650002601549650001601575700001901591700002101610700002401631700002101655773014801676856008301824852000901907655001201916IND60694857820221120045001.0220411e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069485782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02622-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVítek, Petr10aRaman imaging of microbial colonization in rock—some analytical aspects  ap. 3717-3726.  aRaman imaging allows one to obtain spatially resolved chemical information in a nondestructive manner. Herein, we present analytical aspects of effective in situ and in vivo Raman imaging of algae and cyanobacteria from within their native rock habitats. Specifically, gypsum and halite inhabited by endolithic communities from the hyperarid Atacama Desert were analyzed. Raman imaging of these phototrophic colonization reveals a pigment composition within the aggregates that helps in understanding some of their adaptation strategies to survive in this harsh polyextreme environment. The study is focused on methodical aspects of Raman imaging acquisition and subsequent data processing. Point imaging is compared with line imaging in terms of their image quality, spatial resolution, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, time requirements, and risk of laser-induced sample alteration. The roles of excitation wavelength, exposure time, and step size of the imaging grid on successful Raman imaging results are also discussed.

In the past two seasons, 48 sites were mapped and characterized by the presence of Levallois technology and, therefore, attributed to the Middle Paleolithic of Arabia. Preferential Levallois reduction using different methods of dorsal core preparation have been found at these sites. The technological variability includes Nubian Levallois methods, preferential Levallois with centripetal preparation, as well as recurrent centripetal reduction methods. In Arabia, sites with Nubian Levallois reduction are known from southern Oman, eastern Yemen, and central Saudi Arabia, while in Africa this reduction method has been identified across much of the northeastern continent. Preferential Levallois with centripetal preparation and recurrent centripetal Levallois methods have been found across Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. Outside of Arabia, these methods have been found in many regions across the Old World. In this paper, we present the results from technological analyses on the Middle Paleolithic assemblages from the newly discovered Al-Jawf sites. The technological data are used to place these sites into a wider regional framework, assessing whether connections with known lithic industries from across the Near East and northeastern Africa can be surmised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aindustry 3asurveys 3aAfrica 3aMiddle East 3aOman 3aSaudi Arabia 3aUnited Arab Emirates 3aYemen 0aMiddle Paleolithic 0aLithic industries 0aNubian Complex 0aLevallois technology 0aSaudi Arabia1 aCrassard, Rémy,1 aCharloux, Guillaume1 aLoreto, Romolo0 tQuaternary international.g2017 Apr. 12, v. 435 p.77-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245015900160300001800319520118300337592002801520650002501548650001801573650002001591650001701611650002401628650001201652650002201664650001801686650002001704650001101724650001501735700001901750700002501769700002601794700002201820773014801842856008301990852000902073655001202082IND60694857920221117180216.0220411e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069485792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02609-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Nan12aA thiol-ene microfluidic device enabling continuous enzymatic digestion and electrophoretic separation as front-end to mass spectrometric peptide analysis  ap. 3559-3571.  aOne of the most attractive aspects of microfluidic chips is their capability of integrating several functional units into one single platform. In particular, enzymatic digestion and chemical separation are important steps in processing samples for many biochemical assays. This study presents the development and application of a free-flow electrophoresis microfluidic chip, and its upstream combination with an enzyme microreactor with immobilized pepsin in the same miniaturized platform. The whole microfluidic chip was fabricated by making use of thiol-ene click chemistry. As a proof of concept, different fluorescent dyes and labeled amino acids were continuously separated in the 2D electrophoretic channel. The protease pepsin was immobilized using a covalent linkage with ascorbic acid onto a high-surface monolithic support, also made of thiol-ene. To show the potential of the microfluidic chip for continuous sample preparation and analysis, an oligopeptide was enzymatically digested, and the resulting fragments were separated and collected in a single step (prior to mass spectrometric detection), without the need of further time-consuming liquid handling steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aascorbic acid 3aelectrophoresis 3afluorescence 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3aoligopeptides 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3apepsin 3aseparation1 aSticker, Drago1 aKretschmann, Andreas1 aPetersen, Nickolaj J.1 aKutter, Jörg P.,0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2020 June, v. 412, no. 15 p.3559-3571dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-02609-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245012600166300001600292520159400308592002801902650001401930650001601944650001701960650002401977650001302001650001702014650001402031650002502045650001302070650002002083650001402103650001202117650002502129650002102154650001902175650001402194650001002208650002402218650001402242651001102256700002402267700002402291700003302315773009802348856007302446852000902519655001202528IND60403271820221119121743.0150831e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040327182DNAL7 a10.1111/aec.122412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza‐Silva, Herbert10aConsequences of habitat disturbance on seed fate of a Brazilian tropical dry forest tree Cavanillesia arborea (Malvaceae)  ap. 726-732.  aWe compared seed fate (survival, mortality by rodent predators, desiccation and other causes) of the tree Cavanillesia arborea (Malvaceae) in preserved old‐growth tropical dry forests and in nearby abandoned pasturelands in Brazil. For this purpose, we performed an experiment where 15 seeds were placed in the surroundings of 15 parental individuals in each habitat. These 450 seeds were monitored over four months. At the end of the experiment, seed predation by rodents was higher in forest (56.5%) than in pasture (8.9%) areas, but seed desiccation showed the opposite pattern (8.9% vs. 80.4%). Mortality by desiccation was also faster in pasture than in forest areas, probably reducing their attractiveness to predators in these areas. None of the seeds placed in the pasture survived, whereas 26.2% of seeds became seedlings in forest areas. The absence of seedling recruitment of Cavanillesia arborea in pastures is likely a consequence of their incapacity to tolerate the harsh abiotic conditions in this habitat. Thus, forest conversion imposes a strong limitation to the long‐term population viability of this species. However, restoration and natural regeneration of abandoned pastures can recreate the forest structure and microclimatic conditions favourable to seed germination and seedling establishment. Remnant individuals of Cavanillesia arborea in agricultural landscapes may have a negligible contribution to current recruitment, but they can attract potential dispersers of pioneer species, with positive feedbacks to future recruitment during secondary succession.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalvaceae 3adry forests 3aforest trees 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3amicroclimate 3amortality 3anatural regeneration 3apastures 3apioneer species 3apredators 3arodents 3asecondary succession 3aseed germination 3aseed predation 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aspecies recruitment 3aviability 3aBrazil1 aMachado, Larissa F.1 aSilva, Jhonathan O.1 aEspírito‐Santo, Mário M.0 tAustral ecology.g2015 Sept., v. 40, no. 6 p.726-732dBlackwell Science Asiax1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.122413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015100169300001600320520055600336592002800892596006500920596006500985596006501050650002001115650003801135650001101173650001001184650003001194650003001224650001001254700002101264700002101285700002201306700005901328773012901387856008301516852000901599655001201608IND60707719620221118180817.0210707e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070771962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-020-00930-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshioka, Rikuto10aPCR detection of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, the causal agent of bacterial black node in barley and wheat, using newly designed primer sets  ap. 387-392.  aWe designed two novel primer sets based on the sequence of the hrpZ gene to detect Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, the causal agent of bacterial black node in barley and wheat.

Trials were conducted from 1999 to 2001 to determine if weed suppression in narrow row spacings, in conjunction with new residual herbicides supplemented with nonresidual herbicides, improved weed control and reduced herbicide use. Within each row spacing were three levels of weed management using the residual herbicides imazapic {(±)-2-[4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-5-oxo-1-imidazol-2-yl]-5-methyl-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid}, diclosulam [-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-ethoxy-7-fluoro[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine-2-sulfonamide], sulfentrazone {-[2,4-dichloro-5-[4-(difluoromethyl)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-1-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]phenyl]methanesulfonamide}, and flumioxazin {2-[7-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-4-(2-propynyl)-2-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1-iso-indole-1,3(2)-dione}. Minimal weed management was ethalfluralin [-ethyl-N-(2-methyl-2-propenyl)-2,6-dinitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)ben-zenamine] alone for annual grass control. Moderate weed management was ethalfluralin, a residual herbicide, and 2,4-DB [4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butanoic acid]. Intense weed management was the moderate system for each residual herbicide, plus paraquat (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium ion), bentazon [3-(1-methylethyl)-(1)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3)-one 2,2-dioxide], and acifluorfen {5-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-2-nitrobenzoic acid}. Peanut seeded in narrow rows had quicker canopy closure than peanut seeded in wide rows. Densities of individual weeds species were not affected, although total weed densities were lower in narrow rows than wide rows. Narrow row spacings with residual herbicides did not reduce herbicide use compared with wide row spacings. Yields were 12% greater in narrow rows than wide rows. While narrow row spacings did not affect individual weed species and reduce herbicide use, narrow row spacings supplement herbicides by reducing the total number of weed escapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflumioxazin 3aweed control 3apeanuts 3achemical control 3apesticide application 3acultural control 3aimazapic 3arow spacing 3asulfentrazone 3adiclosulam 3acrop yield 3aweeds 3aArachis hypogaea 3aGeorgia 0aherbicides1 aProstko, Eric P.1 aMullinix, Benjamin G.0 tAgronomy journal.g2005 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.85-88dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x1435-06457nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/37723Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2005.00853Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02449naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245016700162500001900329520133400348592002801682650002001710650001301730650000901743650001701752650002501769650001001794650001201804650001301816700002901829700001901858700001801877773012001895856007502015852000902090655001202099IND60735060420221122004535.0210423e20210420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073506042DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110411832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlimiuk, Paweł 10aEvaluation of the Proliferative Activity of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) in Dogs with Respect to Patient Eligibility for Anthracycline-Based Chemotherapy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDifferent types of canine lymphoma respond differently to chemotherapy and have different prognoses. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma in dogs. Topoisomerase II alpha (TOPIIα) protein has been shown to be a proliferation marker associated with prognostic significance. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between TOPIIα expression, mitotic count (MC), and Ki67 antigen index in DLBCL in dogs, taking into account the applicability of these parameters to select the chemotherapy protocol with emphasis on the use of anthracycline drugs. Samples of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lymph nodes from 34 dogs with DLBCL were immunohistochemically labelled with anti-TOPIIα and Ki67. The number of positive cells and the intensity of the reaction were taken into account in order to assess TOPIIα expression. MC was estimated in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides in the area of 2.37 mm². Positive association between TOPIIα and MC, but no association between TOPIIα and Ki67 was found. It can be concluded that the immunohistochemical determination of TOPIIα as a molecular target for drugs from the anthracycline group may be used in association with MC to establish a diagnostic-clinical protocol for selecting dogs with DLBCL for treatment with anthracycline drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-cell lymphoma 3aantigens 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alymph 3amitosis 3apatients1 aŁopuszyński, Wojciech 1 aBulak, Kamila 1 aBrzana, Adam 0 tAnimals.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110411833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009700162520101800259592002801277650001401305650002401319650002301343650002701366650001201393650002101405650001201426650002001438700002201458773010101480856008201581852000901663655001201672IND60679586820221117165014.0200128e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067958682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.1309132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Huan10aSolid state aldol reactions of solvated and unsolvated lithium pinacolone enolate aggregates  aWe reported the first systematic study of the solid-state aldol reactions of solvated and unsolvated lithium pinacolone enolate with a variety of solid aromatic aldehydes utilizing a mortar and pestle condition in comparison with the simple ball milling condition or tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution condition.

Under the condition of mortar and pestle, the reactions with unsolvated lithium pinacolone enolate showed the mixture of aldol condensation product and aldol addition product at room temperature.

In this paper, we propose a novel non-local means (NL-means) based iterative-correction projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm, named as NLMIC-POCS, for effective and robust sparse angular CT reconstruction. The motivation for using NLMIC-POCS is that NL-means filtered image can produce an acceptable priori solution for sequential POCS iterative reconstruction. The NLMIC-POCS algorithm has been tested on simulated and real phantom data. The experimental results show that the presented NLMIC-POCS algorithm can significantly improve the image quality of the sparse angular CT reconstruction in suppressing streak artifacts and preserving the edges of the image.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputed tomography 3amotivation1 aMa, Jianhua1 aLiu, Nan1 aZhang, Hua1 aBian, Zhaoying1 aFeng, Yanqiu1 aFeng, Qianjin1 aChen, Wufan0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2011 Apr., v. 41, no. 4 p.195-205dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2011.01.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009500171300001800266500001900284520079400303536050701097592002801604596002501632596007201657596002401729650001801753650001601771650001001787650001201797650002201809650000701831650001701838653002201855653002401877653001701901653001901918653002101937700001701958700002001975773012801995856008502123852000902208655001202217IND60702345820221123024831.0200717e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070234582DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2020.17468412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Seong-Min10aDevelopment of caramel colour with improved colour stability and reduced 4-methylimidazole  ap. 1110-1117.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigated the effect of chemical substances, such as Mg²⁺ (as magnesium sulphate), Zn²⁺ (as zinc sulphate), Fe²⁺ (as iron sulphate), ascorbic acid, and citric acid, on the formation of 4-methylimidazole (4-MI) and colour stability of caramel colour.

Among the chemical substances added to reduce 4-MI in the caramel colour, Mg²⁺ (0.1 molar ratio) and ascorbic acid improved the colour stability more than the others.  aThis research was supported by the Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Research Centre Support Program, and Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [IPET 118012031SB010] through the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; and the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (grant number NRF-2018R1A2B6002634), Republic of Korea.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2018R1A2B6002634  aAgricultureaFood and Rural Affairs Research Centre Support Program  aIPET 118012031SB010 3aascorbic acid 3acitric acid 3acolor 3aethanol 3amagnesium sulfate 3apH 3azinc sulfate 0a4-Methylimidazole 0achemical substances 0aorganic acid 0acaramel colour 0acolour stability1 aPark, Minsun1 aLee, Kwang-Geun0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2020 July 02, v. 37, no. 7 p.1110-1117dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2020.17468413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
