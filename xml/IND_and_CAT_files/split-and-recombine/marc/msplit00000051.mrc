However, understanding the responses of taxonomic and functional diversity to specific conversion from natural forest to agriculture and urban land-use remains limited, especially in subtropical streams where biomonitoring programs and using functional traits are still under development. Here, we conducted research in a subtropical stream network to examine the responses of macroinvertebrate taxonomic and functional diversity to different types of land-use in central China. Our results showed that medium body size, univoltine, gill respiration, and slow seasonal development were much higher in natural forest sites, while certain traits related to strong resilience and resistance (e.g., small body size, fast seasonal development, bi-or multivoltine, abundant occurrence in drift, sprawler) dominated in high-intensity agriculture and urbanization sites. We further found that land-use compromised water quality (e.g., increases in total phosphate, conductivity and water temperature) and habitat conditions (e.g., high proportion of sand and silt, gravel, and channel width) accounted for the changes in trait composition based on a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analysis. Moreover, natural forest sites presented relatively high values of functional richness than other land-use, demonstrating the importance of natural forest maintenance to promote high levels of functional diversity. However, taxonomic diversity indexes showed higher sensitivity to distinguish different types of land-use compared to functional diversity measures. Even so, given that certain trait categories showed significant relationships with specific local environmental stressors, trait-based approaches can provide reliable evidence to diagnose the cause of impairment and complement the results of the taxonomic-based approaches. Our findings support the idea that taxonomic and functional approaches should be integrated in river restoration and land-use management.  aPublisher supplied data  aNO. 31720103905, No. 41571495cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2015FY110400-4cthe National Science and Technology Basic Research Program  a2019HB2096001006cBiodiversity Survey, Monitoring and Assessment  aGT-611cP&D Aneel-Cemig 3abody size 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3agravel 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3amultivoltine habit 3aphosphates 3apollution 3aresearch 3arivers 3asand 3aseasonal development 3asilt 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3aunivoltine habit 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aLi, Zhengfei1 aCastro, Diego M.

Currently, there are three distinct MAdV types known with rather different tropism and pathology. Here we report and annotate the DNA sequence of the full genome of MAdV-2. It was found to consist of 35,203bp thus being considerably larger than the genomes of the other two MAdV types. The increased size of the MAdV-2 genome is generally due to larger genes and ORFs, although some differences in the number of ORFs were observed for the early regions E1, E3 and E4. The homologue of the 19K gene of E1B from MAdV-2 codes for 330 amino acids (aa) and is almost twice as large as from other mastadenoviruses. Accordingly, only the N-terminal half (155aa) has homology to the 19K protein. A homologue of the gene of the 12.5K protein was identified in the E3 region of MAdV-2, but not in MAdV-1 or MAdV-3. The other gene of yet unknown function in the E3 region of MAdV-2 seems to be unique. The E4 region of MAdV-2 contains three ORFs. One has similarity to the 34K gene of other AdVs. Two unique ORFs in the E4 region of MAdV-2 have no homology to any of the five and six ORFs in the E4 region of MAdV-1 or MAdV-3, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the three murine AdVs have a close common ancestor. They likely formed the first branching of the lineage of mastadenoviruses, and seem to be the most ancient representatives of this genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aphylogeny 3amice 3aamino acids 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aMurine mastadenovirus B 0aMurine adenovirus B1 aVidovszky, Márton Z.1 aRuminska, Justyna1 aRamelli, Sandra1 aDecurtins, Willy1 aGreber, Urs F.1 aHarrach, Balázs0 tVirus research.g2011 Sept., v. 160, no. 1-2 p.128-135dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245019000155300001600345500001400361520140700375592002801782650002701810650001101837650001201848650001701860650001401877653001201891653001501903653002801918653002501946700002001971700001801991700002202009773010902031856007302140852000902213655001202222IND60726962820221120182055.0210209e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072696282DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/peu0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Cort, W.10aAdministration of a Salmonella Enteritidis ΔhilAssrAfliG strain by coarse spray to newly hatched broilers reduces colonization and shedding of a Salmonella Enteritidis challenge strain  ap. 131-135.  aNAL-light  aConsumption of contaminated poultry meat is still an important cause of Salmonella infections in humans. Colonization inhibition (CI) occurs when a live Salmonella strain is administered to chickens and subsequently protects against challenge with another Salmonella strain belonging to the same serotype. A Salmonella Enteritidis hilAssrAfliG deletion mutant has previously been proven to reduce colonization and shedding of a wild-type Salmonella Enteritidis strain in newly hatched broilers after experimental infection. In this study, we compared two administration routes for this strain. Administering the Salmonella Enteritidis ΔhilAssrAfliG strain through drinking water on the first day of life resulted in decreased fecal shedding and cecal colonization of a wild-type Salmonella Enteritidis challenge strain administered 24 h later using a seeder-bird model. When administering the CI strain by coarse spray on newly hatched broiler chicks, an even more pronounced reduction of cecal colonization was observed, and fecal shedding of the Salmonella Enteritidis challenge strain ceased during the course of the experiment. These data suggest that administering a Salmonella Enteritidis ΔhilAssrAfliG strain to newly hatched chicks using a coarse spray is a useful and effective method that reduces colonization and shedding of a wild-type Salmonella Enteritidis strain after early challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3amodels 3amutants 3apoultry meat 3aserotypes 0abroiler 0aSalmonella 0acolonization inhibition 0aadministration route1 aHaesebrouck, F.1 aDucatelle, R.1 avan Immerseel, F.0 tPoultry science.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 94, no. 1 p.131-135dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/peu0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01646naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010700172300001800279520036100297592002800658650001700686650001100703650004400714650001400758700003300772700002000805700002300825700002600848700001700874700001800891700001700909700001900926700001900945700001900964700002100983773011801004856008201122990002301204852000901227655001201236IND60091062120221121151559.0141103e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009106212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.04.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Angeline C.-H.10aThieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives as PDK1 inhibitors discovered by fragment-based screening  ap. 4023-4027.  aLigand efficient fragments binding to PDK1 were identified by an NMR fragment-based screening approach.

Islands are natural and socioeconomic systems wherein seasonal tourism and agriculture are the major economic activities, while environmental and health security are the top priorities. The majority of the individual housing facilities on islands are not connected to a public sewage system, thereby rendering the treatment and disposal of septage difficult. A significant degree of seasonal variability is observed in the quantities and characteristics of the septage produced, which hinders the sustainability of potential solutions. Consequently, there is a need to elucidate the benchmarks of a sustainable solution and quantify the CE implementation. This problem was solved using a simple two-step process. First, a concept for septage management was selected based on a waste hierarchy approach. Second, a sustainability policy was quantified by evaluating a composite indicator that accounts for economic, environmental, and social issues. The application of the sustainability index enables the assessment of the cumulative impact of the proposed solution on the environment of the island. The applied methodology has proven to be useful in the creation of a sustainable management concept that minimises negative impacts and protects resources. The proposed septate mining concept can strengthen the self-sustainability of islands and alleviate the threat to their business and environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3aenvironmental management 3aissues and policy 3aseasonal variation 3asewage systems 3atourism 0aSeptage mining 0aSeptage hierarchy 0aSustainable index 0aKarst islands 0aCircular economy 0aSustainability0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 May 01, v. 285 p.112128-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1121283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007800169300001800247520101900265592002801284650001001312650002101322650001601343650001801359650001201377650000901389650001701398650001401415700002701429700001901456700001901475700001701494700002301511773009601534856008401630990002301714852000901737655001201746IND60094782320221121084942.0141104e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009478232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2012.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiwa, Shinsuke10aKIF19A Is a Microtubule-Depolymerizing Kinesin for Ciliary Length Control  ap. 1167-1175.  aCilia control homeostasis of the mammalian body by generating fluid flow. It has long been assumed that ciliary length-control mechanisms are essential for proper flow generation, because fluid flow generation is a function of ciliary length. However, the molecular mechanisms of ciliary length control in mammals remain elusive. Here, we suggest that KIF19A, a member of the kinesin superfamily, regulates ciliary length by depolymerizing microtubules at the tips of cilia. Kif19a⁻/⁻ mice displayed hydrocephalus and female infertility phenotypes due to abnormally elongated cilia that cannot generate proper fluid flow. KIF19A localized to cilia tips, and recombinant KIF19A controlled the length of microtubules polymerized from axonemes in vitro. KIF19A had ATP-dependent microtubule-depolymerizing activity mainly at the plus end of microtubules. Our results indicated a molecular mechanism of ciliary length regulation in mammals, which plays an important role in the maintenance of the mammalian body.  aPublisher supplied data 3acilia 3afemale fertility 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrocephalus 3akinesin 3amice 3amicrotubules 3aphenotype1 aNakajima, K.q(Kazuo),1 aMiki, Harukata1 aMinato, Yusuke1 aWang, Doudou1 aHirokawa, Nobutaka0 tDevelopmental cell.g2012 Dec. 11, v. 23, no. 6 p.1167-1175dElsevier Inc.x1534-58077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2012.10.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003400139245009300173500002000266520202700286592002802313596004802341650001102389650001802400650001702418650002402435650001802459650001102477650001502488650001502503650001902518650001502537650001702552650001002569650001502579650001602594650001702610650000902627650002402636651001202660651001102672700001702683773010702700856007402807852000902881655001202890IND60761457320221121041238.0211229e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076145732DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.38612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía‐Rodríguez, Alberto10aConstant gardeners: Endozoochory promotes repeated seedling recruitment in clonal plants  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aParadoxically, seedlings of clonal plants are rarely observed in nature, despite many of these species producing large amounts of seeds every fruiting season. Studies about clonal plants’ recruitment strategies are usually based on experiments carried out under controlled conditions (e.g., laboratory) and rarely consider frugivores’ effects. We tested the role of endozoochory in the seedling recruitment in natural conditions of the bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, a widely distributed clonal species and a key resource in temperate and boreal regions of Eurasia, which has been suggested to recruit at occasional windows of opportunity (unpredictable conditions in which seedling recruitment may occur within conspecific adult stands). We marked brown bear Ursus arctos, mesocarnivore (red foxes Vulpes vulpes and martens Martes spp.) and passerine feces containing bilberry seeds in the Tatra Mountains (Carpathian Mountains, Southern Poland) and followed the fate of the embedded seeds during two years. We detected bilberry germination associated with 100%, 87.5%, and 50% of brown bear, mesocarnivore, and passerine feces, and also in 43.6%, 41.2%, and 23.1% of the control plots located 5, 10, and 30 m away from the bear scats, respectively. In bear scats, investigated in more detail, 15.7% of the seedlings survived at least one year. The largest numbers of seedlings were associated with bear scats (154.4 ± 237.3 seedlings/m²), especially to those defecated upon the soil disturbances these animals create next to their resting sites. Our results demonstrate that endozoochory facilitates repeated bilberry seedling recruitment in nature, suggesting that studies on the reproductive strategies of clonal plants must consider the role of frugivores. Some frugivores’ behaviors, such as the defecation by bears in the vicinity of their resting sites, may in fact be crucial for the reproduction of clonal plants and for the adaptation of these species to the current changing climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/22/Z/NZ8/00121cNarodowe Centrum Nauki 3aMartes 3aPasseriformes 3aUrsus arctos 3aVaccinium myrtillus 3aVulpes vulpes 3aadults 3abilberries 3acarnivores 3aconspecificity 3adefecation 3aendozoochory 3afeces 3afrugivores 3agermination 3areproduction 3asoil 3aspecies recruitment 3aEurasia 3aPoland1 aSelva, Nuria0 tEcosphere.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.e03861-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.38613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012700164300001800291520131100309592002801620650001401648650001601662650002501678650001201703650001601715650002001731650001701751650001601768650001501784651001501799653001601814653001301830653002201843700001901865700001801884700002101902773009901923856008502022852000902107655001202116IND60688428120221117222234.0200607e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068842812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, Rui10aComplementary relationship between small-hydropower and increasing penetration of solar photovoltaics: Evidence from CAISO  ap. 1139-1146.  aTo achieve the 100% green electricity goal, we need to understand the relationship between resources in the market and identify the flexible clean resources (i.e., hydropower) to integrate power from wind and photovoltaic (PV). This paper reveals a complementary relationship between small hydropower plants and solar PVs in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) based on the system-wide hourly generation data from 2013 to 2017. When the solar PV increases its portion in the generation mix by 1%, small hydro will increase its portion by 0.01–0.06%. Such response is obvious in the net demand peak hours, both morning and evening. The low operation cost, flexibility, and dispatchability of small hydro in CAISO explain this complementarity. Due to its benefit in emission and low Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), it is suggested to consider more small hydro projects to accommodate additional PV capacity for the 100% green electricity goal. Our estimation indicates that the current feasible potential of small hydro is sufficient, if the relation stays the same over years. If developers can mitigate the environmental impact, more technical potential will become feasible. Thus, small hydro could integrate more solar PV and reduce the demand for natural gas plants and batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental impact 3amarkets 3anatural gas 3aoperating costs 3asolar energy 3awater power 3awind power 3aCalifornia 0aSmall hydro 0aSolar PV 0aBayesian learning1 aSasthav, Colin1 aWang, Xianxun1 aLima, Luana M.M.0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Aug., v. 155 p.1139-1146dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011600174520135300290592002801643650002901671650001501700650003201715651001401747700002101761700001501782773011701797856008601914852000902000655001202009IND60728389720221120052659.0211219e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072838972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1121292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBluemling, Bettina10aBoundaries, limits, landscapes and flows: An analytical framework for boundaries in natural resource management  aIn times of increasing pressure on natural resources, resource boundaries have become more ambiguous. Resources are increasingly interlinked, and competing users may define a resource and its boundaries differently. At times, resource units are confined into “resource plots”, while at other times they are “resource stocks”. Nevertheless, according to Elinor Ostrom, “clearly defined boundaries” are an important design principle. Against this background, the aim of this article is to develop, based on the work of Achille Varzi, an analytical framework with the help of which a better understanding can be gained of boundaries and their ambiguities in CPR management. Applied to 33 publications from Elinor Ostrom, the framework shows that focus has been on spatial, social boundaries. Less attention has been paid to natural boundaries, and in particular to natural resource limits. Applied to three empirical cases from East Asia, the framework shows how a more nuanced understanding of boundaries and their ambiguities can inform environmental management on the role of ambiguity. On a theoretical level, the paper finds that we need to move away from understanding a resource as a plain landscape, to a landscape as composed of shifting equilibria of resource flows, the limits of which need to be incorporated in CPR management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental management 3alandscapes 3anatural resource management 3aEast Asia1 aTai, Hsing-Sheng1 aChoe, Hyun0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 May 01, v. 285 p.112129-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1121293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015000167300002000317520170200337592002802039596005902067596006202126596006202188650002302250650001602273650001202289650002502301650001302326650002302339650002002362650001502382650002102397650004102418650001302459650002902472650002502501650002002526700001602546700001702562700001602579700001602595700001702611773015502628856008302783852000902866655001202875IND60747266120221121032928.0220208e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074726612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13868-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Guoliang10aInfluence of Rahnella aquatilis on arsenic accumulation by Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara for the phytoremediation of arsenic-contaminated water  ap. 44354-44360.  aVallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara is a suitable submerged plant for the phytoremediation of As-contaminated water. Rahnella aquatilis is one of the plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria. Influences of R. aquatilis on the arsenic accumulation and detoxification of V. natans were investigated. The results showed that As accumulation by V. natans could be significantly improved after R. aquatilis inoculated at the lower level of As (< 2 mg/L). At 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L As levels, the As concentrations of V. natans with R. aquatilis were respectively 100.40%, 57.96%, and 22.62% higher than that of V. natans with no R. aquatilis. The concentration of As in V. natans was increased with the increasing the As concentration up to 1 mg/L, but it was decreased at 2 mg/L As. The correlation analysis showed that the As accumulated in the plant was positive correlated (R² = 0.977, p < 0.01) with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) produced by R. aquatilis under different As levels. IAA may be the major factor affecting the As accumulation of V. natans. The results of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase, hydrogen peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase indicated that IAA produced by R. aquatilis had alleviated the arsenic stress on V. natans. The synthesis of IAA by R. aquatilis was related to the As levels. When the As was at 2 mg/L, the IAA that produced by R. aquatilis decreased and the promotion of R. aquatilis on As accumulation by V. natans reduced. However, R. aquatilis has a positive influence on the arsenic accumulation by V. natans at the lower As levels (< 2 mg/L), and it may be a potentially useful way to improve the removal of arsenic from contaminated water using submerged plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a41501343cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018JJ3153cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province  a2020JJ4287cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province 3aRahnella aquatilis 3aVallisneria 3aarsenic 3aascorbate peroxidase 3ahydrogen 3aindole acetic acid 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aresearch 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater pollution1 aRan, Yanlin1 aMa, Yongqing1 aChen, Zhang1 aLi, Zhixian1 aChen, Yuanqi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 32 p.44354-44360dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13868-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245009500175300001400270520164600284592002801930650002301958650001701981650003501998650001902033650001502052650002002067650001502087650001102102650001502113650001302128650001602141650001502157651001002172653001902182653002802201653002102229653002002250653002202270653002102292700001802313700005802331773009302389856008902482852000902571655001202580IND60541723720221120211755.0190401e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054172372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTortora, Alfonso10aRural landscape planning through spatial modelling and image processing of historical maps  ap. 71-82.  aRural land has been affected over the years by profound, complex and difficult to understand transformations due to natural events, human intervention and changes in natural cycles. Nowadays, the analysis of rural land as well as the environment and landscape is made easier and more complete through the use of powerful and reliable tools; many changes can be considered to be models of territorial development that may prove useful in the appropriate planning of interventions in a rural area. In this paper the land use changes in a rural area located in Southern Italy were analysed by comparing some historical cartographic supports produced by the Italian Geographic Military Institute at different periods over about 160 years with modern maps, in order to evaluate the morphological and vegetation variations of agro-forestry land. The results in terms of landscape modification of the study area show significant changes: the agricultural and forestry land has been affected by deep transformations. Land use and morphological changes at four time steps were conducted through the implementation of digital terrain models, which were enriched by draping land cover pictures over them; these finally enabled an evaluation in a scenic way of the morphological and vegetation variations of the agro-forestry landscape, allowing a virtual jump back to periods when digital aerial photography was not yet possible. Multitemporal analysis with the support of GIS techniques has great potential for assessing and monitoring landscape diversity and typical changes of vegetation and for planning sound interventions in landscape structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3aagroforestry 3ageographic information systems 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3arural areas 3avegetation 3aItaly 0aRural planning 0aAgro-forestry landscape 0aLand use changes 0aHistorical maps 0aSpatial modelling 0aImage processing1 aStatuto, Dina1 aPicuno, Pietro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2514-27210 tLand use policy.g2015 Jan., v. 42 p.71-82dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245011900206300001800325520096700343592002801310650001601338650002401354650001301378650001401391650003701405700002101442700001701463700001501480700002001495700001401515773011801529856008201647990002301729852000901752655001201761IND60091062420221121081218.0141103e20120615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009106242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.04.0822doi7 aPMC33626632pmcid7 a226076832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Haijun10a5-Cyano-6-oxo-1,6-dihydro-pyrimidines as potent antagonists targeting exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP  ap. 4038-4043.  aExchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) are a family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors that regulate a wide variety of intracellular processes in response to second messenger cAMP. To explore the structural determinants for Epac antagonist properties of high throughput screening (HTS) hit ESI-08, pyrimidine 1, a series of 5-cyano-6-oxo-1,6-dihydro-pyrimidine analogues have been synthesized and evaluated for their activities for Epac inhibition. Structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis led to the identification of three more potent Epac antagonists (6b, 6g, and 6h). These inhibitors may serve as valuable pharmacological probes for further elucidation of the physiological functions and mechanisms of Epac regulation. Our SAR results and molecular docking studies have also revealed that further optimization of the moieties at the C-6 position of pyrimidine scaffold may allow us to discover more potent Epac-specific antagonists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aguanine nucleotides 3aproteins 3ascreening 3astructure-activity relationships1 aTsalkova, Tamara1 aMei, Fang C.1 aHu, Yunyi,1 aCheng, Xiaodong1 aZhou, Jia0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2012 June 15, v. 22, no. 12 p.4038-4043dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.04.0823Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013200168300001800300500001900318520122800337592002801565596006001593596006001653596004901713596004901762650001301811650001001824650001201834650001501846650001801861650001201879650001701891650001601908650001101924650002301935650001901958650000901977650002001986650001702006700002102023700005602044773013902100856008202239852000902321655001202330IND60701851020221118181213.0200716e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070185102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-019-00321-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Shin Woong10aApplication of a soil quality assessment system using ecotoxicological indicators to evaluate contaminated and remediated soils  ap. 1681-1690.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe deterioration of soil quality owing to human activities results in adverse effects on the soil ecosystem. This study developed a systematic method to quantitatively evaluate soil quality based on physical, chemical, biological, and ecotoxicological indicators and proposed the soil quality assessment and management system. This system consists of step-by-step processes, including indicator classification, indicator measurement, scoring and weighting, and soil quality index (SQI) calculation. The novel strategy included the usage of authentic ecotoxicological indicators for realistically interpreting soil quality assessment results. This study used five ecotoxicological indicators, including earthworm survival, enzyme activities, nematode reproduction, plant germination and growth, soil algal biomass, and soil algal photosynthetic capacity. Relatively higher SQI values than those corresponding to the actual soil quality status would be obtained without considering the ecotoxicological indicators. We conclude that the use of ecotoxicological indicator can help in soil quality assessment even under extreme soil quality conditions, such as highly contaminated or physically and chemically remediated soils.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016R1A2B3010445cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2018R1A2B6006139cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2016001970001cKorea Ministry of Environment  a2014000560001cKorea Ministry of Environment 3aNematoda 3aalgae 3abiomass 3aearthworms 3aecotoxicology 3aenzymes 3ageochemistry 3agermination 3ahumans 3amanagement systems 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil 3asoil ecosystems 3asoil quality1 aJeong, Seung-Woo1 aAn, Youn-Joo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0193-19290 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2020 June, v. 42, no. 6 p.1681-1690dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870049x0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-019-00321-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245019000212300001800402500001900420520152200439592002801961650005001989650001402039650002002053650002202073650000902095650002202104650001702126650001702143650003102160650002102191650000902212650002002221650001102241650000902252651001602261700001502277700002502292700005902317773013902376856008202515852000902597655001202606IND60701851120221118180835.0200716e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070185112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-019-00334-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarafdar, Abhrajyoti1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0020-527910aProfiling and potential cancer risk assessment on children exposed to PAHs in playground dust/soil: a comparative study on poured rubber surfaced and classical soil playgrounds in Seoul  ap. 1691-1704.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChildren can get affected by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) while they interact with play area soil/rubber surfacing and exposed to PAHs by dermal contact, inhalation and hand-to-mouth activity. A comparative study has been conducted on PAHs profiling and probable cancer risk of children from PAHs present in uncovered playground surface soil and poured rubber surfaced playground dust. Surface soil and dust samples have been collected from 14 different children parks around the Korea University campus, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Concentrations of 16 PAHs in the soils/dust were found to be in a range of 2.82–57.93 μg g⁻¹. Profiling of the PAHs from the playground soils/dust reveals 3-ring PAHs are dominating with 79.9% of total PAHs content, on an average. The diagnostic ratio analysis confirms that vehicular exhaust and fossil fuel burning are likely the main sources of high molecular weight carcinogenic PAHs, whereas low molecular weight PAHs have pyrogenic origin. The probabilistic health risk assessment using Monte Carlo simulations for the estimation of the 95% cancer risk exposed to the PAHs from the surfaced playgrounds shows a little higher value than the USEPA safety standard (1.3 × 10⁻⁵). Sensitivity analysis revealed exposure duration and relative skin adherence factor for soil as the most influential parameters of the assessment. Noticeably, cancer risk is approximately 10 times higher in poured rubber surfaced playgrounds than in uncovered soil playgrounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3abreathing 3acarcinogenicity 3acomparative study 3adust 3aexposure duration 3afossil fuels 3ageochemistry 3ahealth effects assessments 3amolecular weight 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arubber 3asoil 3aSouth Korea1 aOh, Min-Ju1 aNguyen-Phuong, Quynh1 aKwon, Jung-Hwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6341-75620 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2020 June, v. 42, no. 6 p.1691-1704dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870049x0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-019-00334-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006600170300001800236520104700254592002801301650001601329650001501345650002201360650000901382650000901391650001201400650002001412650000901432650002901441700002601470700002701496700002201523700003301545773011101578856008401689990002301773852000901796655001201805IND60094782720221120131848.0141104e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009478272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2012.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, Renata10aHoxd13 Contribution to the Evolution of Vertebrate Appendages  ap. 1219-1229.  aFossil data suggest that limbs evolved from fish fins by sequential elaboration of their distal endoskeleton, giving rise to the autopod close to the tetrapod origin. This elaboration may have occurred by a simultaneous reduction of the distal ectodermal fold of fish fins. Modulation of 5′Hoxd gene transcription, through tetrapod-specific digit enhancers, has been suggested as a possible evolutionary mechanism involved in these morphological transformations. Here, we overexpress hoxd13a in zebrafish to investigate the impact of increasing 5′Hoxd expression during fin development. This overexpression causes increased proliferation, distal expansion of chondrogenic tissue and finfold reduction. In addition, we also show that the tetrapod-specific 5′Hoxd enhancer CsC promotes similar expression in zebrafish fins and mouse limbs. Our results support the idea that modulation of 5′Hoxd gene expression, by acquisition of novel enhancer elements, offered the substrate for the evolution of fins and the origin of tetrapod limbs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aappendages 3aenhancer elements 3afins 3afish 3afossils 3agene expression 3amice 3atranscription (genetics)1 aGómez-Marín, Carlos1 aWilson, Jonathan Mark1 aCasares, Fernando1 aGómez-Skarmeta, José Luis0 tDevelopmental cell.g2012 Dec. 11, v. 23, no. 6 p.1219-1229dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12082x1534-58077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2012.10.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008900155520133600244592002801580650001701608650001101625650001501636650001201651650001301663651001001676700002501686700001801711773012701729856007401856852000901930655001201939IND60652782820221119092921.0190713e20190117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065278282DNAL7 a10.3390/su110204722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Ping 10aHow Does High-Speed Rail Affect Tourism? A Case Study of the Capital Region of China  aThe objective of this study is to analyze the tourism spatial interaction that defines two scenarios, i.e., the actual one with the current high-speed rail (HSR) network, and the future one with an extension of the HSR network, considering as a case study the Capital region of China. The impact of HSR on the spatial distribution characteristics is investigated. The main outcome of this study is that the extension of the HSR network in the future scenario will significantly increase the total tourism spatial interaction and will reduce the spatial difference. What this paper adds to the current knowledge about HSR and tourism is that smaller cities, such as Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde, connected via HSR to core cities will benefit the most from the HSR network&rsquo;s operation. Those cities should take the HSR network as a development opportunity to enhance their attractiveness and strengthen their marketing to achieve sustainable tourism competitiveness. The study found that effects can also be registered on larger cities, but they are smaller. So, larger cities, such as Beijing and Tianjin, should reassess their attractiveness to the tourist market and take corresponding countermeasures. The findings of this study can be used by tourism management authorities to develop short-term and long-term plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3aecotourism 3amarkets 3atourists 3aChina1 aPagliara, Francesca 1 aWilson, Alan 0 tSustainability.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110204723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01318naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007000159300001400229500002000243520043100263592002800694650001400722650000900736650001300745650002000758700002300778773014400801856007400945852000901019655001201028IND60786653920221118045259.0220805e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078665392DNAL7 a10.1002/awwa.14812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, John D.10aUSDA Source Water Protection Funding: Successes and Opportunities  ap. 50-59.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSource water protection (SWP) programs funded in the 2018 Farm Bill require highly motivated partners for implementation in priority watersheds.

In this work, a hot steel spherical particle (6–14mm and 600–1100°C) was dropped onto pine needles with a fuel moisture content (FMC) of 6–32% and wind speed of 0–4m s-1. Several ignition phenomena including direct flaming, smouldering and smouldering-to-flaming transition were observed. The critical particle temperature for sustained ignition was found to decrease with the particle size (d) and increase with FMC as (°C), and the maximum heating efficiency of particle was found to be . As the particle size increases, the influence of FMC becomes weaker. The flaming ignition delay times for both direct flaming and smouldering-to-flaming transition were measured, and decreased with particle temperature and wind speed, but increased with FMC. The proposed heat-transfer analysis explains the ignition limit and delay time, and suggests that the hot particle acts as both heating and pilot sources like a small flame for direct flaming ignition, but only acts as a heating source for smouldering. This study deepens the fundamental understanding of hot-particle ignition, and may help provide a first step to understanding the mechanism behind firebrand ignition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconifer needles 3afuels 3afuels (fire ecology) 3aheat transfer 3aparticle size 3asteel 3atemperature 3awater content 3awelding 3awildfires 3awind speed 0aignition delay 0aignition limit 0apine needles 0asmouldering-to-flaming transition 0aspotting1 aHuang, Xinyan1 aChen, Haixiang1 aLiu, Naian0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2017, v. 26, no. 1 p.71-81dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF160963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011800155300001600273500001400289520149900303592002801802650001001830650001501840650002601855650001501881650001101896650001001907650001301917653002001930653001501950653001201965653000801977653002601985700002102011700002302032773010902055856007302164852000902237655001202246IND60726963420221121205229.0210209e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072696342DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/peu0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aDevelopment of intestinal mucin 2, IgA, and polymeric Ig receptor expressions in broiler chickens and Pekin ducks  ap. 172-180.  aNAL-light  aIntestinal mucin 2 (MUC2), a major gel-forming mucin, represents a primary barrier component of mucus layers and a target site for secretory IgA. Polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) expressed on the basolateral surface of epithelium is used to transport polymeric IgA from the lamina propria into luminal mucins to establish the first lines of intestinal defense. To determine the spatio-temporal expression of MUC2, IgA, and pIgR in broiler chickens and Pekin ducks, intestinal tissues (n = 6/age) were dissected from late embryonic days up to 21 d posthatch. In the intestinal tissues, MUC2 was expressed with a rapid increase at hatching, followed by steady expression through 21 d posthatch both in chickens and ducks. IgA expression was low during the first week following hatching for both species. From the second week posthatch, IgA was rapidly expressed in the chickens, arriving at steady expression in the third week after hatching. However, in ducks, IgA expression during the 2 to 3 wk posthatch period was relatively slow. The expression of pIgR was greatly increased after hatching for both species, but its expression in ducks was relatively delayed. In addition, intestinal pIgR expression was highly correlated with MUC2 and IgA expressions in chickens but just moderately correlated in ducks. The relatively slow and late expression of IgA and pIgR as well as their moderate correlation may or may not account for the susceptibility of ducklings to mucosal pathogens at a young age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPekin 3aepithelium 3aimmunologic receptors 3aintestines 3amucins 3amucus 3apolymers 0abroiler chicken 0aPekin duck 0amucin 2 0aIgA 0apolymeric Ig receptor1 aEicher, Susan D.1 aApplegate, Todd J.0 tPoultry science.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 94, no. 2 p.172-180dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/peu0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245010800178300001600286520129900302592002801601650001401629650001401643650001301657650000901670650001401679650003301693650001301726650003701739650001901776653001101795653001301806653001701819653002401836653001301860653001401873700001801887700002101905700001801926700002101944773012101965856009002086852000902176655001202185IND50062725320221119091036.0190403e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006272532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinhartova, Zuzana10aMorphology and ultrastructure of beluga (Huso huso) spermatozoa and a comparison with related sturgeons  ap. 220-229.  aThe ultrastructure and morphology of beluga spermatozoa (Huso huso) (Acipenseridae, Chondrostei) were studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Spermatozoa of 51.27±4.71μm total length (mean±SD) were typical of sturgeon and paddlefish spermatozoa. Each consisted of an elongated nucleus (length: 5.84±0.46μm) with distinct acrosome, a cylindrical midpiece (length: 2.10±0.42μm), and a single flagellum (length: 42.21±3.82μm). The acrosome was umbrella shaped (length: 1.12±0.14μm, width: 0.87±0.10μm) with seven to nine posterolateral projections (length: 0.49±0.09μm). Three endonuclear canals, spirally arranged, traversed the nucleus length from the acrosome to the implantation fossa. The flagellum comprised an axoneme with the typical 9+2 organization of microtubules. Two flat fins were present along the flagellum parallel to the plane of the central doublet of microtubules. These fins arose at different positions, 0.57±0.30 and 4.06±1.32μm from the midpiece and terminated 4.18±1.09 and 4.92±1.34μm from the distal end of the flagellum. Principal component analysis revealed spermatozoan ultrastructure and morphology were similar among sturgeon species, and, although assigned to genus Huso, beluga may be closely related to the genus Acipenser.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser 3aHuso huso 3aacrosome 3afins 3aflagellum 3aprincipal component analysis 3asturgeon 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 0aBeluga 0aSturgeon 0aSpermatozoon 0aElectron microscopy 0aAcrosome 0aFlagellum1 aRodina, Marek1 aNebesarova, Jana1 aCosson, Jacky1 aPsenicka, Martin0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2013 Mar., v. 137, no. 3-4 p.220-229dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001400137245017400151300001400325520130600339592002801645650001301673650002601686650001401712650001001726650001401736651001001750653002001760653001701780653001301797700001201810700001801822773010701840856007101947852000902018655001202027IND60568961520221122223215.0170522s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056896152DNAL7 a10.1071/WF161152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yiyin10aPost-fire dispersal characteristics of charcoal particles in the Daxing’an Mountains of north-east China and their implications for reconstructing past fire activities  ap. 46-57.  aA wildfire with many ignition points took place in the Daxing’an Mountains of north-east China in June 2010. After the fire, moss polsters and particle traps were collected from burnt and unburnt areas a few kilometres away from four ignition points. Charcoal extracted from the samples was divided into macroscopic charcoal >125μm and microscopic charcoal <125μm. Our results showed that the average amount of charcoal deposited in the burnt areas was statistically greater than the amount deposited in unburnt areas. The microscopic charcoal concentration inside the burnt areas rose as the size of the burnt area increased. However, the sampling points within the largest burnt area did not have the highest macroscopic charcoal concentration. We found that only limited amounts of charcoal were transported over a long distance and that the primary charcoal produced during or shortly after a fire event was much more abundant than the secondary charcoal produced during the non-fire period. This suggested that primary charcoal is the dominant signal in charcoal records, and that the charcoal Z-score values inside the burnt areas were clearly higher than the surroundings. Our observations indicate that multiple-size charcoal records may be a robust tool for reconstructing fire histories.  aPublisher supplied data 3acharcoal 3amosses and liverworts 3amountains 3atraps 3awildfires 3aChina 0abiomass burning 0alarch forest 0awildfire1 aXu, Xin1 aZhao, Pengfei0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2017, v. 26, no. 1 p.46-57dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF161153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011300168300002000281520140400301592002801705650002201733650002201755650002101777650002101798650002701819650002601846650002201872650001301894650001901907650001401926650001401940650001301954650001301967650003701980650001102017700002602028700002202054700003302076773015502109856008302264852000902347655001202356IND60747266720221121050546.0220208e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074726672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13482-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBekhit, Mohamad10aRadiation-induced synthesis of copper sulfide nanotubes with improved catalytic and antibacterial activities  ap. 44467-44478.  aIn the current paper, copper sulfide nanotubes have been successfully synthesized via the green, simple, and effective gamma-radiolysis method without adding any capping or reducing agents. The structural and morphological characteristics of the as-prepared CuS nanotubes were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N₂ adsorption-desorption measurements at 77 K, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, which all demonstrated the formation of pure CuS covellite phase with tubular morphology. The synthesized CuS nanotubes possessed not only high activity towards the reduction of both cationic (methylene blue) and anionic (Congo red) dyes in the presence of NaBH₄ but also exhibited excellent reusability. In addition, the pseudo-first-order kinetic model represented the reduction of MB very well, and the value of the normalized rate constant (2.4 × 10⁻² s⁻¹ mg⁻¹) was higher than those of other solid catalysts reported in the literature. Ultimately, CuS nanotubes were found to have a broad-spectrum microbicidal action against the common microbiota, such as Gram-positive (exemplified by Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (exemplified by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli), yeast (exemplified by Candida albicans), and plant pathogenic fungi (exemplified by Aspergillus niger).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3akinetics 3amethylene blue 3ananotubes 3apollution 3aresearch 3asulfides 3atransmission electron microscopy 3ayeasts1 aAbo El Naga, Ahmed O.1 aEl Saied, Mohamed1 aAbdel Maksoud, Mohamed I.

However, their use in understanding community‐level patterns and processes is an emerging and rapidly developing field. Here, we examine a set of important and challenging topics that are central to advancing the field of community ecology where we believe SDMs and ENMs can help in making progress. Topics examined in this review include the prediction of community attributes (e.g., species richness and composition), the detection and estimation of rare species, species abundance patterns, scale dependencies in species–environment relations, biotic interactions, and historical contingencies. We also describe how SDMs can be used to help construct regional species pools and community assembly models that can be used to help address important questions in novel and interesting ways. We expect that greater integration between theoretical advancements in community ecology, local field‐based experimental studies, and coarse‐scale species distribution modeling applications will become a highly productive avenue for moving the field of community ecology forward and for developing more predictive models of community assembly and dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  aMG‐30‐15‐0094‐15cInstitute of Museum and Library Services  cAlan Graham Fund in Global Change 3ageographical distribution 3aniches 3aprediction 3arare species 3aspecies abundance 3aspecies richness1 aSmith, Adam B.0 tEcosphere.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.e03864-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.38643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010300162300001600265520045800281592002800739650001200767650002600779650002800805650002700833650001500860650001400875650002000889650001200909650001800921650001100939650001700950650001200967700001600979773013700995856007701132852000901209655001201218IND60521251120221120061613.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052125112DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1965-05092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeisenberg, M.10aStörung des Nachweises der Ribonucleinsäure-Polymerase in Tabakblättern durch eine Nucleosidase  ap. 454-457.  aAn enzymatic degradation of ATP, ADP, AMP to adenine was observed in tobacco leaves.

Based on the cap-and-trade mechanism, this paper studies the joint production and emission reduction problem of a manufacturer. The manufacturer faces emissions-sensitive demand impacted by consumers&rsquo; environmental preferences (CEP). An extended newsvendor model is used to find the optimal production quantity and emissions reduction quantity. We explore the impacts of market price of carbon credits, emission reduction investment coefficient and CEP on the optimal strategies. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results and orthogonal experimental design technique was applied to find robust system parameters. It is concluded that among all parameters, emissions cap has the greater impact on the expected profit, which is followed by than the market price of carbon credits. This means that the government plays a major role in economic development. The total carbon emissions are mainly affected by the carbon trading price and the product&rsquo;s sale price, which indicates the carbon trading market and product market play a larger role in controlling environmental benefits. Several valuable managerial insights on helping governments and industries understand how market conditions change and make better long-term decisions are further concluded.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3acommodity markets 3aeconomic development 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3aexperimental design 3aindustry 3amarket prices 3amodels1 aDu, Jianbang 1 aZhao, Fu 1 aMu, Dong 1 aSutherland, John W.,0 tSustainability.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110204743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245008500181300001600266500001900282500000900301520165600310592002801966650002001994650001302014650001202027650002202039650001402061650001402075650001202089650001302101650001302114650001702127650000902144650001502153650002502168700001602193700001902209700001802228773012202246856009702368852000902465655001202474IND60663317720221120072334.0191122e198301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066331772DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1983.00021962007500010026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Neill, M.

This experiment was designed to evaluate the irrigation gradient system as a mechanism for evaluating drought tolerance in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moencb.] in the field. Fifty sorghum hybrids which were developed with A-lines ‘CK-60’ and ‘Redlan’ were planted perpendicular to the mainline of the sprinkler irrigation gradient system at Yuma, Ariz. in 1979 and 1980. The soil was a superstition sand (sandy, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Calciorthid) with an average available soil moisture of 3.6 % . Characteristics including panicle rank, anthesis date, plant height, panicle and peduncle length, crown diameter, and plant weight were measured on plants of each hybrid grown in the high and low water areas of the gradient system. The distance from the line source to the last grain-producing panicle in the low water area of the gradient was also measured on each hybrid. Hybrids developed with CK-60 were able to produce seed-producing panicles in drier areas of the gradient compared to hybrids developed with Redlan. The average distance from the sprinkler Line source was 14.4 m for CK-60 hybrids and 11.3 m for Redlan hybrids over both years. Days to anthesis, panicle and peduncle length of plants in the stressed area of the gradient may be potential indicators of drought resistance. The irrigation gradient system is a useful tool for evaluating drought resistance and the selection of parental lines over a wide range of available soil moisture conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aagronomy 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aflowering 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3apanicles 3apeduncle 3aplant height 3asand 3asoil water 3asprinkler irrigation1 aHofmann, W.1 aDobrenz, A.

We aimed to use routine data to estimate population exposure to PWS-fluoride in England and to determine whether PWS-fluoride exposure from 2005 to 2015 could be used as a proxy for exposure for 1995–2004, when fluoride concentration data that could be linked to population health data were unavailable. We calculated annual mean water supply zone PWS-fluoride concentrations from monitoring data for 1995–2015, stratified by fluoridation scheme-flagging. We allocated annual 2005–2015 mean PWS-fluoride concentrations to small area boundaries to describe population exposure within five concentration categories (< 0.1 to ≥ 0.7 mg/L). We compared zone-level 1995–2004 and 2005–2015 mean PWS-fluoride concentrations using Spearman correlation. Most (72%) of the population received PWS with < 0.2 mg/L fluoride and 10% with ≥ 0.7 mg/L. Fluoride concentrations in 1995–2004 and 2005–2015 were similar (median 0.11 mg/L (lower quartile–upper quartile (LQ–UQ) 0.06–0.17) and 0.11 mg/L (LQ–UQ 0.07–0.17), respectively) and highly correlated (coefficient 0.93) if un-fluoridated but differed (1995–2004 median 0.78 mg/L (LQ–UQ 0.59–0.92); 2005–2015 0.84 mg/L (LQ–UQ 0.72–0.95)) and correlated weakly (coefficient 0.31) if fluoridated.

Two experiments were conducted to investigate effects of wheat DDGS (wDDGS) and enzyme on nutrient digestibility and performance of turkey hen poults (7 to 21 d). Two starter diets (0 or 30% wDDGS) were formulated to meet or exceed the nutrient requirements for Hybrid Converter female turkeys. These diets were then mixed in different proportions to obtain 2 additional wDDGS inclusion levels (10 and 20%). In Experiment 1, 0 and 30% wDDGS diets were each subdivided into 3 portions and supplemented with no enzyme (E−), protease (P+; 0.125 g/kg) or β-mannanase (M+; 0.5 g/kg). A total of 144, 7-day-old poults were randomly distributed in groups of 4 in 6 replicate cages per treatment. There were no significant main effects or interactions on feed intake from 7 to 21 d. However, a positive (P < 0.05) effect of 30% wDDGS was shown for weight gain and gain:feed. A significant interaction on nitrogen retention (NR) was found between enzymes and wDDGS level. There were significant main effects and interactions on the AME of the diets. The AME was higher (P < 0.05) for 30% compared to 0% wDDGS. Supplementation of P+ decreased (P < 0.05) AME for 0% diets as compared to 30% diets and vice versa for M+. In Experiment 2, 7-day-old poults (4 birds per 6 replications per treatment) were fed 4 levels of wDDGS (0, 10, 20, and 30%) with no enzyme. A linear (P < 0.01) response was found for gain:feed with 30% wDDGS having a better response. Quadratic (P < 0.01) responses were also found for NR and AME; both were highest for 10% wDDGS diets. In summary, no beneficial effects of P+ or M+ were demonstrated in diets containing 30% wDDGS. Wheat DDGS is a valuable energy source and as high as 30% can be incorporated in turkey hen poults (7 to 21 d) diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3aethanol production 3afeed intake 3afemales 3anitrogen retention 3apoultry industry 3aprotein sources 3aproteinases 3aturkey hens 3aweight gain 3awheat 0adistillers dried grains with solubles 0aturkey 0aprotease 0aβ-mannanase1 aClassen, H.L.1 aScott, T.A.0 tPoultry science.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 94, no. 2 p.207-214dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/peu0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01462naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245009600159300001700255520048500272592002800757650002000785650001500805650002400820650001100844650001100855650001900866700001200885700001400897773015100911856007701062852000901139655001201148IND60521251520221120061634.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052125152DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1965-05132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZang, K.

Screening of Various Inorganic and Organic P Compounds  ap. 15-21.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aThe suitability of 32 different P compounds for foliar application was tested by using a new technique in which predetermined quantities of P were applied to a fixed leaf area. This made it possible to obtain quantitative data on absorption of added P and on translocation of absorbed P out of the treated area. Presently foliar applications of P are used less than N, one reason being that no P compound is available which can be sprayed on planta in large enough quantities without damaging the leaves. Several representatives of the condensed phosphates and some compounds containing P-N bonds or P-N-P linkages proved promising. Both group of compounds hydrolyze spontaneously to release orthophosphate, and all share the quality of delayed action. These P sources could be applied at 2.5 to 3 times the quantity of P that could be applied as orthophosphate in a greenhouse experiment without causing leaf damage. The most successful compound for corn (Zea mays L.) was ammonium tripolyphosphate, which could be applied at 370 µg of P/cm² without causing leaf damage; 66% of the applied P was absorbed within 10 days, and 87% of the absorbed P was translocated out of the area of application in the same period. Other successful compounds for corn were ammonium tetrapolyphosphate and phosphoryl triamide. Soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr.) proved more sensitive than corn and could, in general, tolerate only two-thirds to three-fourths of the quantity of the various compounds that could be applied to corn, with the exception of phosphonitrilic hexaamide, which could be applied at 340 µg of P/cm². Ammonium tri- and tetrapolyphosphate could be applied at 220 µg of P/cm² to soybeans. Rapid intake is suspected to be an important reason for the damage observed with orthophosphate. Several organic P compounds were tested, but none of them was superior to the condensed P sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aabsorption 3aagronomy 3aammonium 3acorn 3afoliar application 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aorthophosphates 3atripolyphosphates1 aBlack, C.

Ca, Fe, Al, Mg, and K were the most abundant elements among the studied elements in TSP, much higher than those of heavy metals. The annual mean concentrations of Pb, As, V, Ni, Cd, and Mn were within the acceptable limits of the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China while Cr(VI) exceeded the limits. Most elements exhibited clear seasonal patterns with maxima over the cold season and minima over the warm season. The spatial variabilities in concentrations of the measured elements were not significant except Ni and V. However, the size distribution pattern of each element was quite similar across the region. Characteristic size distributions of elements allowed identification of three main groups: (a) unimodal distribution in the coarse fraction for Ca, Al, Mg, and Ba; (b) unimodal distribution in the fine fraction for Pb, Se, As, Ag, V, Ni, Zn, and Cd; and (c) bimodal or multimodal distribution for Fe, Mn, Cr, K, and Cu. The combination of the size-fractionated concentrations, enrichment factors, correlation coefficients, and factor analysis offered the identification of mixed sources such as vehicular exhaust and wear, heavy fuel oil combustion, and resuspension of road dust. Non-carcinogenic health risks associated with inhalable exposure to airborne metals were higher than the safety threshold (hazard index > 1) across the region, suggesting non-carcinogenic health risks via inhalation. Mn, V, and Ni contributed 74–83% of the total non-carcinogenic risk. The assessment investigation of carcinogenic health risks revealed V and Cr(VI) as elements with the largest carcinogenic risks, accounting for more than 95% of the overall inhalation risk. Nevertheless, the carcinogenic risks for children and adults were between 10⁻⁶ and 10⁻⁴, within the range considered acceptable by the US EPA. In terms of the size-fractionated risk, PM₂.₅ contributed 43–50% and 39–44% of the total non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, respectively, indicating the potential health hazard of coarse particle–bound toxic metals was not negligible.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0502901cMinistry of Science and Technology of China  a41471390cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aWorld Health Organization 3abreathing 3acarcinogenicity 3acold season 3acombustion 3adust 3aecology 3afactor analysis 3afuel oils 3ahealth hazards 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3awarm season 3aChina1 aLi, Xiang1 aCai, Mei-Jun1 aGao, Yang1 aXu, Chao1 aSchwab, James J.1 aYuan, Chung-Shin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 32 p.44565-44579dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13896-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007600167300001800243520150200261592002801763650001001791650001601801650001401817650002001831650003101851650001001882650001101892650001301903650004301916650005201959650001302011650001602024650001902040650002202059650002002081700001702101700001602118700002302134700001702157700002102174773010802195856008102303852000902384655001202393IND60556098320221119083757.0161031e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055609832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-016-4057-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBüyük, İlker10aGenome-wide identification of salinity responsive HSP70s in common bean  ap. 1251-1266.  aThe present study is aimed to identify and characterize HSP70 (PvHSP70) genes in two different common bean cultivars under salt stress. For this purpose various in silico methods such as RNAseq data and qRT-PCR analysis were used. A total of 24 candidate PvHSP70 gene were identified. Except for chromosome 4 and 7, these candidate PvHSP70 genes were distributed on the remaining chromosomes. While the lowest number of PvHSP70 genes was determined on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11 (one HSP70 gene), the highest number of PvHSP70s was on chromosomes 6 and 8 (seven HSP70 genes each). Three genes; PvHSP70-5, -9, and -10 were found to have no-introns. In addition, four tandemly and six segmentally duplicated gene couples were detected. A total of 13 PvHSP70 genes were targeted by miRNAs of 44 plant species and the most targeted genes were PvHSP70-5 and -23. The expression profile of PvHSP70 genes based on publicly available RNA-seq data was identified and salt treated leaf tissue was found to have more gene expression levels compared to the root. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcript concentrations of upregulated PvHSP70 genes in leaves of Zulbiye (sensitive) were mostly higher than those of Yakutiye (resistant). The present study revealed that PvHSP70 genes might play an important role in salt stress response for common bean cultivars and variability between cultivars also suggests that these genes could be used as functional markers for salt tolerance in common bean.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeans 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3amicroRNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asequence analysis 3astress response1 aInal, Behcet1 aIlhan, Emre1 aTanriseven, Mehmet1 aAras, Sümer1 aErayman, Mustafa0 tMolecular biology reports.g2016 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.1251-1266dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-016-4057-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012800169300001200297500001900309520187400328592002802202596006002230650001202290650001302302650001102315650001502326650004102341650001302382650001602395650001102411650001602422651002102438700002002459700005702479700001802536773015102554856008302705852000902788655001202797IND60701852020221118184128.0201127e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070185202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08483-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaushal, Deepika10aAerosol-associated n-alkanes over Dhauladhar region of North-Western Himalaya: seasonal variations in sources and processes  ap. 517.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aParticulate n-alkanes are major constituents of organic aerosols (OA). Being primary in origin, chemically stable and thus long-lived, n-alkanes retains source signatures and along with diagnostic parameters have extensively been used to identify source(s) of OA. Systematic, yearlong study was carried out in the Dhauladhar region of North-Western Himalaya (NWH) to investigate dynamics in the composition and concentration of aerosol-associated n-alkanes. PM₁₀ samples were collected for 24 h, once every week, at an urban mid-altitude location (Dharamshala) and a rural low-altitude site (Pohara). Particulate bound n-alkanes were identified and quantified using thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TD-GCMS). Annual mean concentrations of total n-alkanes (TNA) were 211 ± 99 ng m⁻³ and 223 ± 83 ng m⁻³, while mass fractions of TNA in PM₁₀ were 4410 ± 1759 ppm and 3622 ± 1243 ppm at Dharamshala and Pohara, respectively. At both sites, a slight dominance of odd carbon-numbered n-alkanes was noticed. The TNA concentration and associated diagnostic parameters indicated unique source profiles at rural and urban locations. Significant seasonal variations were attributed to the contrasting land-use settings and meteorological variations. Influence of petrogenic contributions at urban location and predominance of biogenic contributions at rural location were observed in spring and autumn seasons. Preliminary insights on sources of organic aerosols are presented here. The diagnostic parameters allowed apportionment of biogenic and petrogenic sources. Biogenic emissions from agricultural practices viz. harvesting and threshing were predominant in the rural settings, while tourism-led anthropogenic contributions significantly add to petrogenic contributions in urban environment of the NWH region.  aPublisher supplied data  aMRP-MAJOR-ENVI-2013-30069cUniversity Grants Commission 3aalkanes 3aaltitude 3aautumn 3adesorption 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aland use 3arural areas 3aspring 3aurban areas 3aHimalayan region1 aBamotra, Sarita1 aYadav, Shweta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7455-64611 aTandon, Ankit0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Aug., v. 192, no. 8 p.517-517dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08483-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245010100160300001800261520147000279592002801749650001801777650001401795650001301809650001801822650002001840650001601860650001001876650003001886650001701916650001701933650001601950650001301966650002501979650000702004650001402011650001802025650001802043650001402061650002202075650002002097650001602117700002102133700001902154700002202173700001702195700002102212700002102233700002002254773017902274856007802453852000902531655001202540IND60118089720221117165616.0141126e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011808972DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.035840-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrakash, Om10aRhodanobacter denitrificans sp. nov., isolated from nitrate-rich zones of a contaminated aquifer  ap. 2457-2462.  aBacterial strains 2APBS1T and 116-2 were isolated from the subsurface of a nuclear legacy waste site where the sediments are co-contaminated with large amounts of acids, nitrate, metal radionuclides and other heavy metals. A combination of physiological and genetic assays indicated that these strains represent the first member of the genus Rhodanobacter shown to be capable of complete denitrification. Cells of strain 2APBS1T and 116-2 were Gram-negative, non-spore-forming rods, 3–5 µm long and 0.25–0.5 µm in diameter. The isolates were facultative anaerobes, and had temperature and pH optima for growth of 30 °C and pH 6.5; they were able to tolerate up to 2.0 % NaCl, although growth improved in its absence. Strains 2APBS1T and 116-2 contained fatty acid and quinone (ubiquinone-8; 100 %) profiles that are characteristic features of the genus Rhodanobacter. Although strains 2APBS1T and 116-2 shared high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Rhodanobacter thiooxydans LCS2T (>99 %), levels of DNA–DNA relatedness between these strains were substantially below the 70 % threshold used to designate novel species. Thus, based on genotypic, phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and physiological differences, strains 2APBS1T and 116-2 are considered to represent a single novel species of the genus Rhodanobacter, for which the name Rhodanobacter denitrificans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 2APBS1T ( = DSM 23569T = JCM 17641T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodanobacter 3aanaerobes 3aaquifers 3achemotaxonomy 3adenitrification 3afatty acids 3agenes 3agroundwater contamination 3aheavy metals 3amicrobiology 3anew species 3anitrates 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aradionuclides 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asequence homology 3asodium chloride 3atemperature1 aGreen, Stefan J.1 aJasrotia, Puja1 aOverholt, Will A.1 aCanion, Andy1 aWatson, David B.1 aBrooks, Scott C.1 aKostka, Joel E.0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Oct., v. 62, no.

Abalone aquaculture has experienced such losses, and thus, thermal-tolerant species are needed for mechanistic research and selective breeding programs. Hence, suitable methods to evaluate the thermal tolerance of abalone have become vitally important. In this study, a high-throughput evaluation method (heat adhesion duration, HAD) was developed based on the adhesion capacity of abalone. The stability and accuracy of the new method were verified by comparisons of survival time, Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Positive correlations were found between HAD and survival time and between HAD and ABT, indicating that individuals with higher HAD were more thermal tolerant. The HAD values increased with acclimation temperature (20 °C, 24 °C) but were not affected by abalone size, age, or sex. The assessments of HAD, ABT, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated stronger thermal tolerance of the southern population (JJ) of Haliotis discus hannai compared to the northern population (DL), suggesting plasticity of abalone in thermal tolerance. In addition, the thermal resistance of five abalone species from two hybridization systems, H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (GG), H. fulgens (FF), hybrid H. gigantea ♀ × H. discus hannai ♂ (GD), and hybrid H. discus hannai ♀ × H. fulgens ♂ (DF), was evaluated by HAD and ABT, confirming the existence of heterosis for thermal tolerance. The high-throughput method developed in this study could provide a reliable indicator for molecular mechanism analyses and genetic selection for thermal tolerance in abalone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis discus hannai 3aabalone 3aacclimation 3aadhesion 3agenetic selection 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3aheterosis 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3amollusc culture 3asummer 3atemperature 0aThermal tolerance 0aAdhesion capacity 0aHigh-throughput1 aWu, Yiyu1 aShen, Yawei1 aPeng, Wenzhu1 aLiu, Junyu1 aLin, Weihong1 aHuang, Zekun1 aGan, Yang1 aXiao, Qizhen1 aChen, Nan1 aYou, Weiwei1 aLuo, Xuan1 aKe, Caihuan0 tAquaculture.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 545 p.737226-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7372263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245014400157300001800301520143100319592002801750650001501778650001601793650001501809650001601824650001101840650001101851650001301862650002301875650001901898650001401917650001201931650002301943650001501966650001801981650001501999650001502014651001402029653001902043653002402062773012202086856007102208852000902279655001202288IND60673488520221117190323.0191018s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067348852DNAL7 a10.1071/MF190172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTownsend, S.

In this study, the underpinning role of discharge in driving water quality is examined for an Australian tropical savanna river. The seventh-order Daly River has a near-natural discharge regime and catchment that is highly weathered, and has low topographic relief, with most of its natural vegetation retained. Four discharge periods are defined according to surface and groundwater water source, and the magnitude and frequency of run-off events. On a seasonal scale, the river’s water quality reflected the mix of water sources. These comprised extremes of high surface water-driven discharge, high suspended sediment concentrations and low water clarity during the wet season, and low groundwater-fed discharge during the dry season with high water clarity. The suspended sediment concentration of run-off events during the dry-to-wet transition and the wet season were directly and inversely related to event maximum discharge respectively, suggesting the exhaustion of sediment supply to the river during the wet season. Variability associated with the discharge–water quality relationships was attributed to water source, hysteresis and event magnitude and timing. Suspended sediment yields and concentrations were relatively low compared with more anthropogenically affected Australian savanna catchments.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry season 3agroundwater 3ahysteresis 3ariver water 3arivers 3arunoff 3asavannas 3aseasonal variation 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asolutes 3asuspended sediment 3atopography 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aAustralia 0aeuphotic depth 0asediment exhaustion0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2019, v. 70, no. 11 p.1585-1602dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957320x1323-16507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF190173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013100173500001900304520089800323592002801221650002201249650001701271650001301288650001701301650001301318653002401331653002501355653001801380653002101398653002101419700002501440700002301465700002201488700002101510700002201531700006701553773011001620856008501730852000901815655001201824IND60696198020221119142433.0200614e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069619802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1520372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuznetsov, Petr M.10aThiazolothiazole-based conjugated polymers for blade-coated organic solar cells processed from an environment-friendly solvent  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh efficiencies of organic solar cells (OSCs) are generally achieved for small-area devices processed from halogenated solvents, which are hazardous to human health and pollute the environment. Commercialization of OSCs requires the development of novel photovoltaic materials, which are suitable for large-scale fabrication of devices through printable techniques using environmentally-friendly solvents. In this work, we report the synthesis of two novel polymers comprising thiazolothiazole, benzothiadiazole (P1), and benzoxadiazole (P2) moieties and the fabrication of polymer-fullerene OSCs and photovoltaic modules by blade coating under ambient conditions. The P1-based solar cells and larger area modules showed tolerance to processing solvents and delivered encouraging efficiencies illustrating polymer P1 as a promising material for environment friendly large-area photovoltaics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3ahuman health 3apolymers 3asolar energy 3asolvents 0aOrganic solar cells 0aPhotovoltaic modules 0aBlade coating 0aThiazolothiazole 0aPolycondensation1 aNikitenko, Sergey L.1 aKuznetsov, Ilya E.1 aProshin, Pavel I.1 aRevina, Daria V.1 aTroshin, Pavel A.1 aAkkuratov, Alexander V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8750-00480 tTetrahedron letters.g2020 June 25, v. 61, no. 26 p.152037-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1520373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002300170245010100193300001600294500001500310520126100325592002801586650001801614650001001632650001401642650001401656650001701670650002401687650001601711650001601727650002001743650001701763650002101780650001501801650002401816650001701840650003801857650002701895650001801922650002101940650003401961650004201995650005302037650002302090650001702113651001002130653001602140700001902156700001802175773010202193856008702295852000902382655001202391IND4466318020221119183738.0141112e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446631802DNAL7 a227501832pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.05.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlatikanov, Stefan10aLinear and non-linear chemometric modeling of THM formation in Barcelona's water treatment plant  ap. 365-374.  a2019-12-06  aThe complex behavior observed for the dependence of trihalomethane formation on forty one water treatment plant (WTP) operational variables is investigated by means of linear and non-linear regression methods, including kernel-partial least squares (K-PLS), and support vector machine regression (SVR). Lower prediction errors of total trihalomethane concentrations (lower than 14% for external validation samples) were obtained when these two methods were applied in comparison to when linear regression methods were applied. A new visualization technique revealed the complex nonlinear relationships among the operational variables and displayed the existing correlations between input variables and the kernel matrix on one side and the support vectors on the other side. Whereas some water treatment plant variables like river water TOC and chloride concentrations, and breakpoint chlorination were not considered to be significant due to the multi-collinear effect in straight linear regression modeling methods, they were now confirmed to be significant using K-PLS and SVR non-linear modeling regression methods, proving the better performance of these methods for the prediction of complex formation of trihalomethanes in water disinfection plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3aseeds 3aequipment 3achlorides 3achlorination 3aregression analysis 3amethodology 3ariver water 3awater treatment 3adisinfection 3anonlinear models 3aprediction 2aChlorinexchemistry 2aDisinfection 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aLinear Models 2aModels, Chemical 2aNephelometry and Turbidimetry 2aTrihalomethanesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Purification 2aWater Supply 0aSpain 0anew methods1 aMartín, Jordi1 aTauler, Romà0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 432 p.365-374dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.05.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01615naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001500185245014100200300001800341506007600359520038400435592002800819506003700847650001600884650001700900650002700917650001100944700002200955700003100977700002201008700002901030773010701059856007801166852000901244655001201253IND60171778220221207113948.0150602e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017177822DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.113.1110472doi7 aPMC36947062pmcid7 a237154712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Min10aChloroplast Division Protein ARC3 Regulates Chloroplast FtsZ-Ring Assembly and Positioning in Arabidopsis through Interaction with FtsZ2  ap. 1787-1802.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSymmetric division of chloroplasts ensures consistent chloroplast morphology during leaf growth and development.

The two Indian Rivers Ganges and the Yamuna having different origins and flow, face accumulation of carbon-rich substrates due to the discharge of wastewater from adjoining paper and pulp industries, which could potentially contribute to the natural enrichment of LCB utilizing genes, especially at their confluence. We analyzed CAZyme diversity in metagenomic datasets across the sacred confluence of the Rivers Ganges and Yamuna. Functional annotation using CAZyme database identified a total of 77,815 putative genes with functional domains involved in the catalysis of carbohydrate degradation or synthesis of glycosidic bonds. The metagenomic analysis detected ~ 41% CAZymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass polymers- cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin. The Beta diversity analysis suggested higher CAZyme diversity at downstream region of the river confluence, which could be useful niche for culture-based studies. Taxonomic origin for CAZymes revealed the predominance of bacteria (97%), followed by archaea (1.67%), Eukaryota (0.63%), and viruses (0.7%). Metagenome guided CAZyme diversity of the microflora spanning across the confluence of Ganges-Yamuna River, could be harnessed for biomass and bioenergy applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aGKC-01/2016-17cNational Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) program  a212cNational Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) program  aNMCG- ResearchcNational Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) program 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3adata collection 3adatabases 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3apectins 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3avalue added 3awastewater1 aSamson, Rachel1 aYadav, Rakeshkumar1 aDastager, Syed1 aKhairnar, Krishna1 aDharne, Mahesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3965-73200 t3 Biotech.g2022 June, v. 12, no. 6 p.132-132dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-022-03190-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245015400161300001600315520116200331592002801493650001801521650001201539650001601551650003701567650002001604650001301624650002401637650002401661650001801685650001301703650001901716650001301735650001601748650003701764700002101801700006101822700006001883773016801943856008002111852000902191655001202200IND60601937220221123033819.0180709e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060193722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b031542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCong, Cong10aMicrowave-Assisted Polyol Synthesis of Pt/Pd and Pt/Rh Bimetallic Nanoparticles in Polymer Solutions Prepared by Batch and Continuous-Flow Processing  ap. 179-190.  aColloidal dispersions of Pt/Pd and Pt/Rh bimetallic nanoparticles have been synthesized by a microwave-assisted polyol method using ethylene glycol and glycerol as a solvent in the presence of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP). The structure of bimetallic nanoparticles has been investigated by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The effectiveness of the batch and continuous-flow processing was demonstrated for the preparation of various bimetallic nanoparticles under multimode or single-mode microwave irradiation. In the single-mode microwave-assisted continuous-flow processing in contrast to the batch processing, the well-dispersed colloidal bimetallic nanoparticles were successfully produced at the boiling temperature of solvent. EXAFS analysis indicated that, in the case of Pt/Pd (1/1) and Pt/Rh (1/1) bimetallic nanoparticles prepared using both batch and continuous-flow processing, the distribution of different metallic species in a particle tended to be a “cluster-in-cluster” structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatch systems 3aboiling 3adispersions 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aethylene glycol 3aglycerol 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3aprocess design 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aNakayama, Sayaka1 aMaenosono, Shinya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2669-82191 aHarada, Masafumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1864-86410 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 57, no. 1 p.179-190dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b031543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245006200161300001800223520105500241592002801296650002301324650000801347650001601355650001001371650001701381650001601398650002501414650001401439650001801453650001701471650001601488651001001504700001801514700001401532700001501546700002001561773017901581856007801760852000901838655001201847IND60118090020221119060800.0141126e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011809002DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.035352-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiewei10aBrevundimonas viscosa sp. nov., isolated from saline soil  ap. 2475-2479.  aA Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated F3T, was isolated from a saline soil sample in China and studied by using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain F3T was affiliated with the genus Brevundimonas, with Brevundimonas kwangchunensis KSL-102T (98.4 % similarity) and Brevundimonas alba DSM 4736T (98.2 %) as its closest relatives.

In Europe, handling e-waste is regulated by the European Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which is based on the extended producer responsibility (EPR) model as a regulatory tool forcing manufacturers and importers to take responsibility for their products throughout their lifecycles. However, the directive allows for great variations in implementations in each country, causing e-manufacturers and e-waste handling operators to face challenges in their transition to more sustainable operations. To identify the challenges involved, this study investigates the effect of the WEEE directive from a manufacturer’s perspective. A case study of an e-manufacturer operating subsidiaries in several European countries and the associated producer responsibility organizations (PROs) is presented. The case study includes interviews from 17 stakeholders in 12 organizations in eight European countries. Key findings are as follows. First, the WEEE data reported are not harmonized. Second, the calculations of the environmental fee differ across countries. Third, following up on different national WEEE obligations sometimes leads to over-reporting to avoid negative effects on environmental corporate social responsibility, brand reputation, and profitability. Fourth, outsourcing end-of-life (EoL) treatment responsibility to PROs is seen as positive by the manufacturer but results in a decoupling of the EPR and the operational EoL treatment, which may reduce efforts to transfer to a higher circularity level of its EEE products. Fifth, WEEE is considered a way for e-manufacturers to handle waste not to adopt a circular focus. This paper contributes to both practitioners and researchers within reverse logistics and sustainability by adding knowledge from real-life context of how EPR is implemented in WEEE.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomparative study 3acorporate social responsibility 3aelectronic wastes 3apollution 3aproducer responsibility 3aprofitability 3aresearch 3astakeholders 3aEurope0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Mar., v. 29, no. 14 p.19920-19939dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13206-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01825naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002600185245010100211300001800312506007600330520033400406592002800740506003700768650002700805650001900832650001700851650001600868650001100884650001700895650001300912700001800925700002100943700001700964700002000981700002301001700001801024700002101042700002101063700002601084700002201110700001701132773010701149856007801256852000901334655001201343IND60171778720221207114104.0150602e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017177872DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.112.1021522doi7 aPMC36947092pmcid7 a237233252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancisco, Rita Maria10aABCC1, an ATP Binding Cassette Protein from Grape Berry, Transports Anthocyanidin 3-O-Glucosides  ap. 1840-1854.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis work provides biochemical evidence that ABCC transporters are directly involved in anthocyanin transport into plant vacuoles.

Five high-oleic (HO) peanut cultivars and 4 seed dressing treatments capable of controlling several diseases and insect pests along with untreated checks were used to find the best combinations to cope with the dual stresses during sowing to emergence period. High broad-sense hereditability estimates of seedling emergence indicated great potential for genetic improvement of this trait. Analysis of variance in the split-plot experiment showed that the main effects of variety and seed dressing and their interaction on seedling emergence were significant. Seed dressing treatments increased seedling emergence percentage by 2.09–35.00 percent points. Four of the 5 HO peanut cultivars yielded satisfactory results. For Huayu 665, Huayu 668 and Huayu 965, Huweisanbao may be the best option; for Huayu 962, Weilidan was highly acceptable. These combinations will be evaluated further in multiple environments before large-scale extension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3acultivars 3agenetic improvement 3ahumidity 3aoil crops 3apeanuts 3aseedling emergence 3asoil water 3atemperature 3aChina 0aGroundnut 0aHigh oleate 0aSeed-coating 0aSplit-plot design 0aEmergence percentage 0aChill stress 0aHigh soil moisture1 aWang, Zhiwei1 aWei, Ying1 aTang, Yueyi1 aWang, Feifei1 aHan, Hongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1084-08741 aSun, Yan0 tOil crop science.g2021 Oct., v. 6, no. 4 p.164-168dElsevier B.V.athe Oil Crop Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agriculture ScienceswJournal:27503x2096-24287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocsci.2021.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245006200159300001800221520147900239592002801718650002101746650001401767650001801781650001401799650001001813650001201823650001601835650001201851650001701863650001701880650001301897650001601910650002501926650003001951650001301981650001101994650001802005650002202023650000902045650001102054651001302065700002302078700002302101700001702124700002002141773017902161856007802340852000902418655001202427IND60118090120221119060454.0141126e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011809012DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.038307-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAra, Ismet10aCryptosporangium mongoliense sp. nov., isolated from soil  ap. 2480-2484.  aA Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile actinomycete, strain MN08-A0264T, was isolated from soil sampled in Mongolia. The isolate formed pale to moderate yellowish brown colonies and branched substrate mycelium. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain MN08-A0264T belonged to the genus Cryptosporangium and exhibited 97.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Cryptosporangium aurantiacum IMSNU 22120T, 97.7 % with C. minutisporangium IFO 15962T, 97.2 % with C. arvum IFO 15965T and 96.8 % with C. japonicum IFO 15966T. The allocation of the isolate to the genus Cryptosporangium was supported by chemotaxonomic data: menaquinone MK-9(H6) with minor amounts of MK-9(H8) and MK-9(H4), major amounts of iso-C16 : 0, C18 : 19c and C17 : 0 10-methyl, a polar lipid profile comprising phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and glycolipids, and whole-cell sugars glucose, galactose, acofriose (3-0 methylrhamnose), mannose, ribose, arabinose, xylose and rhamnose (trace). DNA–DNA relatedness (5–20 %) differentiated the isolate from its closest neighbours. The physiological and biochemical tests allowed the differentiation of strain MN08-A0264T from members of the genus Cryptosporangium. Thus, strain MN08-A0264T represents a novel species, for which the name Cryptosporangium mongoliense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MN08-A0264T ( = NBRC 105887T = VTCC D9-27T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporangium 3aarabinose 3achemotaxonomy 3agalactose 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycolipids 3amannose 3amenaquinones 3amicrobiology 3amycelium 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3arhamnose 3aribose 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3asoil 3axylose 3aMongolia1 aTsetseg, Baljinova1 aDaram, Damdinsuren1 aSuto, Manabu1 aAndo, Katsuhiko0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Oct., v. 62, no.

To understand the selectors of the ARGs, we examined the occurrence of heavy metals (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb and Zn), associated ARB (β-lactam-resistant Escherichia coli, β-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) and ARGs (blaOXA, blaCTX₋M, blaIMP, blaTEM) in water and sediments from two sub-urban rivers receiving urban and hospital effluent waters in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). High abundances of ARB and ARGs were observed in all sediment samples. All the metal contents correlated negatively with grain size (− 0.94 ≤ r ≤ − 0.54, p < 0.05) except for Ni and positively with organic matter content and total copies of 16 s rRNA (0.42 ≤ r ≤ 0.79, p < 0.05), except for Ni and Zn. The metals had a significant positive correlation with the faecal indicator Enterococcus except for Ni and Cd (0.43 ≤ r ≤ 0.67, p < 0.05). Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae correlated negatively with Zn (r = − 0.44, p < 0.05) and positively with all the rest of toxic metals (0.58 ≤ r ≤ 1.0, p < 0.05). These results suggested that some metals had a great influence on the persistence of ARB and ARGs in sediments. Overall, this study strongly recommends the managing urban wastewater to preserve water resources used for human and agricultural purposes. Additionally, we recommend the utilizing biological indicators (faecal indicator bacteria, ARB, ARGs) when investigating urban wastewater pollutions.  aPublisher supplied data  aScholarship no. 11432cKing Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3aorganic matter 3apollution 3aresearch 3arivers 3asediments 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo1 aLaffite, Amandine1 aSivalingam, Periyasamy1 aPoté, John0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Mar., v. 29, no. 14 p.20530-20541dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17115-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245005700169300001600226520103400242592002801276650001901304650001901323650001901342650000901361650002901370650002101399650002801420650003401448650001101482650001801493650001701511650002901528651002101557653003401578653001701612653001701629653001901646653002101665700001901686773009401705856008401799852000901883655001201892IND60639367320221120062455.0190606e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063936732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.04.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Young-Hwan10aPower sector reform and CO2 abatement costs in Korea  ap. 202-214.  aThe current Korean administration is driving change in the power sector by gradually phasing out nuclear power plants, expanding the use of renewable energy, and imposing restrictions on the operation of coal power plants. Considering these changes, the marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve would provide crucial information to determine an appropriate greenhouse gas reduction target, especially for 2030. This study derives the MAC curves for the Korean power sector in 2030 using a bottom-up optimization model with three scenarios based on different carbon pricing schedules. In addition, the carbon price required to achieve the CO2 emission targets in the Korean power sector in 2030 are estimated. The results show that a carbon price of 135–157 US$/tCO2 would be required to achieve the 2030 emission target for the power sector. By comparing the MAC curves of three different scenarios, we can reiterate the fact that early action regarding climate change mitigation is more effective and efficient than delayed action.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3aclimate change 3acoal 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amarginal abatement cost 3amarginal abatement cost curve 3amodels 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3arenewable energy sources 3aKorean Peninsula 0aMarginal abatement cost curve 0aPower sector 0aCarbon price 0aFuel switching 0aRenewable energy1 aJeon, Wooyoung0 tEnergy policy.g2019 Aug., v. 131 p.202-214dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.04.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013300209300001100342520157400353592002801927596006501955596006702020596005002087650001702137650001902154650001902173650002402192650001502216650002902231650000902260650001502269650001702284650002102301650001802322650000902340650001402349651002002363700002602383700002002409700002702429700002402456773010902480856008302589852000902672655001202681IND60777906620221121081344.0220916e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077790662DNAL7 a10.1186/s13750-022-00273-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzra, Mohamad Nor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9333-927010aWhat evidence exists on the impact of climate change on some of the worst invasive fish and shellfish? A systematic map protocol  ap. 19.  aBACKGROUND: The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has estimated that invasive alien species (IAS) might cause billions of dollars of losses every year across the world. One example is South-East Asia, where IAS have caused an estimated loss of 33.5 billion USD, affecting the environment, human health, and agricultural production. Factors associated with climate change, such as increased carbon dioxide (CO₂), heavy precipitation, and elevated temperatures is expected to facilitate biological invasion, leading only to further financial and public health loss. Thus, further study is needed to identify, collate and categorise what evidence exists on the impacts of climate change on fish and shellfish species that contribute to the list of “One Hundred of the World’s Worst Invasive Alien Species” as identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN). Such mapping will identify regions more at risk of biological invasion as climate change progresses. METHODS: We outline a systematic mapping review protocol that follows the Guideline and Standards for Evidence Synthesis in Environmental Management and RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES). We describe how peer-reviewed articles will be collected from Web of Science and Scopus, and then analyzed to create knowledge maps on the impact climate change has on invasive species. Finally, we speculate on how our results will aid future management of invasive species in the light of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  aLRGS/1/2020/UMT/01/1cMinistry of Higher Education, Malaysia  aLRGS UMT Vot No. 56040cMinistry of Higher Education, Malaysia  a55321cMinistry of Higher Education, Malaysia 3abiodiversity 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental management 3afish 3aguidelines 3ahuman health 3ainvasive species 3apublic health 3arisk 3ashellfish 3aSouth East Asia1 aNoor, Mohd Iqbal Mohd1 aSung, Yeong Yik1 aLawrence, Elizabeth R.1 aGhaffar, Mazlan Abd0 tEnvironmental evidence.g2022 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.19-19dBioMed CentralwJournal:21545x2047-23827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-022-00273-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245012300153300001600276520135000292592002801642653002001670653001101690653001801701653002501719653001401744653002201758700001801780700002201798700005901820773012601879856007202005852000902077655001202086IND60673489220221117190327.0191023e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067348922DNAL7 a10.1071/SB190142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rong10aAssembly and comparative analyses of the mitochondrial genome of Castanospermum australe (Papilionoideae, Leguminosae)  ap. 484-494.  aPlant mitochondrial genomes are often difficult to assemble because of frequent recombination mediated by repeats. Only a few mitochondrial genomes have been characterised in subfamily Papilionoideae of Leguminosae. Here, we report the complete mitochondrial genome of Castanospermum australe A.Cunn. & C.Fraser, an important medicinal and ornamental species in the Aldinoid clade of Papilionoideae. By mapping paired-end reads, seven hypothetical subgenomic conformations were rejected and two hypothetical complete isometric mitochondrial genome conformations that differed by a 64-kb inversion were strongly supported. Quantitative assessment of repeat-spanning read pairs showed a major conformation (MC1) and a minor conformation (MC2). The complete mitochondrial genome of C. australe was, thus, generated as 542 079 bp in length, with a high depth of coverage (∼389.7×). Annotation of this mitochondrial genome yielded 58 genes encoding 37 proteins, 18 tRNAs and three rRNAs, as well as 17 introns and three medium-sized repeats (133, 119 and 114 bp). Comparison of 10 mitochondrial genomes from Papilionoideae demonstrated significant variation in genome size, structure, gene content and RNA editing sites. In addition, mitochondrial genes were shown to be potentially useful in resolving the deep relationships of Papilionoideae.  aPublisher supplied data 0agenome skimming 0alegume 0amitochondrion 0aMoreton Bay chestnut 0aphylogeny 0aread-pair mapping1 aJin, Jian-Jun1 aMoore, Michael J.1 aYi, Ting-Shuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7093-95640 tAustralian systematic botany.g2019 Oct. 1, v. 32, no. 5-6 p.484-494dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl43314x1446-57017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SB190143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002300185245010500208300001800313506007600331520038500407592002800792506003700820650001600857650001700873650001800890650002200908650002000930650001900950650001800969650001100987700001600998700002101014700002301035700002301058700001901081700002601100700002001126700002301146700001901169700002101188700002401209700001901233700002501252700002401277700002501301700001701326773010701343856007801450852000901528655001201537IND60171779120221207113936.0150602e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017177912DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.113.1115002doi7 aPMC36947122pmcid7 a236959792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortimer, Jenny C.10aAbnormal Glycosphingolipid Mannosylation Triggers Salicylic Acid–Mediated Responses in Arabidopsis  ap. 1881-1894.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe showed that a Golgi sugar nucleotide transporter (GONST1) is not required for polysaccharide biosynthesis as previously hypothesized.

DHP is converted from 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) by 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20β-HSD). A recent study reported that 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12-like (hsd17b12L) is responsible for DHP production, and its expression is upregulated by gonadotropin during oocyte maturation in masu salmon and Nile tilapia. However, whether the hsd17b12L gene encodes 20β-HSD in Actinopterygii remains unknown. Sturgeons belong to ancient fish and are suggested to have diverged 200 million years ago. Currently, the MIS of sturgeons and its associated mechanism remain unknown. This study aimed to understand the evolution of Actinopterygii hsd17b12L and determine its function during sturgeon oocyte maturation. In the Amur sturgeon and sterlet, two hsd17b12L types were repeatedly isolated. Mammalian expression vectors containing Amur sturgeon hsd17b12L type I and sterlet hsd17b12L type I were transfected into HEK293T cells, which then exhibited strong 20β-oxidoreductase activity, converting 17OHP to DHP. LC/MS analyses indicated that Amur sturgeon hsd17b12L did not convert DHP, androstenedione, testosterone, estrone, estradiol-17β, adrenosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone, confirming that Amur sturgeon hsd17b12L has 20β-oxidoreductase activity, but not 20β-dehydrogenase activity toward DHP neither17β-HSD activity. Masu salmon hsd17b12L and Nile tilapia hsd17b12 expression were limited to the follicles and testes at the maturation stage, while Amur sturgeon hsd17b12L was upregulated in all tissues examined. In individuals that reached ovulation, serum DHP concentrations during oocyte maturation increased, and the Amur sturgeon hsd17b12L mRNA levels of follicles during oocyte maturation were higher than prior to maturation. Finally, sterlet and Amur sturgeon ovarian follicles were incubated with chum salmon pituitary extract (SPE, 500 μg/mL) for different times. The DHP concentration in the medium was increased by SPE. However, hsd17b12L mRNA levels were not significantly different following SPE stimulation. The present study demonstrated that sturgeon hsd17b12L encodes 20β-HSD, suggesting that the hsd17b12L gene encodes 20β-HSD in related fish species that evolved after the sturgeon. An in vivo experiment revealed that sturgeon hsd17b12L was associated with oocyte maturation and DHP production, but its mRNA expression in vitro did not exhibit a rapid increase during oocyte maturation as previously observed in masu salmon, suggesting that hsd17b12L does not solely regulate sturgeon DHP production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser ruthenus 3aAcipenser schrenckii 3aOncorhynchus keta 3aOncorhynchus masou 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aandrostenedione 3aaquaculture 3ablood serum 3aestrone 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agenes 3agonadotropins 3amammals 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3asturgeon 3atestosterone 0aOocyte maturation 0a20β-oxidoreductase 0aMaturation-inducing steroid 0aDHP 0aMIS 0a17OHP 0a20β-HSD 0ahsd17b12L 0aGTH 0aGVBD 0ahCG 0aSPE 0aLHRHa 0aRACE 0aORF 0aNGS 0aCV 0aA4 0aT 0aE1 0aE2 0a11KA4 0a11KT 0aP4 0aS1 aIjiri, Shigeho1 aSurugaya, Ryohei1 aSakai, Ryuichi1 aAdachi, Shinji0 tAquaculture.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 546 p.737238-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7372383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04850naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006600142245014600208520296100354592002803315596005603343596005303399596003303452650003903485650002203524650001303546650001703559650002903576650001803605650002503623650002003648650001803668650001003686650001903696650002103715650001303736650002203749650002003771650001503791650000703806650001803813650001503831650001403846650001903860650002103879650001903900650002403919650001703943650001103960650001903971651001303990700002804003700002404031773010704055856007704162852000904239655001204248IND60777906720221121062925.0220523e20220512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077790672DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/12241932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLejissa, Lemlem Tajebe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8412-258X10aEffects of Conservation Agriculture and Conventional Tillage on the Soil Physicochemical Properties and Household Income in Southern Ethiopia  aIn Ethiopia, soil degradation has been ongoing for centuries and caused the population to be food insecured. To cope with the challenges of soil fertility loss and related stress, various indigenous reclamation practices have been developed and implemented by local smallholder farmers. However, the contributions of indigenous soil management in augmenting soil quality and crop productivity were not well studied. This study selected two neighboring districts, Derashe and Arba Minch Zuriya, with different indigenous soil management practices. The Derashe people as an adaptation strategy designed indigenous soil management, locally known as Targa-na-Potayta with zero tillage, and mixed/rotational cropping. However, in the neighboring Arba Minch Zuriya district, smallholder farmers use conventional tillage using animal power. Representative soil samples were collected from selected four adjacent kebeles of the two districts. Eight farm plots per kebele were selected and a total of 32 composite samples were collected following a zigzag pattern to the depth of 30 cm. Bulk density (BD), field capacity (FC), permanent wilting point (PWP), particle size, soil textural classes, power of hydrogen (pH), cation exchange capacity (CEC), available potassium (Av. K), available phosphorous (Av. P), total nitrogen (TN), exchangeable bases (Na, Mg, Ca, and K), and soil organic carbon (OC) were analyzed. To assess crop production and income, a total of 392 household heads were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using an independent sample t-test. The results showed, soils under indigenous management, clay content was 53.74 ± 2.68%, FC 47.8 ± 1.09%, AWHC 15.2 ± 0.37%, pH 8.02 ± 0.07, SOC 1.8 ± 0.02%, and sum of cations 68.2 ± 1.66 meq/100 g. The values in the tested parameters were statistically significant (P<0.05) and favor good soil management practice as compared to conventional tillage. Using the three consecutive cultivation seasons, CA and CT groups’ mean production from pooled annual crops was 81.28 and 51.03Q ha-1, respectively. CA and CT groups’ mean gross income from annual crops was 98,250.15 ETB ($2751.78) ha-1 and 71,099.48 ETB ($1993.4) ha-1, respectively. Considering the pooled three consecutive cultivation seasons, CA and CT groups’ income from annual + perennial crops was 93,405.29 ETB ($2870.69) ha-1 and 280,721.73 ETB ($8325.17) ha-1, respectively. CA and CT groups’ per annum income from annual + perennial crops was 49,672.86 ETB ($1444.82) ha-1 and 157,980.60 ETB ($4595.13) ha-1, respectively. To sustainably maximize the productivity of the land, conventional tillage practicing smallholder farmers need to integrate the indigenous soil management approach—Targa-na-Potayta. Besides, the benefits of Targa-na-Potayta as sustainable agricultural land management practice need to be scaled out with policy support.  aPublisher supplied data  cEthiopian Environment and Forest Research Institute  cEnvironment Forest and Climate Change Commission  cAddis Ababa University (AAU) 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aagricultural land 3aagronomy 3abulk density 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay fraction 3aconventional tillage 3acrop production 3adraft animals 3afarms 3afield capacity 3ahousehold income 3ahydrogen 3aissues and policy 3aland management 3ano-tillage 3apH 3aparticle size 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aquestionnaires 3asoil degradation 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3at-test 3atotal nitrogen 3aEthiopia1 aFeyera Senbeta Wakjira,1 aTanga, Agena Anjulo0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2022 May 12, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/12241933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006100169300001400230520129700244592002801541650002001569650002701589650001401616650001301630650002201643650001701665650001701682650001601699650001601715650001001731650002001741650002401761650001401785650001201799650001901811653003001830653002601860653003601886653001701922653002001939653001301959700005501972700005902027773011102086856008602197852000902283655001202292IND60653711420221120150314.0190815e20190910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065371142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2019.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTee, Kang Lan10aProtein engineering for bioreduction of carboxylic acids  ap. 53-64.  aCarboxylic acids (CAs) are widespread in Nature. A prominent example is fatty acids, a major constituent of lipids. CAs are potentially economical precursors for bio-based products such as bio-aldehydes and bio-alcohols. However, carboxylate reduction is a challenging chemical transformation due to the thermodynamic stability of carboxylate. Carboxylic acid reductases (CARs), found in bacteria and fungi, offer a good solution to this challenge. These enzymes catalyse the NADPH- and ATP-dependent reduction of aliphatic and aromatic CAs. This review summarised all the protein engineering work that has been done on these versatile biocatalysts to date. The intricate catalytic mechanism and structure of CARs prompted us to first examine their domain architecture to facilitate the subsequent discussion of various protein engineering strategies. This then led to a survey of assays to detect aldehyde formation and to monitor aldenylation activity. Strategies for NADPH and ATP regeneration were also incorporated, as they are deemed vital to developing preparative-scale biocatalytic process and high-throughput screening systems. The objectives of the review are to consolidate CAR engineering research, stimulate interest, discussion or debate, and advance the field of bioreduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaldehydes 3abacteria 3abiobased products 3abiocatalysis 3abiocatalysts 3aengineering 3afatty acids 3afungi 3aoxidoreductases 3aprotein engineering 3ascreening 3asurveys 3athermodynamics 0aCarboxylic acid reductase 0aCarboxylate reductase 0aNonribosomal peptide synthetase 0aBioreduction 0aCarboxylic acid 0aAldehyde1 aXu, Jian-He1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4301-76301 aWong, Tuck Seng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7689-90570 tJournal of biotechnology.g2019 Sept. 10, v. 303 p.53-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2019.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011200164300001800276520165700294592002801951650000801979650001601987650001202003650001102015650002002026650001902046650002402065651001002089700001802099700002002117700006102137700001602198773017102214856008002385852000902465655001202474IND60601937720221121101729.0180709e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060193772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b032352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMisra, Shamik10aEnclave Optimization: A Novel Multiplant Production Scheduling Approach for Cryogenic Air Separation Plants  ap. 5301-5322.  aThe cryogenic air separation process is among the most energy-intensive operations and requires intelligent approaches to minimize its operational cost, the main constituent of which is the power cost. Some of the air separation plants operate in a co-operative manner with each other, and to capture the intricacies of these arrangements, a novel multisite framework is needed. In this paper, a novel approach called enclave optimization, which incorporates a small product exchange network among plants in the enclave, along with the multiplant production network, is introduced. The merits of enclave level framework lie in its ability to address the major challenges that originate from multiplant arrangements such as shared inventory, common customer and global liquid demands, etc. Motivated by the time scales of (i) gas and liquid demands and (ii) other operational factors, we adopt a nonuniform time discretization framework, which helps to define constraints regarding different products in various time scales, over the optimization horizon. The results show that the successful implementation of the nonuniform time discretization greatly reduces the overall number of constraints and variables involved in the optimization problem and makes the formulation computationally efficient. The above-mentioned nonuniform time, enclave level framework is applied to a real-world multiplant setting using representative scenarios provided by Praxair India Pvt., Ltd. The proposed model manifests its efficacy by optimizing those plants in a collaborative manner to determine an overall minimum production cost with high computational efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3ainventories 3aliquids 3amodels 3aoperating costs 3aprocess design 3asystem optimization 3aIndia1 aSaxena, Divya1 aKapadi, Mangesh1 aGudi, Ravindra D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1684-41741 aSrihari, R.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Mar. 06, v. 57, no. 15 p.5301-5322dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b032353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01838naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001500150245013500165300001600300520083100316592002801147650001501175650002301190650001001213650001401223650001101237700001401248700001501262700001301277700001801290700001301308773008401321856008601405852000901491655001201500IND4468916520221122103235.0141111e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446891652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ruihan10aEffects of the processing steps on parathion levels during honey production and parathion removal by macroporous adsorption resins  ap. 234-237.  aThe effects of different steps in honey production on parathion levels and parathion removal from honey using macroporous adsorption resins (MARs) were investigated in this study. Parathion residues were quantified by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection (GC-FPD) after each processing step including preheating, filtration, vacuum concentration and pasteurization. The four processing steps could reduce the initial parathion level of 2.77 to 2.73, 2.53, 2.30 and 2.23 mg/kg, respectively, and the total loss of parathion was only 19%. Meanwhile, different types of MARs were used in parathion adsorption, and the results from removal experiments showed that LS-803 resin was more efficient in removing parathion from honey than other resins LS-903, LSA-21 and LSA-900B, with the adsorption rate of above 90%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3agas chromatography 3ahoney 3aparathion 3aresins1 aCheng, Ni1 aHuang, Wei1 aGao, Hui1 aDeng, Jianjun1 aCao, Wei0 tFood control.g2012 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.234-237dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008200169520139100251592002801642650001701670650002301687650001901710650001701729650001701746650002601763650001001789650001101799650001501810650001701825650001701842650001501859650001701874650002801891650001501919650001901934653000901953653000901962653001201971653000701983653000901990653001301999653000802012653000902020653000802029653000702037653000802044653000702052653000802059653000802067653000802075653003102083653002702114653001702141653001602158653003902174700002002213700001702233700001802250700001902268700001802287700002702305700001402332700001802346773011302364856008602477852000902563655001202572IND60766358120221123040152.0220509e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076635812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1284112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIm, Gwang-Bum10aEffect of polystyrene nanoplastics and their degraded forms on stem cell fate  aSeveral studies have examined the effects of micro- and nanoplastics on microbes, cells, and the environment. However, only a few studies have examined their effects—especially, those of their reduced cohesiveness—on cell viability and physiology. We synthesized surfactant-free amine-functionalized polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles (NPs) and PS-NPs with decreased crosslinking density (DPS-NPs) without changing other factors, such as size, shape, and zeta potential and examined their effects on cell viability and physiology. PS- and DPS-NPs exhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity by upregulating GPX3 expression and downregulating HSP70 (ROS-related gene) and XBP1 (endoplasmic reticulum stress-related gene) expression in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). Additionally, they led to upregulation of MFN2 (mitochondrial fusion related gene) expression and downregulation of FIS1 (mitochondrial fission related gene) expression, indicating enhanced mitochondrial fusion in hBM-MSCs. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that PS- and DPS-NPs increased the proportion of cells in the S phase, indicating that they promoted cell proliferation and, specifically, the adipogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs. However, the cytotoxicity of DPS-NPs against hBM-MSCs was higher than that of PS-NPs after long-term treatment under adipogenic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3amitochondria 3ananoplastics 3aphysiology 3apolystyrenes 3areactive oxygen species 3astem cells 3azeta potential 0aCEBP 0aDMEM 0aDPS-NPs 0aER 0aFACS 0ahBM-MSCs 0aIBS 0aMNPs 0aNPs 0aNT 0aPBS 0aPS 0aROS 0aSEM 0aTEM 0aAdipogenic differentiation 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aNanoplastics 0aPolystyrene 0aReactive oxygen species scavenging1 aKim, Young Geon1 aJo, In-Seong1 aYoo, Tae Yong1 aKim, Sung Won,1 aPark, Hyun Su1 aHyeon, T.q(Taeghwan),1 aYi, Gi-Ra1 aBhang, Suk Ho0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 May 15, v. 430 p.128411-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1284113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010800163300001800271520122200289592002801511650001801539650001501557650001801572650001601590650001001606650001701616650001601633650003101649650002501680650002501705650003001730650001801760700002101778773017901799856007801978852000902056655001202065IND60118090620221119060728.0141126e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011809062DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.038224-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipski, André10aAquamicrobium ahrensii sp. nov. and Aquamicrobium segne sp. nov., isolated from experimental biofilters  ap. 2511-2516.  aTwo groups of Gram-negative, aerobic bacterial strains previously isolated from experimental biofilters were investigated to determine their taxonomic position. Based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences, these isolates formed two distinct groups within the genus Aquamicrobium. The gene sequence similarities of the new isolates to the type strains of Aquamicrobium species were below 98.3 %. The presence of ubiquinone-10, C18 : 1 cis 11 as the predominant fatty acid and a polar lipid pattern with phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine was in accordance with the characteristics of this genus. The results of DNA–DNA hybridization, biochemical tests and chemotaxonomic properties allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the strains from all recognized species of the genus Aquamicrobium. Therefore, the isolates were assigned to two novel species of this genus for which the names Aquamicrobium ahrensii sp. nov. (type strain 905/1T = DSM 19730T = CCUG 55251T) and Aquamicrobium segne sp. nov. (type strain 1006/1T = DSM 19714T = CCUG 55250T) are proposed.

The COD values at the inlet follow a complex nonstationary pattern, making its prediction challenging. This study compared the performance of several novel machine learning models developed through hybridizing kernel-based extreme learning machines (KELMs) with intelligent optimization algorithms for the reliable prediction of real-time COD values. The combined time-series learning method and consumer behaviours, estimated from water-use data (hour/day), were used as the supplementary inputs of the hybrid KELM models. Comparison of model performances for different input combinations revealed the best performance using up to 2-day lag values of COD with the other wastewater properties. The results also showed the best performance of the KELM-salp swarm algorithm (SSA) model among all the hybrid models with a minimum root mean square error of 0.058 and mean absolute error of 0.044.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemical oxygen demand 3amodels 3aprediction 3aresearch 3aswarms 3atime series analysis 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aEwees, Ahmed A.1 aAnsari, Sepideh1 aShahid, Shamsuddin1 aYaseen, Zaher Mundher1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3647-71370 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Mar., v. 29, no. 14 p.20496-20516dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17190-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012300162300001800285520148100303592002801784650002101812650002501833650002701858650002501885650002101910650002101931650001701952650001501969650001801984650000902002650002702011650002102038650001502059700001302074700001902087700001702106773010602123856004802229852000902277655001202286IND50068192820221119030222.0130730e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006819282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-012-0885-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Luyun10aFunctional Properties and Bioactivities of Pine Nut (Pinus gerardiana) Protein Isolates and Its Enzymatic Hydrolysates  ap. 2109-2117.  aThe functional properties and bioactivities of the pine nut protein isolates (PPI) and its enzymatic hydrolysates (PPH) prepared with Alcalase at 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 25 % degree of hydrolysis (DH) were studied. The solubility of PPH significantly increased (p < 0.05) with the increase of the DH, while the foaming capacity of PPH was only improved at a low DH. However, enzymatic hydrolysis reduced the emulsifying capacity of PPH. The DPPH radical scavenging and inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation activities of PPH were significantly improved by a low DH (5 %) compared with those of PPH with a higher DH and the original PPI (p < 0.05). The reducing power of PPH at all DH decreased in comparison to that of the original PPI. Potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides could be generated by hydrolysis with Alcalase, and the ACE inhibitory activity of PPH increased (p < 0.05) with the DH. These results revealed that a low degree of enzymatic hydrolysis was appropriate to obtain PPH with improved functional properties and good antioxidant activities, while a high degree of hydrolysis was essential to obtain highly potent ACE inhibitory peptides from PPI. These results suggest that the control of the DH may be an effective strategy to modify specific functional and bioactive properties of PPH, and PPH has potential as a functional food ingredient for related functional and health benefits. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus gerardiana 3aantioxidant activity 3aemulsifying properties 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afoaming capacity 3afunctional foods 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3alinoleic acid 3anuts 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aprotein isolates 3asubtilisin1 aXiao, Li1 aLiu, Changhong1 aYing, Tiejin0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2013 Aug., v. 6, no. 8 p.2109-2117dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-012-0885-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012600206300002000332520147100352592002801823596007001851596007801921596005901999596025102058596012402309650001102433650002502444650001802469650001202487650001302499650001302512650002602525650001002551650001302561650001902574650001202593700001402605700001402619700001402633700001602647700001602663700001502679700002002694773015502714856008302869852000902952655001202961IND60769307520221121221313.0220811e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076930752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-17176-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Fuliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2391-979510aPreparation and related properties of geopolymer solidified uranium tailings bodies with various fibers and fiber content  ap. 20603-20616.  aUranium tailing ponds are a potential major source of radioactive pollution. Solidification treatment can control the diffusion and migration of radioactive elements in uranium tailings to safeguard the surrounding ecological environment. A literature review and field investigation were conducted in this study prior to fabricating 11 solidified uranium tailing samples with different proportions of PVA fiber, basalt fiber, metakaolin, and fly ash, and the weight percentage of uranium tailings in the solidified body is 61.11%. The pore structure, volume resistivity, compressive strength, radon exhalation rate variations, and U(VI) leaching performance of the samples were analyzed. The pore size of the solidified samples is mainly between 1 and 50 nm, the pore volume is between 2.461 and 5.852 × 10⁻² cm³/g, the volume resistivity is between 1020.00 and 1937.33 Ω·m, and the compressive strength is between 20.61 and 36.91 MPa. The radon exhalation rate is between 0.0397 and 0.0853 Bq·m⁻²·s⁻¹. The cumulative leaching fraction of U(VI) is between 2.095 and 2.869 × 10⁻² cm, and the uranium immobilization rate is between 83.46 and 85.97%. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the physical and mechanical properties, radon exhalation rates, and U(VI) leaching performance of the solidified samples, the basalt fiber is found to outperform PVA fiber overall. The solidification effect is optimal when 0.6% basalt fiber is added.  aPublisher supplied data  a2021JJ30572cHunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a20A422cResearch Project of Education Department of Hunan Province, China  a11875164cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YKZX1004cProject Approved by the Hunan Province Engineering Research Center of Radioactive Control Technology in Uranium Mining and Metallurgy and Hunan Province Engineering Technology Research Center of Uranium Tailings Treatment Technology  a2019KFZ01cOpen Fund Project of the Hunan Cooperative Innovation Center for Nuclear Fuel Cycle Technology and Equipment 3abasalt 3acompression strength 3afiber content 3afly ash 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aradioactive pollution 3aradon 3aresearch 3asolidification 3auranium1 aTan, Biao1 aWang, Zhe1 aLiu, Yong1 aHao, Yuying1 aZhang, Chao1 aWu, Haonan1 aHong, Changshou0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Mar., v. 29, no. 14 p.20603-20616dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17176-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245010300199520158900302592002801891596006801919650002401987650002202011650001402033650002002047650001402067650001502081650001702096650001502113650002002128650001902148650001602167650002502183650002202208650002102230650003102251700001202282700001602294700001502310700001702325700005502342700005502397773012002452856007702572852000902649655001202658IND60777907120221120221310.0220523e20220511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077790712DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/29431772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Nannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2252-442210aStudy of Saponin Components after Biotransformation of Dioscorea nipponica by Endophytic Fungi C39  aThis study conducted the solid fermentation process of Dioscorea nipponica using endophytic fungi C39 to determine the changes in the diosgenin concentration. The results revealed that endophytic fungi C39 could effectively biotransform the saponin components in D. nipponica. Moreover, the maximum increase in the diosgenin concentration reached 62.67% in 15 days of solid fermentation. MTT assay results demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of the fermentation drugs on four types of cancer cells (liver cancer cells (HepG2), stomach cancer cells (BGC823), cervical cancer cells (HeLa), and lung cancer cells (A549)) were better than those of the crude drugs obtained from D. nipponica. The chemical composition of the samples obtained before and after the biotransformation of D. nipponica was analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. A total of 32 compounds were identified, 21 of which have been reported in Dioscorea saponins and the ChemSpider database and 11 compounds were identified for the first time in D. nipponica. The biotransformation process was inferred based on the variation trend of saponins, which included transformation pathways pertaining to glycolytic metabolism, ring closure reaction, dehydrogenation, and carbonylation. The cumulative findings provide the basis for the rapid qualitative analysis of the saponin components of D. nipponica before and after biotransformation. The 11 metabolites obtained from biotransformation are potential active ingredients obtained from D. nipponica, which can be used to further identify pharmacodynamically active substances.  aPublisher supplied data  a81373902 81872967cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aDioscorea nipponica 3abiotransformation 3adatabases 3adehydrogenation 3adiosgenin 3aendophytes 3afermentation 3aglycolysis 3aliver neoplasms 3alung neoplasms 3ametabolites 3aqualitative analysis 3astomach neoplasms 3atoxicity testing 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aYu, Dan1 aHuo, Jinhai1 aWu, Junkai1 aChen, Yiyang1 aDu, Xiaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2492-75911 aWang, Xijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0949-34920 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2022 May 11, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/29431773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009200171300001600263500001500279520140600294592002801700650001901728650001901747650002401766650001401790650001001804650001301814650001401827650001701841650001401858650001201872650002501884650002201909650003501931650001301966650000901979650001401988650002302002650001002025650002202035651001002057651001102067653001602078700001802094700002802112700001802140700002202158700001902180773010402199856008102303852000902384655001202393IND4468965720221122075209.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446896572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2010.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazan, Latifah Saiful10aEffect of kenaf seed oil from different ways of extraction towards ovarian cancer cells  ap. 328-332.  a2019-12-06  aKenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) from the family of Malvaceae is a valuable fibre plant native to India and Africa. Kenaf is composed of various active components including tannins, saponins, polyphenolics, alkaloids, essential oils and steroids. It has been used to treat bruises, bilious conditions, fever and puerperium. Nevertheless, the anti-cancer properties of kenaf seed oil have not yet been investigated. In this study, kenaf seed oils obtained by Sonication, Soxhlet and supercritical carbon dioxide fluid extraction (SFE) with 9 different combinations of pressure (bars) and temperature (°C) (200/40, 200/60, 200/80, 400/40, 400/60, 400/80, 600/40, 600/60 and 600/80) were investigated for the cytotoxicities. All the oils were cytotoxic towards ovarian cancer (CaOV3) and colon cancer (HT29) cell lines in a dose dependent manner as detected by using the MTT assay and trypan blue dye exclusion method. Oil from Sonication was the most cytotoxic towards CaOV3 cell line. Treated cells exhibited characteristics of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. In conclusion, kenaf seed oils from the three extractions were cytotoxic towards CaOV3 cell line in a dose-dependent manner possibly via the induction of apoptosis. In considering the safety of the product, SFE technology is a better alternative extraction method that is suitable in kenaf seed oil extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproduct safety 3aessential oils 3aHibiscus cannabinus 3aalkaloids 3akenaf 3asaponins 3aapoptosis 3acytotoxicity 3aseed oils 3atannins 3acolorectal neoplasms 3apostpartum period 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3asteroids 3adyes 3achromatin 3aindigenous species 3afever 3aovarian neoplasms 3aIndia 3aAfrica 0atemperature1 aFoo, Jhi Biau1 aGhafar, Siti Aisyah Abd1 aChan, Kim Wei1 aTahir, Paridah Md1 aIsmail, Maznah0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2011 Oct., v. 89, no. 4 p.328-332dElsevier B.V.x0960-30857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2010.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245012900167300001600296500001400312520114700326592002801473650001001501650002001511650002301531650001701554650001201571650002201583650002201605650003001627650002301657650001801680650002101698651001101719653000901730653001401739653001401753653002501767700003001792700002201822700002601844700002401870773011801894856007702012852000902089655001202098IND60673453320221117005955.0191018e20180405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067345332DNAL7 a10.1093/forsci/fxx0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedrich, Saskia C10aSpatial Genetic Structure in Seed Stands of Pinus arizonica Engelm. and Pinus cooperi Blanco in the State of Durango, Mexico  ap. 191-202.  aNAL-light  aSpatial genetic structure (SGS) characterizes the geographical distribution of genetic variation. Pinus arizonica and P. cooperi are two of the most important timber tree species in Mexico. Certified seed stands of these species are needed to increase productivity and recover degraded areas. In the present study, we analyzed neutral and putatively adaptive AFLPs to examine the SGS in 12 natural seed stands of P. arizonica and P. cooperi at local (within the seed stands) and large scales (among the seed stands). Since these pine species are wind pollinated, widespread, and often occur at high population densities, we did not expect to find any SGS at the fine scale or significant differences in the SGS of the two species. At the fine scale, we observed highly significant spatial genetic autocorrelation for both species in only two of the 12 seed stands. At the large scale, we observed significant spatial structure, which may be the result of isolation by distance. We recommend establishing a fine-meshed network of seed stands, with maximal distances of 9–18 km between them to prevent greater loss of local genetic structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aautocorrelation 3adisease-free seeds 3aforest trees 3aforests 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3apopulation density 3aseed orchards 3awind pollination 3aMexico 0aAFLP 0aisolation 0agene flow 0aspatial distribution1 aHernández-Díaz, José C1 aLeinemann, Ludger1 aPrieto-Ruíz, José A1 aWehenkel, Christian0 tForest science.g2018 Apr. 05, v. 64, no. 2 p.191-202dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45979x1938-37387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forsci/fxx0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02105naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006600142245012100208520056300329592002800892650002300920650001400943650001800957650001100975650001300986650001800999651000901017700006301026700006101089700005901150700006201209700006401271700007201335700005901407700006001466773010701526856007701633852000901710655001201719IND60777907320221120221318.0220523e20220512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077790732DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/34897852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado-Zegarra, Jaime1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8938-783210aLabeling of Genetically Modified (GM) Foods in Peru: Current Dogma and Insights of the Regulatory and Legal Statutes  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and afflicted human lives and been a transformative catalyst leading to closure of many companies, disrupting mental health, and reducing access to food and exacerbating food insecurity.

Using colored pan traps, we sampled flower visitors during the plant growing season between 2014 and 2016. We captured 5,520 flower visitors that were dominated by halictid bees and vespid wasps. Twenty genera of bees representing at least 30 species were captured within our experimental plots. Within the forest understory, we found higher abundances and diversities of bees and other flower visitors within plots that had been treated with prescribed fire or a combination of mechanical thinning and prescribed fire compared to control plots. Within our midstory samples, we found that forest management practices did not affect the abundance of any common flower visitor species/family. However, Augochlora pura and Vespula spp. were more abundant in the midstory compared to the forest understory. Overall, our study demonstrates that repeated applications of prescribed fire maintained elevated abundances and diversity of bees and other flower-visiting insects compared to untreated plots, likely due to increased herbaceous plant diversity and enhanced quality of nesting habitat within the understory. Our results also indicate that many flower visitors utilize the midstory of a temperate forest potentially for foraging habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalictidae 3aVespula 3abees 3acolor 3aforaging 3aforest management 3agrowing season 3ahabitats 3aherbaceous plants 3anesting 3apollinators 3aprescribed burning 3asampling 3aspecies diversity 3atemperate forests 3atraps 3aunderstory 3awasps 3aNorth Carolina 0aforest midstory 0acanopy 0aprescribed burn 0aAugochlora pura1 aVigueira, Patrick A1 aViguiera, Cynthia C1 aGreenberg, Cathryn H.,0 tForest science.g2018 May 28, v. 64, no. 3 p.299-306dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45979x1938-37387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forsci/fxx0083Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012800168520145600296592002801752650002501780650002101805650002601826650003201852650001101884650001701895650002901912650001301941650001601954650001701970650002901987650002002016653001702036653003902053653001702092653002502109653001602134700001702150700001302167700001802180700001902198773011302217856008602330852000902416655001202425IND60766358820221123010826.0220509e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076635882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1284182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaojian10aIntegrated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis reveals actively expressed antibiotic resistomes in the plastisphere  aThe plastisphere is viewed as a reservoir for the antibiotic resistome in water environments and may pose health concerns. However, the expression profiles of the resistome in the plastisphere are largely unknown. Here, we profiled the occurrence, abundance, and transcriptional level of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), plasmid associated ARGs, microbial composition and ARG bacterial hosts in the plastisphere and urban river water using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and metatranscriptomic sequencing methods. A total of 173 ARGs conferring resistance to 24 major classes of antibiotics commonly prescribed to humans and animals were detected in the plastisphere. Of these, 75 genes were observed with transcriptional activity, indicating that the antibiotic resistome in the plastisphere was not only present, but also actively expressed. Human pathogens belonging to family Enterobacteriaceae were identified as bacterial hosts of ARGs in the plastisphere. The opportunistic and multidrug resistant human pathogen Enterobacter cloacae was found to actively express tetG and confer tetracycline resistance to the plastisphere. Furthermore, 39 genes were identified as “plasmid associated ARGs” in the plastisphere, displaying a higher proportion of transcript abundance compared with water. The above results suggest that the plastisphere is a hotspot for antibiotic resistome acquisition, expression, and dissemination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3ahumans 3ametagenomics 3amultiple drug resistance 3aplasmids 3ariver water 3atetracycline 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 0aMicroplastic 0aAntibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) 0aPlastisphere 0aAntibiotic resistome 0aHaihe River1 aLiu, Zongbao1 aLi, Meng1 aBartlam, Mark1 aWang, Yingying0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 May 15, v. 430 p.128418-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1284183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006600140245008200206500002000288520205700308592002802365596006402393650001902457650002402476650001502500650001502515650002102530650001502551650001702566650002002583650001502603650001002618650001702628651001202645700005902657700006802716773012602784856007502910852000902985655001202994IND60761455320221120095224.0211229e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076145532DNAL7 a10.1111/avsc.126182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDettlaff, Margarete A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9533-435013aAn invasive grass and litter impact tree encroachment into a native grassland  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQUESTIONS: Woody plant encroachment and invasive plants are two critical factors that negatively impact grass‐dominated ecosystems. While studies have extensively investigated these factors individually, research on how invasive species impact the susceptibility of grasslands to encroachment is less common. Using the aspen parkland, an endangered savannah‐type ecosystem, we asked how the presence of a widespread invasive grass in North America, smooth brome (Bromus inermis), impacted the growth and survival of one‐year old trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) seedlings. We also asked if plant litter was a potential mechanism of inhibition (as has been proposed for brome litter) or coexistence (as has been hypothesized for aspen litter) in this system. LOCATION: Alberta, Canada. METHODS: We used a manipulative experimental approach to determine if the survival and subsequent growth of planted aspen seedlings was impacted by the presence of smooth brome and manipulation of litter amount and type. RESULTS: We found that the presence of smooth brome reduced aspen survival by 57% compared to uninvaded habitats, likely mediated by reduced soil moisture, while litter manipulation had no effect on survival. For surviving seedlings, local context had complex impacts on growth; the addition of aspen litter to brome‐invaded communities increased seedling growth while aspen litter additions to native communities resulted in decreased growth. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that invasion by smooth brome will alter the dynamics of aspen establishment in this system, potentially leading to significant changes to this already endangered landscape. Though smooth brome may serve as a barrier to aspen establishment, accumulation of aspen litter from nearby stands to brome patches could lead to faster growth of seedlings in invaded areas at the edge of existing aspen stands. Our results also suggest more generally that the impact of invasive plants on the establishment of native woody plants can be dependent on litter inputs.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aBromus inermis 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aecosystems 3agrasslands 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3aplant litter 3aseedling growth 3asoil water 3atrees 3awoody plants 3aAlberta1 aErbilgin, Nadir1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9912-80951 aCahill, James F., JrcJr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4110-15160 tApplied vegetation science.g2021 Oct., v. 24, no. 4 p.e12618-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58701x1402-20017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.126183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013600168520221800304592002802522650001502550650002102565650001502586650001102601650001802612650001302630650001402643650001502657650001602672650001502688653001702703653002402720653002202744653002202766653001402788700002502802700001502827700003102842700002002873700002702893700005702920700001802977773011702995856008603112852000903198655001203207IND60728387820221120052738.0211219e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072838782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1120642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillán, M.,10aToward more sustainable photovoltaic solar electrochemical oxidation treatments: Influence of hydraulic and electrical distribution  aPowering electrochemical technologies with renewable energies is a promising way to get more sustainable environmental remediation techniques. However, the operational conditions of those processes must be optimized to undergo fast and efficient treatments. In this work, the influence of electrical and hydraulic connections in the performance of a set of two electrolyzers directly powered by photovoltaic panels was evaluated. Despite both electrolyzers were assembled using the same electrode material, they showed different performances. Results indicate that the electrolyzer with higher ohmic resistance and higher overpotential attained a greater production of oxidant species, being produced under the most efficient strategy around 4.8 and 15.1 mmol of oxidants per Ah by electrolyzer 1 and 2, respectively. Nevertheless, an excess of oxidant production because of an inefficient energy management, led to low removal efficiencies as a consequence of a waste of energy into undesirable reactions. Regarding the hydraulic distribution of wastewater between the cells, it was found to influence on the total remediation attained, being the serial connection 2.5 and 1.8 more efficient than a parallel wastewater distribution under series and parallel electrical strategies, respectively. Regarding electrical strategies, parallel connections maximize the use of power produced by the photovoltaic panels. Furthermore, this allows the system to work under lower current densities, reducing the mass transfer limitations. Considering both advantages, a hydraulic connection of the cells in series and an electrical connection in parallel was found to reach the highest specific removal of pollutant, 2.52 mg clopyralid (Wh)⁻¹. Conversely, the opposite strategy (parallel hydraulic connection-series electrical connection) showed the lowest remediation ratio, 0.48 mg clopyralid (Wh)⁻¹. These results are important to be considered in the design of electrolytic treatments of waste directly powered by photovoltaic panels, because they show the way to optimize the cells stack layout in full-scale applications, exhibiting significant impact on the sustainability of the electrochemical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclopyralid 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3amass transfer 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aremediation 3awastewater 0aElectrolyzer 0aPhotovoltaic panels 0aGreen remediation 0aElectro-oxidation 0aPesticide1 aGarcía-Orozco, V.M.1 aLobato, J.1 aFernández-Marchante, C.M.1 aRoa-Morales, G.1 aLinares-Hernández, I.1 aNatividad, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8978-10661 aRodrigo, M.A.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 May 01, v. 285 p.112064-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1120643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001200137245016600149300001600315520152200331592002801853650002001881650001901901650001501920650002201935650002201957650001501979650001501994650002402009651001002033651002402043653001902067653000802086653002302094653001502117653001502132653002602147700001902173700001702192700001702209700001702226700002002243700002502263700001402288700001802302773008402320856007102404852000902475655001202484IND60568959120221118142818.0170522s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056895912DNAL7 a10.1071/SR160972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, D.10aLong-term effects of fertilisers and organic sources on soil organic carbon fractions under a rice–wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of north-west India  ap. 296-308.  aDecline in soil organic carbon (SOC) content is considered a key constraint for sustenance of rice–wheat system (RWS) productivity in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region. We, therefore, studied the effects of fertilisers and manures on SOC pools, and their relationships with crop yields after 18 years of continuous RWS. Total organic C increased significantly with the integrated use of fertilisers and organic sources (from 13 to 16.03gkg-1) compared with unfertilised control (11.5gkg-1) or sole fertiliser (NPKZn; 12.17gkg-1) treatment at 0–7.5cm soil depth. Averaged across soil depths, labile fractions like microbial biomass C (MBC) and permanganate-oxidisable C (PmOC) were generally higher in treatments that received farmyard manure (FYM), sulfitation pressmud (SPM) or green gram residue (GR) along with NPK fertiliser, ranging from 192 to 276mgkg-1 and from 0.60 to 0.75gkg-1 respectively compared with NPKZn and NPK+cereal residue (CR) treatments, in which MBC and PmOC ranged from 118 to 170mgkg-1 and from 0.43 to 0.57gkg-1 respectively. Oxidisable organic C fractions revealed that very labile C and labile C fractions were much larger in the NPK+FYM or NPK+GR+FYM treatments, whereas the less-labile C and non-labile C fractions were larger under control and NPK+CR treatments. On average, Walkley–Black C, PmOC and MBC contributed 29–46%, 4.7–6.6% and 1.16–2.40% towards TOC respectively. Integrated plant nutrient supply options, except NPK+CR, also produced sustainable high yields of RWS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNPK fertilizers 3aanimal manures 3acrop yield 3along term effects 3amicrobial biomass 3amung beans 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3aIndia 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain 0acereal residue 0aFYM 0agreen gram residue 0aInceptisol 0alabile SOC 0asulphitation pressmud1 aDwivedi, B.

Sodium montmorillonite (Na MMT), the most widely used silicate clay, was incorporated into viscous, cohesive soy protein adhesives at concentrations ranging from 1 to 11 % (dry basis, w/w). Hydroxyethyl cellulose was used as a suspension agent to stabilize the soy protein and nano clay to be the dispersion system. The interaction between soy protein and Na MMT was characterized by XRD, FTIR, Zeta potential and DSC. Results indicated that soy protein molecules were adsorbed on the surface of the interlayer of Na MMT through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction. The soy protein/Na MMT adhesives had the intercalation structure with Na MMT contents ranging from 1 to 11 %. Adhesion strength, specifically wet adhesion strength, of soy protein adhesives at isoelectric point (pI) was significantly improved by the addition of Na MMT. It is believed that the physical cross-linking reactions between soy protein and Na MMT mainly contribute to the improved adhesion performance of soy protein adhesives. Wet adhesion strength increased from 2.9 MPa of control soy protein adhesive to 4.3 MPa at 8 % Na MMT. An increase of pH beyond pI value resulted in decreased adhesion strength due to increased surface charges of soy protein and slightly reduced affinity of soy protein on the nano clay surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadhesion 3aadhesives 3acellulose 3aclay 3acrosslinking 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3aisoelectric point 3amontmorillonite 3apH 3asodium 3asoy protein 3azeta potential1 aLi, Ningbo1 aWang, Donghai1 aSun, Xiuzhi Susan0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2016 Nov., v. 93, no. 11 p.1509-1517dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-016-2890-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245004100160300001400201500002000215520066500235592002800900650001800928650001100946650001400957650002000971700002200991700001701013700001801030773014501048856007401193852000901267655001201276IND60786651220221118043844.0220805e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078665122DNAL7 a10.1002/awwa.16342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoyle, Martin W.10aGrowing Options for Shrinking Cities  ap. 56-66.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhen people and industries leave a community, water utilities face the potential loss of revenue from departing customers and the cost and issues associated with maintaining excess system capacity.

Our goals were to develop inactivation kinetics models of microorganisms applicable under varied environmental conditions of excreta matrices and to identify the appropriate indicators that can be monitored during disinfection processes. We conducted a systematic review targeting previous studies that presented time-course decay of a microorganism and environmental conditions of matrices. Defined as a function of measurable factors including treatment time, pH, temperature, ammonia concentration and moisture content, the kinetic model parameters were statistically estimated using hierarchical Bayesian modeling. The inactivation kinetics models were constructed for Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Enterococcus, Ascaris eggs, bacteriophage MS2, enterobacteria phage phiX174 and adenovirus. The inactivation rates of a microorganism were predicted using the established model. Ascaris eggs were identified as the most tolerant microorganisms, followed by bacteriophage MS2 and Enterococcus. Ammonia concentration, temperature and moisture content were the critical factors for the Ascaris inactivation. Our model predictions coincided with the current WHO guidelines. The developed inactivation kinetics models enable us to predict microbial concentration in excreta matrices under varied environmental conditions, which is essential for microbiological risk management in emerging resource recovery practices from human excreta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscaris 3aBayesian theory 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3aammonia 3abacteriophages 3adisinfection 3aenvironmental management 3aexcreta 3ahumans 3akinetics 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3apH 3apathogens 3arisk management 3asystematic review 3atemperature 3awater content 0aDisinfection 0aExcreta 0aHACCP 0aPathogens 0aPredictive environmental microbiology1 aKadoya, Syun-suke1 aNishimura, Osamu1 aB.

In experiment 1, broilers were fed control feed or the same feed containing BacPack 2X, which includes the prebiotic IMW50 (a mannan oligosaccharide beta-glucan yeast cell wall product) plus the probiotic Calsporin (Bacillus subtilis C-3102). Broilers reared on wire flooring consistently developed higher incidences of BCO than hatchmates reared on wood shavings litter (≥24 vs. ≤4%, respectively; P = 0.001). Adding BacPack 2X to the feed on d 1 through 56 delayed the age of onset and reduced the cumulative incidence of BCO on wire flooring when compared with broilers fed the control feed (24.0 vs. 40.7%, respectively; P = 0.003). In experiment 2, broilers reared on wire flooring received tap water on d 1 through 62 (control group) or therapeutic levels of the potent fluoroquinolone antimicrobial enrofloxacin in the water on d 35 through 54 (enrofloxacin group). During enrofloxacin administration, half as many birds developed BCO in the enrofloxacin group when compared with the control group (8.1 vs. 19.5%, respectively, on d 35 through 54; P = 0.001), whereas both groups had similar BCO incidences subsequent to withdrawing enrofloxacin on d 55 through 62 (14.8 vs. 18.2% for the enrofloxacin vs. control groups; P = 0.386). Cumulative lameness incidences for d 1 through 62 were higher for the control group than for the enrofloxacin group (39.0 vs. 25.8%, respectively; P = 0.003). These results demonstrate that wire flooring imposes a rigorous challenge that leads to high incidences of BCO that can be difficult to suppress, even with therapeutic doses of enrofloxacin. Prophylactically adding BacPack 2X to the feed reduced the incidence of BCO lameness by a proportion similar to that achieved with enrofloxacin, indicating that probiotics potentially can provide effective alternatives to antibiotics for reducing BCO lameness attributable to bacterial translocation and hematogenous distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3abeta-glucans 3ablood flow 3acartilage 3acell walls 3adigestive tract 3aenrofloxacin 3afluoroquinolones 3alameness 3aoligosaccharides 3aosteomyelitis 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3atap water 3atherapeutics 3awood 3ayeasts 0abroiler 0aprobiotic 0aprebiotic1 aAl-Rubaye, A.1 aKwon, Y.M.1 aBlankenship, J.1 aLester, H.1 aMitchell, K.N.1 aPevzner, I.Y.1 aLohrmann, T.1 aSchleifer, J.0 tPoultry science.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 94, no. 1 p.25-36dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/peu0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01241naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002200162245007100184300001600255500000900271520023500280592002800515650001500543650002700558650001500585650002700600650002100627650000900648650001900657650001000676773012300686856009700809852000900906655001200915IND60663315620221120062355.0191122e196309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066331562DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1963.00021962005500050015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReisenauer, H.

This may affect the soil pore system and its processes, soil functions and soil ecosystem services. Compaction experiments were performed on loamy Luvisols at three sites in Denmark: Aarslev, Flakkebjerg and Taastrup. Non-trafficked control soil was compared with soil subjected to four annual traffic events with approximately 3-, 6- or 8-Mg wheel loads from tractor–trailer combinations. A self-propelled machine with a single pass of approximately 12-Mg wheel load was tested at Aarslev. Undisturbed soil cores were sampled at 0.3m depth when the experimental plots had received either 2 years (Flakkebjerg) or 3 years (Aarslev and Taastrup) of repeated compaction treatment. The volume of air-filled pores and air permeability were quantified for soil drained to –100hPa matric potential. Freeze–thaw and dry–wet treatments were applied to soil cores in the laboratory for Aarslev and Taastrup samples. The multipass machinery significantly affected >30µm soil pores and air permeability at wheel loads of ~6 Mg or higher, whereas no or only minor effects could be detected for ~3-Mg wheel loads. Indices combining air permeabilities with air-filled porosities indicated that pore morphological features had also been affected. Estimates of hydraulic conductivity indicated critical conditions for the percolation of excess rainwater for severely compacted soil at Aarslev. Generally, the single-pass machine with a high wheel load did not affect the pores and their function. A dry–wet event was a more effective remediation of compaction than a freeze–thaw treatment. In conclusion, present-day field traffic risks creating a bottleneck soil layer for important soil functions just below the tilled topsoil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuvisols 3aair 3acompacted soils 3aecosystem services 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amagnesium 3apermeability 3arain 3aremediation 3arisk 3asoil ecosystems 3asoil pore system 3atopsoil 3atraffic 3aDenmark 0aair permeability 0aecosystem service 0arepeated traffic 0awheel load1 aLamandé, Mathieu1 aCrétin, Valentin1 aNielsen, Janne Aalborg0 tSoil research.g2017, v. 55, no. 3 p.234-244dCSIRO Publishingx1838-675X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR161493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245013100162300001600293520076000309592002801069650001401097650002801111650001301139650000901152650001401161650001301175650001101188650001101199650001601210773015001226856007701376852000901453655001201462IND60521246120221120024219.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052124612DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1965-02162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoffa, Georg14aDer Antiferromagnetismus des Ferritins bei Messungen der magnetischen Suszeptibilität im Temperaturbereich von 4,2 bis 300°K  ap. 167-172.  aMeasurements of magnetic susceptibility in the temperature range 4.2-300°K show that ferritin is antiferromagnetic with a Néel temperature of 20° ± 3°K. The theory of J. S. SMART for antiferromagnetic exchange between iron atoms clustered in groups of two (“isolated clusters”) gives the best agreement between theoretical and experimental values. The antiferromagnetic exchange constant is J/k=- 4.8 (°K). Reduced magnetic moment for µₑff =3.85 μB is due to the transfer of two electrons from oxygen atoms to ferric atoms caused on the cation-anion-cation superexchange. Some models of superexchange are discussed. Antiferromagnetism and superexchange are possibly caused on the cubic magnetic structure of iron-oxygen micelles in ferritin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrons 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aferritin 3airon 3amagnetism 3amicelles 3amodels 3aoxygen 3atemperature0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 20, no. 2 p.167-172dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1965-02163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01366naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245006100159300001400220500002000234520050400254592002800758650002300786650001300809650001800822650002000840773014500860856007401005852000901079655001201088IND60786651720221118043931.0220805e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078665172DNAL7 a10.1002/awwa.16312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStates, Stanley10aEpidemic/Pandemic Emergency Planning for Water Utilities  ap. 26-33.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEpidemics and pandemics are natural disasters that water utilities must prepare for and respond to.

In this 50 d cage study, the effects of coarsely ground corn (CC) inclusion on broiler live performance, GIT development, apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of energy and nitrogen (N), and digesta particle size distribution and retention time were investigated. This study included 3 CC inclusions (0, 25, and 50% fine corn [FC] replaced by CC), with 6 replicate cages of 10 birds per treatment. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) at 35 and 42 d was improved (P < 0.01) as the dietary inclusion of CC increased without effect on feed intake. The 50% CC diet increased absolute and relative gizzard weight at 42 d of age as compared to diets with 0 and 25% CC (P < 0.01). Dietary CC increased absolute proventriculus weight at 28 d of age (P < 0.05). A numerically lower gizzard digesta pH (P < 0.08) was observed at 28 d but not 42 d of age, and there was no difference in proventriculus, jejunum, or ileum digesta pH at 28 or 42 d of age. The 25 and 50% CC treatments increased the digesta retention time at 30 and 45 d of age (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The 25 and 50% CC treatments improved AID of energy by 7.1 and 8.2%, respectively, when compared with the 0% CC treatment, and they improved AID of N by 12.2 and 12.4%, respectively (P < 0.01). The digesta particles in the jejunum exhibited a similar distribution, with a dgw (geometric mean diameter by mass) of 218, 204, and 181 μm when 0, 25, of 50% CC diets were consumed, respectively. In conclusion, birds fed pelleted and screened diets that contained 25 and 50% CC exhibited increased BW, improved FCR, and increased AID of energy and N, which was probably due to enhanced gizzard development and greater digesta retention time.  aPublisher supplied data 3acages 3acorn 3adiet 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3adigestive tract 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agizzard 3aileum 3ajejunum 3anitrogen 3apH 3aparticle size distribution 3aproventriculus 0acoarse corn 0agastrointestinal tract development 0adigesta retention time1 aStark, C.R.1 aFerket, P.R.1 aWilliams, C.M.1 aPacheco, W.J.1 aBrake, J.0 tPoultry science.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 94, no. 1 p.53-60dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/peu0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013700170300001300307520164100320592002801961650001501989650001702004650001802021650002002039650001502059650002602074650001802100650001802118650001202136651001002148700001902158700002402177700002902201700002802230773011702258856008102375852000902456655001202465IND60556096120221119083941.0161104e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055609612DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-6163-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangella, Giuliano10aSpatial analysis of clay content in soils using neurocomputing and pedological support: a case study of Valle Telesina (South Italy)  ap. 1357.  aThe spatial analysis of soil properties by means of quantitative methods is useful to make predictions at sampled and unsampled locations. Two most important characteristics are tackled, namely the option of using complex and nonlinear models in contrast with (also very simple) linear approaches, and the opportunity to build spatial inference tools using horizons as basic soil components. The objective is to perform the spatial analysis of clay content for validation purposes in order to understand whether nonlinear methods can manage soil horizons, and to quantitatively measure how much they outperform simpler methods. This is addressed in a case study in which relatively few records are available to calibrate (train) such complex models. We built three models which are based on artificial neural networks, namely single artificial neural networks, median neural networks and bootstrap aggregating neural networks with genetic algorithms and principal component regression (BAGAP). We perform a validation procedure at three different levels of soil horizon aggregations (i.e. topsoil, profile and horizon pedological supports). The results show that neurocomputing performs best at any level of pedological support even when we use an ensemble of neural nets (i.e. BAGAP), which is very data intensive. BAGAP has the lowest RMSE at any level of pedological support with [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. We analysed in-depth artificial neural parameters, and included them in the “Appendix”, to provide the best tuned neural-based model to enable us to make suitable spatial predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aclay fraction 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3asoil analysis 3asoil horizons 3atopsoil 3aItaly1 aBasile, Angelo1 aBonfante, Antonello1 aMileti, Florindo Antonio1 aTerribile, F.q(Fabio),0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Oct., v. 75, no. 20 p.1357-1357dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-6163-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009700163300001800260500000900278520152600287592002801813650001301841650000901854650001001863650001501873650001301888650001201901650002001913650000901933650002001942650002101962650001701983650001102000650001202011651001302023700002302036773013502059856007802194852000902272655001202281IND60663315820221120062236.0191122e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066331582DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj15.03082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, William J.10aField-Scale Studies Show Site-Specific Corn Population and Yield Responses to Seeding Depths  ap. 2475-2481.  aepub  aCorn (Zea mays L.) seeding depth recommendations typically range from 3.8 to 5.1 cm, but few studies have been conducted in recent years. We conducted field-scale studies on four farms at four equally spaced seeding depths (2.5–6.4 cm) in New York in 2013 and 2014 to validate seeding depth recommendations across different soil conditions. Seeding depth affected corn populations and yield in 6 of 8 site-years but optimum seeding depth differed across sites and years within sites. Yield responses to seeding depth were small on well-drained silt loams with reduced tillage (∼3% advantage at 3.8 vs. 2.5 and 5.1 cm in 2013 and no difference in 2014), and on somewhat poorly drained silty clay loams under no-till (∼5.5% difference with maximum yields predicted at ∼4.2 cm in both years). Yield responses to seeding depth were larger on a somewhat poorly drained silt loam with moldboard plowing (9–15% advantage for 6.4 vs. 5.1 and 3.8 cm, respectively; maximum yields predicted at >5.78 cm in both years). On somewhat poorly drained silt loams with reduced tillage, populations had a positive quadratic response (maximum populations predicted at 5.45 cm) and yield had a positive linear response in 2013, but plant populations had a negative linear response and yield had no response in 2014. Weather conditions after planting affected yield responses inconsistently, but the data indicate that seeding depths should probably range from 3.8 to 5.1 cm on silty clay loams and from 3.8 to 6.4 cm on silt loams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3afarms 3ano-tillage 3aplanting 3aplowing 3areduced tillage 3asilt 3asilt loam soils 3asilty clay soils 3asoil quality 3asowing 3aweather 3aNew York1 aCherney, Jerome H.0 tAgronomy journal.g2015 Nov., v. 107, no. 6 p.2475-2481dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj15.03083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009000168300001800258520193700276592002802213650001602241650001002257650001802267650002002285650000902305650001202314650002102326650001502347650001502362650001202377650001102389650001902400650001702419650001102436650001502447650001202462700002302474700001702497700001502514700002002529700002102549700005902570773014902629856008202778852000902860655001202869IND60632630820221118023522.0190804e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063263082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-018-2999-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoujaber, Ossama10aCellular senescence is associated with reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton  ap. 1169-1183.  aSenescent cells undergo structural and functional changes that affect essentially every aspect of cell physiology. To date, the impact of senescence on the cytoskeleton is poorly understood. This study evaluated the cytoskeleton in two independent cellular models of kidney epithelium senescence. Our work identified multiple senescence-related alterations that impact microtubules and filamentous actin during interphase. Both filamentous systems reorganized profoundly when cells became senescent. As such, microtubule stability increased during senescence, making these filaments more resistant to disassembly in the cold or by nocodazole. Microtubule stabilization was accompanied by enhanced α-tubulin acetylation on lysine 40 and the depletion of HDAC6, the major deacetylase for α-tubulin lysine 40. Rho-associated kinase Rock1 is an upstream regulator that modulates key properties of the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton. Our research shows that Rock1 concentrations were reduced significantly in senescent cells, and we revealed a mechanistic link between microtubule stabilization and Rock1 depletion. Thus, Rock1 overexpression partially restored the cold sensitivity of microtubules in cells undergoing senescence. Additional components relevant to microtubules were affected by senescence. Specifically, we uncovered the senescence-related loss of the microtubule nucleating protein γ-tubulin and aberrant formation of γ-tubulin foci. Concomitant with the alterations of microtubule and actin filaments, senescent cells displayed functional changes. In particular, cell migration was impaired significantly in senescent cells. Taken together, our study identified new senescence-associated deficiencies of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton, provided insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms and demonstrated functional consequences that are important to the physiology and function of renal epithelial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3aactin 3acell movement 3acell senescence 3acold 3aenzymes 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3ainterphase 3akidneys 3alysine 3amicrofilaments 3amicrotubules 3amodels 3aphysiology 3atubulin1 aFishbein, Francine1 aOmran, Nawal1 aLiang, Yue1 aColmegna, Inés1 aPresley, John F.1 aStochaj, Ursula1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4040-86950 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2019 Mar., v. 76, no. 6 p.1169-1183dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-018-2999-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010100161520133900262592002801601650001401629650001301643650003001656650001301686650001601699650001901715650002601734650001201760700002801772773012701800856007401927852000902001655001202010IND60652781420221119093058.0190713e20190116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065278142DNAL7 a10.3390/su110204592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoldermo, Sidsel10aWhat about the Migrant Children? The State-Of-The-Art in Research Claiming Social Sustainability  aThis study aimed to investigate research articles that relate to education for sustainability, primarily in early childhood, in order to describe to what extent a holistic perspective on education for sustainability has been applied, and how the social dimension is conceptualized. The review comprised research articles in Nordic Journals of Education, International Journals of Early Childhood Education, and International Journals of Education/Environmental/Sustainability education. The findings disclosed that researchers within the field of education for sustainability acknowledged, to a large extent, environmental, economic, and social aspects, and thus applied a holistic perspective. This review shows, however, that even if the social dimension were conceptualized as strongly related to topics such as social justice, citizenship, and the building of stable societies, few articles have investigated diversity, multicultural perspectives, or migrant children’s situations in the context of early childhood education for sustainability. This review discloses that the concept of belonging is rarely used in connection to migrants and refugees in research on early childhood education for sustainability. A further argument encourages the inclusion of these aspects in further research which claims social sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood 3achildren 3aearly childhood education 3arefugees 3aresearchers 3asocial justice 3asocial sustainability 3asociety1 aØdegaard, Elin Eriksen0 tSustainability.g2019 Jan. 16, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110204593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007800170300001400248520147500262592002801737650001901765650002601784650001401810650001201824650001401836650001401850650001601864650002101880650001901901650001301920650001601933700002201949700002001971700001801991773008902009856008602098852000902184655001202193IND60084616720221118075441.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008461672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2011.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiskova, Jana10aApoptosis and necrosis in vaccinia virus-infected HeLa G and BSC-40 cells  ap. 40-50.  aIn most cells, vaccinia virus (VACV) infection is considered to cause a lytic cell death, an equivalent of necrosis. However, upon infection of the epithelial cell lines HeLa G and BSC-40 with VACV strain Western Reserve (WR), we have previously observed an increased activation of and activity attributable to caspases, a typical sign of apoptosis. In this paper, we have further analyzed the type of cell death in VACV-infected cells HeLa G and BSC-40. In a cell-based flow cytometric assay, we showed a specific activation of caspase-2 and 4 in HeLa G and BSC-40 cells infected with VACV, strain WR, while we did not find any effects of inhibitors of calpain and cathepsin D and E. The actual activity of the two caspases, but also of caspase-3, was then confirmed in lysates of infected HeLa G, but not in BSC-40 cells. Accordingly, poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage was found increased only in infected HeLa G cells. Consequently, we have determined morphological features of apoptosis and/or activity of the executioner caspase-3 in infected HeLa G cells in situ, while only a background apoptosis was observed in infected BSC-40 cells. Finally, vaccination strains Dryvax and Praha were found to induce apoptosis in both HeLa G and BSC-40 cells, as characterized morphologically and by PARP cleavage. These findings may be important for understanding the differences in VACV-host interactions and post-vaccination complications in different individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinia virus 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aapoptosis 3acalpain 3acaspase-2 3acaspase-3 3acathepsin D 3aepithelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3anecrosis 3avaccination1 aKnitlova, Jarmila1 aHonner, Richard1 aMelkova, Zora0 tVirus research.g2011 Sept., v. 160, no. 1-2 p.40-50dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012500165300001600290520111200306592002801418650002301446650001501469650001801484650001401502650002301516650002501539650001501564650002001579650001501599650001101614650001501625650002001640650002101660650003301681650002301714653001401737653002401751653002301775653002801798653002501826700001801851700001301869700001801882700001701900700001601917773009701933856008502030852000902115655001202124IND60688427020221117222344.0200607e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068842702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.1762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yichao10aFermentable sugar production from wet microalgae residual after biodiesel production assisted by radio frequency heating  ap. 827-836.  aIn this study, the feasibility of comprehensive recovery of lipid and carbohydrate in wet microalgae Chlorella vulgaris was explored. First, four sets of enzyme combinations of α-Amylase, Amyloglucosidase and CTec2 were evaluated for hydrolysis efficiency on microalgae disrupted with radio frequency heating. Then, the most suitable combination was applied to raw microalgae and microalgae residual after biodiesel production, respectively, for saccharification. Adsorption kinetics of the optimized enzyme combination on the aforementioned three samples were determined and adsorption isotherm was analyzed by Freundlich equation. Morphology of microalgae was also investigated by scanning electron microscopy. A yield of reducing sugars in microalgae residual at 54.5% was obtained after 72 h saccharification. The results from enzyme adsorption kinetics, isotherm and SEM images were consistent with each other. This study demonstrated that the microalgae residual after biodiesel production could be used as carbohydrate feedstock for fermentable sugar production through simple enzymatic hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aadsorption 3aalpha-amylase 3abiodiesel 3adielectric heating 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3ahydrolysis 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3areducing sugars 3asaccharification 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 0aBiodiesel 0aMicroalgae residual 0aFermentable sugars 0aRadio frequency heating 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis1 aWang, Pixiang1 aWang, Yi1 aLiu, Shaoyang1 aWang, Qichen1 aWang, Yifen0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Aug., v. 155 p.827-836dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.03.1763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245016800172300001600340520082000356592002801176650000801204650002101212650003601233650001001269650001001279650001301289650001201302650000901314650001201323650002201335650002701357650003301384650002201417650001201439700002701451700002101478700002601499700002101525700002101546773009101567856008601658852000901744655001201753IND60084616820221118075926.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008461682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2011.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, Takumi10aImmunity to Rice black streaked dwarf virus, a plant reovirus, can be achieved in rice plants by RNA silencing against the gene for the viroplasm component protein  ap. 400-403.  aThe nonstructural protein P9-1 of Rice black streaked dwarf virus has been confirmed to accumulate in viroplasms, the putative sites of viral replication, in infected plants and insects. We transformed rice plants by introducing an RNA interference construct against the P9-1-encoding gene. The resultant transgenic plants accumulated short interfering RNAs specific to the construct. All progenies produced by self-fertilization of these transgenic plants with induced RNA interference against the gene for P9-1 were resistant to infection by the virus. Our results demonstrated that interfering with the expression of a viroplasm component protein of plant reoviruses, which plays an important role in viral proliferation, might be a practical and effective way to control plant reovirus infection in crop plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aRNA interference 3aRice black streaked dwarf virus 3acrops 3agenes 3aimmunity 3ainsects 3arice 3aselfing 3atransgenic plants 3aviral inclusion bodies 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aNakazono-Nagaoka, Eiko1 aAkita, Fusamichi1 aUehara-Ichiki, Tamaki1 aOmura, Toshihiro1 aSasaya, Takahide0 tVirus research.g2011 Sept., v. 160, no. 1-2 p.400-403dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01622naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245005000171300001100221520060800232592002800840596007100868650001800939650002400957650002600981650001001007650000901017700002401026700002201050773014501072856008201217852000901299655001201308IND60556096420221119083606.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055609642DNAL7 a10.1186/s40490-016-0075-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, Nicholas T.10aElastic constants of green Pinus radiata wood  ap. 19.  aBACKGROUND: Mathematical modelling is often used to investigate phenomena difficult or impossible to measure experimentally.

In this study, molecular composition changes of a paddy topsoil 2 years following amendments at 10 t ha⁻¹ OC equivalent with untreated (CS), manured (CM) and charred (CB) maize straw were compared to no amendment (CK). Topsoil SOM was sequentially extracted with ultrapure water (UWE), solvent (TSE), base hydrolysis (BHY) and CuO oxidation (CUO) and molecular compounds in these extracted fractions were detected quantitatively by GC/MS. Compared to CK, SOC content was increased respectively by 12% under CS and CM, and by 36% under CB. Fraction abundance both of UWE and CUO was increased but that of TSE unchanged under CS and CM, while that of BHY unchanged under CS but increased by > 60% under CM and CB, respectively. Under CB relative to CS and CM, abundance of TSE and BHY fractions was greatly increased but that of UWE and CUO unchanged. Specifically, abundances of water-soluble monosaccharides, low molecular weight organic acids and lignin-derived phenols, especially cinnamyl-based monomers, were all enhanced under CS, but abundances of n-alkanols, fatty acids in free lipids and di-acids and hydroxyl fatty acids in bound lipids were decreased under both CS and CM. In contrast, CB amendment increased abundances of n-alkanols, alkanes and sterols in free lipids while enhanced molecular and functional group diversity of UWE and TSE fractions. Overall, short-term crop residue amendment altered the abundance and molecular diversity of OM mainly associated with short-lived UWE and labile TSE fractions and biochar enhanced preservation of plant derived molecules mainly in lipids. Thus, returning crop residue as biochar could be a sustainable approach to enhance not only SOM pool but molecular diversity also in agricultural soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3acorn straw 3aenvironmental management 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3apaddies 3arice 3asoil organic matter 3asolvents 3asterols 3atopsoil 3awater solubility 0aSoil organic matter 0aCrop residue return 0aBiochar 0aRice paddy 0aMolecular diversity1 aDing, Yuanjun1 aXia, Xin1 aFeng, Xiao1 aLiu, Xiaoyu1 aZheng, Jufeng1 aDrosos, Marios1 aCheng, Kun1 aBian, Rongjun1 aZhang, Xuhui1 aLi, Lianqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0022-11081 aPan, Genxing0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 May 01, v. 285 p.112104-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1121043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012200170300001600292520127500308592002801583650000801611650001101619650001601630650003101646650001001677650001301687650001601700650001101716650001001727650001301737650004301750650002101793650003001814700001901844700002101863773009101884856008601975852000902061655001202070IND60084617220221122025341.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008461722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2011.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCongiu, Mario10aNo increase in the expression of key unfolded protein response genes in HCV genotype 3 patients with severe steatosis  ap. 420-423.  aAlthough hepatic steatosis is common in patients infected with HCV, the mechanisms leading to cellular triglyceride retention are obscure. A role for the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) has been postulated, either through its activation or dysfunction. In this study we set out to investigate the expression of key UPR genes in HCV genotype 3 patients with moderate to severe steatosis. RNA was extracted from liver obtained by percutaneous biopsy and key genes from the UPR were semi quantified using real-time PCR. We compared values in patients with minimal steatosis to those with high steatosis. Patients with high steatosis were younger (44.6±2.4 vs. 37.4±2.1, p<0.05) and had higher hepatic viral RNA loads (1.00±0.21 vs. 3.98±0.22, p<0.05). We found no significant difference in the expression of UPR genes, except for a small increase in EDEM1 in the high steatosis group (1.00±0.13 vs. 1.38±0.09, p<0.05). In conclusion, despite a four-fold greater concentration of HCV RNA in tissue with a high level of steatosis, we found no change in the expression of key UPR related genes, except for a only a modest up-regulation of EDEM1. Our data does not support a sustained change in expression of UPR genes in the steatogenesis of HCVGT3 infected human liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3abiopsy 3afatty liver 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahepatitis C 3ahumans 3aliver 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atriacylglycerols 3aunfolded protein response1 aRyan, Marno C.1 aDesmond, Paul V.0 tVirus research.g2011 Sept., v. 160, no. 1-2 p.420-423dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012500157300001600282500001400298520190000312592002802212650002102240650002702261650001302288650002002301650002602321650001302347650001802360650002102378650004302399650002002442650001202462650000702474650001202481650003902493650002502532650002602557653003602583653001402619653001902633653001702652700001502669700001702684700001702701700001402718773010902732856007302841852000902914655001202923IND60726962520221120171645.0210209e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072696252DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/peu0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Chenyao12aA simple method for isolating chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin using effective delipidation solution and ammonium sulfate  ap. 104-110.  aNAL-light  aChicken egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) is a superior alternative to mammalian immunoglobulin. However, the practical application of IgY in research, diagnostics, and functional food is limited due to complex or time-consuming purification procedures. The objective of this study was to develop a simple, safe, large-scale separation method for IgY from egg yolk. Egg yolk was diluted with 6-fold delipidation solutions made of different types (pectin, λ-carrageenan, carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, and dextran sulfate) and concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2%) of polysaccharides, respectively. The yolk solution was adjusted to pH 5.0, and then kept overnight at 4°C before being centrifuged at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was added to 35% (w/v) (NH₄)₂ SO₄ and then centrifuged. The precipitant, which contained IgY, was dissolved in distilled water and then dialyzed. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were utilized to conduct qualitative analysis of IgY; high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for quantitative analysis. The immunoreactivity of IgY was measured by ELISA. The results showed that yield, purity, and immunoreactivity varied with types and concentrations of polysaccharides. The optimal isolation of IgY for pectin, λ-carrageenan, dextran sulfate, and carboxymethylcellulose was at the concentration of 0.1%; for methylcellulose, optimal isolation was at 0.15%. The best results were obtained in the presence of 0.1% pectin. In this condition, yield and purity can reach 8.36 mg/mL egg yolk and 83.3%, respectively, and the negative effect of IgY on immunoreactivity can be minimized. The procedure of isolation was simplified to 2 steps with a higher yield of IgY, avoiding energy- and time-consuming methods. Therefore, the isolation condition under study has a great potential for food industry production of IgY on a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium sulfate 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achickens 3adextran sulfate 3adiagnostic techniques 3aegg yolk 3afood industry 3afunctional foods 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aimmune response 3amammals 3apH 3apectins 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative analysis 0achicken egg yolk immunoglobulin 0aisolation 0apolysaccharide 0adelipidation1 aGeng, Fang1 aHe, Zhenjiao1 aCai, Zhaoxia1 aMa, Meihu0 tPoultry science.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 94, no. 1 p.104-110dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/peu0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245012300158300001600281500001500297520203000312592002802342650002002370650002302390650001902413650002402432650001502456650002902471650001502500650002002515650001902535650001702554650002502571650003102596650000902627650001402636650001102650650002102661651002002682653001102702700001602713700001702729700003202746773008402778856007102862852000902933655001202942IND60568960520221122195424.0170522s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056896052DNAL7 a10.1071/SR162052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Brian R.10aClimatically driven change in soil carbon across a basalt landscape is restricted to non-agricultural land use systems  ap. 376-388.  a2019-12-06  aSoils represent a significant component of the global terrestrial carbon cycle. Historical soil carbon depletion resulting from soil and land management offers an opportunity to store additional carbon to offset greenhouse gas emissions as part of our international response to climate change. However, our ability to reliably measure, estimate and predict soil carbon storage is hindered by a range of sources of variability, not least of which is change through time. In the present study, we assessed temporal changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and its component fractions in response to climate alone and in the absence of land use change at any given site by examining a series of soil monitoring sites across a basalt landscape in north-west New South Wales under a range of land use types over a 3-year period (March–April 2008 and March–April 2011), where a significant rainfall event had occurred in the intervening time (2010). Across the dataset, woodland soils contained the largest carbon concentration (SOC%) and total organic carbon stock (TOCs) compared with other non-wooded land use systems, which themselves were statistically similar. However, larger carbon quantities were restricted largely to the surface (0–10cm) soil layers. Between 2008 and 2011, significant increases in SOC% and TOCs were detected, but again these were restricted to the woodland sites. No change in particulate organic carbon (POC) was detected between the two sampling times, but both humic organic carbon (HOC) and resistant organic carbon (ROC) increased in woodland soils between the two sampling times. Increased HOC we attribute to microbial processing of soil carbon following the 2010–11 rainfall event. However, we suggest that increased ROC results from limitations in mid-infrared calibration datasets and estimations. We conclude that the quantity of soil carbon and its component fractions is, indeed, driven by climatic factors, but that these effects are moderated by aboveground land use and SOC inputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3atemporal variation 3awoodland soils 3asoil organic carbon 3amonitoring 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alandscapes 3adata collection 3aclimate change 3acarbon sinks 3acarbon sequestration 3aparticulate organic carbon 3arain 3awoodlands 3abasalt 3aclimatic factors 3aNew South Wales 0acarbon1 aKing, Dacre1 aGrowns, Ivor1 aVeeragathipillai, Manoharan0 tSoil research.g2017, v. 55, no. 4 p.376-388dCSIRO Publishingx1838-675X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR162053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009600166300001600262520076200278592002801040650002101068650001901089650001901108650001901127650001601146650001501162650001601177650002101193700001501214700001701229700001701246700001701263700002001280773011501300856008101415852000901496655001201505IND50089572920221119121144.0140728e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008957292DNAL7 a10.1007/s12257-013-0556-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Junhyoung10aLabel-free measurement of cell viability via counting cells attached on affinity substrates  ap. 257-261.  aThe commonly used trypan blue dye exclusion method and other modified cell viability methods, such as fluorescein dye and tetrazolium dye exclusion, artificially introduce toxic chemicals to cells and, thus, alter cellular organelles when measuring cell viability.

An important concern is when elephants avoid lying down, due to degenerative joint and foot disease, social structure, or stressful environmental changes. Inability or unwillingness to lie down for resting is an important welfare issue, as it may impair sleep. We emphasize the importance of satisfying rest in elephants by reviewing the literature on resting behavior in elephants (Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus) as well as the documentation of four cases from European zoos and our own direct observations in a zoo group of four female African elephants during 12 entire days. The common denominator in the case reports is the occurrence of a falling bout out of a standing position subsequently to a cessation of lying rest for different periods of time. Although well‐known in horses as “episodic collapse” or “excessive drowsiness,” this syndrome has not been described in elephants before. To enable its detection, we recommend nocturnal video monitoring for elephant‐keeping institutions. The literature evaluation as well as own observational data suggest an inverse relationship between lying rest and standing rest. Preventative measures consist of enclosure modifications that facilitate lying rest (e.g., sand hills) or standing rest in a leaning position as a substitute. Anecdotal observations suggest that the provision of appropriate horizontal environmental structures may encourage safe, sleep‐conducive standing rest. We provide drawings on how to install such structures. Effects of providing such structures should be evaluated in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephas maximus 3aLoxodonta africana 3acase studies 3afemales 3afoot diseases 3ahorses 3amonitoring 3aobservational studies 3asleep 3asocial structure 3azoos1 aHoby, Stefan1 aWenker, Christian1 aHård, Therese1 aScholz, Robert1 aClauss, Marcus1 aHatt, Jean‐Michel0 tZoo biology.g2018 May, v. 37, no. 3 p.133-145dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl34050x0733-31887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/zoo.214063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01434naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245006400163300001600227506002800243520046500271592002800736506003700764653001900801653006300820700001800883773016700901856007901068852000901147655001201156IND60774916320221207045858.0171205e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077491632DNAL7 a10.19113/sdufbed.968282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAKYAR, Handan 10aGenelleştirilmiş Fibonacci Çizgelerin Bazı Özellikleri  ap. 661-666.  aResource is Open Access  aBu çalışmada $k$. dereceden genelleştirilmiş Fibonacci çizgelerin kenar sayısı, düzlemselliği, çapı, yarıçapı, merkezi, kalınlığı ve çevresi gibi çeşitli özellikleri incelenmiş ve genelleştirilmiş Fibonacci çizgelerin kromatik polinomları yardımıyla kromatik sayıları ve kromatik indeksleri hesaplanmıştır.

To simultaneously obtain satisfactory ignition and flame-propagation performance, a novel air-assistant design is proposed for the cavity-strut based combustor. Furthermore, comparison experiments are conducted under ambient pressure to investigate the influence of air-assistant on combustor characteristics. The discrepancies are experimentally explored in terms of lean ignition, blowout, and combustion characteristics in three cavity-based combustors accompanied with numerical flow fields. The results indicate that the air-assistant design can widen the ignitable space for ignition, extend the flammable Mach number, and decrease the lean ignition and blowout fuel/air ratio by 18.6% and 17.9% respectively. The air-assistant method can also accelerate the kernel generation and flamelet growth and suppress the flame quenching in the cavity-strut structure, which enhances the flame stability in either strut-stabilizing or cavity-stabilizing mechanism. The introduction of air-assistant regulates the flame structure and eventually increases the temperature rise of combustor by 250–350 K within the full range of operating fuel/air ratio. Moreover, the temperature distribution altered by air-assisting is more suitable for engineering combustors with higher requirements on circumferential flame propagation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient pressure 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aseeds 3atemperature 0aAir-assistant design 0aIgnition 0aFlame-holding 0aFlame-propagation 0aCavity 0aStrut1 aFan, Yuxin1 aWu, Weiqiu1 aZhao, Shilong0 tApplied energy.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 283 p.116307-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1163073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245007200175300001600247520160400263592002801867650000801895650001501903650001501918650001501933650001301948650001301961650001701974653001601991653000802007653002702015653003802042700003002080700002402110700002202134773013402156856008602290852000902376655001202385IND60552871220221122065502.0161021e20150420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055287122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Lima, Sandro V.12aA dielectric study of interpolymer complexes of polyaniline and DNA  ap. 139-147.  aWhen positively charged conjugated polymer chains are jointly dispersed with (single-stranded or double stranded) DNA chains in solvents of low polarity, complex hybrid structures can result. Interpolymer complexes (IC) can be formed due to the mutual Coulomb interactions between the positive charges in the doped conjugated polymer and the negatively charged phosphate groups along the external ridge of the nucleotide chains. In fact, some of these IC have been reported as potential candidates for several biotechnological applications as, for instance, the development of reliable methods for determining the precise concentration of DNA, a still acute necessity for a number of applications. In this work, we measure the dielectric response of polyaniline/DNA complexes as a convenient procedure to investigate the dominating mechanisms involved in their process of aggregation when dispersed in chloroform. As the ratio of concentrations [PANI]/[DNA] is progressively increased, the corresponding charge transfer resistance varies in a characteristic way, according to the nature of the microscopic reactions taking place in the solution. In fact, the patterns of variation of the charge transfer resistance and optical absorbance of the solution corresponding to the polaron band transition are quite similar, but exhibiting opposite trends. We take this as strong evidence that the electrical characterization of such IC systems represents an alternative method to conventional spectroscopic techniques for investigating the dominant interaction mechanisms DNA and PANI chains in solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabsorbance 3achloroform 3aphosphates 3apolymers 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 0aPolyaniline 0aDNA 0aInterpolymer complexes 0aElectrical impedance spectroscopy1 ade Oliveira, Helinando P.1 aAndrade, Cesar A.S.1 ade Melo, Celso P.0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Apr. 20, v. 471 p.139-147dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001800147245010800165300001800273500000900291520160700300592002801907650001701935650001601952650001301968650001401981650001601995650002002011650001402031650002302045650002502068650001902093650002802112650001702140650002202157650001202179650001102191650001402202700002002216700002502236773012302261852000902384856008402393655001202477IND4399079620221119194101.0191228e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439907962DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2007.03.01302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qing-Fu10aCytogenetic Studies on Diploid and Autotetraploid Common Buckwheat and Their Autotriploid and Trisomics  ap. 2340-2345.  aepub  aCrossing autotetraploid plants with diploid parent is an efficient way to produce autotriploid and trisomics. Comparative studies on cytogenetics and pollen fertility in diploid and autotetraploid common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) and their autotriploid hybrids and trisomics were conducted. Observation of meiosis metaphase I of pollen mother cells showed that the average configurations of chromosome pairing in the autotetraploid cultivar Emka, its inbreeding line Emka-1, and autotriploid hybrids were 0.67I + 11.60II + 0.32 III + 1.79IV, 0.71I + 7.42II + 1.19 III + 3.22IV, and 4.71I + 4.71II + 3.29III, respectively. The average numbers of micronuclei in telophase II cells in the diploid cultivar Siva, autotetraploids Emka and Emka-1, and the autotriploid hybrids were 0.03, 0.09, 0.20, and 0.86, respectively. Siva had the highest pollen fertility (98.89%), followed by the autotetraploids Emka and Emka-1 (95.33 and 93.33%); the autotriploid hybrids had the lowest (31.28%). When autotriploid hybrids were backcrossed with diploid cultivar Sobano, 27.72% of the flowers pollinated yielded shriveled dead seeds, and only 3.08% yielded normal seeds. Of the 34 achenes of the autotriploid hybrids, 6 were double trisomics (2n + 2), 23 trisomics (2n + 1) and 5 diploids (2n). The segregation of short-style (Ss) and long-style (ss) plants in backcrossing progenies of trisomics showed that the S gene of common buckwheat was located on chromosome 4E. The common buckwheat trisomic lines produced in this study will become an important tool for common buckwheat genetics and breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3abackcrossing 3apollination 3adiploidy 3atriploidy 3atetraploidy 3aplant fertility 3atrisomics 3achromosome pairing 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aautopolyploidy 3aplant genetic resources 3acell nucleus 3aseed productivity 3ameiosis 3apollen 3abuckwheat1 aHsam, Sai L.

This study has investigated the trafficking properties of this receptor when stably expressed by HEK-293 cells. As previously reported, cell surface CB2 rapidly internalized upon exposure to agonist. Direct evidence of CB2 recycling was observed upon competitive removal of the stimulating agonist by inverse agonist. CB2 also underwent slow constitutive internalization when agonist was absent and was up-regulated in the presence of inverse agonist. Co-expression of CB2 and dominant negative Rab5 resulted in a significantly reduced capacity for receptors to internalize with no effect on recycling of the internalized receptors. Conversely, co-expression with dominant negative Rab11 did not alter the ability of CB2 to internalize but did impair their ability to return to the cell surface. Co-expression of wild-type, dominant negative or constitutively active Rab4 with CB2 did not alter basal surface expression, extent of internalization, or extent of recycling. These results suggest that Rab5 is involved in CB2 endocytosis and that internalized receptors are recycled via a Rab11 associated pathway rather than the rapid Rab4 associated pathway. This report provides the first comprehensive description of CB2 internalization and recycling to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acannabinoids 3aendocytosis 3aimmune system 3aimmunomodulation 3areceptors1 aGoodfellow, Catherine E.1 aDragunow, Mike1 aGlass, Michelle0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

By using 2-20 array lanes for parallel separation, the sensitivity of the MCE-ICP-MS system was proportionally improved by 2-20 folds. No significantly adverse effect of parallel separation on column efficiency and resolution was observed. Rapid separation of Hg2+ and methylmercuric (MeHg) ion within 36s under an electric field of 800Vcm−1 was achieved in the 2-cm twenty-channels with a background electrolyte of 5mmolL−1 borate buffer (pH 9.2). Detection limits of Hg2+ and MeHg by the proposed system were decreased to 6.8–7.1ngL−1. Good agreement between determined values and certified values of a certified reference fish was obtained with recoveries ranged between 94–98%. All results prove its advantages including high sensitivity, high efficiency and low operation cost, which are beneficial to routine analysis of metal speciation in environmental, biological and food fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3abuffers 3amercury 3achromatography 3apH 3amethylmercury compounds 3afish 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aelectrophoresis 3aborates 0aMercury speciation 0aInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aSensitivity enhancement 0aelectrolytes 0aMicrochip electrophoresis 0aParallel separation1 aLiu, Jinhua1 aXu, Zigang1 aWang, Yuanchao1 aYe Lian, Meiying,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Aug. 26, v. 1461 p.198-204dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2016.07.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01638naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007900155300001800234520062800252592002800880650001500908650002300923650001000946650001700956650000900973650000900982650001300991650001901004700001901023700001701042700001601059773013001075856007401205852000901279655001201288IND60666687520221119215320.0190917e20190912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066668752DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay01483g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wenbo10aDetection of Fe³⁺ using a novel hyperbranched polymeric spectral sensor  ap. 4456-4463.  aFe³⁺ was efficiently detected using a novel turn-on hyperbranched polymeric spectral sensor based on the linear relationship between the absorbance at 562 nm (or the fluorescence intensity at 578 nm) of the sensor–Fe³⁺ solution and the Fe³⁺ concentration, as well as the visible (from colorless to pink) and fluorescence (from dark to orange-red) color changes.

Deployment on apartment buildings remains low, even in Australia with its world-leading residential photovoltaic penetration, or in countries subject to specific enabling legislation, such as Austria. We present a comparative study of photovoltaic system deployment on multi-occupancy residential buildings in these two countries, examining the impact of their distinct climates, financial settings, heating and cooling technologies and regulatory environments. A mixed-integer linear optimisation model is used to compare cost-optimal photovoltaic system size and achievable cost savings for a nine-apartment building. We find that Australia’s higher insolation and lower investment costs drive higher optimal system size and bill savings, but lower electricity tariffs and regulatory barriers constrain deployment. By contrast, European enabling legislation has not yet achieved success in overcoming Austria’s higher investment costs and lower solar exposure, partly due to significant administrative hurdles. Our findings point to possible country-specific policy approaches to increase deployment in this important sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3amodels 3aprofitability 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aAustralia 3aAustria 0aPhotovoltaics 0aApartment buildings 0aPV sharing 0aEnergy communities 0aResidential electricity 0aMixed integer linear optimisation 0aSelf-consumption 0aAustria 0aAustralia1 aRoberts, Mike B.1 aAuer, H.q(Hans),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9111-99411 aBruce, Anna1 aMacGill, Iain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9587-68350 tApplied energy.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 283 p.116309-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1163093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01113naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009700162300002000259520029000279592002800569650001100597650002600608700001800634773012400652856007400776852000900850655001200859IND60640786620221119060051.0190505e20160628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064078662DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra06828f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi, Fereshteh10aSynthesis of benzoimidazoquinazolines by cobalt-catalyzed isocyanide insertion–cyclization  ap. 61955-61958.  aAn efficient and practical protocol for the synthesis of benzoimidazoquinazoline amines in moderate to good yields by the reaction of isocyanides and benzo[d]imidazol-anilines via a cobalt-catalyzed isocyanide insertion cyclization reaction into the two N–H active bonds is reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3acyclization reactions1 aBazgir, Ayoob0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 28, v. 6, no. 66 p.61955-61958dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra06828f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014400167300001400311520143700325592002801762650001501790650001801805650001001823650002201833650001801855651001501873700001501888700001601903700002001919700002801939773008701967856008402054852000902138655001202147IND60085233920221122133556.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008523392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2012.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Henglong10aSampling sufficiency for analyzing taxonomic relatedness of periphytic ciliate communities using an artificial substratum in coastal waters  ap. 22-27.  aTaxonomic relatedness measures of ciliated protozoan communities have successively been used as useful indicators for assessing water quality in marine ecosystems with a number of desirable properties. Sampling sufficiency for analyzing taxonomic relatedness indices of periphytic ciliate communities was studied in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China, from May to June, 2010. Samples were collected at two depths of 1m and 3m using an artificial substratum (glass slides), and were analyzed based on different sampling strategies (slide replicates). For achieving a dissimilarity of <10%, more slide replicates were required with shortening community ages: 3–10 slide replicates were sufficient for the young (1–7days) communities while 2–4 slide replicates were for the mature (10–28days). The standard errors of four taxonomic relatedness indices due to the sample sizes were increased only in the young communities with shortening colonization times. For achieving a standard error of <10%, 1 slide replicate was generally sufficient for the mature communities, whereas 4–10 were required for the young. These findings suggested that low slide replicates were required for measuring taxonomic relatedness indices compared to analyzing the community patterns, and that these indices were more sensitive to the sample sizes of a young community than a mature one of periphytic ciliates in marine ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3acoastal water 3aglass 3amarine ecosystems 3awater quality 3aYellow Sea1 aZhang, Wei1 aJiang, Yong1 aZhu, Mingzhuang1 aAl-Rasheid, Khaled A.S.0 tJournal of sea research.g2012 Aug., v. 72 p.22-27dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2012.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245007100161300001600232520079500248592002801043650001801071650000901089650001301098650001701111773011201128856007701240852000901317655001201326IND60120935920221120024542.0150212e199809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012093592DNAL7 a10.1007/s0001800502172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, G. M.10aIntroduction: genetic determinants of mid- and late-life dementias  ap. 895-896.  aWe introduce a series of papers dealing with genetic aspects of a subset of dementias of mid-life and late-life in order to illustrate four principles. First, there appear to be many genetic loci with the potential to modulate susceptibility to such dementias. Second, most of those so far discovered are autosomal dominants and none are autosomal recessives. Third, the autosomal dominant mutations are individually rare.

Fourth, despite their rarity, they may inform us about the pathogenesis of more common late-life dementias, notably dementias of the Alzheimer type, which have polygenic determinants.

Amounts of ash and char are used to roughly evaluate the impacts of a fire on nutrient cycling and ecosystem recovery. Numerous studies have suggested that fire severity can be assessed by measuring changes in ash characteristics. Traditional methods to determine fire severity are based on in situ observations, and visual approximation of changes in the forest floor and soil which are both laborious and subjective. These measures primarily reflect the level of consumption of organic layers, the deposition of ash, particularly its depth and color, and fire-induced changes in the soil. Recent studies suggested adding remote sensing techniques to the field observations and using machine learning and spectral indices to assess the effects of fires on ecosystems. While index thresholding can be easily implemented, its effectiveness over large areas is limited to pattern coverage of forest type and fire regimes. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, allow multivariate classifications, but learning is complex and time-consuming when analyzing space-time series. Therefore, there is currently no consensus regarding a quantitative index of fire severity. Considering that wildfires play a major role in controlling forest carbon storage and cycling in fire-suppressed forests, this study examines the use of low-cost multispectral imagery across visible and near-infrared regions collected by unmanned aerial systems to determine fire severity according to the color and chemical properties of vegetation ash. The use of multispectral imagery data might reduce the lack of precision that is part of manual color matching and produce a vast and accurate spatio-temporal severity map. The suggested severity map is based on spectral information used to evaluate chemical/mineralogical changes by deep learning algorithms. These methods quantify total carbon content and assess the corresponding fire intensity that is required to form a particular residue. By designing three learning algorithms (PLS-DA, ANN, and 1-D CNN) for two datasets (RGB images and Munsell color versus Unmanned Aerial System (UAS)-based multispectral imagery) the multispectral prediction results were excellent. Therefore, deep network-based near-infrared remote sensing technology has the potential to become an alternative reliable method to assess fire severity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acolor 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afire intensity 3afire severity 3aforest litter 3aforest types 3amultispectral imagery 3anear infrared photography 3aprediction 3aspace and time 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aHamzi, Seham 1 aRoberts, Dar 1 aIchoku, Charles 1 aShtober-Zisu, Nurit 1 aWittenberg, Lea 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 29, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141536323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245009600161300001600257520096700273592002801240650001001268650002601278650001801304650001101322650002401333650001401357650001801371650001301389650001601402650001101418650001401429650002401443650002601467700001601493700001801509773012401527856007701651852000901728655001201737IND60638189920221122133112.0190426e199811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063818992DNAL7 a10.1007/s0029900505482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYantcheva, A.10aDirect somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration of carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.)  ap. 148-153.  aConditions for efficient direct somatic embryogenesis and plant regeneration of leaf explants from carnation cultivars Lena (SIM group) and Bulgarian spray cultivars Nasslada, Yanita, Regina and Line 84 were established. Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium supplemented with 1 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 0.2 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine was used for direct induction of embryoids without an additional callus phase. The first globular structures were observed after 20 days of cultivation. Their further development to the torpedo stage was correlated with the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000). Somatic embryo maturation was promoted by casein hydrolysate (1000 mg/l) in MS liquid media. The percentage conversion of embryos and polyembryos to whole plants varied between 10 and 75% among studied cultivars. Plantlets regenerated by this procedure were morphologically identical to the donor material and developed normally in a greenhouse.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3abenzyladenine 3acallus 3acasein hydrolysates 3acultivars 3aculture media 3aexplants 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3aplantlets 3apolyethylene glycol 3asomatic embryogenesis1 aVlahova, M.1 aAtanassov, A.0 tPlant cell reports.g1998 Nov., v. 18, no. 1-2 p.148-153dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33565x0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0029900505483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012900169300001400298506002800312520093000340592002801270506003701298650001101335650000901346650001601355650001501371650001301386650001801399650002001417650001201437650002001449653002301469653004001492653001501532653002301547653002701570700002401597700002601621773013301647856008801780852000901868655001201877IND60774916620221207045857.0181029e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077491662DNAL7 a10.20961/carakatani.v20i2.205142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRianto, Edy10aPenampilan Produksi Sapi Peranakan Ongole dan Sapi Peranakan Ongole x Limousin yang mendapat Pakan Rumput Raja dan Ampas Bir  ap. 91-97.  aResource is Open Access  aAn experiment was carried out to compare the performance of Grade Ongole (GO) and its crossing with Limousin (GL) bulls fed King Grass and brewery by-product. Four GO (weighed: 198.50 ± 38.04 kg) and four GL bulls (weighed: 248.84 ± 36,39 kg) were fed king grass and brewery by-product with ratio of 50:50.

Evaluating a captive breeding and release program for the recovery of an endangered rodent  ap. 198-205.  aThe critical question for the success of all captive breeding and release programs (CBRPs) is the same: will the benefit of augmenting or reestablishing a population with captive animals outweigh the loss of taking individuals from the wild? Yet, few studies have simultaneously evaluated the impact of removal of animals for captive breeding on the source population and the potential contribution of the released animals to the augmented populations. We used the endangered Key Largo woodrat (Neotoma floridana smalli, KLWR) as a model system to simultaneously examine the effect of animal removal, captive breeding, and reintroduction on the dynamics and persistence of a wild population. We used mark-recapture and telemetry data, as well as zoo records from a recent CBRP for the endangered KLWR to parameterize a matrix population model and to simulate the response of the KLWR population to alternative captive breeding and release strategies. Our results suggest that a CBRP as practiced previously would not contribute to KLWR recovery; instead, removal of wild KLWR for captive breeding could harm the population. Captive breeding programs will not contribute to the recovery of KLWR unless survival of released animals and breeding success of captive individuals are improved. Our study provides a framework for simultaneous consideration of animal removal from the wild, breeding success in captivity and survival of released animals for a comprehensive evaluation of captive breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotoma 3aanimal breeding 3acaptive animals 3anatural resources conservation 3areproductive success 3arodents 3asimulation models 3atelemetry 3azoos 0aKey Largo woodrat 0aCaptive breeding 0aRelease 0aMatrix population model 0aPopulation viability analysis 0aProbability of extinction and quasi-extinction1 aHostetler, Jeffrey A.1 aOli, Madan K.0 tBiological conservation.g2014 Jan., v. 169 p.198-205dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.11.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012200170300001600292520134100308592002801649650001201677650001101689650002001700650002401720650001301744650002401757650001501781650001901796650001501815650001801830650001901848650001901867650001501886650002001901650002101921653002701942653002101969653002001990653001702010653002302027653002002050700002502070700002602095700001602121700001802137773013402155856008602289852000902375655001202384IND60552871420221122005555.0161021e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055287142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousef, Ayman10aCatalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane for hydrogen generation using Cu(0) nanoparticles supported on TiO2 nanofibers  ap. 194-201.  aCu(0) nanoparticles supported on TiO2 nanofibers (Cu-decorated TiO2 NFs) are introduced as an effective photocatalyst for hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB) under solar radiation. The introduced Cu-decorated TiO2 NFs were prepared using electrospinning followed by hydrothermal treatment as a novel route for preparation of metal-decorated metal oxide nanofibers. Interestingly, the utilized physicochemical characterizations showed that the prepared nanocatalyst composed of core TiO2 NFs decorated by Cu(0) NPs. A strong photocatalytic activity for catalytic hydrolysis of AB under solar radiation using the introduced nanocatalysts was observed. The results reveal that high rate of hydrogen release from ammonia borane (2.75 equivalent moles) as compared to undecorated TiO2 NFs (1.6 equivalent moles) and pristine Cu NPs (1.2 equivalent moles). The obtained high hydrogen production, in case of the introduced Cu-decorated TiO2 NFs, is attributed to the dual effect of counter parts. Furthermore, the introduced nanofibers could be utilized for three successive cycles with the same efficiency which reflects high stability. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of the introduced NFs was further confirmed by photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under solar radiation; complete removal was observed after 120min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acopper 3adehydrogenation 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3amethylene blue 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide 0aAmmonia borane complex 0aHydrogen release 0aElectrospinning 0aHydrothermal 0aTitania nanofibers 0aMetallic copper1 aBarakat, Nasser A.M.1 aEL-Newehy, Mohamed H.1 aAhmed, M.M.1 aKim, Hak Yong0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 470 p.194-201dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011000166300001800276520122400294592002801518650002501546650001701571650003601588650002101624650001101645650000901656650001501665650001201680650001301692650002201705650002201727700002201749700002501771700002401796700002501820773010201845856007501947852000902022655001202031IND60531321220221116163732.0160723e20130226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053132122DNAL7 a10.1021/bi300982v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehera, Rabindra Kumar10aThermodynamic Effects of the Alteration of the Axial Ligand on the Unfolding of Thermostable Cytochrome c  ap. 1373-1384.  aThe role the axial methionine plays in the conformational properties and thermostability of the heme active site has been investigated with the help of site-specific mutations at the axial Met69 position with His (M69H) and Ala (M69A) in thermostable cytochrome c₅₅₂ from Thermus thermophilus. Detailed circular dichroism, direct electrochemistry, and other spectroscopic studies have been employed to investigate the thermally induced and GdnHCl-induced unfolding properties of the heme active site of the wild type and the mutants of cytochrome c₅₅₂. We observed an unusually high thermodynamic and thermal stability of the M69A mutant compared to that of wild-type cytochrome c₅₅₂. However, the M69H mutant exhibited a slightly lower unfolding free energy compared to that of the wild-type protein. The high conformational stability of the M69A mutant was attributed to the presence of residual structure in the unfolded state as well as to the altered conformation in the folded state of this mutant of cytochrome c₅₅₂. This study thus supports the view that apart from the folded state, the unfolded state of a protein may also make a significant contribution to the stability of a protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermus thermophilus 3aactive sites 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aheme 3amethionine 3amutants 3amutation 3aspectral analysis 3athermal stability1 aNakajima, Hiroshi1 aRajbongshi, Jitumani1 aWatanabe, Yoshihito1 aMazumdar, Shyamalava0 tBiochemistry.g2013 Feb. 26, v. 52, no. 8 p.1373-1384dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi300982v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013100168300001800299520142900317592002801746650001401774650001201788650002601800650002201826650003701848650005101885650002301936650001401959650001301973650002101986650002402007650003202031700001502063700001502078700001802093773013102111856008402242990002302326852000902349655001202358IND60090035920221122061826.0141110e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009003592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Tae Gyu10aApoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 is an intracellular inducer of p38 MAPK-mediated myogenic signalling in cardiac myoblasts  ap. 1412-1421.  aMyogenic differentiation is an essential process for the myogenesis in response to various extracellular stimuli. p38 MAPK is a core signalling molecule in myogenic differentiation. The activation of p38 MAPK is required for myogenic differentiation; however, the mechanism for this activation remains undefined. ASK1 is a member of the MAP3K family that activates both JNK and p38 MAPK pathways in response to an array of stresses such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and calcium influx. Here, we reported that TNFα was significantly released from H9c2 cardiac myoblast in differentiation medium. Furthermore, the oxidant H₂O₂ acted as a messenger in the TNFα signalling pathway to disrupt the complex of ASK1–Trx, which was followed by the activation of ASK1 in cardiac myogenic differentiation. Subsequently, the activated ASK1 stimulated MKK3/6–p38MAPK signalling cascade to induce specific myogenic differentiation. In addition, exogenous TNFα added to the medium at physiological levels enhanced the ASK1–p38 MAPK signalling pathway through the increased generation of H₂O₂. Interestingly, inhibition of p38 MAPK abrogated the production of H₂O₂, suggesting that there might be a positive feedback loop in the myogenic–redox signalling pathway. These results indicate that ASK1 is a new intracellular regulator of activation of the p38 MAPK in cardiac myogenic differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3amuscle development 3amyoblasts 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3asignal transduction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aLee, Jisun1 aHa, Joohun1 aKim, Sung Soo0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

The groupings determine the charge of the pectin and the gelation mechanism. However, not as yet extensively studied is the impact on gelation of the distribution of the charges as characterized by an absolute degree of blockiness (DBabs). The aim of this study was to characterize rheologically the acid gelation of a pectin with a high DBabs and a degree of methyl esterification of ∼37%, in the absence and presence of monovalent ions. The results obtained suggest that a pectin with a blocky charge distribution at pH conditions close to or below the pKa exhibits weak gel-like properties at intermediate frequencies, despite the absence of a permanent network structure. The addition of monovalent ions changed the rheological behavior to resemble that of a strong gel whose properties depended on the type and concentration of the ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aesterification 3agelation 3agels 3aions 3apH 3apectins 3arheological properties 3arheology 0aFine structure 0aAcid gelation 0aBlocky pectin 0aRandom pectin 0aWeak gels 0aEntangled solution1 aSchuster, Erich1 aGoh, Suk Meng0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Nov. 26, v. 113 p.336-343dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.06.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009600158300001800254520109200272592002801364650001201392650001701404650002601421650001701447650001301464650000901477650001501486650001901501650001101520650000901531650004401540650001101584651001601595700002101611700002401632700001401656700002501670700002001695700002101715773013201736856007501868852000901943655001201952IND60538485420221120185344.0160815e20120314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053848542DNAL7 a10.1021/ja212116q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamamoto, Yuka10aBrevisulcenal-F: A Polycyclic Ether Toxin Associated with Massive Fish-kills in New Zealand  ap. 4963-4968.  aA novel marine toxin, brevisulcenal-F (KBT-F, from karenia brevisulcata toxin) was isolated from the dinoflagellate Karenia brevisulcata. A red tide of K. brevisulcata in Wellington Harbour, New Zealand, in 1998 was extremely toxic to fish and marine invertebrates and also caused respiratory distress in harbor bystanders. An extract of K. brevisulcata showed potent mouse lethality and cytotoxicity, and laboratory cultures of K. brevisulcata produced a range of novel lipid-soluble toxins. A lipid soluble toxin, KBT-F, was isolated from bulk cultures by using various column chromatographies. Chemical investigations showed that KBT-F has the molecular formula C₁₀₇H₁₆₀O₃₈ and a complex polycyclic ether nature. NMR and MS/MS analyses revealed the complete structure for KBT-F, which is characterized by a ladder-frame polyether scaffold, a 2-methylbut-2-enal terminus, and an unusual substituted dihydrofuran at the other terminus. The main section of the molecule has 17 contiguous 6- and 7-membered ether rings. The LD₅₀ (mouse i.p.) for KBT-F was 0.032 mg/kg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKarenia 3aalgal blooms 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acytotoxicity 3adistress 3afish 3afish kills 3alethal dose 50 3alipids 3amice 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atoxins 3aNew Zealand1 aTachibana, Kazuo1 aHolland, Patrick

Zero tillage (ZT) significantly reduced the population of Phalaris minor and dry matter of grassy weeds as compared to conventional tillage (CT) and furrow irrigated raised bed system (FIRBS), however, density and dry matter of broad-leaved weeds was higher under ZT that under CT and FIRBS. Grasses were predominant under FIRBS as compared to CT. Cultivar ‘PDW 291’ had less density and dry weight of weeds having superior yield attributes and produced significantly higher grain yield over ‘WH 896’ and ‘WH 912’. Pre-emergence application of pendimethalin (1.5 kg/ha) reduced the density and dry matter accumulation by grassy as well as broad-leaved weeds effectively and increased the wheat grain yield by 25% over weedy check.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhalaris minor 3aconventional tillage 3acultivars 3adry matter accumulation 3adurum wheat 3afield experimentation 3afurrows 3agrain yield 3ano-tillage 3apendimethalin 3apreemergent weed control 3araised beds 0aResource conservation techniques 0aWeeds 0aYield1 aBanga, R.S.1 aYadav, Ashok0 tIndian journal of weed science.g2013, v. 45, no. 2 p.93-98dIndian Society of Weed SciencewJournal:2005x0974-81647nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245009900162520116600261592002801427650001501455650001101470650001301481650001601494700001301510700002101523700001901544700001401563773015901577856007501736852000901811655001201820IND60660491520221118205139.0190823e20190814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066049152DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi80803602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Sheng’en 10aMultifaceted Geometric Assessment towards Simplified Urban Surfaces Built by 3D Reconstruction  aLarge-scale three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from multi-view images is used to generate 3D mesh surfaces, which are usually built for urban areas and are widely applied in many research hotspots, such as smart cities. Their simplification is a significant step for 3D roaming, pattern recognition, and other research fields. The simplification quality has been assessed in several studies. On the one hand, almost all studies on surface simplification have measured simplification errors using the surface comparison tool Metro, which does not preserve sufficient detail. On the other hand, the reconstruction precision of urban surfaces varies as a result of homogeneity or heterogeneity. Therefore, it is difficult to assess simplification quality without surface classification. These difficulties are addressed in this study by first classifying urban surfaces into planar surfaces, detailed surfaces, and urban frameworks according to the simplification errors of different types of surfaces and then measuring these errors after sampling. A series of assessment indexes are also provided to contribute to the advancement of simplification algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acities 3ageometry 3aurban areas1 aYi, Hui 1 aChen, Xiangning 1 aWang, Decheng 1 aJin, Wei 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2019 Aug. 14, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi80803603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013900168300001600307520128000323592002801603650001301631650002101644650001901665650001701684650002101701650001901722650001101741650002101752650002201773650001201795650001601807650001501823650001001838650001501848653001501863653001601878653001501894653001601909653001601925653001301941653001201954653001401966653001301980653001901993653001902012653000802031653000902039653001102048653000802059653001002067653001202077653000802089653001002097653000802107653000802115653000702123653000702130653000802137653000902145700001902154700002202173700006302195700002202258700006302280700002002343773011202363856008202475852000902557655001202566IND60616066620221119170923.0190401e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061606662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2018.09.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraeyman, Sophie10aComparative in vitro cytotoxicity of the emerging Fusarium mycotoxins beauvericin and enniatins to porcine intestinal epithelial cells  ap. 566-572.  aThe emerging Fusarium mycotoxins beauvericin (BEA) and enniatin (ENN) A, ENN A1, ENN B and ENN B1 gain increasing interest due to their highly prevalent contamination of cereals and cereal products. After oral intake, the gastro-intestinal tract is the first possible site of interaction. In the present in vitro study, the relative cytotoxicity of these mycotoxins towards proliferating and differentiated intestinal porcine epithelial cells of the jejunum (IPEC-J2) was evaluated using flow cytometric viability analysis. IPEC-J2 cells showed the highest sensitivity to BEA and ENN A. In proliferating cells, incubation for 24h with 10 μM BEA caused complete disruption, while the viability percentage declined to 32% after 24h of incubation with 10 μM ENN A. ENN A1 and ENN B1 were less cytotoxic with 87% and 93% viable cells after 24h of incubation with 10 μM ENN A1 and B1, respectively. ENN B was the least cytotoxic since incubation at concentrations up to 100 μM resulted in 83% viable proliferating cells. The same trend was observed for differentiated cells. The limited in vitro cytotoxic effect of ENN B on intestinal cells corroborates previous in vivo findings in broiler chicken in which dietary ENN B had minimal effect on intestinal morphometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3abroiler chickens 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aepithelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3agrains 3ain vitro studies 3aintestinal mucosa 3ajejunum 3amorphometry 3amycotoxins 3aswine 3atoxicology 0aEnniatin A 0aEnniatin A1 0aEnniatin B 0aEnniatin B1 0aBeauvericin 0aEmerging 0aIPEC-J2 0aApoptosis 0aNecrosis 0aFlow cytometry 0aAnnexin-V-FITC 0aBEA 0aBrdU 0aCaco-2 0aENN 0aH295R 0aIPEC-J2 0aLOD 0alog P 0aLPO 0aMTT 0aNR 0aPI 0aROS 0aTEER1 aMeyer, Evelyne1 aDevreese, Mathias1 aAntonissen, Gunther1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8832-14981 aDemeyere, Kristel1 aHaesebrouck, Freddy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1709-933X1 aCroubels, Siska0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2018 Nov., v. 121 p.566-572dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2018.09.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245011100132300001500243500001900258520173900277592002802016650001002044650001702054650001302071650001902084650002702103650001202130650002302142650001202165650001902177650001602196650002202212650001602234650001602250650001802266650001302284650001702297650001002314650001002324653001402334653002102348653001502369653001202384700001802396700001202414700002502426773012802451852000902579655001202588IND60716709320221118052852.0201224e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071670932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChander, Navell10aNutrient removal by weeds and crops as affected by herbicide combinations in soybean-wheat cropping system  ap. 99-105.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEight weed control treatments in soybean and three in wheat were evaluated in soybean-wheat cropping system during 2009–10 and 2010–11 at Palampur. Commelina benghalensis followed by Echinochloa colona were the most competitive weeds in soybean. In wheat, Phalaris minor and Avena ludoviciana were the most predominant weeds. Pendimethalin fb chlorimuron reduced dry weight of Aeschynomene, Ageratum, Cyperus, Echinochloa and Panicum significantly over the unweeded check. Isoproturon 1000 g/ha + 2, 4-D 500 g/ha reduced dry weight of Phalaris minor over the weedy check. In soybean, application of pendimethalin fb chlorimuron-ethyl allowed weeds to remove 89.2, 89.1 and 88.9% less N, P and K, respectively as compared to the unweeded check. Application of isoproturon 1000 g/ha+ 2,4-D 500 g/ha reduced N, P and K depletion by weeds by more than 24% over the unweeded check. Application of pendimethalin fb chlorimuron-ethyl resulted in 187.5% higher N and 166.3% higher K uptake by soybean over weedy check. Unchecked weed growth reduced P uptake by 62.4% as compared to pendimethalin fb chlorimuron ethyl. Isoproturon 1000 g/ha + 2,4-D 500 g/ha and isoproturon 750 g/ha + 2,4-D 500 g/ha resulted in significantly higher N, P and K uptake by wheat over unweeded check. Weedy check reduced soybean equivalent yield by 37.4 and 28.8% during 2009 and 2010, respectively. Imazethapyr fb imazethapyr produced higher soybean equivalent yield (3.34 t/ha) during 2009, whereas, pendimethalin fb chlorimuron (3.16 t/ha) was better during 2010.

However, the transcription of the SREBP-1c and HSL genes was decreased by T3. Such T3-mediated alterations were negated by TRα siRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that the binding of TRα to the TR-responsive element (TRE) of the FAS promoter was elevated by T3. In contrast, the ability of TRα to bind to the TRE of the SREBP-1c promoter was decreased by T3. In addition, the binding of SREBP-1c to the SRE of the HSL promoter was lowered by T3. These results indicate that T3 increased the accumulation of intracellular lipids by enhancing the expression of the FAS gene through direct binding of TRα to the FAS promoter and simultaneously lowered the amount of lipolysis via reduced binding of T3-decreased SREBP-1c to the HSL promoter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3achromatin 3agenes 3alipids 3alipolysis 3amice 3aprecipitin tests 3asmall interfering RNA 3athyroid hormone receptors 3atriiodothyronine 0aT3 0aTRα 0aFAS 0aSREBP-1c 0aHSL 0a3T3-L1 0aPPARγ 0aC/EBP 0aSREBP 0aACC 0aFAS 0aTG 0aATGL 0aHSL 0aMGL 0aTH 0aTR 0aTRE 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aqPCR 0aTBP 0aChIP 0aRXR1 aMatsumura, Miki1 aFujimori, Ko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2506-07690 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 431 p.1-11dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245012100179300001400300520157800314592002801892650000901920650001801929650001201947650001501959650001001974650001701984650001102001650001502012651001502027700001902042700002102061700002102082700002102103700003302124700002202157700002002179773010202199856008602301852000902387655001202396IND60087738520221121152611.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008773852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, Roberto A.,10aComparison of methods for the detection of coliphages in recreational water at two California, United States beaches  ap. 73-79.  aMethods for detection of two fecal indicator viruses, F+ and somatic coliphages, were evaluated for application to recreational marine water. Marine water samples were collected during the summer of 2007 in Southern California, United States from transects along Avalon Beach (n=186 samples) and Doheny Beach (n=101 samples). Coliphage detection methods included EPA method 1601 – two-step enrichment (ENR), EPA method 1602 – single agar layer (SAL), and variations of ENR. Variations included comparison of two incubation times (overnight and 5-h incubation) and two final detection steps (lysis zone assay and a rapid latex agglutination assay). A greater number of samples were positive for somatic and F+ coliphages by ENR than by SAL (p<0.01). The standard ENR with overnight incubation and detection by lysis zone assay was the most sensitive method for the detection of F+ and somatic coliphages from marine water, although the method takes up to three days to obtain results. A rapid 5-h enrichment version of ENR also performed well, with more positive samples than SAL, and could be performed in roughly 24h. Latex agglutination-based detection methods require the least amount of time to perform, although the sensitivity was less than lysis zone-based detection methods. Rapid culture-based enrichment of coliphages in marine water may be possible by further optimizing culture-based methods for saline water conditions to generate higher viral titers than currently available, as well as increasing the sensitivity of latex agglutination detection methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aagglutination 3abeaches 3acoliphages 3alatex 3asaline water 3asummer 3aviral load 3aCalifornia1 aLove, David C.1 aStewart, Jill R.1 aTajuba, Julianne1 aKnee, Jacqueline1 aDickerson, Jerold W., JrcJr1 aWebster, Laura F.1 aSobsey, Mark D.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2012 Apr., v. 181, no. 1 p.73-79dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245016500174506002800339520174400367592002802111506003702139650001902176650000802195650002002203650001902223650001102242650001102253650001402264650001002278651001502288653001902303653002702322653002502349653001402374653002502388700001802413773011302431856008902544852000902633655001202642IND60740045820221207092350.0190709s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074004582DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2019.53.3.23292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolitor, Daniel10aClimate change is implicating a two-fold impact on air temperature increase in the ripening period under the conditions of the Luxembourgish grapegrowing region  aResource is Open Access  aAim: Grape (Vitis vinifera L.) phenology is mainly temperature-driven. Consequently, the shift in thermal conditions due to climate change is supposed to have a distinct influence on grape phenology, grape maturity and wine typicity. This study aims to investigate (i) the future phenological development, as well as (ii) the consequences on the temperature conditions in specific phenophases under the conditions of the Luxembourg grapegrowing region. Methods and Results: A budburst model and a phenological model were combined with an ensemble of ten regional climate change projections for Luxembourg. Analyses comparing four 30-year time spans (reference period: 1971-2000; present: 2001-2030; near future: 2031-2060; far future: 2061-2090) demonstrated that each of the 27 phenological stages according to BBCH code is projected to be reached significantly earlier than in the reference period. According to these projections, the length of phenophases at the early stages is not affected, whereas the ripening period length is significantly shortened. The air temperature increase in the ripening period (far future compared to reference period: + 4.6 °C to + 5.3 °C) is projected to be markedly higher than in the annual averages (+ 2.6 °C). Conclusions: Since (i) air temperatures are generally projected to increase in the future and (ii) the ripening period will take place earlier (usually in the warmer parts of the season), climate change is implicating a two-fold impact on air temperature increase in the ripening period. Significance and impact of the study: This two-fold impact potentially threatens the wine typicity of the traditional grapegrowing regions and therefore calls for specific adaptation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3aair 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3agrapes 3amodels 3aphenology 3awines 3aLuxembourg 0aclimate change 0acumulative degree days 0amulti-model ensemble 0aphenology 0aripening temperature1 aJunk, Jürgen0 tOENO One.g2019, v. 53, no. 3dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2019.53.3.23293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245005100176300001400227520099800241592002801239650002401267650001401291650002301305650003401328650000901362650001801371650001801389650001401407650001801421650003101439650001001470650002301480650002201503653001801525653002201543653001901565653003301584653003401617653001101651653001601662653002201678653002001700700002201720773014001742856008501882852000901967655001201976IND60555495920221123044447.0180522e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055549592DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2013.8488342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadhum, Abdul Amir H.10aEdible lipids modification processes: A review  ap. 48-58.  aLipid is the general name given to fats and oils, which are the basic components of cooking oils, shortening, ghee, margarine, and other edible fats.

The chemical properties of the lipids, including degree of saturation, fatty acid chain length, and acylglycerol molecule composition are the basic determinants of physical characteristics such as melting point, cloud point, solid fat content, and thermal behavior. This review will discuss the major lipid modification strategies, hydrogenation, and chemical and enzymatic interesterification, describing the catalysts used mechanisms, kinetics, and impacts on the health-related properties of the final products.

The sampling procedure was repeated every 3h within a timeframe of 48h. All species above a size of 1cm were recorded quantitatively. The analysis of the dataset, consisting of thirteen sampling years, revealed rhythmic abundance fluctuations of one crustacean and two fish species, depending on the time of day. In order to check the accuracy of the results obtained, we further analysed the dataset for short-term effects of continuous trawling at the same track on the abundance of individual species. No direct effect on the abundance of particular species was detected, but the analysis revealed a periodic fluctuation of the mean number of individuals and the mean catch volume.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3adata collection 3afish 3amonitoring 3aNorth Sea1 aTürkay, Michael,0 tJournal of sea research.g2012 Oct., v. 73 p.1-6dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2012.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013500159520181600294592002802110650002602138650001202164650002402176650001002200650001602210700001502226700001802241700001802259700002002277773012002297856007402417852000902491655001202500IND60754425920221121055108.0211023e20211019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075442592DNAL7 a10.3390/w132029332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chengpeng 10aTransient Process of Pumped Storage System Coupling Gas–Liquid Interface: Novel Mathematical Model and Experimental Verification  aThe traditional calculation method for a transient process has high accuracy when the pipeline only contains liquid, but when the pipeline contains both gas and liquid the accuracy is greatly reduced. The coupling characteristics of gas–liquid interface movement in hydraulic transient processes are not clear due to the lack of high-precision mathematical model and experimental verification. This paper proposes a novel mathematical model of a gas–liquid pipeline system in a hydropower station based on Preissman’s implicit difference scheme and the method of characteristics. The solving mechanism of the transient process of gas–liquid movement was developed on the gas–liquid interface tracking method. Subsequently, the models proposed in this paper were applied in two typical scenarios of a gas–liquid transient process in a hydropower system, and their accuracy were verified in a field experiment. The comparison results showed that the novel model could accurately capture the movement of the gas–liquid interface, and the average relative error of the characteristic parameter was about 7.2%. Under the load rejection condition, the change speed of characteristic parameters was positively correlated with the pipeline slope. Under the pump failure after low-head startup condition, the maximum pumping discharge was negatively correlated with startup water level and the maximum reversal discharge and speed were positively correlated with the pump failure water level. Compared with the conventional method, the proposed model has advantages in solving the complex transient process coupling gas–liquid. It has potential value in applications such as the safe operation of hydropower stations, the transient process of water diversion projects and in urban pipe network operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afield experimentation 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3awater 3awater power1 aPeng, Tao 1 aYang, Jiebin 1 aZhao, Zhigao 1 aYang, Jiandong 0 tWater.g2021 Oct. 19, v. 13, no. 20dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132029333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01234naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012300175300001600298520033800314592002800652650001500680650002200695650001700717650001800734700002800752773008300780856008400863852000900947655001200956IND60554000920221123034024.0161023e20150820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055400092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2015.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToledano, Michel B.10aKeeping Oxidative Metabolism on Time: Mitochondria as an Autonomous Redox Pacemaker Animated by H2O2 and Peroxiredoxin  ap. 517-519.  aIn this issue of Molecular Cell, Kil et al.

The relationships between bloom-forming microalgal species and environmental factors were investigated during the study period. The changing environmental conditions (e.g. increasing water transparency and salinity) after seawater transfer to the Golden Horn Estuary stimulated phytoplankton growth with dense algal blooms. Annual average values of Secchi depth, salinity and dissolved oxygen increased in comparison with those in an earlier study in 2009–2010. Nine microalgal species, which consisted of four diatoms, two dinoflagellates, one cryptophycean, one raphidophycean and one euglenophycean, formed the blooms with water discolorations during spring and summer. The species that reached the highest bloom density were Plagioselmis prolonga (62.4 × 10⁶ cells l⁻¹) among crytophyceans, Heterocapsa triquetra (21.8 × 10⁶ cells l⁻¹) among dinoflagellates and Skeletonema marinoi (39 × 10⁶ cells l⁻¹) among diatoms. The abundance of dinoflagellates and phytoflagellates increased particularly in the upper estuary when compared to diatoms and their rapid growth and bloom formation revealed that they have a wide range of tolerance to changing environmental conditions and a strong ability to compete with other species in this study area.  aThe author wishes to thank Dr. Ahsen Yuksek for nutrient data, Dr. Fuat Dursun, scholarship student Turgay Durmus and technician Sezgin Camurcu for their efforts in field and laboratory during this project.

Using a novel method, we show how to exploit satellite data to analyse whether and how a migratory species responds to fluctuating environmental conditions in its wintering area. This is particularly crucial for establishing comprehensive conservation measures for rare species in areas that are threatened by increasing land use and climate change. 2. We use ST data of Eleonora’s falcon Falco eleonorae, a long‐distance migratory raptor that winters in Madagascar, and assess the performance of static species distribution models (SDM) as well as multi‐temporal models. ST data were derived from seven falcons tracked during three consecutive wintering periods and for a total of 2410 bearings, of which 512 locations were used in SDMs. We employed environmental predictors (climate, topography and land cover) with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds (c. 1 km2) to match rigorously filtered ST data with an accuracy of ≤1 km. 3. We first created a model with low temporal but high spatial resolution (half‐year). To predict suitable habitat for each month of the wintering season, we took advantage of the high temporal resolution inherent in ST data and employed temporally corresponding remote sensing data [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 10‐day composites] together with other variables to create monthly models. 4. We show that ST data are suited to build robust and transferable SDMs despite a low number of tracked individuals. Multi‐temporal SMDs further revealed seasonal responses of the study species to changing environmental conditions in its wintering area. 5. Synthesis and applications. We present a transferable approach to predict the potential distribution of organisms as well as their dynamic response to changing environmental conditions. Future conservation management plans could include the prediction of a species’ reaction to changing land‐use practices or climate change based on the methodology proposed here. This would provide an early warning system for the decline of populations wintering in remote areas that underlie strong climatic fluctuations.  aPublisher supplied data 3atopography 3abirds of prey 3amodels 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3afalcons 3avegetation 3aland cover 3aFalco 3aremote sensing 3aland use 3ahabitats 3apopulation dynamics 3aclimate 3aprediction 3aMadagascar 0abearings1 aKalko, Elisabeth K.

Four bioclimatic zones and 9 strata were identified, overlaid with protected areas, and associated with on-going landuse change, i.e. a rapid increase in rubber plantation from 8% to 22% of total area between 2002 and 2010. Significant changes in the areal extent and distribution of all zones and strata are projected, with an averaged mean annual temperature increase ranging from 1.6°C to 2.4°C. By 2050, there are significant geographical shifts in all identified strata, with an average upward shift of 309m of elevation for all strata. On average, more than 75% of Xishuangbanna is predicted to shift to a different zone, with 96% shifting to a different stratum. The area conducive to rubber plantations, currently limited by climatic conditions, expands to nearly 75% of the total area. Climatic change potentially removes the bioclimatic barriers to further expansion of rubber plantations within the area and increases pressure on remaining biodiversity both within and outside of protected areas. The analysis provides the basis for understanding potential impacts of changing bioclimatic conditions on managed and unmanaged ecosystems and landuse change trends, within the context of ongoing rapid change and agricultural expansion in the area. Current efforts to conserve forests, biodiversity and traditional landuse systems require an improved understanding of both the projected climatic changes and the responses of biodiversity and traditional agricultural systems to changing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aland use change 3aplantations 3arubber 3aspatial variation 3atemperature 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aBioclimatic stratification 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aHimalaya1 aTrabucco, Antonio1 aWang, Mingcheng1 aLang, Rong1 aChen, Huafang1 aMetzger, Marc J.1 aSmajgl, Alexander,d1971-1 aBeckschäfer, Philip1 aXu, Jianchu0 tBiological conservation.g2014 Feb., v. 170 p.264-273dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01655naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011100169300001400280520049000294592002800784650001200812650000900824650002600833650001900859650002200878650001100900650001600911700003500927700001800962700002200980700001901002700002301021700002101044773012601065856008101191852000901272655001201281IND60477637520221120220735.0160101e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047763752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-015-0990-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHimsel, Alexandra10aDescribing the sticking phenomenon of aminoplastic resins: dependency on temperature and relative humidity  ap. 31-36.  aA previously developed rheometer-based method to examine undesired cold tack (“sticking”) of aminoplastic resins to machinery parts was further modified to enable climate depending measurements.

The particle spring constant used in such CFD–DEM simulations is commonly much smaller than that for realistic particles used in experiments. For cohesive particles, the predicted flow patterns depend on the value of particle spring stiffness used in the simulations. This dependence can be explained through a simple analysis involving head-on collision of two particles. A modified cohesion model is then proposed and verified through simulations of two-particle collisions. Simulations of gas-fluidization of cohesive particles with this modified cohesion model reveal that the predicted distributions of bubble size are insensitive to particle stiffness for Group A particles. For Group C particles, except for substantially small particle stiffness, the flow patterns are preserved when smaller particle stiffness is used. The proposed model, which was deduced through analysis of binary collisions, provides satisfactory results for fluidization of Group A particles manifesting only mild cohesion; however, similar to the previous finding by Kobayashi et al. [Powder Technol. 248, 143–152 (2013)] with a simpler model, it is less accurate for Group C particles with strong cohesive interactions, where large agglomerates form.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3amodels 3apowders 0aFluidization 0aMultiphase flow 0aNumerical simulation 0aVan der Waals force 0aParticle spring stiffness 0aCFD–DEM simulations1 aÖzel, Ali,1 aSundaresan, Sankaran0 tPowder technology.g2016 Aug., v. 296 p.17-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2015.09.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010900162300001800271520085700289592002801146650002301174650002301197650001701220650000901237650001401246650001701260650001901277650001401296650001701310650002201327650002201349650000701371650001901378700001601397700001701413700002001430700001901450700001901469700001601488700001501504700001501519700001801534773011801552856008101670852000901751655001201760IND60550522020221122201425.0160911e20150320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055052202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b000772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Guangle10aAminobenzofuran-Fused Rhodamine Dyes with Deep-Red to Near-Infrared Emission for Biological Applications  ap. 3170-3175.  aAminobenzofuran-fused rhodamine dyes (AFR dyes) containing an amino group were constructed by an efficient condensation based on 3-coumaranone derivatives. AFR dyes exhibited significantly improved properties, including deep-red and near-infrared emissions, a large Stokes shift, good photostability, and wide pH stability. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium assay experiments show that these AFR dyes are biocompatible for their low cytotoxicity to both A549 and HeLa cells. Cell imaging data reveal that AFR1, AFR1E, and AFR2 are mainly located in the mitochondria, while AFR3 is a lysosome tracker. As far as we know, NIR AFR3 is the longest fluorescent rhodamine derivative containing the amino group. These amino group-containing AFR dyes hold great potential in fluorogenic detection, biomolecule labeling, and cell imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acytotoxicity 3adyes 3aemissions 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3alysosomes 3amitochondria 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3aphotostability1 aLiu, Weimin1 aWu, Jiasheng1 aZhou, Bingjiang1 aTan, Kim Hong,1 aZhang, Hongyan1 aGe, Jiechao1 aWang, Ying1 aXu, Haitao1 aWang, Pengfei0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2015 Mar. 20, v. 80, no. 6 p.3170-3175dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.5b000773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013300167300001600300520149700316592002801813650001501841650002201856650002001878650003001898650002401928650001501952650001801967650002501985650002402010650001402034653003602048653002002084653002702104653004102131700002002172700001702192700002102209700002002230773009702250856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60717414820221121024543.0201223e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071741482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xincheng10aEffects of temperature-dependent property variations on the output capacity prediction of a deep coaxial borehole heat exchanger  ap. 334-349.  aThis study aims to understand the effects of property variations on prediction discrepancies in the output capacity (i.e., output power) of deep coaxial borehole heat exchangers under different operational conditions. These properties include the specific heat and thermal conductivity of the water and the reservoir rock, as well as the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid. Numerical simulation and grey relational analysis were combined to quantify the effects of the property variations on heat convection, heat conduction, and the heat exchanger’s predicted output capacity. The simulation results indicate that the average convective heat transfer coefficient of the water decreases, but the average thermal diffusivity of the rock increases with the extraction of geothermal energy. These changes further lead to an over-prediction of the output capacity. The grey relational analysis reveals that the flow rate and well depth are the principal factors causing over-prediction. The over-prediction increases with the rise of the injection flow rate and well depth. The results also show that the variability of the specific heat and the dynamic viscosity of the water are the two most significant factors causing a discrepancy in the predicted output capacity. The results from this research have highlighted the significance of considering property variations for a more practical prediction of the numerically modeled output capacity of deep coaxial borehole heat exchangers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3ageothermal energy 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3aspecific heat 3athermal conductivity 3athermal diffusivity 3aviscosity 0aCoaxial borehole heat exchanger 0aOutput capacity 0aGrey relational degree 0aConvective heat transfer coefficient1 aBanks, Jonathan1 aGuo, Yunting1 aHuang, Guangping1 aLiu, Wei Victor0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Mar., v. 165 p.334-349dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04138naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100001800192245010600210300001600316506007600332520180800408592002802216506003702244650003402281650002702315650002102342650002602363650002002389650002402409650002702433650002602460650001202486650002602498650001202524650002502536650001702561650002902578650002502607650001702632650001802649650001202667650001502679650001902694650002202713650002202735650001802757650003202775650001302807650001902820650001002839650002502849653000902874653001002883653003002893653001102923653002002934653003902954653001802993700001503011700002803026700002203054700002203076700002103098700002003119700002003139773011403159856008603273852000903359655001203368IND60689906020221207055029.0200708e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068990602DNAL7 a279270902pmid7 aPMC61307502pmcid7 a10.1080/13880209.2016.12384882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerhat, Maria10aAntioxidant, anticholinesterase and antibacterial activities of Stachys guyoniana and Mentha aquatica  ap. 324-329.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aContext: Stachys guyoniana Noë ex. Batt. and Mentha aquatica L. are two Algerian Lamiaceae used in folk medicine. Objective: To investigate their antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antibacterial activities. Material and methods: n-Butanol (BESG), ethyl acetate (EESG) and chloroform (CESG) extracts of S. guyoniana and methanol (MEMA) and chloroform (CEMA) aerial part extracts of M. aquatica and methanol (MERMA) and acetone (AERMA) roots extracts of M. aquatica were evaluated for their antioxidant activity by the β-carotene-linoleic acid, DPPH• and ABTS•⁺ scavenging, CUPRAC and metal chelating assays. The anticholinesterase activity was tested against AChE and BChE. The antibacterial activity was assessed by MICs determination against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella heidelberg, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Morganella morganii strains. Results: In the β-carotene test, the CESG (IC₅₀: 2.3 ± 1.27 μg/mL) exhibited the highest activity. The BESG was the best scavenger of DPPH• (IC₅₀: 2.91 ± 0.14 μg/mL). In the ABTS test, AERMA was the most active (IC₅₀: 4.21 ± 0.28 μg/mL). However, with the CUPRAC, the BESG exhibited the best activity (A₀.₅₀: 0.15 ± 0.05 μg/mL) and was active in metal chelating assay with 48% inhibition at 100 μg/mL. The BESG was the best AChE inhibitor (IC₅₀: 5.78 ± 0.01 μg/mL) however, the AERMA showed the highest BChE inhibitory activity (IC₅₀: 19.23 ± 1.42 μg/mL). The tested extracts exhibited a good antibacterial activity. Conclusion: This study demonstrated good antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antibacterial potential of S. guyoniana and M. aquatica, which fits in well with their use in folk medicine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aEnterobacter aerogenes 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aMentha aquatica 3aMorganella morganii 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella Heidelberg 3aStachys 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aacetone 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aaerial parts 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3abutanol 3achloroform 3acholinesterase 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aethyl acetate 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amethanol 3aplant extracts 3aroots 3atraditional medicine 0aDPPH 0aABTS+ 0aβ-carotene/linoleic acid 0aCUPRAC 0ametal chelating 0acholinesterase inhibitory activity 0aagar dilution1 aErol, Ebru1 aBeladjila, Khadidja Aya1 aÇetintaş, Yunus1 aDuru, Mehmet Emin1 aÖzturk, Mehmet,1 aKabouche, Ahmed1 aKabouche, Zahia0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 55, no. 1 p.324-329dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2016.12384883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245014000180520131100320592002801631650001301659650001201672650001401684650001401698650001401712650001601726650001901742650000901761650001301770650001101783650001001794650001401804650001801818650002801836650002001864651001001884653002701894653003401921653002401955653001801979653001701997653001602014700001902030700001702049700001602066700002402082700002602106700003202132773012002164856008202284852000902366655001202375IND60690711620221119092938.0210108e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069071162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2020.1004032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashyap, Chandrashekhar Azad10aDistribution, genesis and geochemical modeling of fluoride in the water of tribal area of Bijapur district, Chhattisgarh, central India  aThe present study has been carried out to determine the sources and distribution of fluoride (F⁻) contamination in the water of district Bijapur, Chhattisgarh, central India. For this study, 45 water samples were collected from surface and groundwater from shallow and deeper aquifers. It was observed that 50% of groundwater samples have elevated F⁻ level and varies from 0.1 to 7.1 mg/L, though, F⁻ level in water bodies was below the WHO maximum permissible limit (1.5 mg/L). The major ions of water samples reveal the dominance of Ca–Mg–HCO₃ hydrochemical facies. This study suggests F⁻ contaminated water shows a significant correlation with Cl⁻ which further supported by statistical correlation. Analysis of rocks and sediments from the study area suggests leaching of minerals like biotite, hornblende, and richterite which are likely sources for elevated F⁻ level in groundwater. Gibbs diagram reveals the dominance of the evaporative process for contaminated water by F⁻ in the study area. Due to improper awareness, the local tribal population (≈2, 55,000) of the area is consuming F⁻ enriched groundwater and vulnerable to dental and skeletal fluorosis. Thus, surface and uncontaminated water w.r.t F⁻ should be developed for providing safe water to the inhabitants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abiotite 3achlorides 3afluorides 3afluorosis 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3aions 3aleaching 3amodels 3arocks 3asediments 3asurface water 3asustainable development 3awater pollution 3aIndia 0aFluoride contamination 0aDental and skeletal fluorosis 0aGroundwater quality 0aCentral India 0aChhattisgarh 0aTribal area1 aGhosh, Arindam1 aSingh, Swati1 aAli, Shakir1 aSingh, Hemant Kumar1 aChandrasekhar, Trupti1 aChandrasekharam, Dornadulla0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2020 Oct., v. 11 p.100403-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2020.1004033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002100168245006900189300001600258500000900274500001500283520090700298592002801205650001901233650001701252650001901269653001701288700002001305773012101325852000901446856009801455655001201553991630389910742620221118103657.0191122e197507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590915242DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1975.0011183X001500040039x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcConnell, R.

Reciprocal Ft progenies of this S, clone and another Si clone whose S2 progeny was normal green in color, were green also. The F2 data fit phenotypic ratios of 9 green: 7 variegated plants or 3 green: 1 variegated plant depending upon the genotype of the Ft parent. F2 intercross progenies were grown to confirm the F3 segregations and to assign genotypes to several F2 plants. Two recessive genes controlled the chlorophyll deficiency.

However, the survival and subsequent growth of enrichment plantings depend on how they respond to competition from neighbours. For successful forest restoration or commercial forest management, the challenge is to determine appropriate frequencies and intensities of silvicultural interventions, principally competition reduction. In this study, we use long-term data (49–60 years) from four enrichment planting experiments established after selective logging and girdling of non-commercial trees in a tropical rainforest in north Queensland, Australia, to assess the effects of competition on the survival and growth of enrichment plantings. We found that residual overwood development severely reduced the survival, diameter and volume growth of two widely planted rainforest species - Flindersia brayleyana (Rutaceae) and Agathis robusta (Araucariaceae). Both species responded well to overstory removal, either as an initial treatment or thereafter. Use of Hegyi’s competition index confirmed the strong suppressive effect of neighbours. The most abundant competitor was the fast-growing, early-secondary species Acacia aulacocarpa, which only became apparent after cessation of silvicultural treatments, 7 years after planting. Our results reaffirm the importance of an initial or early-age removal of the competing overstory for the success of enrichment planting. Further silvicultural treatments may be required for extended periods to control excessively increased overwood basal area and to remove late emerging pioneer or early secondary species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia aulacocarpa 3aAgathis robusta 3aFlindersia brayleyana 3abiodiversity 3aecological function 3aforest management 3aforest restoration 3agirdling 3alogging 3aoverstory 3aplanting 3aseedlings 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 3aQueensland 0aUnderplanting 0aAcacia aulacocarpa 0aAgathis robusta 0aFlindersia brayleyana 0aHegyi’s index 0aOverwood competition 0aLogged tropical rainforest1 aBaynes, Jack1 aHerbohn, John0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 472 p.118241-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1182413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245004200168500001900210520102000229592002801249650001501277650001401292650001501306650001601321650001201337650001301349650001701362650002101379650001701400653002701417653001401444653002001458700002501478700001901503700001201522773012001534856008501654852000901739655001201748IND60705698320221119233359.0200907e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070569832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.susmat.2020.e002052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Zhengfen10aLaser induced graphene for biosensors  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiosensors can sensitively and selectively detect a wide range of compounds and macromolecules strongly relevant to human health diagnosis and environment monitoring.

This laser direct writing technology demonstrates a great potential for developing graphene-based electronics for its chemical-free and direct patterning of graphene, as well as suitability for roll-to-roll production. In this review, we summarize the recent development of the fabrication of LIG and its modification for meeting the needs of biosensor development. The LIG has been directly employed as electrode, modified with enzyme, aptamer or other catalyst for biosensing. The review also highlights integrated LIG biosensors that can simultaneously measure multiple objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acatalysts 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3aenzymes 3agraphene 3ahuman health 3aoligonucleotides 3aporous media 0aLaser induced graphene 0aBiosensor 0aLaser reduction1 aNguyễn, Nam Trung,1 aGao, Yongsheng1 aLi, Qin0 tSustainable materials and technologies.g2020 Sept., v. 25 p.e00205-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23531x2214-99377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2020.e002053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016900168520172300337592002802060650002202088650002002110650001902130650003502149650001602184650001902200650002302219650001502242650000902257650001102266650001502277650001802292650002802310650001702338650001702355650001602372653002202388653002602410653004202436653003702478653003602515700001902551773012002570856008202690852000902772655001202781IND60690711720221119092906.0210108e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069071172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2020.1003542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohn, Bernadette10aIdentification of risk zone area of declining piezometric level in the urbanized regions around the City of Kolkata based on ground investigation and GIS techniques  aThe falling piezometric level of groundwater is one of the major concerns, because of its immense importance especially in areas where treated surface water is not easily accessible. An attempt is made to identify the areas of maximum depletion of groundwater in KMC area by studying the post monsoon groundwater level data for the years 1991–2010. The Arc GIS software is used for the representation of the secondary data and also for the easy comparison of data. The study is done to find the groundwater trough in the region by predicting the groundwater level for post monsoon 2018 and validating the result with the data collected from the field. The result thus obtained is analysed with the help of the said software using the IDW (Inverse Distance weightage) technique. Thus, it is seen that GIS forms an excellent platform for the analysis of groundwater data and is very helpful in the present study. A comparative analysis has been made and it is seen that at maximum places in KMC region the water level is receding-places like Narendrapur, Chitpur, Sinthi, Ballygunge, Park Street, Jadavpur all show a receding trend, few places being exception like Mukundapur, Kalikapur where there has been a slight rise in the groundwater level, over the years. With the advancement in the surface water supply by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and with the decrease in population density, there is no respite in the groundwater level recession in the city. Blessed with river Hooghly alongside, the potable water issue is solved to a greater extent but still the southern Kolkata shows dependence on groundwater. Due to the falling groundwater level the chances of land subsidence is seem to be high in the city.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adrinking water 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3amonsoon season 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3arisk 3arivers 3asubsidence 3asurface water 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3awater supply 3awater table 0aPiezometric level 0aGroundwater depletion 0aGeographical-information-system (GIS) 0aInverse distance weightage (IDW) 0ambgl (metre below-Ground-level)1 aDas, Subhasish0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2020 Oct., v. 11 p.100354-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2020.1003543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05003naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245024900162300001600411520316000427592002803587650001903615650001603634650001503650650002203665650001403687650001403701650001003715650001503725650002103740650001703761650001503778650002103793650002403814650002003838650001203858650001703870650001903887650001103906650001403917650002603931653004103957653000903998653001704007653001104024653001604035653001404051653002004065653001904085653001604104700002604120700002004146700002404166773012404190856007804314852000904392655001204401IND60130412420221119225935.0151127e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013041242DNAL7 a10.2983/035.032.02302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReid, Gregor K.10aDietary Proportion of Fish Culture Solids Required by Shellfish to Reduce the Net Organic Load in Open-Water Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture: A Scoping Exercise with Cocultured Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) and Blue Mussel (Mytilus edulis)  ap. 509-517.  aIntegrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) aims to recapture portions of nutrient waste lost from 1 species as nutritional inputs for another. This process has the potential to augment growth of cocultured species while reducing the nutrient load from an aquaculture site. In several jurisdictions, open-water aquaculture is regulated through measures of benthic hydrogen sulfide concentrations, which is proportional to excess deposition of organic material such as feces and uneaten food. Interception, consumption, and digestion of organic portions from the fed trophic level (e.g., fish) by organic extractive species (e.g., shellfish, deposit feeders) results in “organic stripping,” with less organic material in resulting feces, thereby reducing the net organic load and benthic deposition potential. Shellfish are deployed beside fish cages in some openwater IMTA systems. In addition to the potential consumption of fish culture solids (i.e., feces, feed “fines”), natural particles (i.e., seston) will also be consumed. Consumption of seston portions by shellfish means that some suspended solids that would otherwise drift by fish cages now have the potential for redirection to the benthos as indigestible seston components, egested in shellfish feces. This raises the issue as to what dietary proportion of fish culture solids, consumed by extractive species, results in an increase or reduction of net organic load. As a scoping exercise, a simple mathematical model was created using known absorption efficiencies (fraction of organic material digested) of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) on diets of seston, and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) culture solids, to estimate the resulting organic fecal load of blue mussels on a mixed diet. The organic load from the mussel feces was added to the unconsumed load of salmon culture organics to determine the net IMTA organic load. The dietary proportion threshold (DPT) is the percentage of fish culture solids in an extractive species diet that results in no change in net organic load at an IMTA site. The DPT of salmon culture solids that must be exceeded for mussel culture to reduce the net IMTA site organic load is 14.5% for salmon feces and high-quality seston, 19.6% for salmon feces and lowquality seston, 11.5% for salmon feed fines and high-quality seston, and 15.6% for salmon feed fines and low-quality seston. A net reduction of organic load occurs if the amount of salmon culture organics absorbed (digested) by mussels exceeds the organic fecal load produced by indigestible seston components. Changes in total particulate matter consumed by a mussel population or changes in the amount of salmon culture solids available did not change the DPT, although these factors did influence the magnitude of net organic load increases or decreases. Whether DPTs are achievable is a function of many biophysical parameters, and these avenues are not pursued in this study. However, knowledge of DPTs can be useful to frame expectations of nutrient mitigation and to assist in the interpretation of augmented growth and tracer data as a means to infer nutrient reduction potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3aSalmo salar 3aabsorption 3abenthic organisms 3acoculture 3adigestion 3afeces 3afish cages 3afish consumption 3afish culture 3afood waste 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amathematical models 3amollusc culture 3amussels 3aparticulates 3apollution load 3asalmon 3ashellfish 3atrophic relationships 0aintegrated multi-trophic aquaculture 0aIMTA 0ablue mussels 0asalmon 0aaquaculture 0anutrients 0aorganic loading 0aMytilus edulis 0aSalmo salar1 aRobinson, Shawn M.

The aim of this study was to produce wine from jackfruit pulp and to evaluate the total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant properties of the wine. The ability of scavenging free radicals was measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant assay (FRAP), N, N-dimethyl-p-phenylendiamine (DMPD) and nitric oxide (NO) scavenging assays. Experimental results indicated that jackfruit wine was effective in DPPH radical scavenging (69.44±0.34%), FRAP (0.358 optical density value, O.D.), DMPD (78.45±0.05%) and NO (62.46±0.45%) capacity. By the analysis of the high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), two phenolic compounds namely gallic acid and protocatechuic acid were identified. The jackfruit wine was also able to protect H₂O₂+UV radiation and γ-radiation (100Gy) induced DNA damage in pBR322 plasmid DNA. The antioxidant and DNA damage protecting properties of jackfruit wine confirmed health benefits when consumed and could become a valuable source of antioxidant rich neutraceuticals. Additionally, the wine could be a commercially valuable by-product for the jackfruit growers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtocarpus heterophyllus 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aabsorbance 3aantioxidant activity 3abyproducts 3afree radical scavengers 3agallic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ajackfruits 3anitric oxide 3aprotocatechuic acid 3apulp 3asubtropics 3atropics 3awines1 aWaghmare, Shailesh R.1 aLokhande, Vinayak H.1 aSuprasanna, Penna1 aBapat, Vishwas A.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2011 Nov., v. 34, no. 3 p.1595-1601dElsevier B.V.x0926-66907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2011.05.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012100171520163500292592002801927650002001955650002401975650001501999650003502014650004202049650001102091650001202102650002502114650001502139650001902154650001502173650001402188650001302202700001902215700002002234700002002254700002302274700003602297700002002333700002202353700002002375773012302395856008202518852000902600655001202609IND60768475020221123000412.0220225e20220218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076847502DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110202662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrohmayer, Carina 10aTumor Cell Plasticity in Equine Papillomavirus-Positive Versus-Negative Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck  aSquamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is a common malignant tumor in humans and animals. In humans, papillomavirus (PV)-induced HNSCCs have a better prognosis than papillomavirus-unrelated HNSCCs. The ability of tumor cells to switch from epithelial to mesenchymal, endothelial, or therapy-resistant stem-cell-like phenotypes promotes disease progression and metastasis. In equine HNSCC, PV-association and tumor cell phenotype switching are poorly understood. We screened 49 equine HNSCCs for equine PV (EcPV) type 2, 3 and 5 infection. Subsequently, PV-positive versus -negative lesions were analyzed for expression of selected epithelial (keratins, β-catenin), mesenchymal (vimentin), endothelial (COX-2), and stem-cell markers (CD271, CD44) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF; keratins/vimentin, CD44/CD271 double-staining) to address tumor cell plasticity in relation to PV infection. Only EcPV2 PCR scored positive for 11/49 equine HNSCCs. IHC and IF from 11 EcPV2-positive and 11 EcPV2-negative tumors revealed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition events, with vimentin-positive cells ranging between <10 and >50%. CD44- and CD271-staining disclosed the intralesional presence of infiltrative tumor cell fronts and double-positive tumor cell subsets independently of the PV infection status. Our findings are indicative of (partial) epithelial–mesenchymal transition events giving rise to hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal and stem-cell-like tumor cell phenotypes in equine HNSCCs and suggest CD44 and CD271 as potential malignancy markers that merit to be further explored in the horse.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell structures 3adisease progression 3aepithelium 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahead and neck squamous cell carcinoma 3ahorses 3ahybrids 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasticity 3aprognosis 3avimentin1 aKlang, Andrea 1 aKummer, Stefan 1 aWalter, Ingrid 1 aJindra, Christoph 1 aWeissenbacher-Lang, Christiane 1 aRedmer, Torben 1 aKneissl, Sibylle 1 aBrandt, Sabine 0 tPathogens.g2022 Feb. 18, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110202663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013600166300001600302520125200318592002801570650001501598650002201613650001101635650001901646650001601665650000901681650001201690650001301702650002501715653002501740653001501765653001101780653001401791653001501805700001601820700001501836773009901851856008501950852000902035655001202044IND60613737820221120143053.0200523e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061373782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Zhaolin10aExperimental and modelling studies on fixed bed adsorption for Cu(II) removal from aqueous solution by carboxyl modified jute fiber  ap. 952-959.  aTo guide the practical application of fibrous materials in wastewater treatment, this study explored the engineering design of fixed bed adsorption technique by using carboxyl-modified jute fiber (CMJF) for copper ion (Cu(II)) removal from aqueous solution. The study, conducted by means of adsorption experiments in a column with a fixed bed of sorbent, investigated the effects of the CMJF sorbent dosage, the flow rate and the initial Cu(II) concentration on the corresponding breakthrough curves and compared the dynamic adsorption performance of raw and modified jute in the same process conditions. Compared with the fixed bed of raw jute fiber, the CMJF sorbent exhibited a breakthrough time about 3.2 times longer and a dynamic adsorption capacity roughly 4.2 times higher at the optimal conditions (packing height of 8 cm, flow rate of 17.45 cm/min and initial concentration of 100 mg/L). The dynamic adsorption capacity, 50% breakthrough time and 10% breakthrough time could be well predicted by Thomas, Yoon–Nelson and Bed Depth Service Time (BDST) models, respectively. Besides, these dynamic models well described the fixed bed adsorption behavior, and the CMJF exhibited better fixed bed adsorption performance than raw jute.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acopper 3adynamic models 3aengineering 3ajute 3apowders 3asorbents 3awastewater treatment 0aFixed-bed adsorption 0aJute fiber 0aCopper 0aModelling 0aWastewater1 aZheng, Tong1 aWang, Peng0 tPowder technology.g2018 Oct., v. 338 p.952-959dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011700173300001600290520074500306592002801051650003801079650002201117650001801139650001301157650001901170650002601189650001501215650002401230650001701254700002201271700002101293773010101314856004801415852000901463655001201472IND50065778720221120172851.0130425e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006577872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-012-0506-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaghiyari, Hamid Reza10aEffects of nano-silver impregnation on brittleness, physical and mechanical properties of heat-treated hardwoods  ap. 467-480.  aThe present study investigates the effect of heat treatment of untreated and nano-silver-impregnated Populus nigra, Populus deltoides and Fagus orientalis on the physical and mechanical properties.

Nano-silver impregnation aggravated the effects of heat treatment. Although significant in some cases, nano-silver impregnation did not seem to have great effect on physical properties. It may be concluded that although NS impregnation aggravated the effects of heat treatment on solid woods, other factors may also be involved such as the species and density of the wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. orientalis 3aPopulus deltoides 3aPopulus nigra 3ahardwood 3aheat treatment 3amechanical properties 3ananosilver 3aphysical properties 3awood density1 aEnayati, Aliakbar1 aGholamiyan, Hadi0 tWood science and technology.g2013 May, v. 47, no. 3 p.467-480dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-012-0506-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245009200206300001300298520090300311592002801214650001201242650000901254650001001263650001301273650001001286650001001296650001501306651001101321651002101332653001201353653001001365653001701375653001901392653001101411700001801422773011201440856008501552852000901637655001201646IND60583258020221122073703.0190412e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058325802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrkun, Ömer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4478-252110aMolecular characterization of Babesia species in wild animals and their ticks in Turkey  ap. 8-13.  aTo date, no study has investigated Babesia ecology in wild boars, hares or foxes in Turkey.

We detected Babesia spp. molecularly in hares for the first time. In addition, we identified B. vulpes in foxes for the first time in Turkey. The presence of B. rossi, B. crassa and B. occultans was also revealed in ticks collected from wild boars and hares. This is only the second report of B. rossi in ticks outside of Africa and suggests that B. rossi is circulating in ticks in Turkey. Therefore B. rossi poses a significant threat to domestic dogs. Here we demonstrate the role of wild animals in the life cycle of Babesia species in Turkey and contribute to Babesia ecological and taxonomic information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia 3adogs 3afoxes 3agenotype 3ahares 3aticks 3awild boars 3aAfrica 3aTurkey (country) 0aBabesia 0aTicks 0aWild animals 0aNovel genotype 0aTurkey1 aKaraer, Zafer0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2017 Nov., v. 55 p.8-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245010500160300001600265520151100281592002801792650002801820650001601848650001001864650002201874650001501896650001201911650001301923650001001936650004301946650000901989650001401998650002102012650002202033651001102055651001902066651001702085653002802102653001702130653002102147653001202168653001402180653006402194700002502258773012402283856007802407852000902485655001202494IND60130412520221119230245.0151127e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013041252DNAL7 a10.2983/035.032.02312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, Annie M.10aGenetic Diversity of Vibrio parahaemolyticus from Narragansett Bay and Coastal Ponds of Rhode Island  ap. 519-525.  aQuantitative polymerase chain reaction studies have detected Vibrioparahaemolyticus virulence genes (hemolysins tdh and trh) in Rhode Island oysters and waters. Illness caused by V. parahaemolyticus is currently rare in Rhode Island; however, there is concern over increasing aquaculture and water temperatures. The aim of this study was to characterize further the genetic diversity of V. parahaemolyticus in Rhode Island to determine disease risk. The genetic profile of pathogenic (tdh+ and/or trh+) strains and environmental (tdh-/trh-) strains of V. parahaemolyticus isolated from Rhode Island oyster and water samples was compared with pandemic and clinical strains using repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. Of the 291 V. parahaemolyticus colonies isolated, 27 were pathogenic strains, with 25 of 291 (9.0%), tdh-/trh+; 1 of 291 (0.3%), tdh+/trh+; and 1 of 291 (0.3%), tdh+/trh-. Rhode Island isolates did not cluster closely with pandemic or clinical strains. Isolates containing tdh and/or trh genes from Rhode Island waters were predominantly tdh-/trh+, in contrast with a predominance of tdh+/trh- or tdh+/trh+ strains in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and the Gulf of Mexico. Similar to other studies in the United States, a high level of genetic diversity in pathogenic and environmental strains of V. parahaemolyticus was seen. This study clarified the diversity and virulence gene content (tdh and trh status) of V. parahaemolyticus isolates from Rhode Island waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aaquaculture 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahemolysins 3aoysters 3apandemic 3aponds 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3awater temperature 3aAlaska 3aGulf of Mexico 3aRhode Island 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0aRhode Island 0aNarragansett Bay 0aoysters 0ashellfish 0arepetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction1 aGomez-Chiarri, Marta0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2013 Aug., v. 32, no. 2 p.519-525dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.032.02313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245019800178300001500376520195500391592002802346650001402374650001802388650002102406650002402427650002502451650001102476650001102487650001002498650002102508650001302529650003302542650001802575650002102593650000902614650001602623650001002639650003102649650001402680650001602694650001902710650001802729650003302747650001902780653002502799653002102824653001502845653003602860653002002896700002402916700001702940700001402957700002602971700002002997700002103017700001303038700002403051773011403075856008503189852000903274655001203283IND60583258120221122063928.0190412e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058325812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Herrero, M.C.10aNovel avian oropharyngeal trichomonads isolated from European turtle doves (Streptopelia turtur) and racing pigeons (Columba livia): genetic and morphometric characterisation of clonal cultures  ap. 93-103.  aExtensive diversity has been described within the avian oropharyngeal trichomonad complex in recent years. In this study we developed clonal cultures from four isolates selected by their different ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 (ITS) genotype and their association with gross lesions of avian trichomonosis. Isolates were obtained from an adult racing pigeon and a nestling of Eurasian eagle owl with macroscopic lesions, and from a juvenile wood pigeon and an European turtle dove without clinical signs. Multi-locus sequence typing analysis of the ITS, small subunit of ribosomal rRNA (SSUrRNA) and Fe-hydrogenase (Fe-hyd) genes together with a morphological study by optical and scanning electron microscopy was performed. No significant differences in the structures were observed with scanning electron microscopy. However, the genetic characterisation revealed novel sequence types for the SSUrRNA region and Fe-hyd gene. Two clones were identified as Trichomonas gallinae in the MLST analysis, but the clones from the racing pigeon and European turtle dove showed higher similarity with Trichomonas tenax and Trichomonas canistomae than with T. gallinae at their ITS region, respectively. SSUrRNA sequences grouped all the clones in a clade that includes T. gallinae, T. tenax and T. canistomae. Further diversity was detected within the Fe-hyd locus, with a clear separation from T. gallinae of the clones obtained from the racing pigeon and the European turtle dove. In addition, morphometric comparison by optical microscopy with clonal cultures of T. gallinae revealed significant statistical differences on axostyle projection length in the clone from the European turtle dove. Morphometric and genetic data indicate that possible new species within the Trichomonas genus were detected. Taking in consideration the diversity in Trichomonas species present in the oral cavity of birds, a proper genetic analysis is highly recommended when outbreaks occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBubo bubo 3aColumba livia 3aColumba palumbus 3aStreptopelia turtur 3aTrichomonas gallinae 3aadults 3aclones 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3agenotype 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ajuvenile wood 3alight microscopy 3aloci 3amorphometry 3amouth 3amultilocus sequence typing 3anestlings 3anew species 3aracing pigeons 3aribosomal RNA 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atrichomoniasis 0aTrichomonas gallinae 0aGenetic variants 0aMorphology 0aOropharyngeal bird trichomonads 0aTrichomonas sp.1 aGarijo-Toledo, M.M.1 aLiebhart, D.1 aGanas, P.1 aMartínez-Díaz, R.A.1 aPonce-Gordo, F.1 aCarrero-Ruiz, A.1 aHess, M.1 aGómez-Muñoz, M.T.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2017 Nov., v. 55 p.93-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.08.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245009900163300001600262520153800278592002801816650002301844650001401867650001301881650001501894651001801909653002301927653002701950653002901977653002102006653002302027653001802050700001502068700002202083700001702105773011802122856008602240852000902326655001202335IND60637941320221121032656.0190613e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063794132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2019.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bai12aA simulation-based evaluation of sea sampling design for American lobster in the Gulf of Maine  ap. 145-154.  aFishery-dependent monitoring programs provide valuable information for the assessment and management of fishery stocks. The quality of the data and subsequent stock assessment are largely influenced by sampling design and sample size. The Lobster Sea Sampling Program in the Gulf of Maine yields critical information for the assessment of American lobster (Homarus americanus). To facilitate the use of an on-boat tablet-based data entry system, which will replace the current voice recording system, the sampling program requires development of a subsampling procedure to account for a decrease in the data recording speed after the new data entry system is implemented. We evaluated the performance of four potential subsampling strategies, including possible combinations of simple random vs. systematic subsampling with fixed subsample size vs. subsample size in proportion to reference data. Proportional subsampling showed lower relative estimation error and relative bias compared to subsampling with fixed subsample size. Within the two proportional subsampling strategies, systematic subsampling showed similar precision and accuracy compared to random subsampling, but systematic subsampling is more feasible to be conducted onboard. We concluded that the systematic subsampling of 50% of reference data could reduce current sampling effort but still capture the temporal trend of reference data. The simulation approach developed in this study can also be applied to optimize other fisheries-dependent monitoring programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomarus americanus 3afisheries 3alobsters 3amonitoring 3aGulf of Maine 0aMonitoring program 0aSystematic subsampling 0aProportional subsampling 0aSize composition 0aHomarus americanus 0aGulf of Maine1 aChen, Yong1 aReardon, Kathleen1 aWilson, Carl0 tFisheries research.g2019 Aug., v. 216 p.145-154dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245009000162300001500252520106400267592002801331650002201359650001901381650001001400650002001410650001101430650001801441650000901459650001501468650001201483650002101495650002901516650001401545650002201559650001201581653000801593653001401601653001601615700001901631700001401650700001901664700001401683700001401697700001301711700001901724773009101743856008301834990002301917852000901940655001201949IND60697516420221119110438.0200605e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069751642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2016.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Meng10aPB2 substitutions V598T/I increase the virulence of H7N9 influenza A virus in mammals  ap. 92-101.  aPB2 is one of the subunits of the influenza A virus (IAV) polymerase complex. By bioinformatics analysis we identified PB2 substitutions at positions 389 and 598 among IAV isolates from humans, which might associate with viral pathogenicity. To evaluate the biological significance of these substitutions, PB2-K389R and -V598T/I mutant viruses of avian H7N9 IAVs were generated by reverse genetics. Compared to the wild type, the mutant viruses displayed an enhanced growth capacity in human and mammalian cells. Meanwhile, they presented increased transcription and replication by producing higher levels of viral mRNA, cRNA and vRNA. Minireplicon assays indicated that the polymerase activity was elevated by these substitutions. Notably, the PB2-V598T/I substitutions substantially increased virus replication and virulence in mice. Together, we demonstrated that the substitutions PB2-V598T/I contributed to higher IAV replication and virulence in mammals, which added to the knowledge of IAV virulence determinants and benefited the surveillance of IAVs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3abioinformatics 3abirds 3aenzyme activity 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amonitoring 3amutants 3areverse genetics 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aPB2 0aPB2-K389R 0aPB2-V598T/I1 aYuan, Shuofeng1 aZhang, Ke1 aSingh, Kailash1 aMa, Qiang1 aZhou, Jie1 aChu, Hin1 aZheng, Bo-Jian0 tVirology.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 501 p.92-101dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245009700168300001600265520151100281592002801792650001601820650001601836650002001852650001301872650000901885650001401894650001201908650001701920650001801937650004301955650001101998650001502009650001102024650001702035650001402052650001202066650001902078653002102097653002302118653002102141700002202162700001402184700001602198700001602214773013402230856007702364852000902441655001202450IND60480966120221119030215.0200226e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048096612DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2014.17442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Arias, C.A.10aBioaccessibility of ochratoxin A from red wine in an in vitro dynamic gastrointestinal model  ap. 107-112.  aOchratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium species with immunosuppressive, teratogenic, and carcinogenic properties. It has been determined that wine is the second largest source of OTA (10% of total OTA intake) in the European diet and that its presence, even in small doses, can be a problem in terms of long-term toxicity. In this paper, we evaluated the bioaccessibility of OTA in a spiked red wine sample under human fasting conditions using an in vitro dynamic digestion model that includes a continuous-flow dialysis system to simulate intestinal passage. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first examining the bioaccessibility of OTA in wine. A liquid-liquid method was used to extract the OTA and ochratoxin alpha (OTα) from gastrointestinal juices, and the extracts were analysed by HPLC with a fluorescence detector. The bioaccessibility of OTA from the spiked red wine (1.0, 2.0 and 4 μg/l) was high in the gastric compartment (102.8, 128.3 and 122.3%, respectively), whereas in the simulated intestine, it did not exceed 26%, and the amount of OTA that crossed the dialysis membrane was very low (<3.3%). The amount of OTα in gastric chyme ranged from 5.1 to 19.1% of the spiked OTA, whereas in the intestinal compartment it did not exceed 5%. In conclusion, in the in vitro system assayed, OTA exhibited a high bioaccessibility in the simulated stomach, but it decreased after the intestinal digestion and passage through the dialysis membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aPenicillium 3abioavailability 3adialysis 3adiet 3adigestion 3afasting 3afluorescence 3agastric juice 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aintestines 3amodels 3aochratoxin A 3ared wines 3astomach 3ateratogenicity 0abioaccessibility 0ain vitro digestion 0aochratoxin alpha1 aPiquer-Garcia, I.1 aMarin, S.1 aSanchis, V.1 aRamos, A.J.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2015 Jan. 1, v. 8, no. 1 p.107-112dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2014.17443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013800158300001800296520162500314592002801939650001601967650002301983650003002006650001302036650001602049650002002065650001702085650001902102650001902121650001102140650002002151650001502171650002202186650001402208650000702222650002002229700002602249700002202275773011002297856007502407852000902482655001202491IND60529576020221121161042.0160717e20130219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052957602DNAL7 a10.1021/ac303158f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaselberg, Rob10aLow-Flow Sheathless Capillary Electrophoresis–Mass Spectrometry for Sensitive Glycoform Profiling of Intact Pharmaceutical Proteins  ap. 2289-2296.  aCapillary electrophoresis coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE–TOF-MS) via a porous tip sheathless electrospray ionization (ESI) interface was studied for the characterization of pharmaceutical glycoproteins. To achieve optimal glycoform separation, background electrolytes of low pH were used in conjunction with a capillary with a neutral coating exhibiting near-zero electroosmotic flow. Crucial interfacing parameters, like ESI voltage and ESI tip-to-end plate distance, were optimized for very low flow rates (∼5 nL/min) in order to attain maximum sensitivity and stable performance. Under optimal conditions, the sheathless CE–MS interface provided significantly increased ionization efficiencies for intact proteins and decreased ionization suppression leading to detection limits in the picomolar-range. Analysis of a sample of recombinant human interferon-β allowed the assignment of at least 18 glycoforms, plus a variety of deamidation, succinimide, and oxidation products, representing a considerable improvement over sheath-liquid CE–MS. The sheathless CE–MS system also proved highly suitable for the glycoprofiling of recombinant human erythropoietin, revealing 74 glycoforms in a 60-min run. In addition, oxidation and acetylation products were detected, overall resulting in assignment of more than 250 different isoforms. Semiquantitative glycoprofiles could be derived for both pharmaceutical proteins, with estimated glycoform concentrations analyzed ranging from 0.35 to 950 nM. These profiles may be very useful for quality control of biopharmaceuticals and their biosimilars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acoatings 3adeamidation 3adetection limit 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroosmosis 3aerythropoietin 3ahumans 3ainterferon-beta 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3apH 3aquality control1 ade Jong, Gerhardus J.1 aSomsen, Govert W.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Feb. 19, v. 85, no. 4 p.2289-2296dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac303158f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04762naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245014700202300001600349500001400365520302000379592002803399650001303427650003103440650003103471650002203502650002503524650000903549650001503558650001403573650002303587650001103610653002903621653004403650653002303694653003103717700005503748700005803803700002003861700005303881700005903934700005903993773015204052856007904204852000904283655001204292IND60717656520221119005409.0201221e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071765652DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2020-186852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValckenier, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7535-277810aLongitudinal study on the effects of intramammary infection with non-aureus staphylococci on udder health and milk production in dairy heifers  ap. 899-914.  aNAL-light  aWe conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the effect of non-aureus staphylococci (NAS) causing subclinical intramammary infections (IMI) on quarter milk somatic cell count (qSCC) and quarter milk yield (qMY). In total, 324 quarters of 82 Holstein Friesian heifers were followed from calving to 130 d in milk (DIM) and were sampled 10 times each at 14-d intervals. The IMI status of each quarter was determined based on bacterial culture results at the current and previous or next sampling day, or both. The qSCC was determined on each sampling day and the average qMY on sampling day was available through stored daily milk weight data in the management program of the automatic milking system. A transient IMI (tIMI) was defined as a case where a specific pathogen was isolated from a quarter on only one sampling day and not on the previous or next sampling day. When the same bacterial strain, as defined by random amplification of polymorphic DNA-PCR, was isolated from the same quarter on multiple sampling days, it was defined as a persistent IMI (pIMI) status on those sampling days; a pIMI episode was defined as the combination of multiple consecutive pIMI statuses with the same bacterial strain on different sampling days. During this study, 142 subclinical IMI with NAS occurred in 116 different quarters from 64 animals, yielding in total 304 NAS isolates belonging to 17 different species. The prevalence of NAS was highest in the first 4 DIM. Overall, the predominant species was Staphylococcus chromogenes (52% of the isolates), followed by S. epidermidis (9.2%), S. xylosus (8.2%), and S. equorum (5.9%). Staphylococcus chromogenes was the only species for which an effect on qSCC and qMY could be analyzed separately; the other NAS species were considered as a group because of their low prevalence. Eighteen out of 40 IMI (45%) caused by S. chromogenes persisted over at least 2 sampling days, whereas only 10 of 102 (9.8%) IMI caused by other NAS species persisted for at least 2 sampling days. The average duration of pIMI episodes was 110.4 d for S. chromogenes and 70 d for the other NAS species. Remarkably, 17 of the 18 pIMI episodes with S. chromogenes started within the first 18 DIM. The qSCC was highest in quarters having a pIMI with a major pathogen, followed by quarters having a pIMI with S. chromogenes, and a pIMI with other NAS. Transient IMI with other NAS or with a major pathogen caused a small but significantly higher qSCC, whereas the qSCC in quarters having a tIMI with S. chromogenes was not statistically different compared with noninfected quarters. No significant differences in qMY were observed between quarters having a pIMI or tIMI with S. chromogenes or with the other NAS species compared with noninfected quarters, despite the higher qSCC. Quarters having a pIMI with major pathogens showed significantly lower daily milk production. Surprisingly, quarters that cured from an IMI with S. chromogenes had a significantly lower qMY than noninfected quarters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aStaphylococcus chromogenes 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3abacterial culture 3alongitudinal studies 3amilk 3amilk yield 3apathogens 3asomatic cell count 3audders 0anon-aureus staphylococci 0aspecies-specific intramammary infection 0aquarter milk yield 0aquarter somatic cell count1 aPiepers, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4753-93211 aSchukken, Y.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8250-41941 aDe Visscher, A.1 aBoyen, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4777-68801 aHaesebrouck, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1709-933X1 aDe Vliegher, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6330-90620 tJournal of dairy science.g2021 Jan., v. 104, no. 1 p.899-914dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-186853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245012000159300001800279520075600297592002801053650001301081650001201094650002301106650002101129650002801150650001101178650002201189650002501211650002201236700002201258700002601280700002201306700001801328700001101346773011801357856008101475852000901556655001201565IND60550522420221122201416.0160911e20150320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055052242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b001502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Jun10aRh(I)-Catalyzed Chemo- and Stereoselective Domino Cycloaddition of Optically Active Propargyl 2,4-Hexadienyl Ethers  ap. 3195-3202.  a1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol in combination with ZnEt₂, Ti(OⁱPr)₄, and dicyclohexylamine have been employed to catalyze asymmetric alkyne addition to an ynal to synthesize optically active propargylic alcohols containing two alkyne functions with excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

Increasing evidence has suggested a possible role of prolonged arsenic exposure through drinking water in the development of arsenic-induced chronic noncancer diseases, among which hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the focus of concern. Although exposure to high levels of arsenic has been reported to be associated with excess risk of hypertension or T2D in a dose-dependent manner, the association has yet to be established, especially low-level exposure. This cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the potential association between prolonged environmental arsenic exposure through drinking water and the prevalence of hypertension and T2D in Inner Mongolia, China, with emphasis on the assessment of low-level exposure. In this study (a total of 669 men and women), we found that the blood pressure levels were significantly correlated with cumulative arsenic exposure and that the systolic blood pressure of the subjects with arsenic exposure >50 μg/L was significantly higher than those of the subjects with <10 and 10-50 μg/L exposure. Significant prevalence of hypertension was found in the subjects of the >50 μg/L group both before and after adjustment for confounders. In addition, a significant negative relationship was found between urinary arsenic percentage of dimethylated arsenic (DMA%) and the prevalence of hypertension in the >50 μg/L group. However, low-level arsenic exposure (10-50 μg/L) was not statistically associated with hypertension. No significant difference of blood glucose was found among the groups with different arsenic exposure levels. No statistical association was found between arsenic exposure and T2D. Our findings suggested that prolonged arsenic exposure might play a role in the development of hypertension; however, only high-level arsenic was associated with the risk of hypertension. Our findings also indicated that lower DMA% might be related with the increased susceptibility of arsenic-induced hypertension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3ablood glucose 3across-sectional studies 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental exposure 3ahypertension 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apublic health 3arisk 3asystolic blood pressure 2aAdult 2aArsenicxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xepidemiology 2aDrinking Waterxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Exposurexstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxepidemiology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrevalence 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolismxtoxicity. 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aLi, Bing1 aXi, Shuhua1 aZheng, Quanmei1 aLv, Xiuqiang1 aSun, Guifan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Nov., v. 20, no. 11 p.8151-8161dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1768-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011200170500001900282520153300301592002801834650001001862650001901872650001901891650001901910650002901929650002201958650002001980650001402000650000902014650000902023650002102032653001402053653001602067653003202083653003202115700001502147700001702162700001502179773011702194856008402311852000902395655001202404IND60696075120221118013423.0200724e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069607512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1062422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTraoré, Seydou,10aRice yield response forecasting tool (YIELDCAST) for supporting climate change adaptation decision in Sahel  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRice yield responses forecast (YIELDCAST) is a very useful decision support tool in climate adaptation in Sahel, where crops are purely rainfed climate-stressors sensitive. This study aims to construct upland rice yield responses forecasting algebraic formulation code referred as YIELDCAST by using gene-expression programming (GEP) based on observed rainfall and temperatures data (1979–2011), and forcing with global climate model (GCM) downscaled outputs under CO₂ emission scenarios SR-A1B, A2 and B1 (2012–2100) over Bobo-Dioulasso, a Sahelian region.

Yields forecasted (2012–2100) showed a noticeable statistically significant difference between scenarios; however, fluctuating with no substantial increase (average below 1.60 ton/ha); suggesting that the increase observed in temperatures and decrease in rains will either reduced or hindered yield to largely increase in Sahel. With no such YIELDCAST tool to support adaptation decision, Sahel will still be under the trap of the broad array of adaptation strategy, which is a trial and error, less specific and costly. The model can help anticipate adaptation decision support on-farm water management, shift to suitable planting periods, and use of improved drought resistant and short duration varieties adapted to a local weather pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adecision support systems 3adrought tolerance 3agene expression 3ahighlands 3arain 3arice 3awater management 0aYIELDCAST 0aUpland rice 0aAdaptation decision support 0aGene-expression programming1 aZhang, Lei1 aGuven, Aytac1 aFipps, Guy0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 239 p.106242-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1062423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009300170506011700263506007600380520158300456592002802039506003702067650001902104650001802123650001202141650002502153650001102178650001202189653001002201653001702211653003002228653001502258653002402273653002102297653001602318653001702334653006302351700002102414700002302435773008302458856008202541852000902623655001202632IND60705698920221207093036.0220914s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070569892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2020.1010142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexandre, Kabamba10aModification and optimization of the inhibition of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission assay  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHIV-1 infection is caused by cell-free and cell-associated viruses. Currently most of the assays used to screen potential HIV-1 entry inhibitors focus on the inhibition of cell-free viruses. One assay that is widely employed is the TZM-bl neutralization assay that uses pseudotyped viruses. However, a study by Abela et al. showed that many inhibitors that potently inhibit cell-free HIV-1 in this assay can be less effective against the cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. These researchers then designed a method to screen entry inhibitors for activity against cell-associated HIV-1, using pseudotyped viruses. The main limitation of this method, however, was that it can only be reliably employed against viruses that cannot infect target cells as cell-free virion in the absence of a polycation supplement such as DEAE (diethylaminoethyl). Thus, in the current study we provide modifications to this method that solves the problem and makes it possible to study entry inhibitors against cell-to-cell infection of both polycation depend and independent viruses. The main modification involves the introduction of the relative light unit (RLU) vs. virus producing 293-T cells / corresponding supernatants graph. This graph is used to select a virus input that only allows for the detection of cell-associated viruses infection.•The method is a modification of the cell-to-cell transmission assay published by Abela et al.•The method allows for the study of the inhibition of cell-to-cell transmission of both polycation dependent and independent HIV-1 pseudoviruses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHIV infections 3aPseudoviridae 3acations 3aneutralization tests 3avirion 3aviruses 0aHIV-1 0aTZM-bl-cells 0aCell-to-cell transmission 0aInhibition 0aRelative-light-unit 0aVirus expressing 0a293-T-cells 0aSupernatants 0aModified inhibition of the cell-to-cell transmission assay1 aMalatji, Kanyane1 aMulaudzi, Takalani0 tMethodsX.g2020, v. 7 p.101014-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2020.1010143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245008800161300001600249520194200265592002802207650002102235650001502256650001502271650002702286650001202313650001502325650001902340650001402359650002802373650001102401650000702412650000902419650002502428650001102453653001902464653001502483653001502498653002002513653002102533700001602554700001802570700002202588700001402610700001802624700001902642700001702661700001602678773013402694856007702828852000902905655001202914IND60480966420221119030603.0200226e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048096642DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2013.16662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, A.F.10aIn vitro removal of deoxynivalenol by a mixture of organic and inorganic adsorbents  ap. 113-119.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a mixture of inorganic (activated carbon) and organic (yeast cell wall) adsorbents on in vitro removal of deoxynivalenol (DON). The study was carried out using a 24 incomplete factorial design with three replications at the central point, totalling 11 experiments. The independent variables were pH (3.0, 5.0 and 7.0), adsorbent concentration (0.2, 1.1 and 2.0%), DON concentration (2,500, 5,000 and 7,500 ng/ml) and ratio of activated carbon and yeast cell wall (0:100, 15:85 and 30:70), evaluated at 30, 60 and 90 min incubation periods. The highest percentage of adsorption occurred with 2.0% activated carbon and yeast cell wall at 30:70 ratio (≯95.6%) for 30, 60 and 90 min. The lowest adsorption was detected using 0.2% of activated carbon and yeast cell wall at 0:100 ratio (from 14.4 to 77.3%). The pH values (3.0, 5.0 and 7.0) showed no influence on the adsorption of DON in vitro only at 2.0% inclusion level. The predictive model of integrated optimisation of the independent variables of in vitro DON adsorption describes that the maximum adsorption (100%) occurs when the variables pH and adsorbent concentration are set at +1 coded level (pH 7.0 and 2.0%, respectively) and the toxin concentration and the ratio of activated carbon and yeast cell wall at -1 coded level (2,500 ng/ml and 30:70, respectively) for 30, 60 and 90 min. Statistical analysis showed that the equation model obtained can be applied to predict the adsorption percentage of DON in vitro and that the mixture of activated carbon and yeast cell wall at a 2.0% concentration was effective from pH 3.0 to 7.0, which is the range found in the gastrointestinal tract of monogastric animals, thus indicating its potential to minimise the contamination risk by DON. Nevertheless, in vivo efficacy of activated carbon and yeast cell wall at 30:70 ratio should be confirmed with animal experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanimal experimentation 3aanimals 3acell walls 3adeoxynivalenol 3aequations 3agastrointestinal system 3amodels 3apH 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 3ayeasts 0adetoxification 0amycotoxins 0aadsorption 0ayeast cell wall 0aactivated carbon1 aBorsato, D.1 aLofrano, A.D.1 ade Oliveira, A.S.1 aOno, M.A.1 aBordini, J.G.1 aHirozawa, M.T.1 aYabe, M.J.S.1 aOno, E.Y.S.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2015 Jan. 1, v. 8, no. 1 p.113-119dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2013.16663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013300163300001600296520158800312592002801900650002501928650002001953650002001973650001901993650002502012650001802037653001902055653002402074653002502098653002102123653002802144653002002172700001502192773021402207856008302421852000902504655001202513IND60583258520221122073720.0190415e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058325852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jher.2017.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValero, D.10aArtificial Neural Networks and pattern recognition for air-water flow velocity estimation using a single-tip optical fibre probe  ap. 150-159.  aInterest in air-water flows has increased considerably for the last decades, being a common research field for different engineering applications ranging from nuclear engineering to large hydraulic structures or water quality treatments. Investigation of complex air-water flow behavior requires sophisticated instrumentation devices, with additional challenges when compared to single phase instrumentation. In this paper, a single-tip optical fibre probe has been used to record high-frequency samples (over 1MHz). The main advantage of this instrumentation is that it allows direct computation of a velocity for each detected bubble or droplet, thus providing a detailed velocity time series. Fluid phase detection functions (i.e. the signal transition between two fluid phases) have been related to the interfacial velocities by means of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Information from previous measurements of a classical dual-tip conductivity probe (yielding time-averaged velocity data only) and theoretical velocity profiles have been used to train and test ANN. Special attention has been given to the input selection and the ANN dimensions, which allowed obtaining a robust methodology in order to non-linearly post-process the optical fibre signals and thus to estimate interfacial velocities. ANN have been found to be capable to recognize characteristic shapes in the fluid phase function and to provide a similar level of accuracy as classical dual-tip techniques. Finally, performance of the trained ANN has been evaluated by means of different accuracy parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydraulic structures 3ainstrumentation 3aneural networks 3aoptical fibers 3atime series analysis 3awater quality 0aAir-water flow 0aFeedforward network 0aInterfacial velocity 0aStepped spillway 0aArtificial intelligence 0aInstrumentation1 aBung, D.B.0 tJournal of hydro-environment research.g2018 Mar., v. 19 p.150-159dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific DivisionwJournal:2188x1570-64437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2017.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245017500166300001800341520158200359592002801941650001101969650001201980650001701992650001902009650002602028650002302054650001102077650001502088650002902103650002502132650002102157650001302178650001102191650002302202650001902225650002102244650001702265650001302282651001202295700002302307773010202330856004802432852000902480655001202489IND4472616620221119100853.0120427e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447261662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-012-0005-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossmann, Malte10aIntegrated Economic-Hydrologic Assessment of Water Management Options for Regulated Wetlands Under Conditions of Climate Change: A Case Study from the Spreewald (Germany)  ap. 2081-2108.  aThis paper presents an integrated economic-hydrologic approach for the assessment of water management options for wetlands. It is based on a water resources modelling framework for long-term basin planning, that is augmented to model ecosystem service provision levels of wetlands as a function of water availability and water management. The approach is applied to a case study of the Spreewald wetland that is major fen wetland in the mid-reaches of the River Spree (Germany). Different management options at the wetland and basin scale are assessed in a cost-benefit analytical framework regarding their performance under projections of future climatic conditions. The cost-benefit analysis is based on the valuation of important wetland ecosystem services: grassland fodder production, recreational boating, habitat and biodiversity conservation and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. It is found that under future climatic conditions, regulated and drained wetlands such as the Spreewald will require an increasing amount of water to maintain the current levels of benefits derived from the wetlands ecosystem services. Additional inter-basin water transfer could compensate some of the negative effects of increased water demand. However, the assessed transfer option is not economically efficient. Water management approaches that increase the intra-annual water storage in the wetland soils by higher groundwater level regulation targets are found to generate net gains in benefits compared to the current water management without any increase of the water supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aboating 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acost benefit analysis 3aecosystem services 3aforage 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahabitat conservation 3ahigh water table 3aplanning 3arivers 3asoil water storage 3awater currents 3awater management 3awater supply 3awetlands 3aGermany1 aDietrich, Ottfried0 tWater resources management.g2012 May, v. 26, no. 7 p.2081-2108dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-012-0005-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245010600174300001600280520138600296592002801682650001001710650004401720650001501764650001901779650002601798650001701824650000701841650001701848650001901865650000901884650002201893653001701915653002701932653002201959653002001981700002502001700002202026773012602048856008902174852000902263655001202272IND60085384420221116185858.0190410e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008538442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgarwal, Shweta10aSpectroscopic studies of the effects of anticancer drug mitoxantrone interaction with calf-thymus DNA  ap. 177-182.  aMitoxantrone (MTX) (1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis[[2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethyl]amino]-9,10-anthracenedione) is a synthetic antineoplastic drug, widely used as a potent chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of various types of cancer. It is structurally similar to classical anthracyclines. Widespread interest in the anticancer agent mitoxantrone has arisen because of its apparent lower risk of cardio-toxic effects compared to the naturally occurring anthracyclines. In the present work, we investigated the interaction of mitoxantrone with DNA in the buffer solution at physiological pH using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV–Visible absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopic techniques. FTIR analysis revealed the intercalation of mitoxantrone between the DNA base pairs along with its external binding with phosphate–sugar backbone. The binding constant calculated for mitoxantrone–DNA association was found to be 3.88×105M−1 indicating high affinity of drug with DNA double helix. Circular dichroism spectroscopic results suggest that there are no major conformational changes in DNA upon interaction with drug except some perturbations in native B-DNA at local level. The present work shows the capability of spectroscopic analysis to characterize the nature of drug–biomolecule complex and the effects of such interaction on the structure of biomolecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-DNA 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aanthracyclines 3aantineoplastic agents 3adrug therapy 3apH 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3arisk 3aspectral analysis 0aMitoxantrone 0aDNA–drug interaction 0aFTIR spectroscopy 0aCD spectroscopy1 aJangir, Deepak Kumar1 aMehrotra, Ranjana0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2013 Mar. 05, v. 120 p.177-182dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012800164300001600292520129700308592002801605650002301633650001701656650001301673650001601686650001801702650001601720650001101736650004301747650001301790650001201803650001501815700002001830700001901850700001901869700001601888700001801904700001701922700001901939700001901958773010501977856004802082852000902130655001202139IND50064450420221120164254.0130530e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006445042DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-013-0065-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeom, Hyesun10aDetermination of robenidine residues in chicken muscle by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection  ap. 359-365.  aA simple, robust and reliable method for the determination of residual robenidine in chicken muscle using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet (UV) detection was developed and validated according to the Codex Alimentarius Commission guidelines. Chicken muscle was extracted by acetonitrile/formic acid (98:2, v/v) and defatted with hexane. Analytes were isocratically separated on a Luna C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) using 70 % methanol in water containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 30 °C. UV detection was performed at 312 nm. The method was validated by assessing performance parameters including selectivity, linearity, limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, accuracy, recovery, stability and robustness. A calibration curve that was constructed over 0.05–0.5 μg/g showed correlation coefficients of more than 0.999.

Numerous studies have investigated the emerging water-saving irrigation technology of alternate partial root-zone drip irrigation (APDI) on crop yield and WUE. This study investigated the effects of lower soil water thresholds for alteration of the irrigation (LTAI) to the previously dry root-zone on tomato plant growth, yield, and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) under APDI in year 2016 with field plot area of 6.48 m². There were six APDI treatments coded as AS80, AS70, AS60 and AD80, AD70, AD60, indicating APDI under sufficient irrigation (S) or deficit irrigation (D) with LTAI controlled at 80 %, 70 % and 60 % field water capacity (FC) in the previously dry root-zone, respectively. In addition, conventional sufficient (CSD) and deficit (CDD) drip irrigation treatments were added as the controls. The results showed that lowering the irrigation amount significantly reduced tomato plant growth, yield and harvest index, but improved fruit quality in terms of reducing sugar, soluble sugar, vitamin C, and sugar-acid ratio. Compared with that of conventional drip irrigation, the promotion effect of APDI, especially with LTAI at 70 % FC, on root growth was observed in the 0−20 cm top soil layer where more than 90 % of the plant roots were distributed irrespective of irrigation amounts. Under sufficient irrigation, tomato shoot growth and the harvest index showed no significant difference among treatments, but tomato yield and the root to shoot ratio increased significantly in AS70, while fruit quality was improved in AS70 and AS60. Under APDI with deficit irrigation, when LTAI decreased from 80 % FC to 70 % FC in the previously drying root-zone, the yield and IWUE in AD80 and AD70 increased by 8.6 % and 17.4 %, respectively, and thus increased the harvest index compared with CDD. The AD70 treatment saved 31.2 % irrigation water without significant yield reduction, but increased IWUE by 44.9 % compared with the CSD. However, the harvest index and the yield decreased significantly when LTAI decreased from 70 % FC to 60 % FC (AD70 Vs. AD60). In addition, the yield showed no significant difference between AD60 and CDD. Fruit quality increased under APDI as compared with CDD under deficit irrigation, with the best quality appeared in the AD70 and AD60 treatments. These results indicated that the effects of APDI on tomato growth and fruit quality were modulated by LTAI and irrigation amount. APDI with LTAI controlled at 70 % FC was the optimal choice for better yield and fruit quality, especially under deficit irrigation. Unfavorable LTAI could diminish and even eliminate the beneficial effects of APDI on yield and IWUE as compared with conventional drip irrigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3adeficit irrigation 3afreshwater 3afruit quality 3aharvest index 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3amicroirrigation 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aroot shoot ratio 3asoil water 3atomatoes 3atopsoil 3awater conservation 3awater use efficiency 0aLower soil water thresholds for alteration of the irrigation (LTAI) 0aIrrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) 0aRoot distribution 0aYield 0aIrrigation amount1 aLiu, Rui1 aMin, Wei1 aWang, Yao-sheng1 aHong-mei, Yu1 aZhu, Peng-fei1 aZhu, Ji-rong0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 238 p.106200-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1062003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009200167300001200259520129500271592002801566650001601594650001501610650002501625650001401650650004301664650001001707650001201717650001101729650001201740650002101752650002201773650000901795650000901804650001001813651001001823700001801833700002501851700001901876700002201895773013301917856008102050852000902131655001202140IND60572509720221118201005.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057250972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-017-5871-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSāha, Saumena,10aPersistence of acetamiprid in paddy and soil under West Bengal agro-climatic conditions  ap. 150.  aAcetamiprid insecticide has been widely used to control paddy insects. In order to find out the dissipation of acetamiprid residues in paddy (variety: Satabdi), field studies were conducted in Nadia, West Bengal. Acetamiprid (20% SP) was applied twice at 10 g (T₁), 20 g (T₂) and 40 g (T₃) a.i. ha⁻¹ with three replications along with untreated control (T₄). Residue analysis of acetamiprid in paddy (leaf, grain, husk and straw) and soil was conducted utilizing high-pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with UV detector at LOQ of 0.05 mg kg⁻¹. The recoveries of acetamiprid from fortified paddy sample were obtained in the range of 81.8 to 93.1% (for leaf, grain, husk and straw), and for soil, it was 87.2 to 94.3% at the LOQ level and upper two levels of LOQ. The initial residue of acetamiprid (0.11–0.99 mg kg⁻¹) dissipated following the first-order reaction kinetics with the half-life of 1.5 to 1.8 days in paddy leaf and 1.3 to 1.4 days in soil. In harvested samples of paddy straw, grain and soil, the residue was found below LOQ. Because of the rapid dissipation, acetamiprid may be considered to have low risk to the ecosystem. Therefore, the use of acetamiprid for plant protection in paddy may be considered safe for food and environmental health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetamiprid 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3ahalf life 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahulls 3ainsects 3aleaves 3apaddies 3aplant protection 3areaction kinetics 3arisk 3asoil 3astraw 3aIndia1 aMondal, Rahul1 aMukherjee, Subhadeep1 aSarkar, Mitali1 aKole, Ramen Kumar0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2017 Apr., v. 189, no. 4 p.150-150dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-5871-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010200172520146300274592002801737650001401765650001101779650001101790653002601801653001201827653002301839653003201862653002101894653002401915653001501939653002401954653000901978653000801987653000801995653000802003653000802011653000702019653000802026653000702034653000702041653000902048653000902057653000702066653000702073653000702080653001202087653000902099653000802108653000802116653000802124653000802132653000902140653000902149700001902158700003102177773009802208856008702306852000902393655001202402IND60720015320221120050802.0220404e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072001532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1162742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPusceddu, Elian10aSynergies between energy arbitrage and fast frequency response for battery energy storage systems  aEnergy storage can make key contributions to balancing future low-carbon energy systems by providing a variety of energy system services, with batteries expected to be widely deployed as costs fall with innovation. This paper assesses whether synergies exist between two of the most significant of these services, fast frequency response and energy arbitrage, if a battery energy storage system (BESS) is used to deliver both. A techno-economic model is developed to simulate 600 possible fast frequency response availability windows. Results show that two distinct synergies exist between the two services. The first synergy accounts for the possibility of charging outside the deadband for delivering fast frequency response. We propose an innovative state-of-charge management strategy to exploit this synergy. The second synergy results from energy arbitrage revenues being highly concentrated around peak times, which can enable a battery system to capture most of the arbitrage revenues without an excessive reduction in revenues from capacity provision with enhanced frequency response. The combination of these two synergies means that a battery system could increase its operating profits by 25% by delivering arbitrage and frequency response alternately. This result is shown to be statistically robust using historical data. A battery system able to discharge for 1.5–2 h at its full power rating will most most likely optimise these synergies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aenergy 3amodels 0aEnergy storage system 0aBattery 0aAncillary services 0aBattery management strategy 0aRenewable energy 0aElectricity storage 0aSmart grid 0aEnergy system model 0aBESS 0aDoD 0aEAW 0aEFR 0aE/P 0aEn 0aFFR 0aMC 0aMP 0aMWhb 0aMWhs 0apb 0aPn 0aps 0aPtarget 0aNGET 0aSPM 0aSoC 0aTSO 0aVRE 0aVRFB 0aηrt1 aZakeri, Behnam1 aCastagneto Gissey, Giorgio0 tApplied energy.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 283 p.116274-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1162743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009600166300001600262520130100278592002801579650001201607650001301619650002201632650002101654650002601675650003301701650002001734650001501754651001801769700001801787700002401805700001801829700001701847700001801864773008701882856008401969852000902053655001202062IND60549019820221121233401.0160906e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054901982DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-15-0457-FE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcRoberts, N.14aThe Evolution of a Process for Selecting and Prioritizing Plant Diseases for Recovery Plans  ap. 665-671.  aOne element of the cost of dealing with invasive species in the United States is the recovery from the arrival of exotic plant pathogens. We review the development of a process used to prioritize plant diseases for the federally mandated United State Department of Agriculture National Plant Disease Recovery System. A team of university, government, and industry scientists worked together over a 10-year period to develop a science-based objective approach to the challenge of effectively preparing for recovery plans from introduced pathogens, when the timing of the introduction of any single disease is unknown. Over time, the process transitioned from ad hoc, in which recovery plans were written when the relevant experts were able to do so, to a formally organized group-prioritization effort from which emerged the concept of generic recovery plan templates for groups of pathogens and diseases that have similar biological characteristics, and therefore, similar management approaches. Key characteristics for each template were determined through a multivariate analysis for 14 plant diseases for which a recovery plan already existed. The process was validated by a larger group of 15 plant pathologists, for which results were compared with those scored by 14 subject matter experts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperts 3aindustry 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3amultivariate analysis 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant pathogens 3ascientists 3aUnited States1 aThomas, C.

However, these therapeutic modalities suffer from compromised treatment efficacy owing to their limited generation of highly reactive ROS in a tumor microenvironment (TME). In this work, a nanoscale iron-based metal–organic framework, MIL-101(Fe), is synthesized as a Fenton nanocatalyst to perform the catalytic conversion of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) under the acidic environment and as a biocompatible and biodegradable nanocarrier to deliver a 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) photosensitizer for light-activated singlet oxygen (¹O₂) generation. By coupling such chemodynamic/photodynamic effects, the photosensitizer-integrated nanoagents (MIL-101(Fe)@TCPP) could enable more ROS production within tumors to induce amplified oxidative damage for tumor-specific synergistic therapy. In vitro results show that MIL-101(Fe)@TCPP nanoagents achieve the acid-responsive CDT and effective PDT, and synergistic CDT/PDT provides an enhanced therapeutic effect. Ultimately, based on such synergistic therapy, MIL-101(Fe)@TCPP nanoagents cause a significant tumor growth inhibition in vivo without severe side effects, showing great potential for anti-tumor application.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acoordination polymers 3adeath 3agrowth retardation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananocarriers 3ananocatalysts 3aneoplasms 3aoxidative stress 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aporphyrins 3asinglet oxygen 0achemodynamic therapy 0ametal−organic framework 0aphotodynamic therapy 0aporphyrin 0atumor1 aWang, Yitong1 aNiu, Huicong1 aWang, Yuwei1 aWu, Aijun1 aShu, Chaoqin1 aZhu, Yufang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9031-88611 aBian, Yuhai1 aLin, Kaili0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Sept. 16, v. 13, no. 38 p.45201-45213dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c110323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245013500159300001800294500002000312520157300332592002801905650002301933650001401956650002001970650001001990650001102000650001102011650001902022650002102041650001502062650001502077650003502092650000902127650000902136650001502145650001802160700002002178700001902198700001802217700001902235773013602254856007202390852000902462655001202471IND60595553820221119170409.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059555382DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.41072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolding, Lisa A.10aToxicity of dissolved and precipitated forms of barium to a freshwater alga (Chlorella sp. 12) and water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia)  ap. 1632-1642.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBarium is present at elevated concentrations in oil and gas produced waters, and there is no international water quality guideline value to assess the potential risk of adverse effects to aquatic biota. Sulfate concentration largely controls the solubility of barium in aquatic systems, with insoluble barium sulfate (barite) assumed to be less bioavailable and less toxic than dissolved barium. We exposed aquatic biota to dissolved barium only and to a mixture of dissolved and precipitated barium. The chronic dissolved barium 48‐h growth rate inhibition effect concentrations, (EC10 and EC50) for the tropical freshwater alga Chlorella sp. 12 were 40 mg/L (27–54 mg/L 95% confidence limits [CL]), and 240 mg/L (200–280 mg/L 95% CL), respectively. The acute EC10 and EC50 values for 48‐h immobilization of the water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia) by dissolved barium were 14 mg/L (13–15 mg/L 95% CL) and 17 mg/L (16–18 mg/L 95% CL), respectively. Chlorella sp. 12 was significantly more sensitive to precipitated barium than to dissolved barium, whereas the opposite seemed likely for C. dubia. Ceriodaphnia dubia was predicted to be chronically sensitive to dissolved barium at concentrations measured in produced waters and receiving waters, based on a predicted chronic EC10 of 1.7 mg/L derived from the acute EC50/10. Further chronic toxicity data that account for barium toxicity in dissolved and precipitated forms are required to derive a barium guideline for freshwater biota.

In this paper, three functionalized halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) named p-HNTs (treated by KH 560), b-HNTs (in situ grafted by benzidine) and d-HNTs (in situ grafted by 4,4′-(1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diyidioxy)dianiline) were used to fabricate thermally conductive epoxy/HNTs nanodielectrics with a high impact strength. It was found that the surface modification of HNTs play very important roles in enhancing the mechanical, thermal and dielectric properties of epoxy nanodielectrics. The obtained epoxy/b-HNTs nanodielectrics with 60 wt% filler presented the highest thermal conductivity of 0.85 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ (about 30% higher than that of epoxy/HNTs nanodielectrics). The impact strength of epoxy/b-HNTs nanodielectrics is about 5.8 kJ m⁻², 1.5 times that of epoxy/HNTs nanodielectrics. The epoxy/b-HNTs nanodielectrics also possessed excellent thermal stability and electrical insulation properties. In summary, the epoxy/b-HNTs nanodielectrics showed the best overall performance among all epoxy thermosets/in situ grafting HNTs. The results of the SEM images showed that the improved physical properties of epoxy nanodielectrics were attributed to the increased interaction between in situ grafted HNTs and the epoxy matrix and better dispersion of the in situ grafted HNTs in the epoxy matrix. The results suggested that the obtained epoxy nanodielectrics might be promising as efficient heat-releasing materials for thermal management and next generation electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric properties 3aelectronic equipment 3aepoxides 3ahalloysite 3aimpact strength 3aindustry 3ainsulating materials 3ananotubes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal conductivity 3athermal stability1 aYang, Ke1 aLi, Shengtao1 aJiang, Pingkai0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 21, v. 6, no. 73 p.69569-69579dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra06717d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013000156520138100286592002801667650001501695650001701710650001301727650001701740650002901757650002101786650001401807650001401821650001001835650001801845650001701863651001201880700002101892700002801913773012001941856007402061852000902135655001202144IND60754424620221121055204.0211023e20211017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075442462DNAL7 a10.3390/w132029212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZin, Nwe Nwe10aNetwork Model Analysis of Residual Chlorine to Reduce Disinfection Byproducts in Water Supply Systems in Yangon City, Myanmar  aIn Yangon City, chlorination commenced in January 2020 to supply drinkable water; therefore, there is as yet no information on chlorine decay and DBP formation in the water supply system. This study aimed to find methods to optimize chlorine dosage in Yangon City. Onsite sampling and laboratory analyses of residual chlorine and trihalomethane (THM) formation, as well as water quality simulations, were conducted to find the chlorine decay and THM formation kinetics. Due to a high chlorine dose of 2 mg/L for both pre- and post-chlorination, disinfection was effective despite the low removal efficiency of turbidity. However, THMs were found in high levels in both treated and tap water due to the high THM formation potential of raw water. The re-contamination and/or transformation of dissolved organic matter were found in the distribution network by increases in specific ultraviolet absorption (SUVA) values and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorophores, which brought about variations of THMs in the networks. The EPANET models were run assuming there to be no water leakages; it was found that the chlorine dose could be decreased to 0.8 mg/L to meet the guidelines for THMs and residual chlorine. The methods employed in this study could be also applied in other water supply systems in tropical developing countries with limited water quality monitoring data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achlorination 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic matter 3afluorescent dyes 3atap water 3aturbidity 3awater 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aMyanmar1 aKazama, Shinobu 1 aTakizawa, Sq(Satoshi),0 tWater.g2021 Oct. 17, v. 13, no. 20dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132029213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245013400177300001600311520152200327592002801849650004401877650002201921650003701943650001501980650001501995650001902010650001402029650001202043650001502055650001302070650001302083650001102096650000702107650002302114650003702137653003002174653001302204653001502217653003402232653001702266700002402283700001502307700002302322700006102345773007702406856008902483852000902572655001202581IND60558410720221121235825.0170105e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055841072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudcová, Barbora10aSorption mechanisms of arsenate on Mg-Fe layered double hydroxides: A combination of adsorption modeling and solid state analysis  ap. 539-548.  aLayered double hydroxides have been proposed as effective sorbents for As(V), but studies investigating adsorption mechanisms usually lack a comprehensive mechanistic/modeling approach. In this work, we propose coupling surface complexation modeling with various spectroscopic techniques. To this end, a series of batch experiments at different pH values were performed. Kinetic data were well fitted by a pseudo-second order kinetic model, and the equilibrium data were fitted by the Freundlich model. Moreover, the pH-dependent As(V) sorption data were satisfactorily fitted by a diffuse layer model, which described the formation of >SOAsO3H− monodentate and >(SO)2AsO2− bidentate inner-sphere complexes (“>S” represents a crystallographically-bound group on the surface). Additionally, XPS analyses confirmed the adsorption mechanisms. The sorption mechanisms were affected by anion exchange, which was responsible for the formation of outer sphere complexes, as identified by XRD and FTIR analyses. Furthermore, a homogenous distribution of As(V) was determined by HR-TEM with elemental mapping. Using low-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy on isotope 57Fe, a slight shift of the hyperfine parameters towards higher values following As(V) sorption was measured, indicating a higher degree of structural disorder. In general, mechanistic adsorption modeling coupled with solid state analyses presents a powerful approach for investigating the adsorption mechanism of As(V) on Mg-Fe LDH or other sorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanion exchange 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3ahydroxides 3aisotopes 3akinetics 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aLayered double hydroxides 0aArsenate 0aAdsorption 0aSurface complexation modeling 0aSpectroscopy1 aVeselská, Veronika1 aFilip, Jan1 aČíhalová, Sylva1 aKomárek, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3644-99610 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 168 p.539-548dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014300160520130600303592002801609650001401637650001301651650001401664650001301678650002301691650001401714650001301728650001001741700002501751700002301776700002101799700002201820773012901842856007501971852000902046655001202055IND60787869220221121091812.0220811e20220728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078786922DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141536232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouriou, David 10aExperimental Parametric Study of a Functional-Magnetic Material Designed for the Monitoring of Corrosion in Reinforced Concrete Structures  aThe presence of aggressive agents (such as chloride ions brought by seawater) in reinforced concrete structures is responsible for the corrosion of the steel rebars. A Structural Health Monitoring technology is developed as a new passive preventive method that would allow for the detection of and for the ability to follow the presence of chloride ions in the cover concrete of reinforced concrete. This technology, referenced as Functional Magnetic Material (FMM), consists on the measurement with an external interrogator of a Magnetic Observable (MO), partially shielded by a patch and corrodible by chloride ions. This paper presents the results of a parametric experimental study, allowing the validation of the concept of this technology, by highlighting the variation of the MO while considering the geometry and the corrosion level of the patch (based on its Relative Mass Loss—RML), as well as the distance between the samples and the interrogator. The results show that the MO of the FMM significantly varies with the increase in the RML of the patch. A 10%-RML for the patch is sufficient for detecting a variation of the MO of the FMM, and the relative variations of the MO are strongly dependent on the distance between the FMM and the magnetometer, as well as the patch’s thickness.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3aconcrete 3acorrosion 3ageometry 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3aseawater 3asteel1 aKadkhodazadeh, Sima 1 aDérobert, Xavier 1 aGuilbert, David 1 aIhamouten, Amine 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 28, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141536233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011500170300001300285520221400298592002802512650002902540650001702569650002002586650002502606650001302631650001102644650001602655650001302671650001502684650001702699650001202716651001602728700002002744700002202764773008602786856008402872852000902956655001202965IND60085232920221122104709.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008523292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2012.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Craig J.10aMultiple methods, maps, and management applications: Purpose made seafloor maps in support of ocean management  ap. 1-13.  aThe establishment of multibeam echosounders (MBES) as a mainstream tool in ocean mapping has facilitated integrative approaches toward nautical charting, benthic habitat mapping, and seafloor geotechnical surveys. The inherent bathymetric and backscatter information generated by MBES enables marine scientists to present highly accurate bathymetric data with a spatial resolution closely matching that of terrestrial mapping. Furthermore, developments in data collection and processing of MBES backscatter, combined with the quality of the co-registered depth information, have resulted in the increasing preferential use of multibeam technology over conventional sidescan sonar for the production of benthic habitat maps. A range of post-processing approaches can generate customized map products to meet multiple ocean management needs, thus extracting maximum value from a single survey data set. Based on recent studies over German Bank off SW Nova Scotia, Canada, we show how primary MBES bathymetric and backscatter data, along with supplementary data (i.e. in situ video and stills), were processed using a variety of methods to generate a series of maps. Methods conventionally used for classification of multi-spectral data were tested for classification of the MBES data set to produce a map summarizing broad bio-physical characteristics of the seafloor (i.e. a benthoscape map), which is of value for use in many aspects of marine spatial planning. A species-specific habitat map for the sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus was also generated from the MBES data by applying a Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) method to spatially predict habitat suitability, which offers tremendous promise for use in fisheries management. In addition, we explore the challenges of incorporating benthic community data into maps based on species information derived from a large number of seafloor photographs. Through the process of applying multiple methods to generate multiple maps for management applications, we demonstrate the efficient use of survey data sets to maximize the benefit to a wide number of potential end users, and to facilitate the move toward an ecosystem-based approach to management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlacopecten magellanicus 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3afisheries management 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aphotographs 3aplanning 3ascientists 3aspatial data 3asurveys 3aNova Scotia1 aSameoto, J.

The aim of the research is to substantiate the advantages of combining duck meat of regional origin with other types of raw materials in meat-containing cooked smoked sausages. A model for studying of the feasibility of combining duck meat of regional origin with other raw materials was a recipe for cooked smoked sausage containing meat of the Muscovy duck and also including pork hearts, salted pork side-fat, soybean isolates, pork skin protein, edible albumin “Aprored.” In the model samples of forcemeat for meat-containing cooked smoked sausages, functional and technological properties have been determined according to standard methods. The biological food value of the finished products has been determined as well. The analysis of the results confirms that the combination of Muscovy duck meat and protein-containing secondary raw materials improves the moisture content, water-holding capacity, emulsifying ability, and stability of the emulsion. The study of the microbiological parameters of the sausages developed has indicated that the number of mesophilic aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms (MAFAM) in all the samples studied was within the normal limits. The study of the number of bacteria of the E. coli group has not detected these microorganisms in any of the samples. For the ω-6 and ω-3 family, its high biological value as for the content of essential amino acids and its biological effectiveness as for the fatty acids have been confirmed. It has been proved that duck meat can be combined with traditional types of meat and vegetable raw materials to increase the biological effectiveness of meat-containing cooked smoked sausages. It has been determined that when Muscovy duck meat is combined with non-meat kinds of protein-containing raw material (pork skin protein, soybean isolate) as part of meat-containing cooked smoked sausage, it allows producing nutritious food with high quality characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCairina moschata 3aEscherichia coli 3aalbumins 3aanimals 3aduck meat 3aemulsions 3amodels 3anutritive value 3apork 3araw materials 3asoybeans 3avegetables 3awater content 3awater holding capacity 0amuscovy duck 0ameat-containing cooked smoked sausage 0afunctional-technological indicators1 aBozhko, N.1 aTischenko, V.1 aKotliar, Ye.0 tHarčova nauka ì tehnologìâ.g2018 Dec., v. 12, no. 4dOdesa National University of TechnologywJournal:27799x2409-70047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15673/fst.v12i4.12073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002700141245011600168300001600284506002800300520138000328592002801708506003701736650001401773650001501787650001801802650001401820650002101834650001701855650001601872650001101888650001201899650001601911650001101927653002501938653001801963653001301981653001201994773011102006856007602117852000902193655001202202IND60774915520221207064105.0191205e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077491552DNAL7 a10.22146/ipas.371362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarini, Maria Theresia10aEffects of Different Types and Dosage of Green Mulch on Yield and Quality of Aloe vera L. on Coastal Sandy Soil  ap. 103-109.  aResource is Open Access  aA complete content of chemical substance from Aloe vera leaf makes this plant has many functions such as the ingredient of functional food for health, cosmetics, and herbal medicines. This research was aimed to determine the yield and quality of Aloe vera L. on various types and rates of green mulch in coastal sandy soil. The research was conducted in coastal sandy soil of Poncosari Srandakan, Bantul, Yogyakarta and done in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) of two factors with three replications. The first factor was four types of green mulch (shrimp evergreen, cashew, acasia and gliricidia). The second factor was various rate of green mulch consisted of three levels rates of leave mulch (5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 tons ha-1). Soil without mulching was used as a control treatment. The variables observed were yield at the first harvest time and leaf content quality which includes water, protein, fat, carbohydrate, ash, fiber, and mineral (Ca, Fe and Zn). The results showed that there was interaction between types and rates of leave mulch in all variables observed. Gliricidia leaf mulch gave the best effect with optimum rate about of 10 ton ha-1. The effectiveness of green mulch abilities on improving the observed variables from higher order to low was gliricidia, acasia, cashew and shrimp-type evergreen with the rate range between 10 up to 15 tons ha-1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAloe vera 3aGliricidia 3acarbohydrates 3acosmetics 3afunctional foods 3aharvest date 3aingredients 3aleaves 3amulches 3asandy soils 3ashrimp 0afunctional food crop 0aorganic mulch 0anutrient 0abiomass0 tIlmu pertanian.g2019 Nov., v. 4, no. 3 p.103-109dUniversitas Gadjah MadawJournal:22161x2527-71627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22146/ipas.371363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012200163300001800285500001900303500002000322520127300342592002801615596005901643596007001702650002001772650002601792650001701818650001901835650001301854650001901867650001401886650001701900650001601917650001601933650001601949650000701965650001501972650001901987650001602006650002002022650001602042700001302058700001602071700001702087700005702104700005702161773015702218856007902375852000902454655001202463IND60730233920221120184802.0210305e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073023392DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.127242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Peiqing10aHigh pressure processing combined with selected hurdles: Enhancement in the inactivation of vegetative microorganisms  ap. 1800-1828.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHigh pressure processing (HPP) as a nonthermal processing (NTP) technology can ensure microbial safety to some extent without compromising food quality. However, for vegetative microorganisms, the existence of pressure‐resistant subpopulations, the revival of sublethal injury (SLI) state cells, and the resuscitation of viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state cells may constitute potential food safety risks and pose challenges for the further development of HPP application. HPP combined with selected hurdles, such as moderately elevated or low temperature, low pH, natural antimicrobials (bacteriocin, lactate, reuterin, endolysin, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase system, chitosan, essential oils), or other NTP (CO₂, UV‐TiO₂ photocatalysis, ultrasound, pulsed electric field, ultrafiltration), have been highlighted as feasible alternatives to enhance microbial inactivation (synergistic or additive effect). These combinations can effectively eliminate the pressure‐resistant subpopulation, reduce the population of SLI or VBNC state cells and inhibit their revival or resuscitation. This review provides an updated overview of the microbial inactivation by the combination of HPP and selected hurdles and restructures the possible inactivation mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data  a31930087cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFD0400500cNational Key Research & Development Plan of China 3aadditive effect 3aanti-infective agents 3abacteriocins 3acarbon dioxide 3achitosan 3aelectric field 3aendolysin 3afood quality 3afood safety 3alactic acid 3alactoferrin 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aphotocatalysis 3atemperature 3aultrafiltration 3aultrasonics1 aRao, Lei1 aZhao, Liang1 aWu, Xiaomeng1 aWang, Yongtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6003-58601 aLiao, Xiaojun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6231-293X0 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2021 Mar., v. 20, no. 2 p.1800-1828dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.127243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008600160520213600246592002802382650001202410650001502422650002802437650001502465650001402480650002002494650001802514650002402532650001202556650002602568650002202594650001402616651001302630700002502643700002302668700002102691773012902712856007502841852000902916655001202925IND60787869420221121091834.0220811e20220728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078786942DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141536252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotelho, Jonas 10aMapping Roads in the Brazilian Amazon with Artificial Intelligence and Sentinel-2  aThis study presents our efforts to automate the detection of unofficial roads (herein, roads) in the Brazilian Amazon using artificial intelligence (AI). In this region, roads are built by loggers, goldminers, and unauthorized land settlements from existing official roads, expanding over pristine forests and leading to new deforestation and fire hotspots. Previous research used visual interpretation, hand digitization, and vector editing techniques to create a thorough Amazon Road Dataset (ARD) from Landsat imagery. The ARD allowed assessment of the road dynamics and impacts on deforestation, landscape fragmentation, and fires and supported several scientific and societal applications. This research used the existing ARD to train and model a modified U-Net algorithm to detect rural roads in the Brazilian Amazon using Sentinel-2 imagery from 2020 in the Azure Planetary Computer platform. Moreover, we implemented a post-AI detection protocol to connect and vectorize the U-Net road detected to create a new ARD. We estimated the recall and precision accuracy using an independent ARD dataset, obtaining 65% and 71%, respectively. Visual interpretation of the road detected with the AI algorithm suggests that the accuracy is underestimated. The reference dataset does not include all roads that the AI algorithm can detect in the Sentinel-2 imagery. We found an astonishing footprint of roads in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, with 3.46 million km of roads mapped in 2020. Most roads are in private lands (~55%) and 25% are in open public lands under land grabbing pressure. The roads are also expanding over forested areas with 41% cut or within 10 km from the roads, leaving 59% of the 3.1 million km² of the remaining original forest roadless. Our AI and post-AI models fully automated road detection in rural areas of the Brazilian Amazon, making it possible to operationalize road monitoring. We are using the AI road map to understand better rural roads’ impact on new deforestation, fires, and landscape fragmentation and to support societal and policy applications for forest conservation and regional planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aautomation 3acomputers 3adata collection 3adeforestation 3aforest conservation 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aissues and policy 3aprotocols 3aAmazonia1 aCosta, Stefany C.

In this study, subcritical water extraction was used for the extraction of different aronia parts in order to explore their potential. Stems, leaves and berries of Aronia melanocarpa were extracted under the following conditions: temperature 130 °C; pressure 35 bar; time 20 min. The total phenols and flavonoid contents of the produced extracts were evaluated by conventional spectrophotometric methods. Additionally, the main phenolic compounds were also identified and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The biological potential of the extracts was evaluated by determining their antioxidant (DPPH, ABTS and lipid peroxidation assays), antimicrobial, enzyme inhibitory (cholinesterase and elastase) and cytotoxic effects (HeLa, A-549, LS-174T, MRC-5 cell lines). The results indicate that leaves and berries extracts exhibited stronger antioxidant action when compared with stems. The strongest cholinesterase and elastase inhibitory activity was also found in berries extract. Similarly, the extracts obtained from leaves and berries showed considerable cytotoxic effects against tested cell lines. A moderate antimicrobial effects was observed too. Demonstrated biological potential of all three aronia parts can trace a new road map for developing newly designed functional products.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aAronia melanocarpa 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acell lines 3achemical composition 3acholinesterase 3acytotoxicity 3adiodes 3aelastase 3aenzyme inhibition 3aflavonoids 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro studies 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3asmall fruits 3astems 3atemperature 0aSubcritical water extraction 0aAronia 0aHPLC 0aAntioxidants 0aEnzyme inhibitors 0aCytotoxicity 0aAntimicrobial activity1 aZengin, Gökhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6548-78231 aZeković, Zoran1 aŠvarc-Gajić, Jaroslava,1 aRažić, Slavica1 aDamjanović, Ana1 aMašković, Pavle1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7566-28401 aMitić, Milan0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2018 Nov., v. 121 p.458-466dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2018.09.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014400172300001400316520159600330592002801926650002001954650001101974650001001985650001901995650001402014650001402028650001602042650001902058651001302077700001902090700003902109700002402148700002102172773008702193856008402280852000902364655001202373IND60085233020221122133540.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008523302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2012.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinagre, Catarina10aEffect of handling, confinement and crowding in HSP70 production in Pachygrapsus marmoratus, a model species for climate change experiments  ap. 64-68.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of handling, confinement and crowding on HSP70 production in an intertidal crab. HSP70 has been widely used as a biochemical indicator of thermal stress; however studies on the effect of experimental conditions and handling on HSP70 expression are very scarce. The response of marbled crab, Pachygrapsus marmoratus, collected in the Portuguese coast, was investigated through an experiment in captivity, where 42 juveniles (10–19mm of carapace width) were confined in an experimental container (60×42×10cm) and exposed to three treatments: 1) increasing temperatures and periodic handling, 2) only to periodic handling and 3) no handling, for 12h. The objective of this work was to investigate whether the HSP70 production measured in an increasing temperature experiment is a response to temperature alone or whether manipulation, confinement and crowding during the experiment also increase HSP70 production. Three individuals were sampled after t=0, t=4, t=6, t=8, t=10 and t=12h, for the quantification of HSP70 production in the hemolymph, in the three trials. It was concluded that while temperature has a significant effect on HSP70 production, periodic handling does not, nor does confinement to the experimental container or crowding. It can thus be concluded that experimental conditions and handling are not parasitic variables in experiments with this species considering increasing temperatures. P. marmoratus can thus be used as a model species in climate warming experiments involving handling, confinement and crowding.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaptive animals 3acoasts 3acrabs 3aglobal warming 3ahemolymph 3ajuveniles 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3aPortugal1 aMadeira, Diana1 aNarciso, Luís Filipe Castanheira,1 aCabral, Henrique N.1 aDiniz, Mário S.0 tJournal of sea research.g2012 Aug., v. 72 p.64-68dElsevier B.V.x1385-11017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2012.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009800174520134700272592002801619650001101647650000901658650001101667650001701678650002101695653002901716653002001745653002701765653002901792653002301821653001601844700002201860700001801882700003001900700002501930773009801955856008702053852000902140655001202149IND60720015720221120050800.0220404e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072001572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1162862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaletti, Costanza10aEnabling smart control by optimally managing the State of Charge of district heating networks  aDigitalization and smart control of district heating networks are emerging as key features to make these systems flexible and optimal. However, since effective and scalable methods for large-scale systems are currently unavailable, the implementation of smart controllers can be challenging and time-consuming. This is addressed herein by proposing a novel approach to include the thermal capacity of the connected buildings in the optimal control of large-scale heating networks. A reduced-order model of the aggregated communities supplied by a large-scale network is used to define their State of Charge, which is exploited to store or retrieve energy when convenient, while maintaining indoor comfort. This concept is included in a Model Predictive Controller that optimizes power plant management and heat distribution. The results show that the controller successfully shaves heat supply peaks to different regions up to 16% and reduces the difference between distribution and soil temperature up to 20%. At the same time, the return temperature is kept close to the set-point of 35 °C, which is lower than the historical operation and further reduces distribution heat losses. The procedure can be easily replicated to optimize systems of different sizes and to support their transition to efficient, smart district heating networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat 3amodels 3apower plants 3asoil temperature 0aDistrict heating network 0aState of Charge 0aBuilding heat capacity 0aModel predictive control 0aOptimal management 0aScalability1 aZimmerman, Nathan1 aMorini, Mirko1 aKyprianidis, Konstantinos1 aGambarotta, Agostino0 tApplied energy.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 283 p.116286-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1162863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01971naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014300157300001800300520075100318592002801069650002801097650002301125650001201148650001501160650002601175650001701201650002101218650001901239650002801258700001601286700001301302700001601315700002401331700001701355773013001372856007401502852000901576655001201585IND60666687020221119215355.0190917e20190912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066668702DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay01390c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Wenhui10aDevelopment of an endoplasmic reticulum-targeting fluorescent probe for the two-photon imaging of hypochlorous acid (HClO) in living cells  ap. 4450-4455.  aAs an important reactive oxygen species, hypochlorous acid (HClO) could irreversibly destroy Ca²⁺-ATPase to inhibit Ca²⁺ transport in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which may eventually lead to cell dysfunction and cell death. Herein, we present a novel ER-targeting fluorescent probe (NHS-ER) for the two-photon detection of HClO in living cells. NHS-ER was constructed using naphthalimide and showed strong green fluorescence. In response to HClO, the fluorescence intensity at 502 nm gradually decreased, and the probe showed excellent selectivity to HClO over other biologically relevant ROS. Moreover, the probe NHS-ER showed ER-targeting properties and could be successfully applied to the two-photon imaging of HClO in living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3aanalytical methods 3acalcium 3acell death 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3areactive oxygen species1 aDong, Baoli1 aLu, Yaru1 aKong, Xiuqi1 aMehmood, Abdul Hadi1 aLin, Weiying0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Sept. 12, v. 11, no. 35 p.4450-4455dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay01390c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01739naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245007200171300001600243520071300259592002800972650002501000650002501025650002201050650001901072650001201091650001301103650002301116651001401139700002001153700002101173773014101194856005701335852000901392655001201401IND4479668920221118035305.0120418e199512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447966892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8489.1995.tb00554.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlamey, R.K.10aRespondents to contingent valuation surveys: consumers or citizens?  ap. 263-288.  aThe fundamental assumption of the contingent valuation method (CYM) is that responses to CY questionnaires may be interpreted as expressions of consumer preferences. The consumer preference interpretation has been challenged in recent papers arguing that willingness to pay for wildlife preservation is generated, at least in part, by ethical concerns, rather than by a view that wildlife preservation will yield any benefit to individual respondents. Some further evidence bearing upon these questions is derived from a study of forest management in Australia undertaken by the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC).

Intact viruses (Murine Norovirus-1 [MNV-1] and human NoV GII.4), virus like particles (VLPs) and P particles (expressed in vitro from the protruding domain of the viral capsid) of NoVs were used in this study. Following heat treatment, no significant difference of viral titer of MNV-1 versus NoV GII.4 was observed by RNase One RT-PCR or cell-binding RT-PCR, although cell-binding RT-PCR (to measure the capsid functions) revealed higher reductions than RNase One RT-PCR (to measure the capsid integrity). These results indicate that the function assay for receptor binding is more sensitive than the capsid integrity assay to measure the protected viral RNA. MNV-1 could be used as a surrogate for human NoVs by heat inactivation from the perspective of capsid integrity and/or functions. The heat resistance varied among different GI and GII NoV strains when their P particles were studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorovirus 3aRNA 3acapsid 3aheat inactivation 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3ahumans 3amice 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribonucleases 3aviral load 3aviruses1 aBaert, Leen1 aXia, Ming1 aZhong, Weiming1 aVan Coillie, Els1 aJiang, Xi1 aUyttendaele, Mieke0 tJournal of virological methods.g2012 Apr., v. 181, no. 1 p.1-5dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245007500174300001600249520146900265592002801734650001501762650001301777650003101790650001201821650002001833650002501853650001701878650002101895650001101916650002201927650000901949650002101958650004001979653001902019653001302038653001202051653002802063653001702091653002102108700001802129700002902147700002802176700002902204700003002233700006702263773011202330856008202442852000902524655001202533IND60616065920221119170826.0190401e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061606592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2018.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvila-Rojas, Sabino H.10aCurcumin prevents potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7)-induced renal hypoxia  ap. 472-482.  aCurcumin exhibits several therapeutic properties. Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7)-induced nephropathy is associated with oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species production affects renal oxygenation that may participate in the progression of renal damage. The aim of the present work was to elucidate whether K2Cr2O7-induced nephropathy is associated to partial O2 pressure (pO2) impairment and if curcumin is able to prevent it. Four groups of rats were studied: control group; K2Cr2O7 group (12.5 mg/kg, s.c.); curcumin + K2Cr2O7 group, in which animals were treated with curcumin (400 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 10 days before K2Cr2O7 injection; and curcumin group. All animals were sacrificed 48 h after the end of the treatments. K2Cr2O7 administration increased renal function markers and decreased glomerular filtration rate, pO2 and renal perfusion. Concerning hemodynamic parameters, K2Cr2O7 increased mean arterial pressure and renal vascular resistance and reduced renal blood flow. The hemodynamic changes were attributed to decreased availability of nitric oxide and increased 3-nitrotyrosine levels. Moreover, increased superoxide anion production and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were observed after K2Cr2O7 administration. Curcumin attenuated all the above-described alterations. Our results suggest that the protective effects of curcumin in K2Cr2O7-induced nephropathy are associated with its ability to prevent O2 supply reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3acurcumin 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahypoxia 3akidney diseases 3amedicinal properties 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aprotective effect 3arats 3asuperoxide anion 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aNephrotoxicity 0aCurcumin 0aHypoxia 0aPartial oxygen pressure 0aNitric oxide 0aRenal blood flow1 aTapia, Edilia1 aBriones-Herrera, Alfredo1 aAparicio-Trejo, Omar E.1 aLeón-Contreras, Juan C.1 aHernández-Pando, Rogelio1 aPedraza-Chaverri, José1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6628-44110 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2018 Nov., v. 121 p.472-482dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2018.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245007700130300001300207506002800220520144700248592002801695506003701723650001101760650001401771650001301785650001101798650001401809650001301823653002501836653001201861653003201873700002401905773013701929852000902066655001202075IND60774915920221207064102.0101103e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077491592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriyono, Joko10aDissolution Kinetics of Milled-Silicate Rock Fertilizers in Organic Acid  ap. 1-10.  aResource is Open Access  aA dissolution experiment was carried out to identify the effects of milling condition on dissolution kinetics of silicate rock fertilizers. Initially ground materials (Ø < 250 μm for basalt, dolerite, gneiss, and Ø < 150 μm for K-feldspar) were further milled with a ball mill (Spex 8000) under dry and wet conditions for 10, 60, and 120 minutes. The rock powders were dissolved in a mixture of 0.01M acetic-citric acid at a rock powder/solvent ratio of 1/1000, and the solution was agitated continuously on a rotary shaker at 25o C. The concentrations of dissolved Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, and Si from the milled rocks were determined at intervals from 1 hour up to 56 days. Results indicated that the relationships of quantity of dissolved rock and elemental plant nutrients (Et) with time (t) were well described by a power equation: Et = Eo + atn with reaction order (n) of 0.3 – 0.8. Milling increased quantity of total and individual dissolved element (Et), dissolution rate (Rt), the proportion of rapidly soluble rock or element (Eo), and dissolution constant a. The increases in dissolution due to dry milling were larger than for wet milling. Although further proves should be provided, results of this dissolution experiment clearly indicates that SRFs may be used as multinutrient fertilizers as well as remedial materials for acidic soils; and dry milling may be applied as an appropriate method for manufacturing effective SRFs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasalt 3aequations 3afeldspar 3agneiss 3asilicates 3asolvents 0aDissolution kinetics 0amilling 0aorganic acid silicate rocks1 aGilkes, Robert John0 tJurnal tanah Tropika dan Kualitas Lingkungan.g2008 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.1-10dUniversity of LampungwJournal:27737x2086-66827nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012000165300002000285520145700305592002801762650001901790650001701809650001201826650002301838650001701861650001601878650002701894650001901921650001801940650001901958650001001977650002701987650001802014650001002032650002302042653001202065653002702077653002702104700001902131700001502150700001702165700005602182773014602238856008502384852000902469655001202478IND60677662820221123040318.0191202e20191106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067766282DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b061692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lin10aSustainable Biochar-Based Solar Absorbers for High-Performance Solar-Driven Steam Generation and Water Purification  ap. 19311-19320.  aSolar-driven interfacial steam generation is emerging as a green and sustainable technology for potential applications in sterilization, desalination, and water purification. Despite the encouraging progress to date, the solar absorbers of the interfacial steam generators generally are composed of costly and/or delicate nanostructures made from metal particles or semiconductor materials, which partially hinder their mass production for practical applications. Herein, the biomass Enteromorpha prolifera was successfully recycled to construct four biochar-based solar absorbers via a set of processing methods. The hydrophilic, hierarchically porous, and microtubular nanostructures of the carbonized E. prolifera contribute to synergistically efficient water pumping and steam generation of the solar absorbers. Inspired by the natural transpiration of trees, the two-dimensional interfacial steam generators based on the four solar absorbers attain good water evaporation rates of 1.1–1.3 kg m–² h–¹ and high photothermal conversion efficiencies of 80–84% under one sun. Specifically, the performance is among the best-performing solar steam generators constructed via biochar-based solar absorbers. The indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate the first example of using green tide as a sustainable source for biochar-based solar absorbers and realizing cost-efficient and high-performance steam generation and clean water production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUlva prolifera 3aalgal blooms 3abiomass 3acost effectiveness 3adesalination 3aevaporation 3agenerators (equipment) 3ahydrophilicity 3ananomaterials 3asemiconductors 3asteam 3asustainable technology 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater purification 0aBiochar 0aEnteromorpha prolifera 0aSolar steam generation1 aChen, Guoliang1 aZhang, Nan1 aXu, Yunxiang1 aXu, Xiaofeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4501-95790 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Nov. 06, v. 7, no. 23 p.19311-19320dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b061693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245007100165520140100236592002801637650002001665650001401685650001101699650001701710651001201727700002101739773015901760856007501919852000901994655001202003IND60660490720221118204607.0190823e20190810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066049072DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi80803532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaisman, Alejandro 10aMapping Spatiotemporal Data to RDF: A SPARQL Endpoint for Brussels  aThis paper describes how a platform for publishing and querying linked open data for the Brussels Capital region in Belgium is built. Data are provided as relational tables or XML documents and are mapped into the RDF data model using R2RML, a standard language that allows defining customized mappings from relational databases to RDF datasets. In this work, data are spatiotemporal in nature; therefore, R2RML must be adapted to allow producing spatiotemporal Linked Open Data.Data generated in this way are used to populate a SPARQL endpoint, where queries are submitted and the result can be displayed on a map. This endpoint is implemented using Strabon, a spatiotemporal RDF triple store built by extending the RDF store Sesame. The first part of the paper describes how R2RML is adapted to allow producing spatial RDF data and to support XML data sources. These techniques are then used to map data about cultural events and public transport in Brussels into RDF. Spatial data are stored in the form of stRDF triples, the format required by Strabon. In addition, the endpoint is enriched with external data obtained from the Linked Open Data Cloud, from sites like DBpedia, Geonames, and LinkedGeoData, to provide context for analysis. The second part of the paper shows, through a comprehensive set of the spatial extension to SPARQL (stSPARQL) queries, how the endpoint can be exploited.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adatabases 3amodels 3aspatial data 3aBelgium1 aChentout, Kevin 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2019 Aug. 10, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi80803533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010000168300001600268520149200284592002801776653000801804653000701812653000801819653001001827653000801837653000801845653000801853653000701861653000701868653000901875653000901884653000901893653000801902653001201910653000701922653001001929653001401939653000901953653000701962653000901969653000701978653000801985653001101993653000802004653001002012653000802022653000802030653000902038653001002047653000802057653000802065653000802073653000802081653002302089653003002112653003002142653001602172700002202188700002002210700001702230700002202247700002302269773012502292856008402417852000902501655001202510IND60561506820221121234127.0170320e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056150682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resinv.2016.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaijo, Atsuro13aAn analysis of the clinical features of lung cancer in patients with connective tissue diseases  ap. 153-160.  aPatients with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) are at increased risk for lung cancer (LC); interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common form of organ dysfunction in cases of CTD. However, the influence of ILD on the treatment and prognosis in LC patients with CTD is unclear.Between January 2010 and December 2014, 27 patients among all patients with CTD at our institution were diagnosed with primary LC. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features, treatment modalities, and outcomes of these patients, and evaluated the potential prognostic factors. Forty-four LC patients without CTD were also analyzed as a control cohort.LC patients with CTD had a significantly higher incidence of ILD as a complication compared with those without CTD (52% and 14%, respectively). CTD-associated ILD (CTD-ILD) at diagnosis was associated with significantly worse survival in LC patients with CTD. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the complication of CTD-ILD was an independent poor prognostic factor in LC patients with CTD. The incidence of acute exacerbation (AE) of CTD-ILD was 21% among LC patients with CTD, and all of these patients died despite intensive treatment including high-dose corticosteroids. The restrictions in curative therapy for LC due to the presence of ILD and AE of CTD-ILD were thought to be the major reasons for the poor outcome.LC patients with CTD had a high prevalence of ILD, and the presence of CTD-ILD was significantly associated with poor prognosis.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCTD 0aLC 0aSLE 0aPM/DM 0aSSc 0aILD 0aIPF 0aAE 0aPS 0aEGFR 0aECOG 0aHRCT 0aUIP 0aCTD-ILD 0aOS 0aNSCLC 0aNSCLC-NOS 0aSCLC 0aRA 0aMCTD 0aCI 0aIIP 0aRA-ILD 0aSEM 0aCBDCA 0aPTX 0aS-1 0aCDDP 0aVP-16 0aVNR 0aGEM 0aPEM 0abev 0aAcute exacerbation 0aConnective tissue disease 0aInterstitial lung disease 0aLung cancer1 aHanibuchi, Masaki1 aGoto, Hisatsugu1 aToyoda, Yuko1 aTezuka, Toshifumi1 aNishioka, Yasuhiko0 tRespiratory Investigation.g2017 Mar., v. 55 p.153-160dElsevier B.V.aThe Japanese Respiratory Societyx2212-53457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resinv.2016.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011800162300001800280520113800298592002801436650001501464650002001479650001301499650002201512650001801534650001301552650001401565650000701579650001201586650001301598650001701611650001401628700002001642773010201662856007501764852000901839655001201848IND60531320720221116163842.0160723e20130219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053132072DNAL7 a10.1021/bi30162352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGannavaram, Swathi10aRelative Timing of Hydrogen and Proton Transfers in the Reaction of Flavin Oxidation Catalyzed by Choline Oxidase  ap. 1221-1226.  aThe oxidation of the reduced flavin in choline oxidase was investigated with pH, solvent viscosity, and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) in steady-state kinetics and time-resolved absorbance spectroscopy of the oxidative half-reaction in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Both the effects of isotopic substitution on the KIEs and the multiple KIEs suggest a mechanism for flavin oxidation in which the H atom from the reduced flavin and a H⁺ from the solvent or a solvent exchangeable site are transferred in the same kinetic step. Stopped-flow kinetic data demonstrate flavin oxidation without stabilization of flavin-derived species. Solvent viscosity effects establish an isomerization of the reduced enzyme. These results allow us to rule out mechanisms for flavin oxidation in which C4a-peroxy and -hydroperoxy flavin intermediates accumulate to detectable levels in the reaction of flavin oxidation catalyzed by choline oxidase. A mechanism of flavin oxidation that directly results in the formation of oxidized flavin and hydrogen peroxide without stabilization of reaction intermediates is consistent with the data presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3acholine oxidase 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aisomerization 3aisotopes 3aoxidation 3apH 3aprotons 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3aviscosity1 aGadda, Giovanni0 tBiochemistry.g2013 Feb. 19, v. 52, no. 7 p.1221-1226dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi30162353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008800163520089500251592002801146650003501174650001301209650001101222650001701233650001101250650001501261650001601276653001601292653001801308653004101326700001701367700001501384700001701399700001401416700001601430700001301446700001901459773009401478856008201572852000901654655001201663IND60725311320221119062330.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072531132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1064832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Liang10aHeavy metal detection in mulberry leaves: Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data  aFive copper or chromium stress levels were carried out on mulberry leaf, and 20 samples were collected for each metal stress level.

Ginger extract (GE) and fulvic acid (FA) are a new family of multifunctional BIOs that positively affect development processes in plants. However, the underlying mechanisms that influence these development processes are still unknown. The objective of this study was to determine how GE and FA affect the plant growth and productivity in damask rose. Furthermore, the mechanisms of these BIOs that regulate the performance of this plant were investigated. Damask rose plants were foliar-sprayed with GE (5, 10 and 15 mg L⁻¹) or FA (1, 3 and 5 g L⁻¹), while control plants were sprayed with tap water. The results showed that GE or FA foliar applications enhanced plant height and branch number much more than the control; however, FA treatment was more effective than GE. Intriguingly, flower number, flower yield, relative water content, and total chlorophyll content were all improved by either GE or FA, paying attention to reducing the blind shoot number per plant. Relative to the control, foliar application with 15 mg L⁻¹ GE or 3 mg L⁻¹FA increased the flower number by 16.11% and 19.83% and the flower yield per hectare by 40.53% and 52.75%, respectively. Substantial enhancements in volatile oil content and oil yield were observed due to GE and FA treatments, especially with the highest concentrations of both BIOs. The treatments of GE and FA considerably improved the total soluble sugars, total phenolic content, total anthocyanin content, and total carotenoid content, more so with FA. Additionally, the contents of N, P, K, Mg, Fe, and Zn elements were also enhanced by applying either GE or FA, especially at higher levels of both BIOs. In sum, our findings illuminate the potential functions of exogenous application of GE and FA in improving the growth, flower yield, and volatile oil yield in damask rose through enhancing the phytochemical and nutrient profiles. Applications of GE and FA can, thus, be a promising approach for enhancing the productivity of damask rose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aessential oils 3aflowers 3afoliar application 3afulvic acids 3aginger 3alipid content 3anew family 3aoils 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3atap water 3awater content1 aAl-Yasi, Hatim M.1 aIssa, Ahmed A.1 aHessini, Kamel 1 aHassan, Fahmy A.

However, due to the strong mismatch between the refractive index of a liquid and a gas, bubbles deform strongly the path of light rays, rendering automated bubble size analysis a challenging task. We show here how this challenge can be met using the fact that bubbles act like inverted, spherical lenses with a curvature which is the inverse of the bubble radius. The imaging properties of each bubble can then be used to accurately determine the radius of the bubble upon imaging an object which can be filtered easily by a computer. When bubbles are large enough to be deformed under the influence of gravity, it is more appropriate to measure their size after squeezing them between two narrowly spaced glass plates. We therefore show here, how the analysis can be extended to this case; and how both approaches can be combined to measure the size distributions of strongly polydisperse foams containing simultaneously small (several 10s of micrometres) and large bubbles (several 100s of micrometres).  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abubbles 3acomputers 3afoams 3aglass 3agravity 3aimage analysis 3arefractive index 0aFoam 0aBubble 0aImaging 0aMeasurement 0aDistribution 0aAutomation1 aHonorez, C.1 aJumeau, M.1 aElías, F.,1 aDrenckhan, W.0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 May 20, v. 473 p.68-74dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03877naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012600173300001600299520137900315536044801694592002802142596014002170596010702310596010702417650003702524650001602561650001902577650002102596650001202617650001102629650001102640650000902651650001502660650002302675650001802698650001602716650001002732650001702742650001702759650002602776653003402802653001902836653002602855653002702881653002302908653001602931653002002947700002402967700002002991700002603011700001903037773013603056856008603192852000903278655001203287IND60602911220221120085022.0180914e20180818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060291122DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2018.14441982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchäfer, Cynthia10aDaily stem water deficit of Norway spruce and European beech in intra- and interspecific neighborhood under heavy drought  ap. 568-582.  aHigh-resolution measurements of stem radius variations provide information about the tree water status with changing climate conditions by swelling and shrinking due to the reduction of xylem water potential and to the exceedance of leaf transpiration over root water uptake. The aim of this study was to analyze daily stem radius variations of Norway spruce and European beech in intra- and interspecific neighborhood. The experimental plots are part of a rainfall exclusion experiment. These variations are species-specific, i.e. spruces have a higher phloem thickness and higher amplitudes during a day than beeches. The amplitudes were significantly higher at the rainfall exclusion plots, but the amplitudes of spruces decreased above 27°C with increasing drought due to reduced transpiration rates and exhausted soil water reserves. The shrinking amplitude was observed for spruces in intraspecific neighborhood from a soil volumetric water content of 0.21 m³ m⁻³. In interspecific neighborhood, a shrinking amplitude for spruces could not be observed and revealed a lesser tree water deficit than in intraspecific neighborhood. Beeches showed minor differences with a higher tree water deficit in interspecific neighborhood. Consequently, stem radius variations give insights into a tree's water supply, which could help to understand changes in tree growth.  aWe thank the German Science Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) for providing the funds for the projects PR 292/12-1, MA 1763/7-1 and MU 831/23-1 “Tree and stand-level growth reactions on drought in mixed versus pure forests of Norway spruce and European beech”.

However, little is known about ecology, functioning and biodiversity of glacier-fed streams facing global warming. We investigated changes in environmental features and macroinvertebrate communities along a longitudinal gradient of glacier influence of two Patagonian systems that differ in glacier cover magnitude and the spatial sequence of lotic and lentic phases. Both glaciers, Torrecillas (~5.5km², Torrecillas system) and Cónico (~0.44km², Baggilt system), are retreating. Longitudinal distribution of benthic invertebrates partially fitted to predictions for glacierized temperate systems, with Diamesinae spp. dominating at closest sites to the Cónico, and Orthocladiinae increasing downstream, but patterns were unclear at Torrecillas. Generalized Linear Model identified chlorophyll a and conductivity as having significant effect on richness and density respectively at Torrecillas; detritus biomass and gravel influenced species richness, and boulder percentage and water temperature affected density, at Baggilt. Canonical Correspondence Analyses integrating benthic biota and environmental variables revealed that a higher environmental heterogeneity at Baggilt, related with spatial dimension (unshaded/shaded reaches, wetland reaches), local resources (detritus, bryophytes) and temperature, probably explained the unexpected high richness in benthic assemblages (67 taxa). Environmental conditions imposed by the lake outlet (proglacial) at Torrecillas resulted in a less diverse community (31 taxa). Finally our results suggest that these isolated, small glacier-fed streams typical of the Patagonian landscape appear highly vulnerable to global warming. Endemic elements could disappear at upper segments being replaced by other species common at rhithral environments, which might increase local diversity (alfa diversity) but decrease regional diversity (gamma diversity). From an ecosystem perspective stream functioning can result altered. Glacier retreating or disappearing threatens major ecosystem services for Patagonian inhabitants such as water supply, hydrological regulation, recreation and tourism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adetritus 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3aglaciers 3aglobal warming 3agravel 3ahydrology 3alakes 3alandscapes 3alentic systems 3alinear models 3alotic systems 3amacroinvertebrates 3amountains 3aprediction 3arecreation 3aspecies richness 3astreams 3atourism 3awater supply 3awater temperature 3awetlands 3aArgentina 0aGlacier-fed streams 0aEnvironment 0aMacroinvertebrate communities 0aSpatial heterogeneity 0aGlobal warming 0aPatagonia1 aBrand, Cecilia1 aEpele, Luis B.1 aDi Prinzio, Cecilia Y.1 aOmad, Guillermo H.1 aArchangelsky, Miguel1 aMartínez, Oscar,1 aKutschker, Adriana M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 01, v. 622-623 p.152-163dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010500174300001600279520162600295592002801921650001501949650001101964650000901975650002001984650000902004650001402013700002702027700002402054700002102078700002102099773009802120856008502218852000902303655001202312IND60086053420221119081116.0141101e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008605342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTétreault, Pascal10aWeight bearing evaluation in inflammatory, neuropathic and cancer chronic pain in freely moving rats  ap. 495-502.  aPreclinical pain assessment remains a key step for the development of new and potent painkillers. Significant progress in pain evaluation has been achieved with the development of non-reflexive tools. Seeking efficient and clinically relevant devices for pain-related quality of life assessment, we evaluated a new Dynamic Weight Bearing (DWB) device based on pressure captors in three different preclinical chronic pain models. Inflammatory (CFA), neuropathic (CCI) and bone cancer pain (femoral tumor) models were evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats for mechanical allodynia using dynamic von Frey for pain-related behaviors and DWB for discomfort. We observed similar impairment patterns in all of the models for both von Frey (allodynia) and DWB (weight balance) during the complete observation period, starting at day 3 in CCI- and CFA-affected limbs and at day 14 in bone cancer-afflicted rats, indicating that the DWB could be a useful tool for supporting pain assessment. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the main compensation, when animals experienced pain, was seen in the forepaws, ranging from 46% to 69% of increased load compared to normal. Other pain-related coping behaviors were also measured, such as the time spent on each paw and the contact surface. Our results revealed that CFA, CCI and cancerous rats decreased the use of their ipsilateral hind paws by 30% and showed a 50% reduction in paw surface pressed against the floor. In conclusion, this new device improves methods for preclinical evaluation of discomfort and quality of life proxies and could be helpful in screening putative analgesics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesics 3amodels 3apain 3aquality of life 3arats 3ascreening1 aDansereau, Marc-André1 aDoré-Savard, Louis1 aBeaudet, Nicolas1 aSarret, Philippe0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 104, no. 3 p.495-502dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245015100216300001400367520213500381592002802516650002902544650002502573650001302598650001402611650001702625650002802642650001602670650001402686650001002700650002502710650001402735650001202749650002602761650001602787653001302803653001402816653002202830653002302852653001502875700002402890700002002914700002602934700001902960773011902979856008503098852000903183655001203192IND60525175520221118222859.0190318e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052517552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJagadeesan, Rajeswaran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9890-595310aGenetic characterization of field-evolved resistance to phosphine in the rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Laemophloeidae: Coleoptera)  ap. 67-75.  aInheritance of resistance to phosphine fumigant was investigated in three field-collected strains of rusty grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus, Susceptible (S-strain), Weakly Resistant (Weak-R) and Strongly Resistant (Strong-R). The strains were purified for susceptibility, weak resistance and strong resistance to phosphine, respectively, to ensure homozygosity of resistance genotype. Crosses were established between S-strain×Weak-R, S-strain×Strong-R and Weak-R×Strong-R, and the dose mortality responses to phosphine of these strains and their F1, F2 and F1-backcross progeny were obtained. The fumigations were undertaken at 25°C and 55% RH for 72h.Weak-R and Strong-R showed resistance factors of 6.3× and 505× compared with S-strain at the LC50. Both weak and strong resistances were expressed as incompletely recessive with degrees of dominance of −0.48 and −0.43 at the LC50, respectively. Responses of F2 and F1-backcross progeny indicated the existence of one major gene in Weak-R, and at least two major genes in Strong-R, one of which was allelic with the major factor in Weak-R. Phenotypic variance analyses also estimated that the number of independently segregating genes conferring weak resistance was 1 (nE=0.89) whereas there were two genes controlling strong resistance (nE=1.2). The second gene, unique to Strong-R, interacted synergistically with the first gene to confer a very high level of resistance (~80×). Neither of the two major resistance genes was sex linked. Despite the similarity of the genetics of resistance to that previously observed in other pest species, a significant proportion (~15 to 30%) of F1 individuals survived at phosphine concentrations higher than predicted. Thus it is likely that additional dominant heritable factors, present in some individuals in the population, also influenced the resistance phenotype.Our results will help in understanding the process of selection for phosphine resistance in the field which will inform resistance management strategies. In addition, this information will provide a basis for the identification of the resistance genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptolestes ferrugineus 3aanalysis of variance 3acrossing 3afumigants 3ahomozygosity 3alethal concentration 50 3amajor genes 3amortality 3apests 3aphenotypic variation 3aphosphine 3aprogeny 3aresistance management 3asex linkage 0aGenetics 0aDominance 0aGene interactions 0aSelection pressure 0aManagement1 aCollins, Patrick J.1 aNayak, Manoj K.1 aSchlipalius, David I.1 aEbert, Paul R.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2016 Feb., v. 127 p.67-75dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001600295520167700311592002801988650001902016650001102035650001302046650002002059650001602079650001402095650002102109650001202130650001302142650001102155650002502166650001302191650000902204650001902213650001502232650001002247650001002257650001502267651001002282653001802292653001402310653002102324653001502345653001402360653002502374700003702399700001702436700002102453700002602474700002102500700001802521773011602539856008502655852000902740655001202749IND60542516420221119003612.0190403e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054251642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuez, Libertad10aCan seed production and restricted dispersal limit recruitment in Pinus pinaster Aiton from the Spanish Northern Plateau?  ap. 329-339.  aNatural regeneration faces increasing difficulties in dry forests from the Mediterranean basin, including for normally well-regenerating species such as maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton). In this paper, we studied female fertility, seed dispersal and spread rates in P. pinaster from the Spanish Northern Plateau, where natural regeneration failure is a main concern for forest managers. For this purpose we periodically collected data from seed traps and trees located at two core locations across several years. We found significant variation in interannual cone production, with the best seed trees being the same across years. In addition, we found highly skewed distributions of female reproductive effort and large fertility differences across stands located few kilometres away. Annual seed dispersal kernels fitted lognormal or 2Dt models depending on the stand analysed, with median dispersal distances between 14 and 25m. Kernels fitted for maximum dispersal periods showed an outstanding intraseasonal variation of median dispersal distances, from 10 to 54m, in association to variable patterns of rainfall and maximum wind speed. The amount of seed produced appeared to be enough to guarantee the natural regeneration of the stands during the typical 20-year regeneration period. Colonisation simulations concluded that Mediterranean maritime pine has a notable dispersion capacity, which is strongly influenced by levels of fecundity and, especially, by the number and frequency of long-distance dispersal events. The latter play a key role in tree dispersion processes through enlarging the occupied area and fostering the invasion of abandoned crop land.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinaster 3abasins 3acropland 3adata collection 3adry forests 3afecundity 3afemale fertility 3afemales 3amanagers 3amodels 3anatural regeneration 3aplateaus 3arain 3aseed dispersal 3aseed trees 3aseeds 3atraps 3awind speed 3aSpain 0aMating system 0aSeed rain 0aDispersal kernel 0aDispersion 0aSortie-ND 0aMediterranean region1 aGonzález-Martínez, Santiago C.1 aNanos, Nikos1 ade-Lucas, Ana I.1 aOrdóñez, Cristóbal1 adel Peso, Carlos1 aBravo, Felipe0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 313 p.329-339dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245011500191300001800306520166000324592002801984650002302012650002302035650002102058650002302079650002402102650002402126650002602150650002402176650004402200650001902244650001602263650002902279650002402308650002002332650002502352650004302377650001102420650001502431650001702446650003002463650004402493650005302537650002402590650003002614650003402644700001402678700001802692700001902710700002102729700002602750773008802776856008402864852000902948655001202957IND60088190020221117042031.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008819002DNAL7 a210930112pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBialek, Katarzyna10aQuantitative and qualitative analyses of methanogenic community development in high-rate anaerobic bioreactors  ap. 1298-1308.  aMethanogenic community structure and population dynamics were investigated in two anaerobic reactors treating a dairy wastewater, an Inverted Fluidized Bed (IFB) and Expanded Granular Sludge Bed (EGSB). A combination of real-time PCR, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and statistical techniques was employed. Distinct methanogenic communities developed in the IFB and EGSB reactors reflecting step-wise reductions in the applied hydraulic retention time from 72 to 12 h during the 200-day trial. The aceticlastic family Methanosarcinaceae was only detected in the IFB and the order Methanomicrobiales was also much more abundant in this reactor, while the aceticlastic family Methanosaetaceae was more abundant in the EGSB. The hydrogenotrophic order, Methanobacteriales, predominated in both reactors under all applied operational conditions. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and moving-window analyses, based on absolute and relative abundance quantification data, demonstrated that the methanogenic communities developed in a different manner in the IFB, compared to the EGSB reactor. In our study, relative abundance-based quantification by NMS and moving-window analysis appeared to be a valuable molecular approach that was more applicable to reflect the changes in the anaerobic digestion process than approaches based either on qualitative analysis, or solely on absolute quantification of the various methanogenic groups. The overall results and findings provided a comparative, quantitative and qualitative insight into anaerobic digestion processes, which could be helpful for better future reactor design and process control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobacteriales 3aMethanomicrobiales 3aMethanosaetaceae 3aMethanosarcinaceae 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3acommunity development 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afluidized beds 3amethanogens 3amultidimensional scaling 3apopulation dynamics 3aprocess control 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asludge 3awastewater 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aDenaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis 2aEuryarchaeotaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics1 aKim, Jaai1 aLee, Changsoo1 aCollins, Gavin1 aMahony, Therese,1 aO’Flaherty, Vincent0 tWater research.g2011 Jan., v. 45, no. 3 p.1298-1308dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009100169300001600260520217100276592002802447650001402475650001202489650002402501650001102525650001902536650001502555650001802570650001402588650002102602650001002623650001702633650001102650650001602661650001402677651001002691653001302701653002302714653002002737653002302757700001602780700001702796700005302813773012202866856008802988852000903076655001203085IND60615417020221118230951.0201125e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061541702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinares, C.10aImpact on mortality of biomass combustion from wildfires in Spain: A regional analysis  ap. 547-555.  aStudies that analyse the impact on mortality of particulate matter (PM) produced by biomass combustion from wildfires mostly focus on a single city or on cities in different countries, with very few concentrating on one country as a whole. Accordingly, the aim of this paper was to analyse the impact that PM has on daily mortality in Spain on days with biomass combustion from wildfires.To analyse natural PM advections the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing, Food & Environment divides Spain into 9 geographical regions. One province representative of each region for was selected analysis purposes, with provincial daily natural-cause mortality across the period 2004–2009 as the dependent variable, and daily mean PM concentrations in the provincial capital as the independent variable. We controlled for the effect of other chemical pollutants (NO₂ and O₃), maximum daily temperature on heat-wave days, day of the week, trends, seasonalities and the autoregressive nature of the series, using generalised linear models with the Poisson regression link to calculate relative risks (RRs) and the increase in RR (IRR) of PM-related mortality. The analysis was performed for days with and without biomass advections (DBA and DNBA respectively), with a breakdown by year, summer, and the remainder of the year (i.e., excluding summer).The results indicated that daily mean PM concentrations were higher on DBA than on DNBA, with statistically significant differences in most provinces. Furthermore, PM₁₀ was associated with higher daily mortality on DBA in regions where wildfires were most frequent, but not in the remaining provinces. This translated as an IRR per 10μg/m³ of PM of 7.93 (2.36–13.81) in the North-west, 3.76 (1.36–6.22) in the Centre and 4.46 (2.99–5.94) in the South-west, values which in all cases were statistically higher than those obtained on DNBA.The increase in PM caused by biomass advections from wildfires is linked to a significant IRR of mortality in Spain. Hence, the fact that wildfires are likely to become increasingly frequent in the context of climate change makes this type of analysis particularly necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3abiomass 3achemical pollutants 3acities 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3alinear models 3amortality 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3asummer 3atemperature 3awildfires 3aSpain 0aWildfire 0aBiomass combustion 0aDaily mortality 0aParticulate matter1 aCarmona, R.1 aSalvador, P.1 aDíaz, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4282-49590 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 01, v. 622-623 p.547-555dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003000142245013600172300001600308520155400324592002801878650002701906650002001933650002001953650002701973650002102000650002002021650002102041650001202062650001102074650002102085650001602106650005202122650001102174651001102185651001802196653001202214653001702226653003902243653002202282653002602304653001302330653001902343653004602362653002202408653003002430700001902460700003102479700003302510700002702543773012802570856007702698961001302775852000902788655001202797IND60594393520221118012406.0180625e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059439352DNAL7 a10.1653/024.100.04132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIracheta, Maria Magdalena10aActivity and Expression of Midgut Proteases from Mexican and US Trichoplusia ni (Hübner) Strains Exposed to Bacillus thuringiensis  ap. 685-692.  aProteases in the insect midgut have been associated with differences in susceptibility to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal toxins. Therefore, we evaluated the protease activity of laboratory versus field strains of Trichoplusia ni that were previously characterized by their susceptibility to Bt Cry toxins or protoxins and antimicrobial peptide production (Tamez-Guerra et al. 2006, 2008). In addition, because aminopeptidases may be involved in Bt resistance, the expression of T. ni aminopeptidase N1 transcript (tnapn1) was analyzed by RT-PCR. These strains included Mexican (NL) and American (US) laboratory strains, as well as a field collected strain (GTO), and strains obtained by XenTari® selection from the laboratory strains (NLX and USX) or field strain (GTOX). The activity of proteases in midgut extracts were evaluated by in vitro assays or in-gel activity with specific substrates. The results indicated that the ratio of midgut protease activity (trypsin:chymotrypsin) was higher in the laboratory NL and US strains, but the differences did not correlate with Bt resistance. The ratio was slightly increased in the Xentari-selected field strain GTOX, and zymograms with Xentari or Cry1Ac as substrates suggested that both high and low molecular mass protease activities were increased in GTOX. Selection also resulted in 87% and 300% higher tnapn1 amplification in Xentari-selected NLX and USX, respectively. The relationship between Bt susceptibility, proteases and tnapn1 expression and activity alterations is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aTrichoplusia ni 3aaminopeptidases 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acrystal proteins 3aenzyme activity 3ain vitro studies 3ainsects 3amidgut 3amolecular weight 3aproteinases 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atoxins 3aMexico 3aUnited States 0atrypsin 0achymotrypsin 0aBt protoxins and toxins activation 0aaminopeptidase N1 0aenzymatic alterations 0atripsina 0aquimiotripsina 0aactivación de protoxinas y toxinas de Bt 0aaminopeptidasa N1 0aalteraciones enzimáticas1 aOppert, Brenda1 aValadez-Lira, Jose Alberto1 aRodríguez-Padilla, Cristina1 aTamez-Guerra, Patricia0 tFlorida entomologist.g2017 Dec., v. 100, no. 4 p.685-692dFlorida Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44725x1938-51027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.100.04133Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016000168300001400328520139000342592002801732650003601760650002201796650001801818650002001836650000901856650001201865650001101877650002301888650002201911650002401933650001401957650001101971650000701982650001601989650001402005650002002019650002302039651001802062653001402080653002702094653002302121653001802144653001602162653002102178700005902199773011402258856008502372852000902457655001202466IND60542516720221119003552.0190403e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054251672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarlow, James10aExperimental reversal of soil acidification in a deciduous forest: Implications for seedling performance and changes in dominance of shade-tolerant species  ap. 63-68.  aAcer saccharum Marsh. (sugar maple) and the less valuable Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. (American beech) are the dominant shade-tolerant canopy species over large forest tracts in northeast North America. Negative effects of soil acidification on sugar maple could favor greater dominance of beech in the “zero-sum game” dynamics of closed-canopy forests. A watershed-level Ca addition experiment, reversing some effects of acidification (including pH and Ca availability), provided an opportunity to test effects on beech and sugar maple seedling performance over 5yrs, under different canopy species. Ca addition almost doubled leaf area of sugar maple and increased that of beech by over 40%. However extension growth was increased only in sugar maple. Both the direction of effects and the relative performance of maple and beech were consistent across canopy species. We combine our results and other evidence into a conceptual model of how soil acidification and Ca depletion is shifting the competitive balance in the seedling stage toward beech, implying an increase in beech relative abundance in the canopy, unless compensated by other factors, such as beech bark disease. These findings, and mounting evidence of other negative effects of soil acidification, suggest re-examination of the cost-effectiveness of chemical remediation in some poorly buffered forested watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3aFagus grandifolia 3aacidification 3aadverse effects 3abark 3acalcium 3acanopy 3acost effectiveness 3adeciduous forests 3aforested watersheds 3aleaf area 3amodels 3apH 3aremediation 3aseedlings 3ashade tolerance 3asoil acidification 3aNorth America 0aAcid rain 0aReciprocal replacement 0aCalcium limitation 0aZero-sum game 0aCompetition 0aCanopy dominance1 aPeart, David R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6121-22400 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 313 p.63-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009800174300001800272500001900290520125500309592002801564650002101592650002101613650002301634650002901657650001201686650001701698650002001715650001501735650002101750650002201771650002501793650001101818650002001829653002401849653002601873653001701899653002201916653002001938700002101958700002701979700006102006700002802067700002302095700006502118700006502183773014402248856008502392852000902477655001202486IND60730994220210903000000.0210315e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073099422DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c092182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Margarida10aSustainable Strategy Based on Induced Precipitation for the Purification of Phycobiliproteins  ap. 3942-3954.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhycobiliproteins are fluorescent proteins mainly produced by red macroalgae and cyanobacteria. These proteins, essential to the survival of these organisms, find application in many fields of interest, from medical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic to food and textile industries. The biggest obstacle to their use is the lack of simple environmental and economical sustainable methodologies to obtain these proteins with high purity. In this work, a new purification process is proposed based on the induced precipitation of the target proteins followed by ultrafiltration. Purities of 89.5% of both phycobiliproteins and 87.3% of R-phycoerythrin were achieved using ammonium sulfate and poly(acrylic acid) sodium salts as precipitation agents (followed by an ultrafiltration step), while maintaining high recovery yields and protein structure stability. Environmental analysis performed to evaluate the proposed process shows that the carbon footprint for the proposed process is much lower than that reported for alternative methodology, and the economic analysis reveals the cost-effective character associated to its high performance. This work is a step toward more sustainable and effective methodologies/processes with high industrial potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium sulfate 3acarbon footprint 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental assessment 3afabrics 3afluorescence 3agreen chemistry 3amacroalgae 3aphycobiliprotein 3aprotein structure 3apurification methods 3asodium 3aultrafiltration 0aGracilaria gracilis 0ainduced precipitation 0apurification 0aphycobiliproteins 0aR-phycoerythrin1 aSoares, Bruna P.1 aSantos, João H.

Despite the current standard treatment for glioblastoma patients including neurosurgical resection, followed by concomitant radiation and chemotherapy, the median survival rate is only about 15 months. An unresolved challenge for current therapies is related to getting drugs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which hinders many chemotherapeutic agents from reaching tumors cells. Although a large amount of research has been done to circumvent the BBB and deliver drugs to the brain, with nanoparticles (NPs) taking the lead, the challenge is still high. In this regard, the BBB and how to transfer drug pathways through the BBB, especially using NPs, are introduced here. Afterwards, the latest advances in drug delivery, co-drug delivery, and combination modalities are described specifically for GBM treatments using natural and synthetic polymeric NPs and adjuvant therapies including hyperthermia, photodynamic therapy and also ketogenic regimens. In addition, receptor-mediated endocytosis agents that exist in endothelial capillary cells of the brain are explained. Lastly, future directions to finally deliver drugs through the BBB for GBM treatment are emphasized. It is the hope that this review can provide a number of practical pathways for the future development of BBB permeable nanochemotherapeutics against GBM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3abrain neoplasms 3adrugs 3aendocytosis 3afever 3aglioblastoma 3aphotochemotherapy 3apolymers 3aresection 3asurvival rate 0aGlioblastoma 0aDrug delivery 0aBlood-brain barrier 0aPolymeric nanoparticles1 aEsnaashari, Seyedeh Sara1 aWebster, Thomas J.1 aKhosravani, Masood1 aAdabi, Mahdi0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Sept., v. 349 p.649-661dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006000168300001600228520198100244536005902225592002802284596002902312650002602341650002402367650002302391650001202414653002202426653002102448653002402469653001602493653002302509653002202532700001502554700002102569700001902590773013602609856008502745852000902830655001202839IND60602911820221120094747.0180711e20180808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060291182DNAL7 a10.1080/1389224X.2018.14667172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnook, Jorie10aEvaluation of farmer participatory extension programmes  ap. 309-325.  aPurpose: Participatory extension programmes are widely used to promote change in the agricultural sector, and an important question is how best to measure the effectiveness of such programmes after implementation. This study seeks to understand the current state of practice through a review of ex post evaluations of participatory extension programmes. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of the peer-reviewed literature was undertaken to analyse the evaluations based on: (i) year of publication; (ii) location of the study; (iii) programme delivery; (iv) evaluation methods; (v) outcome variables; and (vi) inclusion of evaluation in initial programme design. Findings: The review finds that almost all studies use an experimental or quasi-experimental research design (i.e. using a control group or counterfactual), but some studies do not account for endogeneity or selection bias. Furthermore, only a small number of the evaluations were planned as part of the original programme design, which causes difficulties in obtaining robust counterfactuals. The review also finds that relatively few evaluations, approximately 20%, measure the programme impact on environmental outcomes and only 15% of the evaluations have been undertaken for programmes in developed countries. Practical implication: Limitations with current evaluation practice are identified, and recommendations are provided for improving practice, including better treatment of endogeneity, and the complementary use of qualitative data. Theoretical implication: The review provides a contribution to the debate about the use of quantitative versus qualitative evaluation methods, by addressing the use of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods in a complementary way. Originality/value: Despite their widespread implementation, this is the first systematic literature review for published evaluations of participatory extension programmes in the agricultural sector.  aThis work was supported by Scotland’s Rural College.  aPublisher supplied data  cScotland s Rural College 3aagricultural industry 3adeveloped countries 3aextension programs 3afarmers 0aImpact evaluation 0avoluntary uptake 0aextension programme 0aagriculture 0aex post evaluation 0adiscussion groups1 aEory, Vera1 aBrander, Matthew1 aMoran, Dominic0 tjournal of agricultural education and extension.g2018 Aug. 8, v. 24, no. 4 p.309-325dRoutledgewJournal:jnl56850x1750-86227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2018.14667173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010900170300001800279520160700297592002801904596007201932596009802004596009802102596005802200596005402258650001102312650001402323650001202337650001202349650002302361650002302384650001802407700005802425700006002483773011902543856008502662852000902747655001202756IND60778293520221119024954.0220524e20220513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c003392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shensheng10aComplexation between Oppositely Charged Polyelectrolytes in Dilute Solution: Effects of Charge Asymmetry  ap. 3898-3909.  aWe use dissipative particle dynamics to study polyelectrolyte complexation in dilute solutions under conditions of either chain-length or concentration asymmetry between the polycation and the polyanion, characterized by the macromolecular charge ratio of the minor component to the major component. Our results show that generally the systems form clusters carrying net macromolecular charges. The stoichiometry of these net-charged macromolecular clusters depends on the overall charge asymmetry, and clusters with certain stoichiometry can dominate the cluster population under a wide range of chain-length and concentration asymmetry. The morphology and stability of these net-charged clusters are closely related to their stoichiometry. When the charge ratio reaches a threshold value, the polyions condense into a single large coacervate cluster, signaling the onset of macroscopic coacervation. The threshold value is less for concentration asymmetry systems than for chain-length asymmetry systems at the same salt concentration. This threshold value decreases with added salt, as salt ions cause merging of small clusters into larger ones, eventually leading to the dominance of a single large cluster. This “salting-out” phenomenon is followed by a “salting-in” behavior, as further addition of salt dissolves the large cluster. The preferred size and composition of the net-charged clusters observed in the simulation highlight the significant role of length and concentration asymmetry on polyelectrolyte complex coacervation and hint at the possibility of a microstructured liquid.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-SC0012704cOffice of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006132  a21803011cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22073016cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcHong Kong Quantum AI Lab Ltd.dhttps://doi.org/NA  aNAcShanghai Dongfang Scholardhttps://doi.org/NA 3aanions 3aasymmetry 3acations 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3asalt concentration 3astoichiometry1 aZhang, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4226-13941 aWang, Zhen'gang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3361-61140 tMacromolecules.g2022 May 13, v. 55, no. 10 p.3898-3909dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c003393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010600208300001800314520183900332592002802171596009802199596009802297596005802395596005402453650002202507650001702529650002002546650001902566700006002585773011902645856008502764852000902849655001202858IND60778293620221119024958.0220524e20220512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c003402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4226-139410aSupernatant Phase in Polyelectrolyte Complex Coacervation: Cluster Formation, Binodal, and Nucleation  ap. 3910-3923.  aThis work studies the structure and thermodynamics of the supernatant phase in polyelectrolyte complex coacervation, a relatively unexplored area. By combining the cluster theory in dilute solution with our recently developed mean-field theory for inhomogeneous polyelectrolyte solutions (Zhang, P.; Wang, Z.-G.Macromolecules2021, 54, 10994), we systematically investigate the structure of finite-sized clusters formed by oppositely charged polyions in symmetric dilute solutions and how these clusters affect the binodal, spinodal, and nucleation for polyelectrolyte complex coacervation. We find that both the polyion concentration deep inside the cluster and the interfacial tension decrease with increasing the cluster size, reaching their respective bulk coexistence values with corrections inversely proportional to the cluster radius. The polyion concentration in the supernatant phase at coexistence is several orders of magnitude higher than that obtained under the uniform mixing approximation. For most relevant conditions away from the critical point, the supernatant phase consists predominantly of polyion pairs. By examining the nucleation barrier in supersaturated solutions, we can determine a pseudo-spinodal when the barrier is a few multiples of the thermal energy. The location of this pseudo-spinodal is similarly shifted to much higher concentrations than predicted under the uniform mixing approximation. Making the volume approximation for the clusters, we obtain simple analytical expressions for the cluster formation free energy, the modified binodal, and the pseudo-spinodal. In particular, we propose a simple approximate formula for estimating the concentration of the coexisting supernatant phase in terms of the chain length, interfacial tension, and the polyion concentration in the coacervate phase.  aPublisher supplied data  a21803011cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22073016cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcHong Kong Quantum AI Lab Ltd.dhttps://doi.org/NA  aNAcShanghai Dongfang Scholardhttps://doi.org/NA 3aGibbs free energy 3aelectrolytes 3asurface tension 3athermal energy1 aWang, Zhen'gang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3361-61140 tMacromolecules.g2022 May 12, v. 55, no. 10 p.3910-3923dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c003403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245013400179300001400313520148400327592002801811650001901839650001301858650001201871650001301883650001801896650001701914650001701931650001701948650001801965650003201983650001002015650001002025651001002035653001902045653001702064653001902081653001202100653000902112700001902121700002602140700002002166700001602186773011402202856008502316852000902401655001202410IND60542516920221119003237.0190403e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054251692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-García, Aida10aResin yield in Pinus pinaster is related to tree dendrometry, stand density and tapping-induced systemic changes in xylem anatomy  ap. 47-54.  aPinus pinaster Ait. is the most widespread conifer in Spain and is now the only species tapped for its oleoresin. The role of tree size and xylem anatomy at distal parts (⩾10cm) aside from the tapping wound in the resin yield potential of this species was evaluated. Twenty-six tapped trees with contrasting resin yield classes and 12 non-tapped (control) trees, growing in two locations with the same climate conditions but different stand density and soil characteristics, were selected for the study. In tissues not affected by the tapping wound, the number of radial resin canals per mm2 and resin canal volume per growth ring unit are related to resin yield. The number of radial canals per mm2 and resin yield are strongly related to tree diameter and percentage of live crown. The area per mm2 of axial resin canals is related to high yielding trees, but only in the location with higher plant density and poorer soil quality. In tapped trees, an increase in axial canal frequency and area was found during the three years following the start of tapping activity, suggesting that canal formation is a systemic induced response to wounding. Tree diameter and percentage of live crown and radial resin canal frequency could be useful criteria for estimating resin yields in P. pinaster and could be applied to improve tapping management and breeding programs. The systemic defense system of trees should be taken into account to improve tapping techniques and resin yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus pinaster 3abreeding 3aclimate 3aconifers 3aplant density 3aresin canals 3asoil density 3asoil quality 3astand density 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3axylem 3aSpain 0aXylem wounding 0aResin canals 0aDefense system 0aTapping 0aNWFP1 aLópez, Rosana1 aMartín, Juan Antonio1 aPinillos, Felix1 aGil, Luís,0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 313 p.47-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003500142245011800177300001600295520117700311592002801488650002701516650001401543650002501557650001201582650001201594650002801606650001201634650001401646650001101660650001301671650001301684650001301697651001101710653001901721653001501740653001901755653002301774700003801797700002401835700003201859700004201891700002801933700002901961773012801990856007702118852000902195655001202204IND60594393820221118012426.0180625e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059439382DNAL7 a10.1653/024.100.04162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTejeda-Reyes, Manuel Alejandro10aSusceptibility of Bactericera cockerelli Sulc (Hemiptera: Triozidae) Nymphs to Sivanto® 200 SL (Flupyradifurone)  ap. 704-707.  aSivanto® 200 SL (flupyradifurone) was recently introduced into the Mexican market for the control of Bactericera cockerelli Sulc (Hemiptera: Triozidae) in different solanaceous crops such as potato, tomato, and pepper, which are important crops in Mexico. The objective of this study was to determine the toxicity of flupyradifurone on 5th instar potato psyllids in 3 field-collected populations and a laboratory susceptible one. There were no differences in susceptibility to flupyradifurone among the evaluated populations. The lethal concentration values (LC) at 50% of mortality ranged from 243.2 to 368.1 mg per L at 24 h, after 48 h of exposure, LC50 values were between 51.0 to 62.5 mg per L. The LC95 values at 24 h ranged from 2403 to 5265 mg per L, and at 48 h of exposure were between 506.5 to 936.9 mg per L. The relative toxicity (RT) at 50% of mortality was 4.07 to 4.97 times higher after 48 h than after 24 h. Moreover, an antifeedant effect associated with flupyradifurone decreased the amount of excreta after 24 h of feeding by 51, 42, and 75% at the flupyradifurone dosages of 30, 50, and 100 mg per L, respectively, relative to the untreated control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactericera cockerelli 3aTriozidae 3aantifeeding activity 3aexcreta 3ainstars 3alethal concentration 50 3amarkets 3amortality 3anymphs 3apotatoes 3atomatoes 3atoxicity 3aMexico 0apotato psyllid 0abutenolide 0asusceptibility 0aantifeedant effect1 aRodríguez-Maciel, J.

However, identifying indicator species is not easy and there is a need for rigorous criteria and methods for their selection. In this study, we test a new approach to select indicator species of high mortality-risk of electrocution in power pylons comparing methods based on biological criteria and network analysis. For this purpose, we studied 335 mortality records of 19 bird species electrocuted between 1996 and 2013 in a Special Protected Area located in South-eastern Spain. Our results showed that both species-biology based methods and network analyses provided similar results, indicating that the eagle owl can be considered the best mortality indicator of the bird community on power pylons for the study area. The use of network analysis to select indicator species can be very useful to optimize the monitoring of infrastructure impacts, especially on complex or understudied communities because it does not require detailed information on the biology of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBubo 3abirds 3aindicator species 3ainfrastructure 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aselection methods 3aSpain 0aCo-occurrence 0aEagle owl 0aHuman impacts 0aIndicator species 0aNestedness 0aPower lines 0aOrdination analysis1 aSebastián-González, Esther1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7229-18451 aBotella, Francisco1 aSánchez-Zapata, José A.0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.428-433dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002800169245007800197300001800275520176900293592002802062650001202090650002102102650001502123650001802138650001102156650001302167650002102180650001502201650002502216651001102241700002602252700001602278700002002294700002502314700002402339700002302363700002302386700002702409773008802436856008402524852000902608655001202617IND60088190620221117042241.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008819062DNAL7 a210742372pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoulêtreau, Stéphanie10aRotating disk electrodes to assess river biofilm thickness and elasticity  ap. 1347-1357.  aThe present study examined the relevance of an electrochemical method based on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) to assess river biofilm thickness and elasticity. An in situ colonisation experiment in the River Garonne (France) in August 2009 sought to obtain natural river biofilms exhibiting differentiated architecture. A constricted pipe providing two contrasted flow conditions (about 0.1 and 0.45 m s⁻¹ in inflow and constricted sections respectively) and containing 24 RDE was immersed in the river for 21 days. Biofilm thickness and elasticity were quantified using an electrochemical assay on 7 and 21 days old RDE-grown biofilms (t₇ and t₂₁, respectively). Biofilm thickness was affected by colonisation length and flow conditions and ranged from 36 ± 15 μm (mean ± standard deviation, n = 6) in the fast flow section at t₇ to 340 ± 140 μm (n = 3) in the slow flow section at t₂₁. Comparing the electrochemical signal to stereomicroscopic estimates of biofilms thickness indicated that the method consistently allowed (i) to detect early biofilm colonisation in the river and (ii) to measure biofilm thickness of up to a few hundred μm. Biofilm elasticity, i.e. biofilm squeeze by hydrodynamic constraint, was significantly higher in the slow (1300 ± 480 μm rpm¹/², n = 8) than in the fast flow sections (790 ± 350 μm rpm¹/², n = 11). Diatom and bacterial density, and biofilm-covered RDE surface analyses (i) confirmed that microbial accrual resulted in biofilm formation on the RDE surface, and (ii) indicated that thickness and elasticity represent useful integrative parameters of biofilm architecture that could be measured on natural river assemblages using the proposed electrochemical method.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrodynamics 3arivers 2aBiofilms 2aElectrochemistry 2aElectrodes 2aRiversxmicrobiology 3aFrance1 aCharcosset, Jean-Yves1 aGamby, Jean1 aLyautey, Emilie1 aMastrorillo, Sylvain1 aAzemar, Frédéric,1 aMoulin, Frédéric1 aTribollet, Bernard1 aGarabetian, Frédéric0 tWater research.g2011 Jan., v. 45, no. 3 p.1347-1357dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245014200178300001600320520057500336592002800911650002300939650002300962650002200985650002001007653001501027653001401042653001601056653002201072653001101094700003001105700002201135700002201157700002401179700002801203700002501231700002401256700002001280700002501300773008701325856008401412852000901496655001201505IND60529277820221120071121.0161019e20160224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052927782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.01.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZdvizhkov, Alexander T.10aTransformation of 2-allyl-1,3-diketones to bicyclic compounds containing 1,2-dioxolane and tetrahydrofuran rings using the I2/H2O2 system  ap. 949-952.  aA one-pot procedure was developed for the assembly of bicyclic compounds containing 1,2-dioxolane and tetrahydrofuran rings based on the reaction of 2-allyl-1,3-diketones with the I2/H2O2 system.

Therefore, this study focused on conversion of the shell waste of locally available crab variety P.pelagicus (Blue swimming crab) into the chitosan scaffold. As the poor mechanical strength of chitosan limits its usage in tissue engineering, it was blended with alginate. The scaffolds were prepared by the freeze gelation method which requires less time and minimum energy, with fewer residual solvent and easier to scale up. To the best of our knowledge there are no reports on scaffold preparation from the extracted chitosan, blended with alginate by freeze gelation method. The biological properties of chitosan-alginate scaffolds (Cts–Alg) were evaluated and compared with those of chitosan scaffolds. The prepared scaffolds were characterized by SEM, swelling property, in vitro enzymatic degradation, and hemo, biocompatibility properties. Chitosan-alginate scaffolds had an average pore size of 40 μm and tensile strength of 0.564 ± 0.0.018 % MPa. Its swelling ratio was 27.5 ± 0.28 %, with mass loss percentage of 10 ± 0.33 % after 4 weeks of degradation. It has exhibited good hemocompatible properties too. Mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells were able to adhere and proliferate well in the blended scaffold. All these results indicated that chitosan-alginate scaffold is a suitable alternative substitute for tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPortunus pelagicus 3aalginates 3abiocompatibility 3achitosan 3acost effectiveness 3acrabs 3aenergy 3afibroblasts 3agelation 3amice 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3atensile strength 3atissue engineering 3awastes1 aRajaiah, Shenbagarathai1 aBhavani, K.1 aManjula Devi,1 aKarthika, K.1 aGowri Priya, Chidambaranathan0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2017 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.578-585dSpringer USx1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-016-0834-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010600173300001600279500001500295520088600310592002801196650001301224650001201237650001101249650001101260650001301271650002101284650002201305653002301327700001501350773012401365856008301489852000901572655001201581IND60088143520221119132439.0141102e20121130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008814352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2012.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRzeznik-Orignac, J.10aExperimental estimation of assimilation rates of meiofauna feeding on ¹⁴C-labelled benthic diatoms  ap. 179-185.  a2019-12-06  aKnowledge of the trophic position of meiofauna in marine sediments is still contradictory primarily due to the scarcity of experimental data. The present study analyses diatom-feeders among the meiofauna. The assimilation rate of carbon by meiofauna was determined through a grazing experiment using in situ collected diatoms pre-labelled with ¹⁴C. The assimilation rates of diatom carbon were estimated for the bulk meiofaunal community (0.84ng C.ind⁻¹.h⁻¹), for the bulk harpacticoid copepods (1.92ng C.ind.⁻¹h⁻¹) and for two dominant nematode species (Metachromadora remanei 1.26ng C ind⁻¹h⁻¹, Daptonema oxycerca 1.35ngC.ind. ⁻¹h⁻¹). Experimental results were extrapolated to compute the consumption of meiofauna in situ that would attain up to 12% of primary benthic production in the Brouage mudflat (Marennes-Oléron Bay, southwest Atlantic coast).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3agrazing 3acarbon 3acoasts 3aNematoda 3amarine sediments 3aBacillariophyceae 0aBacillariophycidae1 aFichet, D.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2012 Nov. 30, v. 432-433 p.179-185dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2012.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012900170300001400299520124300313592002801556650002401584650001701608650001301625650001701638650000901655650001601664650002701680650002001707650001301727650002101740650001501761650001901776650001601795650001301811653001701824653001801841653002401859653001601883653002901899653001801928700001801946700001801964700002201982700002502004773011902029856008502148852000902233655001202242IND60525176120221118222950.0190318e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052517612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutluyer, Filiz14aThe in vitro effect of cypermethrin on quality and oxidative stress indices of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss spermatozoa  ap. 63-67.  aThere is limited information on the scientific literature about the effect of in vitro exposure of fish sperm to pesticides. In vitro effect of cypermethrin on sperm quality and oxidative stress has not yet been fully investigated. Therefore, the effects of cypermethrin, a type II pyrethroid insecticide, on quality and oxidative stress of spermatozoa were examined in vitro. To explore the potential in vitro toxicity of cypermethrin, fish spermatozoa were incubated with different concentrations of cypermethrin (1.025, 2.05 and 4.1μg/l) for 2h. The motility rate and duration of sperm were determined after exposure to cypermethrin. Reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in spermatozoa were analyzed for determination of oxidant and antioxidant balance. Our results indicated that spermatozoa motility and duration significantly decreased with exposure to cypermethrin. Additionally, activity of GSH-Px (P<0.05) and MDA and GSH levels increased in a concentration-dependent manner while CAT activity decreased (P<0.05). Consequently, the oxidant and antioxidant status and sperm quality were affected by quantitative changes and different concentrations of cypermethrin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aantioxidants 3acatalase 3acypermethrin 3afish 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3apyrethrins 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3atoxicity 0aCypermethrin 0aRainbow trout 0aOncorhynchus mykiss 0aSpermatozoa 0aOxidative stress indices 0aSperm quality1 aBenzer, Fulya1 aErişir, Mine1 aÖğretmen, Fatih1 aİnanan, Burak Evren0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2016 Mar., v. 128 p.63-67dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2015.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245005900171520126100230592002801491650001801519650001001537650001101547650001601558650002401574650002101598650001701619650001101636650001901647650001801666650001401684650003301698653000901731653000801740653001301748653001001761653000901771653001001780653000801790653000901798653002001807653001601827653001101843653002501854653001901879653001501898700003001913700002801943700004301971773009802014856008702112852000902199655001202208IND60783757520221121161231.0220830e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078375752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1113902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaló, Gonzalo10aTOR signaling in the green picoalga Ostreococcus tauri  aTarget of rapamycin (TOR) is a master regulator that controls growth and metabolism by integrating external and internal signals. Although there was a great progress in the study of TOR in plants and in the model alga Chlamydomonas, scarce data are available in other green algae. Thus, in this work we studied TOR signaling in Ostreococcus tauri, the smallest free-living eukaryote described to date. This picoalga is particularly important because it has a key site at the base of the green lineage and is part of the marine phytoplankton, contributing to global photosynthesis. We investigated OtTOR complex in silico and experimentally, by using first- and second-generation TOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and PP242. We analyzed the effect of TOR down-regulation on cell growth and on the accumulation of carbon reserves. The results showed that O. tauri responds to TOR inhibitors more similarly to plants than to Chlamydomonas, being PP242 a valuable tool to study this pathway. Besides, Ottor expression analysis revealed that the kinase is dynamically regulated under nutritional stress. Our data indicate that TOR signaling is conserved in O. tauri and we propose this alga as a good and simple model for studying TOR kinase and its regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas 3aalgae 3acarbon 3acell growth 3acomputer simulation 3aeukaryotic cells 3amalnutrition 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoplankton 3arapamycin 3atarget of rapamycin proteins 0aAMPK 0aIAA 0aO. tauri 0aPP242 0aRAPA 0aTORC1 0aTOR 0amTOR 0aCarbon reserves 0aGreen algae 0aGrowth 0aNitrogen deprivation 0aTOR inhibitors 0aTOR kinase1 aDe Marco, María Agustina1 aSalerno, Graciela Lidia1 aMartínez-Noël, Giselle María Astrid0 tPlant science.g2022 Oct., v. 323 p.111390-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2022.1113903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245014000157300001400297500001900311520140300330592002801733650000801761650001101769650002301780650001501803650001701818650001601835650002701851650001201878653001701890653002801907653001301935653003201948653001001980700001101990700001402001700001402015700001102029700001102040700001402051700001302065773013702078856007902215852000902294655001202303IND60730994820221120051647.0210315e20200630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073099482DNAL7 a10.1139/cjas-2018-02312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, L.10aMicrosatellite markers reveal polymorphisms at the 3′ untranslated region of the SLC11A1 gene in Zhongdian Yellow cattle (Bos taurus)  ap. 20-29.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolute carrier family 11-member A1 (SLC11A1) gene encodes natural macrophage resistance-associated protein which regulates activity of macrophages against intracellular pathogens. The objective of this study was to study the polymorphism in the microsatellites present at 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the SLC11A1 gene in 113 Zhongdian Yellow cattle (Bos taurus). Using DNA bi-directional sequencing, we detected seven alleles (GT10–16) for the first microsatellite (MS1), five alleles (GT12–16) for MS2, and four alleles (GT4–7) for MS3. MS3 is studied for the first time and revealed four novel variants (alleles GT4–7). Alleles GT12 (45.1%), GT13 (59.3%), and GT5 (85.4%) were the most frequent alleles at MS1, MS2, and MS3, respectively, Genotypes G12/12, G13/13, and G5/5 had the highest frequency 0.239, 0.540, and 0.743 at MS1, MS2, and MS3, respectively. Haplotypic data revealed that GT12/GT13 was the most frequent haplotype observed followed by GT12/14 haplotype. Three nucleotide variations were observed in MS1 and MS2. Comparative analysis of GT12/GT12 and GT13/GT13 genotype with other bovine genotypes showed significant difference (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that the homozygous genotypes GT12/GT12 and GT13/GT13 in Zhongdian Yellow cattle might be related to disease resistance. The findings reported in this study would be helpful in cattle breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acattle 3adisease resistance 3ahaplotypes 3ahomozygosity 3amacrophages 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asolutes 0aSLC11A1 gene 0aZhongdian Yellow cattle 0a3′ UTR 0amicrosatellite polymorphism 0a(GT)n1 aXi, D.1 aXiong, H.1 aMemon, S.1 aLi, G.1 aGu, Z.1 aNadir, S.1 aDeng, W.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2020 June 30, v. 101, no. 1 p.20-29dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1932x0008-39847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjas-2018-02313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245010200156500001400258520145600272592002801728650001501756650001601771650000901787650001601796650001101812650001001823650001701833650001301850650001101863700001701874700001501891700001501906700001501921700001701936700001701953700001801970700001501988700001502003773015902018856007502177852000902252655001202261IND60711723820221118110759.0200928e20200828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071172382DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi90905182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Qing 10aOptimized Spatiotemporal Data Scheduling Based on Maximum Flow for Multilevel Visualization Tasks  aNAL-light  aMassive spatiotemporal data scheduling in a cloud environment play a significant role in real-time visualization. Existing methods focus on preloading, prefetching, multithread processing and multilevel cache collaboration, which waste hardware resources and cannot fully meet the different scheduling requirements of diversified tasks. This paper proposes an optimized spatiotemporal data scheduling method based on maximum flow for multilevel visualization tasks. First, the spatiotemporal data scheduling framework is designed based on the analysis of three levels of visualization tasks. Second, the maximum flow model is introduced to construct the spatiotemporal data scheduling topological network, and the calculation algorithm of the maximum data flow is presented in detail. Third, according to the change in the data access hotspot, the adaptive caching algorithm and maximum flow model parameter switching strategy are devised to achieve task-driven spatiotemporal data optimization scheduling. Compared with two typical methods of first come first serve (FCFS) and priority scheduling algorithm (PSA) by simulating visualization tasks at three levels, the proposed maximum flow scheduling (MFS) method has been proven to be more flexible and efficient in adjusting each spatiotemporal data flow type as needed, and the method realizes spatiotemporal data flow global optimization under limited hardware resources in the cloud environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenvironment 3aflow 3amethodology 3amodels 3apaper 3aspatial data 3atopology 3awastes1 aChen, Meite 1 aFeng, Bin 1 aZhou, Yan 1 aLi, Maosu 1 aXu, Zhaowen 1 aDing, Yulin 1 aLiu, Mingwei 1 aWang, Wei 1 aXie, Xiao 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 Aug. 28, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90905183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011500171300001600286520105900302592002801361650002701389650002701416650002601443650002401469650001601493650002301509650002501532650002601557650002301583650002901606650002101635650001301656651001301669653001101682653002101693653002101714653002201735700001301757700001301770700001701783700001401800700001701814773012201831856008801953852000902041655001202050IND60615417920221119002354.0201125e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061541792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Jingqian10aActivity, toxicity, molecular docking, and environmental effects of three imidazolinone herbicides enantiomers  ap. 594-602.  aAll imidazolinone (IMI) herbicides are chiral consisting of two enantiomers; however, studies on the enantioselectivities of their interactions are limited. This study is a systematic assessment of the enantiomers and racemates of IMI herbicides, including semi-preparation and determination of absolute configurations, stereoselective bioactivity toward target organisms (Echinochloa crus-galli and Microcystis aeruginosa), and toxicity toward Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells. R-imidazolinones were found to be more active than S-IMIs in the inhibition of target organisms, and neither enantiomer had estrogenic activity. Moreover, the relationship between the molecular structures and the efficiency of target growth inhibition by the IMI herbicides was investigated. Molecular modeling provided the rational structural basis for the enantioselectivity of the acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) activity of the IMIs. These findings encourage the application of enantiopure R-IMI herbicides to capitalize on their advantages over the racemates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aacetolactate synthase 3acomputer simulation 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3aenvironmental impact 3aestrogenic properties 3agrowth retardation 3aimidazolinone herbicides 3amolecular models 3atoxicity 3aMichigan 0aChiral 0aEnantio-activity 0aEnantio-toxicity 0aMolecular docking1 aZhao, Lu1 aLiu, Kai1 aGuo, Fangjie1 aGao, Lidi1 aLiu, Weiping0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 01, v. 622-623 p.594-602dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010500169300001600274520176600290592002802056650002902084650001602113650001502129650002902144650001302173650001102186650001202197650002502209650001302234650001402247650001302261651001802274651001202292653003102304653002602335653001902361653002302380653001102403653002302414700001702437700001602454773010002470856008602570852000902656655001202665IND60527095420221118032814.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052709542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrumhansl, K.10aUsing species traits to assess human impacts on near shore benthic ecosystems in the Canadian Arctic  ap. 495-502.  aHuman activities have the potential to alter the diversity and composition of biological communities in natural environments, which can cause changes in ecosystem functioning. This has led to the development of environmental assessment techniques that take into account species identity, as species can contribute differently to various ecosystem processes. Biological Traits Analysis (BTA) is used to compare the abundances of specific biological traits in samples to produce information about how ecosystem functioning may change across a specific terrestrial or aquatic system. In the present study, BTA was used to assess the influence of municipal wastewater effluent on benthic marine communities in near shore soft sediments in four locations across the Canadian Arctic Territory of Nunavut, Canada. Shifts in trait composition were assessed relative to indicators of sediment enrichment (sediment chlorophyll, organic content, degree of anoxia), and natural variation in habitat characteristics (water depth, porosity, average grain size) at a site receiving wastewater and a reference site in each sampling location. The results indicated a mild enrichment effect of wastewater, as evidenced by changes in trait composition at three of the four sites that received wastewater inputs. However, the amount of variance in trait composition explained by metrics of wastewater enrichment in these locations were generally equal to or lower than the amount of variance explained by sediment characteristics related to natural processes. These results provide greater insight into the underlying causes and consequences of human activities than more traditional methods for environmental impact assessment, and can be directly applied in a management context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3achlorophyll 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3amunicipal wastewater 3aporosity 3asediments 3avariance 3aArctic region 3aNunavut 0aBiological Traits Analysis 0aBenthic invertebrates 0aSpecies traits 0aEcosystem function 0aArctic 0aWastewater impacts1 aJamieson, R.1 aKrkosek, W.0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.495-502dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03930naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007000150245014800220300001800368520200200386592002802388596006702416596008002483596009002563596007002653596017702723596009202900650001502992650002303007650001203030650002003042650001303062650001503075650001303090700005703103700005703160700002203217700005603239773011903295856008503414852000903499655001203508IND60778294120221119024836.0220524e20220504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c004022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Hernandez, J.

Herein, a B–A–B triBCP with crystallizable “B” blocks was used to achieve nanofiber aggregation and network formation. Crystallization of the solvophobic terminal blocks in the cores of distinct nanofibers resulted in nanofibers physically linked together by the solvophilic coronal “A” block. The triBCP used in this work, PFTMC₁₄-b-PEG₉₀₀-b-PFTMC₁₄, contains two crystallizable terminal poly(fluorenetrimethylene carbonate) (PFTMC) “B” blocks and a central poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) “A” block. Performing seeded growth/living crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA) with the triBCP at low concentrations (2 mg/mL) and with a low fraction of common solvent (10%) at 20 °C led to the formation of low-dispersity flowerlike nanofibers of controlled lengths with crystalline PFTMC cores and looped coronal chains. In contrast, when self-assembly of the triBCP was conducted at high concentration (>5 mg/mL) with high common solvent fraction (20%) at ≥70 °C with subsequent cooling to 20 °C, networks of nanofibers were obtained. Networks were also accessible from preformed nanofibers of controlled length prepared from PFTMC₁₅-b-PEG₂₆₅ diBCP via the addition of the triBCP under similar conditions. Bundling and entanglement of the nanofibers were observed by TEM and AFM. Macroscopic gels were formed when self-assembly was performed at very high concentrations (e.g., 20 mg/mL) and common solvent fractions (20%). Upon future extension to aqueous systems, the nanofiber network formation process would provide a route to hierarchical assemblies that are of potential interest as gel-like scaffolds for tissue engineering as well as other applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcUniversity of Victoriadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008997  aNAcCanada Foundation for Innovationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000196  aNAcJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aNAcCanada Research Chairsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001804  aNAcCanadian Network for Research and Innovation in Machining Technology, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002790  a748435cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog?adhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003141 3acarbonates 3acomposite polymers 3acooling 3acrystallization 3amicelles 3ananofibers 3asolvents1 aKang, Yuetong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8354-03921 aFukui, Tomoya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3339-11781 aFinnegan, John R.1 aManners, Ian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3794-967X0 tMacromolecules.g2022 May 04, v. 55, no. 10 p.3821-3830dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c004023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010700165300001600272520100800288592002801296650002101324650001301345650001701358650001701375650001001392650001501402650001801417650002601435650001101461650001701472650002201489650001801511650001601529653002401545653001301569653001301582653001901595700001401614700001401628700001401642700001601656700001601672700001401688773010801702856008601810852000901896655001201905IND60540885920221120071831.0190318e20150710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054088592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Di10aCarboxyl-modified poly(vinyl alcohol)-crosslinked chitosan hydrogel films for potential wound dressing  ap. 189-199.  aThe objective of this study was to develop a novel carboxyl-modified poly(vinyl alcohol)-crosslinked chitosan hydrogel films for potential wound dressing. To prepare the crosslinked hydrogels, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was grafted with succinate acid to yield carboxyl-modified poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA-COOH). Hydrogel films based on PVA-COOH and chitosan (CS) at different concentrations were crosslinked through the formation of amide linkages. The mechanical properties of these crosslinked hydrogel films in dry and swollen state were greatly improved with high swelling ratio. Water vapor and oxygen permeability evaluations indicated that crosslinked hydrogel films could maintain a moist environment over wound bed. Biocompatibility test showed the crosslinked hydrogels had no cytotoxicity and hemolytic potential. Gentamicin sulfate-loaded crosslinked hydrogel films showed sustained drug release profile, and could effectively suppress bacterial proliferation and protect wound from infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3agentamicin 3ahydrocolloids 3amechanical properties 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asuccinic acid 3awater vapor 0aPoly(vinyl alcohol) 0aChitosan 0aHydrogel 0aWound dressing1 aZhou, Wei1 aWei, Bing1 aWang, Xin1 aTang, Rupei1 aNie, Jiemin1 aWang, Jun0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 July 10, v. 125 p.189-199dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245013800184300001400322520133500336592002801671650001201699650001201711650001801723650001201741650002001753650002401773650002501797650001001822651001001832653002301842653002601865653001001891653001801901653001901919653002401938700002101962700001801983700002202001700002002023773011402043856008502157852000902242655001202251IND60542517520221119054348.0190403e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054251752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngone Obiang, Nestor Laurier10aDiagnosing the demographic balance of two light-demanding tree species populations in central Africa from their diameter distribution  ap. 55-62.  aThe diameter distribution of a tree species population in a natural forest reflects its demographic dynamics and the impact of past disturbances. A modal diameter distribution can be the mark of a demographic imbalance or it can be the consequence of a particular growth pattern. By comparing the observed diameter distribution with the one that follows from a reference growth model under the hypothesis of demographic balance, we diagnosed demographic balance. In a forest concession in Gabon before logging, an unbalanced diameter distribution was found for Aucoumea klaineana, a long-lived pioneer species and also a valuable commercial species. The Aucoumea klaineana population consisted of old trees without meaningful recruitment, thus indicating an ageing, declining population. In contrast, in the same concession, a balanced diameter distribution was found for Lophira alata, a pioneer to moderate light-demanding species. The history of this forest concession, once heavily populated and subsequently depleted from human perturbation (shifting cultivation), can be used to interpret these demographic statuses. These results reinforce the view of a forest that is constantly changing and shaped by past human perturbations, with the implication for its conservation that some kind of perturbation should be maintained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLophira 3aforests 3agrowth models 3alogging 3apioneer species 3apopulation dynamics 3ashifting cultivation 3atrees 3aGabon 0aAucoumea klaineana 0aDiameter distribution 0aGabon 0aLophira alata 0aNatural forest 0aPopulation dynamics1 aNgomanda, Alfred1 aHymas, Oliver1 aChézeauxl, Éric1 aPicard, Nicolas0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 313 p.55-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013100164500001900295520130900314592002801623650001601651650002701667650002001694650001501714650001601729651001601745700002201761700002101783700002001804700002001824773012301844856008001967852000902047655001202056IND60711720820221118110249.0200928e20200907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071172082DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology70300642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Mun-Ju 10aAnalysis of Groundwater Level Variations Caused by the Changes in Groundwater Withdrawals Using Long Short-Term Memory Network  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo properly manage the groundwater resources, it is necessary to analyze the impact of groundwater withdrawal on the groundwater level. In this study, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was used to evaluate the groundwater level prediction performance and analyze the impact of the change in the amount of groundwater withdrawal from the pumping wells on the change in the groundwater level in the nearby monitoring wells located in Jeju Island, Korea. The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency between the observed and simulated groundwater level was over 0.97. Therefore, the groundwater prediction performance of LSTM was remarkably high. If the groundwater level is simulated on the assumption that the future withdrawal amount is reduced by 1/3 of the current groundwater withdrawal, the range of the maximum rise of the groundwater level would be 0.06–0.13 m compared to the current condition. In addition, assuming that no groundwater is taken, the range of the maximum increase in the groundwater level would be 0.11–0.38 m more than the current condition. Therefore, the effect of groundwater withdrawal on the groundwater level in this area was exceedingly small. The method and results can be used to develop new groundwater withdrawal sources for the redistribution of groundwater withdrawals.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3awater table 3aSouth Korea1 aMoon, Soo-Hyoung 1 aKang, Kyung  Goo1 aMoon, Duk-Chul 1 aKoh, Hyuk-Joon 0 tHydrology.g2020 Sept. 07, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology70300643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245014300164520121200307592002801519650002201547650000801569650002601577650002601603650001301629650001901642650002001661650001301681650001801694650001401712650001501726650002901741650001401770650001301784650001501797650001101812650003701823650001401860653001001874653002601884653002601910653002201936653002601958700001901984700001702003700001702020700001602037700002002053700001602073700001402089700002302103700001102126700001602137700001702153773009802170856008702268852000902355655001202364IND60783754820221121203300.0220921e20221002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078375482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2022.1988732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fei10aIsolation and genomic characterization of a novel Autographiviridae bacteriophage IME184 with lytic activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae  aKlebsiella pneumoniae, a multidrug resistant bacterium that causes nosocomial infections including septicemia, pneumonia etc. Bacteriophages are potential antimicrobial agents for the treatment of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In this study, a novel bacteriophage IME184, was isolated from hospital sewage against clinical multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Transmission electron microscopy and genomic characterization exhibited this phage belongs to the Molineuxvirinae genus, Autographiviridae family. Phage IME184 possessed a double-stranded DNA genome composed of 44,598 bp with a GC content of 50.3%. The phage genome encodes 57 open reading frames, out of 26 are hypothetical proteins while 31 had assigned putative functions. No tRNA, virulence related or antibiotic resistance genes were found in phage genome. Comparative genomic analysis showed that phage IME184 has 94% similarity with genomic sequence of Klebsiella phage K1-ULIP33 (MK380014.1). Multiplicity of infection, one step growth curve and host range of phage were also measured. According to findings, Phage IME184 is a promising biological agent that infects Klebsiella pneumoniae and can be used in future phage therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographiviridae 3aDNA 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3across infection 3agenomics 3agrowth curves 3ahospitals 3ahost range 3amultiple drug resistance 3apneumonia 3aresearch 3asepticemia 3asewage 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avirulence 0aPhage 0aMulti-drug resistance 0aKlebsiella pneumoniae 0aAutographiviridae 0aNosocomial infections1 aTian, Fengjuan1 aNazir, Amina1 aSui, Shujing1 aLi, Mengzhe1 aCheng, Dongxiao1 aNong, Siqin1 aAli, Azam1 aKaKar, Mohib-Ullah1 aLi, Lu1 aFeng, Qiang1 aTong, Yigang0 tVirus research.g2022 Oct. 02, v. 319 p.198873-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2022.1988733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011700175300001600292520132000308592002801628650001501656650001501671650002801686650001201714650002501726650002201751650001801773700002401791700001901815700002301834700001701857700002301874700002101897773009701918856008502015852000902100655001202109IND60086051620221119075111.0141101e20110803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008605162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuster, Robert-Paul10aAllostatic load associations to acute, 3-year and 6-year prospective depressive symptoms in healthy older adults  ap. 360-364.  aAllostatic load represents the strain that chronic stress exerts on interconnected biological systems. Associated algorithms are related to numerous deleterious physical outcomes in older populations, and yet few studies have assessed associations to mental health outcomes like geriatric depression. Using data from the Douglas Hospital Longitudinal Study of Normal and Pathological Aging, we assessed whether using an allostatic load index derived from seven biomarkers could detect self-rated depressive symptoms in 58 healthy older adults followed longitudinally over a 6-year period. Our results revealed that increased allostatic load was associated with increased depressive symptoms on the same year of assessment. After 3years, AL was prospectively associated with depressive symptoms, but entering age and sex as covariates attenuated this effect to a trend. Only age emerged as a significant predictor of depressive symptoms over 6years. These findings suggest that increased AL in older age is only associated with depressive symptomatology acutely. Over longer periods of time, however, the physical and psychological sequelae of advanced age may contribute to increased depressive symptoms via pathways otherwise undetectable using allostatic load indices of sub-clinical physiological dysregulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiomarkers 3acomplications (disease) 3aelderly 3alongitudinal studies 3amental depression 3amental health1 aMarin, Marie-France1 aSindi, Shireen1 aNair, N.P.

Gold nanoplates (Au NPLs) show unique geometrical structures with high ratios of surface to bulk atoms, which display fascinating plasmonic properties but require optimization. This study presented a systematic investigation of the influence of different parameters (shape, aspect ratio, and resonance mode) on localized surface plasmon resonance properties, refractive index (RI, n) sensitivities, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement ability of different types of Au NPLs through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. As a proof of concept, triangular, circular, and hexagonal Au NPLs with varying aspect ratios were fabricated via a three-step seed-mediated growth method by the experiment. Both FDTD-simulated and measured experimental results confirm that the RI sensitivities increase with the aspect ratio. Furthermore, choosing a lower order resonance mode of Au NPLs benefits higher RI sensitivities. The SERS enhancement abilities of Au NPLs also predicted to be highly dependent on the shape and aspect ratio. The triangular Au NPLs showed the highest SERS enhancement ability, while it drastically decreased for circular Au NPLs after the rounding process. The SERS enhancement ability gradually became more intense as the hexagonal Au NPLs overgrown on circular Au NPLs with increasing volumes of HAuCl₄ solution. The results are expected to help develop effective biosensors.  aPublisher supplied data  a202006860052cChina Scholarship Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004543  aRZ2100002826cXihua Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008083 3abiosensors 3arefractive index 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aQiao, Ling1 aXia, Zhichao1 aYu, Jiaming1 aWang, Xiaozhou1 aHuang, Juhong1 aShu, Chang1 aWu, Caijun1 aHe, Yi0 tLangmuir.g2022 May 12, v. 38, no. 20 p.6454-6463dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c006633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165300001600265520168100281592002801962650001101990650001702001650002402018650001202042650001002054650001402064650001602078650001002094650001502104650001102119650001402130650002602144650002802170651002102198653001702219653001702236653001902253653001802272653002302290653001602313653001802329653001702347653001502364653002102379653002802400653002002428653001802448653001802466653001602484653001802500653002802518653002502546700001502571700002102586700002202607773011802629856008202747852000902829655001202838IND60516001620221119210153.0190805e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051600162DNAL7 a10.1017/S20786336120003312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, Orhan14aThe domestic livestock resources of Turkey: goat breeds and types and their conservation status  ap. 105-116.  aGoats were first domesticated in Turkey some 10 000–11 000 years ago. The country's population of 5.1 million goats in 2009 (down from 24.6 million in 1960) are still an important livelihood asset for smallholder farmers and nationally are a rich array of farm animal genetic resources of current enormous and future inestimable value. The structure of agriculture is such that most farms are predominantly subsistence oriented, of small size, keep few animals and provide only minimal inputs. Native breeds have evolved to meet these conditions and are generally well adapted to the natural environment, inadequate and unbalanced nutrition and disease stress. In general, there are two classes of goat, the one being the iconic Angora that produces mohair and the other the “common” or “hair” goat. The reduction in numbers is owing to a variety of reasons both internal and external to the country, but the Angora, which now amounts to only 2.5 percent of national goat numbers, has suffered relatively more than the hair types. This paper, based on detailed reviews of the literature and on the authors' own experiences, provides information on 17 breeds or recognized populations of Turkey's goat genetic resources and their conservation status. The government is now aware of the danger of the impoverishment or loss of this important aspect of biodiversity and has established programmes for conservation and preservation of several native breeds. The government, research institutions and producers should work together to ensure that the local gene pool is preserved and can thus continue to contribute to biodiversity and sustainable livestock production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3abiodiversity 3aconservation status 3afarmers 3afarms 3agene pool 3agoat breeds 3agoats 3alivelihood 3amohair 3anutrition 3aresearch institutions 3asustainable agriculture 3aTurkey (country) 0abiodiversity 0aconservation 0across-breeding 0anative breeds 0aproduction systems 0arisk status 0abiodiversité 0aconservation 0acroisement 0araces indigènes 0asystèmes de production 0aétat de danger 0abiodiversidad 0aconservación 0acruzamiento 0arazas nativas 0asistemas de producción 0asituación de riesgo1 aKor, Askin1 aErtugrul, Mehmet1 aWilson, R.

In this article, a novel method based on Fick’s law, accelerated penetration extraction (APE), was developed for the first time for polyphenol recovery from PS, which aimed at precipitating the polyphenols with Ca²⁺ in alkaline conditions to elevate the concentration gradient between the cell and solution, thus promoting the further penetration of polyphenols to solution. Under the optimal conditions of 8 mg/mL of CaCl₂ and 3 mg/mL of NaOH of APE, the highest polyphenol yield of 113.5 mg GAE/g was obtained, higher than solvent extraction (SE, 92.9 mg GAE/g) by 21.6%. The comparisons of SE and APE were performed, including the polyphenol yields, UV–vis spectra, composition analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and DPPH-scavenging ability. Results showed that APE was non-selective, almost all kinds of polyphenols could be precipitated by alkaline Ca²⁺, and the antioxidation of polyphenols could not be affected by APE. In addition, the mechanisms were discussed based on the mass transfer principle. Results indicated that APE was non-selective, efficient, easily operated, and promising in PS disposal and polyphenol extraction. Most importantly, the application of APE exploited the different concept with other methods to enhance the extraction process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3afruits 3agreen chemistry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass transfer 3apolyphenols 3apomegranates 3asolvents 0apomegranate skins 0aaccelerated penetration extraction 0aHPLC 0aantioxidation1 aZhao, Shunan1 aYang, Xiaoling1 aGuo, Haocheng1 aLi, Yinhui1 aXu, Weidong1 aChen, Jin1 aWang, Zonghan1 aGuo, Mingming1 aLiu, Donghong0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 9, no. 10 p.3702-3709dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c080133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010500170300001800275520098100293592002801274596009201302596007001394596006701464650001701531650001101548650001601559700002101575700001801596700002301614700002301637700001901660700005701679773011301736856008501849852000901934655001201943IND60778291420220524000000.0220524e20220511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c006682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRouvière, Lisa10aSilane-Based SAMs Deposited by Spin Coating as a Versatile Alternative Process to Solution Immersion  ap. 6464-6471.  aFunctionalization of silica surfaces with silane-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) is widely used in material sciences to tune surface properties and introduce terminal functional groups enabling subsequent chemical surface reactions and immobilization of (bio)molecules. Here, we report on the synthesis of four organotrimethoxysilanes with various molecular structures and we compare their grafting by spin coating with the one performed by the conventional solution immersion method. Strikingly, this study clearly demonstrates that the spin coating technique is a versatile, fast, and more convenient alternative process to prepare robust, smooth, and homogeneous SAMs with similar properties and quality as those deposited via immersion. SAMs were characterized by PM-IRRAS, AFM, and wettability measurements. SAMs can undergo several chemical surface modifications, and the reactivity of amine-terminated SAM was confirmed by PM-IRRAS and fluorescence measurements.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcCentre National de la Recherche Scientifiquedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004794  aNAcUniversit? de Bordeauxdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006251  aNAcConsulat G?n?ral de France ?

This impediment has contributed to a serious time-lag in developing EU policy-relevant fish-based indices in the Eastern Mediterranean countries. Here we present the first model-based fish index for the Eastern Mediterranean (the Hellenic Fish Index, HeFI) in an effort to overcome biogeographic differences among the area's biotically heterogeneous rivers. The index is based on modelled reference conditions and employs site-specific electrofished fish samples from an extensive dataset from Greece that covers six freshwater ecoregions, including five transboundary river basins flowing through six countries. Environmental and anthropogenic pressure data were procured from 403 sampled river sites and ecologically-relevant traits were defined for 103 collected fish species. For the development of the index, we first diagnosed least degraded sites forming a calibrated reference site dataset and secondly quantified differences of fish metrics between the reference and impaired sites. Four trait-based fish metrics showed the best ability to discriminate between impaired and reference sites. The index performed well in discriminating anthropogenic pressure classes, giving a significant negative linear response to a gradient of anthropogenic degradation. HeFI successfully assessed both small and large rivers in different freshwater ecoregions. This geographically broad-scale index development shows that key trait-based reference conditions can be produced by a predictive model in remarkably heterogeneous rivers where range-restricted fishes dominate. This index promotes a screening-level bioassessment application that may be further developed and refined with relevant monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiogeography 3abiological assessment 3adata collection 3aecoregions 3aecosystems 3afish 3afreshwater 3aindigenous species 3amonitoring 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aGreece 3aMediterranean region 0aFish communities 0aEcological quality 0aFreshwater ecoregions 0aMediterranean rivers 0aIndex1 aTachos, V.1 aEconomou, A.N.1 aChatzinikolaou, Y.1 aKoutsikos, N.1 aSchmutz, S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 01, v. 622-623 p.676-689dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.2933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245009300189300001800282520139400300592002801694650001101722650001901733650001701752650001301769650001901782650001301801650000701814650001301821650000901834650002101843650002601864650003501890650003101925650002301956650001901979650003101998650002102029700001702050700002402067700002802091773008802119856008402207852000902291655001202300IND60088188420221117205451.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008818842DNAL7 a211151862pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Laat, Joseph10aConcentration levels of urea in swimming pool water and reactivity of chlorine with urea  ap. 1139-1146.  aThis study investigated the reactivity of chlorine with urea which is the main nitrogen contaminant introduced into swimming pool water by bathers. In the first part of this study, analyses showed that the mean concentrations of urea and TOC determined from 50 samples of municipal swimming pool were equal to 18.0 μM (s.d. 11.7) and 3.5 mg C L⁻¹ (s.d. 1.6), respectively. The mean value for the urea contribution to the TOC content was 6.3% (s.d. 3.3). The rate of decomposition of urea in swimming pool water measured during the closure time of the facility was very slow (decay at the rate of ≈1% per hour in the presence of 1.6–1.8 mg L⁻¹ of free chlorine). In the second part of this work, experiments carried out with phosphate buffered solutions of urea ([Urea]₀ = 1 mM; [Cl₂]₀/[Urea]₀: 0.5–15 mol/mol; pH 7.4 ± 0.2; reaction time: 0–200 h) showed that long term chlorine demand of urea was about 5 mol Cl₂/mol of urea. Chlorination led to a complete mineralization of organic carbon into CO₂ for a chlorine dose of 3.5 mol/mol and to the formation of 0.7–0.8 mol NO₃ ⁻/mol of urea for chlorine dose of 8–10 mol/mol. Experiments conducted with dilute solutions of urea ([Urea]₀ = 50 μM; pH ≈ 7.3) confirmed that the degradation rate of urea by chlorine is very slow under conditions simulating real swimming pool water.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorination 3achlorine 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3apH 3aswimming 3aurea 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aChloraminesxanalysis 2aChlorinexanalysisxchemistry. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aSwimming Pools 2aUreaxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWaterxchemistry1 aFeng, Wentao1 aFreyfer, Diab Adams1 aDossier-Berne, Florence0 tWater research.g2011 Jan., v. 45, no. 3 p.1139-1146dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010100170300001800271500001900289520128900308592002801597650001301625650001101638650001301649650003401662650001701696650001301713650002001726653002101746653002701767653003501794653004401829653002101873653001301894700001901907700002001926700001901946700002301965700001601988700001702004700002202021700001502043700005802058773014402116856008502260852000902345655001202354IND60730992220221122165254.0210315e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073099222DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c081192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Songqiao10aAmorphous Carbon Nano-Interface-Modified Aluminum Anodes for High-Performance Dual-Ion Batteries  ap. 3710-3717.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDual-ion batteries (DIBs) are one of the promising candidates to meet the low-cost requirements of commercial applications because of their high working voltage, excellent safety, and environmental friendliness. In addition to the electrolyte, the research on DIBs mainly focuses on the electrode materials, especially the high-performance anodes. Alloy-type materials, such as Si, Sn, Al, and so forth, are promising alternative anodes owing to their large abundance, excellent conductivity, and especially high specific capacity. However, the alloy-type anodes tend to pulverize due to the excessive volume expansion during the alloying/dealloying process, along with repeated growth/fracture of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and continuous consumption of the electrolyte. Herein, we have successfully developed an amorphous carbon nanointerface (ACNI) (<10 nm) coated on an Al anode that acts as an artificial SEI to prevent the continuous growth of the formed SEI layer and maintain its structural stability. Further, pairing this ultrathin ACNI/Al anode with the graphite cathode constructs proof-of-concept DIBs, exhibiting significantly improved performances with a specific capacity of 115 mA h g–¹ and a capacity retention ratio of ∼94% after 1000 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolytes 3agraphene 3agreen chemistry 0adual-ion battery 0aamorphous carbon films 0aamorphous carbon nanointerface 0aartificial solid electrolyte interphase 0aalloy-type anode 0aAl anode1 aZhou, Xiaolong1 aTunmee, Sarayut1 aLi, Zhongzhong1 aKidkhunthod, Pinit1 aPeng, Manqi1 aWang, Wenlou1 aSaitoh, Hidetoshi1 aZhang, Fan1 aTang, Yongbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2705-46180 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 9, no. 10 p.3710-3717dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c081193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009800165500001400263520176900277592002802046650001002074650001402084650001202098650000902110650001102119650001702130650000902147650001602156650001502172650001902187650001702206650001402223650002502237650000902262700002702271773012202298856007402420852000902494655001202503IND60724548020221120133455.0210122e20201226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072454802DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130100532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrangos, Theoharris 10aZinc and Cadmium in the Aetiology and Pathogenesis of Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis  aNAL-light  aOsteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are inflammatory articular conditions with different aetiology, but both result in joint damage. The nutritionally essential metal zinc (Zn²⁺) and the non-essential metal cadmium (Cd²⁺) have roles in these arthritic diseases as effectors of the immune system, inflammation, and metabolism. Despite both metal ions being redox-inert in biology, they affect the redox balance. It has been known for decades that zinc decreases in the blood of RA patients. It is largely unknown, however, whether this change is only a manifestation of an acute phase response in inflammation or relates to altered availability of zinc in tissues and consequently requires changes of zinc in the diet. As a cofactor in over 3000 human proteins and as a signaling ion, zinc affects many pathways relevant for arthritic disease. How it affects the diseases is not just a question of zinc status, but also an issue of mutations in the many proteins that maintain cellular zinc homoeostasis, such as zinc transporters of the ZIP (Zrt-/Irt-like protein) and ZnT families and metallothioneins, and the multiple pathways that change the expression of these proteins. Cadmium interferes with zinc’s functions and there is increased uptake under zinc deficiency. Remarkably, cadmium exposure through inhalation is now recognized in the activation of macrophages to a pro-inflammatory state and suggested as a trigger of a specific form of nodular RA. Here, we discuss how these metal ions participate in the genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors that lead to joint destruction. We conclude that both metal ions should be monitored routinely in arthritic disease and that there is untapped potential for prognosis and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abreathing 3acadmium 3adiet 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alead 3amacrophages 3ametabolism 3aosteoarthritis 3apathogenesis 3aprognosis 3arheumatoid arthritis 3azinc1 aMaret, W.q(Wolfgang),0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 26, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130100533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04092naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245009300206300001600299520248900315592002802804650001202832650001402844650001402858650002502872650002302897650001702920650001402937650002802951650001902979650001402998650000703012650001403019650002203033650001203055650001703067650001803084651001003102651001803112653002003130653001703150653002703167653001403194653002203208653001203230700001603242700002603258700001603284700001603300700001503316773010003331856008603431852000903517655001203526IND60527092320221118032736.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052709232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.06.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4640-997110aDiatoms are better indicators of urban stream conditions: A case study in Beijing, China  ap. 265-274.  aUrbanization dramatically affects hydrology, water quality and aquatic ecosystem composition. Here we characterized changes in diatom assemblages along an urban-to-rural gradient to assess impacts of urbanization on stream conditions in Beijing, China. Diatoms, water chemistry, and physical variables were measured at 22 urban (6 in upstream and 16 in downstream) and 7 rural reference stream sites during July and August of 2013. One-way ANOVA showed that water physical and chemical variables were significantly different (p<0.05) between urban downstream and both reference and urban upstream sites, but not between reference and urban upstream sites (p>0.05). Similarly, structural metrics, including species richness (S), Shannon diversity (H′), species evenness (J′) and Simpson diversity (D′), were significantly different (p<0.05) between urban downstream and both reference and urban upstream sites, but not (p>0.05) between reference and urban upstream sites. However, diatom assemblages were very different among all sites. Achnanthidium minutissima was a consistent dominant species in reference sites; Staurosira construens var. venter and Pseudostaurosira brevistriata were the dominant species in urban upstream sites; and Nitzschia palea was the dominant species in urban downstream sites. Clustering analyses based on the relative abundance of diatom species, showed all the samples fit into three groups: reference sites, urban upstream sites, and urban downstream sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Monte Carlo permutation tests showed that concentration of K+, EC, TN, Cl− and pH were positively correlated with relative abundance of dominant diatom species in urban downstream samples; WT and F− were correlated with reference and urban stream diatom composition. Our results demonstrate that the composition of diatom species was more sensitive to urbanization than the water physical and chemical parameters, and that diatom assemblage structure metrics more accurately assessed water quality. Some species, such as Amphora pediculus and Cocconeis placentula were among the dominant species in low nutrients stream sites; however, they were considered to be high nutrient indicators in some streams in USA. We suggest using caution in applying indicator indices based on species composition from other regions. It is necessary to build a complete set of diatom species data and their co-ordinate environment data for specific regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphora 3aCocconeis 3aNitzschia 3aanalysis of variance 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acase studies 3achlorides 3acorrespondence analysis 3ahydrochemistry 3anutrients 3apH 3apotassium 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3aChina 3aUnited States 0aBenthic diatoms 0aUrban stream 0aUrban–rural gradient 0aNutrients 0aIndicator species 0aBeijing1 aZhou, Weiqi1 aPickett, Steward T.A.1 aLi, Weifeng1 aHan, Lijian1 aRen, Yufen0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.265-274dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.06.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001600268520112400284592002801408650002201436650004401458650002201502650002001524650001901544650001901563650001201582650001401594650001401608650001301622650002201635650001101657650002201668650001901690650001701709650001401726650001901740650001901759650002801778650001301806650002101819650002201840650002101862650003701883700002701920700002701947700002701974700002202001700002402023700003002047700001702077700001602094700001902110773011102129856008102240852000902321655001202330IND60579084320221119161651.0170815e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057908432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-016-0854-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDungani, Rudi10aPreparation and Fundamental Characterization of Cellulose Nanocrystal from Oil Palm Fronds Biomass  ap. 692-700.  aThe objective of this work was to isolate cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) from oil palm fronds (Elaeis guineensis) and its subsequent characterization. Isolation involves sodium hydroxide/anthraquinone pulping with mechanical refining followed by total chlorine free bleaching (includes oxygen delignification, hydrogen peroxide oxidation and peracetic acid treatment) before acid hydrolysis. Bleaching significantly decreased kappa number and increased α-cellulose percentage of fibers as confirmed by Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry standards. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis revealed that acid hydrolysis along with bleaching improved crystallinity index and thermal stability of the extracted nanocrystals. It was observed that CNC maintained its cellulose 1 polymorph despite hydrolysis treatment. Mean diameter as observed by TEM and average fiber aspect ratio of obtained CNC was 7.44 ± 0.17 nm and 16.53 ± 3.52, respectively making it suitable as a reinforcing material for nanocomposite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid hydrolysis 3aacid treatment 3aanthraquinones 3abiomass 3ableaching 3acellulose 3achlorine 3acrystal structure 3afronds 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3aoxidation 3aoxygen pulping 3aperacetic acid 3apulp and paper industry 3arefining 3asodium hydroxide 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aOwolabi, Abdulwahab F.1 aSaurabh, Chaturbhuj K.1 aAbdul Khalil, H.

Despite having large band gap energy, which is enough for phenol degradation, zinc oxide (ZnO) has low photocatalytic efficiency. In this study, ZnO was modified by lanthanum (La) species, and the improved photocatalytic activity was confirmed for degradation of phenol under visible and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. The ZnO and its modified photocatalysts were prepared by the hydrothermal method in the absence and presence of La species (0.01‒2 wt%). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed that the addition of La did not disturb the structure of ZnO, but slightly decreased the crystallite size. While the La addition up to 1 wt% did not affect the optical properties of the ZnO, the addition of 2 wt% La slightly red-shifted the absorption band edge of the ZnO. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra showed La oxide formation observed at 515-540 cm-1 after 2 wt% La addition. Fluorescence emission spectra revealed that synthesized ZnO has oxygen vacancies at 558 nm, and the presence of 1 wt% La did not significantly affect the emission intensity. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO was influenced by the La addition, where the best performance was obtained on the ZnO with 1 wt% La. This study demonstrated that the optimum amount of La species could increase the performance of the ZnO.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3acrystallites 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3ahot water treatment 3airradiation 3alanthanum 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3azinc oxide 0alanthanum 0aphenol degradation 0aphotocatalysis 0azinc oxide1 aLintang, Hendrik Oktendy1 aYuliati, Leny0 tJurnal Kimia Sains dan Aplikasi.g2020 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.109-116dChemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics, Diponegoro UniversitywJournal:27751x2597-99147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.14710/jksa.23.4.109-1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100002100175245008500196300001800281520162700299592002801926650001101954650001801965650003001983650001602013650002702029650001602056650001202072650002302084650003702107650004002144650003902184650005702223650005802280650002002338650004502358650004602403650005502449650002702504650004202531650006302573700002102636700001802657773008802675856009202763852000902855655001202864IND4451689520221118070135.0141111e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445168952DNAL7 a212958342pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFields, Sarah D.10aFibroblast growth factor requirements for in vitro development of bovine embryos  ap. 1466-1475.  aThe overall goal was to describe the importance of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) during development of the bovine embryo. An inhibitor of FGF receptor kinase activity (SU5402) was used to examine whether FGF signaling is required for embryo development. Addition of 20 μM SU5402 on Day 0 (Day of IVF) reduced (P = 0.04) the percentage of oocytes becoming blastocysts on Day 7 compared to controls (5.9 ± 2.1 vs 16.9 ± 2.4; average ± SEM). Also, Day-8 blastocysts placed into individual culture drops of medium containing SU5402 tended to have decreased (P = 0.08) blastomere numbers at Day 11 (211.1 ± 27.5 vs 297.8 ± 25.0). A second series of studies determined if supplemental FGF2 enhances development in vitro. There was no effect of FGF2 on cleavage or blastocyst development rates when 5 or 100 ng/mL FGF2 was provided immediately after fertilization. Also, FGF2 supplementation beginning on Day 5 post-fertilization did not significantly affect blastocyst rates or the number of trophoblast and inner cell mass cells. However, addition of 500 ng/mL FGF2 at both Day 0 and Day 4 increased (P = 0.03) the percentage of oocytes that became blastocysts on Day 7 compared with controls (27.4 ± 1.3 vs 19.7 ± 1.3). In a final study, the thermal-protective ability of FGF2 was examined by adding FGF2 1 h before exposing Day 5 embryos to heat shock. Addition of FGF2 did not significantly influence embryo thermal-tolerance. In conclusion, FGF receptor activation was important for optimal blastocyst formation and FGF2 supplementation increased bovine blastocyst formation when provided at high concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3aembryogenesis 3afibroblast growth factors 3aheat stress 3ain vitro fertilization 3atrophoblast 2aAnimals 2aCattlexembryology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effects 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aFibroblast Growth Factorsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxphysiology 2aHot Temperature 2aInterferon Type Ixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPregnancy Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein-Tyrosine Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPyrrolesxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Fibroblast Growth Factorxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aHansen, Peter J.1 aEaly, Alan D.0 tTheriogenology.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 8 p.1466-1475dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008600164500001400250520166300264592002801927650001801955650001301973650001401986650001602000650000902016650001402025650001702039650001002056650000902066650003002075650002902105650002402134650002802158650001002186650002002196650001702216650001002233650001602243700002302259700002402282700002802306700002302334773012202357856007402479852000902553655001202562IND60724548320221120133528.0210122e20201227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072454832DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130100572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewczyński, Adam 10aNutritional Support in Head and Neck Radiotherapy Patients Considering HPV Status  aNAL-light  aMalnutrition is a common problem in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), including oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).

The severe dysphagia leads to a definitive total impossibility of eating through the mouth in 20–30% of patients. These patients usually require enteral nutritional support. Feeding tubes are a commonly used nutritional intervention during radiotherapy, most frequently percutaneous gastrostomy tube. Recently, a novel HPV-related type of OPC has been described. Patients with HPV-associated OPC are different from the HPV- ones. Typical HPV- OPC is associated with smoking and alcohol abuse. Patients with HPV+ OPC are younger and healthy (without comorbidities) at diagnosis compared to HPV- ones. Patients with OPC are at high nutritional risk, and therefore, they require nutritional support in order to improve the treatment results and quality of life. Some authors noted the high incidence of critical weight loss (CWL) in patients with HPV-related OPC. Other authors have observed the increased acute toxicities during oncological treatment in HPV+ OPC patients compared to HPV- ones. The aim of this paper is to review and discuss the indications for nutritional support and the kinds of nutrition, including immunonutrition (IN), in HNC, particularly OPC patients, undergoing RT/CRT, considering HPV status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol abuse 3aappetite 3adysphagia 3afood intake 3ahead 3aincidence 3amalnutrition 3amouth 3aneck 3anutrition risk assessment 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional support 3aoropharyngeal neoplasms 3apaper 3aquality of life 3aradiotherapy 3ataste 3aweight loss1 aJablonská, Beata,1 aMrowiec, Sławomir 1 aSkładowski, Krzysztof 1 aRutkowski, Tomasz 0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 27, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130100573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245015600185300001800341520157800359592002801937650001501965650001201980650001101992650001402003650000902017650001502026650001102041650002302052650001502075650002302090650003302113650003202146650002202178650002702200650001302227650002002240650002402260700001702284700002002301700001702321700001402338773008802352856008402440852000902524655001202533IND60088188820221117205615.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008818882DNAL7 a211468452pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lanjuan10aDisplacement mechanism of binary competitive adsorption for aqueous divalent metal ions onto a novel IDA-chelating resin: Isotherm and kinetic modeling  ap. 1177-1188.  aAdsorptive properties for Cu (II), Pb (II) and Cd (II) onto an iminodiacetic acid (IDA) chelating resin were systematically investigated at the optimal pH-value in both single and binary solutions using batch experiments. The Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo second-order rate equation could explain respectively the isotherm and kinetic experimental data for sole-component system with much satisfaction. The maximum adsorption capacity in single system for Cu (II), Pb (II) and Cd (II) was calculated to be 2.27mmol/g, 1.27mmol/g and 0.65mmol/g individually. The initial adsorption rate followed the order as Cu (II)>Pb (II)>Cd (II) at the fixed initial concentration, and for each metal the initial sorption rate increased as the initial concentration increased. In addition, the modified Langmuir model could describe the binary competitive adsorption behavior successfully, with which the interaction coefficient was obtained to follow the order as Cu (II)<Pb (II)<Cd (II). Furthermore, in every case of the investigated three binary systems, the reduction in both the uptake amounts and distribution coefficients testified the antagonistic competitive phenomena. Obviously, this novel IDA-chelating resin possessed of a good selectivity toward Cu (II) over Pb (II) and Cd (II) for the obtained highest separation factor values were up to 21.30 and 133.91 in the range of tested. This interaction mechanism between the favorable component and other metal ions could mainly contribute to the direct displacement impact which be herewith illustrated schematically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3acopper 3aequations 3alead 3ametal ions 3amodels 3asorption isotherms 2aAdsorption 2aCadmiumxchemistry 2aCations, Divalentxchemistry 2aChelating Agentsxchemistry 2aCopperxchemistry 2aImino Acidsxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aLeadxchemistry 2aModels, Theoretical1 aLiu, Fuqiang1 aJing, Xiaosheng1 aLing, Panpan1 aLi, Aimin0 tWater research.g2011 Jan., v. 45, no. 3 p.1177-1188dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245015500170300001600325520062900341592002800970650001900998650001501017650001501032650002401047650001101071650002301082650003001105650002401135650003101159650001101190650001601201650001401217651001401231651001101245653001501256653002301271653002601294653001101320700002701331700003501358700002301393700003001416773012901446856007601575852000901651655001201660IND60594392020221118012451.0180625e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059439202DNAL7 a10.1653/024.100.03312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNascimento, Lucas Inoue10aFirst Global Record of Podisus nigrispinus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) as Predator of Gonipterus platensis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) Larvae and Adults  ap. 675-677.  aNative to Australia Gonipterus platensis Marelli (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is the main beetle defoliator of eucalyptus worldwide, causing damage in various regions in which it was introduced, where its management relies mostly on biological control with the parasitoid Anaphes nitens (Girault) (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae).

Soil erosion is one of the main environmental problems for European Mediterranean agro-forestry systems, making soil erosion prevention a key ecosystem service to monitor and assess. Here, we present a spatially and temporally explicit assessment of the provision of soil erosion prevention by vegetation in Mediterranean Europe between 2001 and 2013, including maps of vulnerable areas. We follow a recently described conceptual framework for the mapping and assessment of regulating ecosystem services to calculate eight process-based indicators, and an ecosystem service provision profile. Results show a relative increase in the effectiveness of provision of soil erosion prevention in Mediterranean Europe between 2001 and 2013. This increase is particularly noticeable between 2009 and 2013, but it does not represent a general trend across the whole Mediterranean region. Two regional examples describe contrasting trends and illustrate the need for regional assessments and policy targets. Our results demonstrate the strength of having a coherent and complementary set of indicators for regulating services to inform policy and land management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3adevelopment policy 3aecosystem services 3aland management 3aland policy 3asoil erosion 3avegetation 3aEurope 3aMediterranean region 0aEcosystem service mapping 0aIndicators 0aChange detection 0aPolicy support 0aTrend assessment 0aRUSLE1 aMaes, Joachim1 aGeijzendorffer, Ilse1 aMetzger, Marc J.0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.213-222dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245011500177300001400292520148500306592002801791650001201819650001401831650001401845650001001859650002301869650001201892773011701904856008302021852000902104655001202113IND60088141420221119132544.0141102e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008814142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2012.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeufeld, Christopher J.10aBarnacle appendage plasticity: Asymmetrical response time-lags, developmental mechanics and seasonal variation  ap. 20-27.  aExamples of morphological plasticity now exist across a wide range of taxa and experimental systems. Much of what we know about such plasticity comes from field and laboratory manipulations assessing the magnitude of plastic responses. However, we know much less about how – and how quickly – such changes occur, nor about how changes in form track natural environmental variation. Knowing more about plastic responses under natural conditions is important to help identify developmental costs and limits that may restrict the evolution of plasticity in variable environments. In this study, I measured leg and penis form plasticity in the common Pacific acorn barnacle Balanus glandula. A ten-week transplant experiment under natural conditions in the intertidal revealed: i) barnacles took longer to change leg form than previously thought, ii) response rates depended on transplant direction, and iii) barnacles changed leg length through a combined response of growing longer leg segments and adding more leg segments. Furthermore, a two-year survey of barnacle leg and penis form in natural populations revealed that barnacle leg and penis form varied in a manner consistent with adaptation to seasonal variation in wave height. Together, these results suggest that resource acquisition under natural conditions may be an important and underappreciated limit on morphological response times in natural systems, and shed light on how such changes occur during development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalanus 3aevolution 3amechanics 3apenis 3aseasonal variation 3asurveys0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 429 p.20-27dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2012.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245017600173300001800349520056000367536009700927592002801024596004901052650001901101650001001120650001201130650001501142650001001157650001401167650001601181651003701197651001101234651001101245653001301256653003801269653003101307653001401338653002301352653002201375700001901397773012601416856008501542852000901627655001201636IND60602910220221120110315.0180711e20180711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060291022DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2018.14808122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCumberlidge, Neil10aAlbertine Rift Valley endemics: three new species of freshwater crabs (Brachyura: Potamoidea: Potamonautidae) from Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda  ap. 1637-1656.  aThree new species of potamonautid freshwater crabs are described from the Albertine Rift Valley, Eastern Africa.

Due to the selective adsorption of MIPMs to bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogues, addition of MIPMs to activated sludge increased levels of BPA and its metabolites, which were also the substrates of biodegradation. Higher substrates (BPA and its metabolites) level promoted biodegradation efficiencies of activated sludge via accelerating removal speed of BPA and its metabolites, increasing degradation rate and decreasing half-lives of biodegradation. The enhancement of MIPMs in degradation efficiencies was more significant in environmental water containing low-level of pollutants, and water containing interferences such as heavy metals and humic acid. Furthermore, MIPMs were more suitable than non-selective sorbents such as active carbon to be used as enhancer for BPA biodegradation.

For all the self-mated PTFE–PEEK composites [polyether ether ketone (PEEK) wt % 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50], the average friction coefficient was reduced, and the steady-state and total specific wear rates were improved when compared to testing against stainless steel. Self-mated PTFE–PEEK (wt % 10–40) achieved ultralow wear rates on the order of 10–⁹ mm³/Nm and friction coefficients of 0.08–0.14. When compared with samples slid against stainless steel, IR spectroscopy of the sliding surface showed that the self-mated PTFE–PEEK composites accumulate more PEEK at the sliding interface and more expression of a tribochemical carboxylate species, which have been linked with ultralow wear PTFE materials. The PTFE composites slid on steel rely on the formation of transfer films for ultralow wear performance. This is achieved by unidirectional increasing surface energy gradients from the polymer pin to the steel substrate, which dominate the transport and wear of PTFE composites slid on steel. However, the self-mated ultralow wear PTFE-based composites rely only on the formation and stability of tribofilms that consist of tribochemically altered PTFE with new carboxylate end groups as well as accumulated filler (i.e., PEEK or alumina). These films have self-regulating, minimal differences in surface energy. The close match of these low-energy surfaces contributes to low friction and ultralow wear. The self-mated PEEK-filled PTFE outperforms the alumina-filled PTFE primarily because of the ease at which PEEK accumulates at the surface. Additionally, the reinforcement and anchoring of the surface is better for a polymer blend than a particle-reinforced composite.  aPublisher supplied data  a1449440cDivision of Graduate Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000082  a1452783cDivision of Graduate Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000082  a1842163cDivision of Graduate Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000082  a1463141cDivision of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000147  a2027029cDivision of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000147 3aaluminum oxide 3aenergy 3afriction 3ahumidity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3astainless steel1 aJunk, Christopher P.1 aCampbell, Kasey L.1 aBabuska, Tomas F.1 aKrick, Brandon A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3191-54330 tMacromolecules.g2022 May 12, v. 55, no. 10 p.3924-3935dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c025813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010500168300001600273520163800289592002801927650002301955650002001978650002101998650001702019650001802036650001402054650001402068650001102082650001902093650002202112650002602134650001902160650001202179650001202191650001602203651001002219653002102229653002702250653002502277653001602302653002702318700001202345700001902357773010002376856008602476852000902562655001202571IND60527092920221118032757.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052709292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Guobao10aCarbon footprint of a scientific publication: A case study at Dalian University of Technology, China  ap. 275-282.  aKnowledge of the carbon footprint (CF) of a scientific publication can help to guide changes in behavior for mitigating global warming. A knowledge gap, however, still exists in academic circles. We quantified the CF of a publication by parameterizing searches, downloads, reading, and writing in the processes of publication with both direct and indirect emissions covered. We proposed a time-loaded conversion coefficient to transfer indirect emissions to final consumers. A questionnaire survey, certification database of Energy Star, fixed-asset databases specific to our campus, and reviewed life-cycle-assessment studies on both print media and electronic products were integrated with Monte Carlo simulations to quantify uncertainties. The average CF [(CI: 95%), SD] of a scientific publication was 5.44kgCO2-equiv. [(1.65, 14.78), 4.97], with 37.65MJ [(0.00, 71.32), 30.40] of energy consumed. Reading the literature contributed the most, followed by writing and searching. A sensitivity analysis indicated that reading efficiency, the proportion of e-reading, and reference quantity were the most dominant of 52 parameters. Durable media generated a higher CF (4.24kgCO2-equiv.) than consumable media (1.35kgCO2-equiv.) due to both direct and indirect reasons. Campus policy makers should thus not promote the substitution of e-reading for print reading at the present stage, because their environmental advantages are highly dependent on time-loaded and behavioral factors. By comparison, replacing desktops with laptops is more attractive, by potentially reducing CFs by 50% and the disproportionate consumption of energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3abehavior change 3acarbon footprint 3acase studies 3acertification 3adatabases 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3aissues and policy 3alife cycle assessment 3aquestionnaires 3areading 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aCarbon footprint 0aScientific publication 0aQuestionnaire survey 0aUncertainty 0aMonte Carlo simulation1 aChe, Li1 aZhang, Shushen0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.275-282dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245011900155300001400274506002800288520166100316592002801977506003702005650002502042650001602067650001902083650002102102650001602123650001702139650001502156650001702171650001002188650002102198650001502219650003202234653001702266653002102283653001102304653003602315653001702351773021302368856007702581852000902658655001202667IND60767583220221207141914.0220208e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076758322DNAL7 a10.32718/ujvas4-2.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ping10aComparison of cytotoxicity evaluation of chlorogenic acid extract between Real-time cell analysis and CCK-8 method  ap. 58-61.  aResource is Open Access  aCritical cytotoxicity evaluation of pharmaceuticals is necessary for the clinical practice of chemotherapy. To quantitatively evaluate cell viability, currently there are two main types of sensitive methods including real-time cell analysis (RTCA) and CCK-8 assay, in which RTCA records electrochemical signal changes around an incubated cell, whereas CCK-8 is based on the colorimetric method. Despite the different detection principles adopted for the cytotoxicity assessment, the comparison of the two methods in terms of the application scope is lacking. In order to compare and determine the best experimental method for the study of the toxicity of chlorogenic acid extract from taraxacum officinale on dairy cow mammary epithelial cells. The real time cell analysis (RTCA) and CCK-8 method were used to analyze the cytotoxicity of chlorogenic acid extract to BMEC and calculate its IC50. The results of the real time cell analysis method and the CCK-8 method showed that different concentrations of chlorogenic acid extract reduced the viability of dairy cow mammary epithelial cells, and the decrease was most obvious at 400 ug/mL. The IC50 of the two analysis methods were 326.8 and 320.4 ug/mL, respectively. In contrast, the CCK-8 method had limitations in fixed-point determination. However, the real time cell analysis method can monitor the dynamic biological response process of cell growth and proliferation in real time. Therefore, the real time cell analysis method can observe cell growth more intuitively and accurately, compensate for the shortcomings of the CCK-8 method, and it is a new experimental method for studying cytotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTaraxacum officinale 3acell growth 3acell viability 3achlorogenic acid 3acolorimetry 3acytotoxicity 3adairy cows 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3aepithelium 3ainhibitory concentration 50 0ainflammatory 0achlorogenic acid 0abovine 0abovine mammary epithelial cells 0acytotoxicity0 tUkrainian journal of veterinary and agricultural sciences.g2021 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.58-61dStepan Gzhytskyi National University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnologies LvivwJournal:27911x2617-61497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.32718/ujvas4-2.103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024004100138040001800179100001400197245008300211300001400294506007600308506003100384520205300415592002802468596008302496506003702579650001702616650002102633650002902654650001502683650001902698650002202717650001702739650001302756650002902769650001402798650001802812650000902830650002002839650002502859650001302884650001402897650002502911653002702936653002702963653002002990653002503010653001703035700001703052700001603069700005303085773012003138856008803258852000903346655001203355IND60615416020221207110034.0201125e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061541602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3022chorus7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Chao10aFe3 +-saturated montmorillonite effectively deactivates bacteria in wastewater  ap. 88-95.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aExisting water disinfection practices often produce harmful disinfection byproducts. The antibacterial activity of Fe³⁺-saturated montmorillonite was investigated mechanistically using municipal wastewater effluents. Bacterial deactivation efficiency (bacteria viability loss) was 92±0.64% when a secondary wastewater effluent was mixed with Fe³⁺-saturated montmorillonite for 30min, and further enhanced to 97±0.61% after 4h. This deactivation efficiency was similar to that when the same effluent was UV-disinfected before it exited a wastewater treatment plant. Comparing to the secondary wastewater effluent, the bacteria deactivation efficiency was lower when the primary wastewater effluent was exposed to the same dose of Fe³⁺-saturated montmorillonite, reaching 29±18% at 30min and 76±1.7% at 4h. Higher than 90% bacterial deactivation efficiency was achieved when the ratio between wastewater bacteria population and weight of Fe³⁺-saturated montmorillonite was at <2×10³CFU/mg. Furthermore, 99.6–99.9% of total coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci in a secondary wastewater effluent was deactivated when the water was exposed to Fe³⁺-saturated montmorillonite for 1h. Bacterial colony count results coupled with the live/dead fluorescent staining assay observation suggested that Fe³⁺-saturated montmorillonite deactivated bacteria in wastewater through two possible stages: electrostatic sorption of bacterial cells to the surfaces of Fe³⁺-saturated montmorillonite, followed by bacterial deactivation due to mineral surface-catalyzed bacterial cell membrane disruption by the surface sorbed Fe³⁺. Freeze-drying the recycled Fe³⁺-saturated montmorillonite after each usage resulted in 82±0.51% bacterial deactivation efficiency even after its fourth consecutive use. This study demonstrated the promising potential of Fe³⁺-saturated montmorillonite to be used in applications from small scale point-of-use drinking water treatment devices to large scale drinking and wastewater treatment facilities.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3abyproducts 3acell membranes 3acoliform bacteria 3adisinfection 3adrinking 3adrinking water treatment 3aeffluents 3afreeze drying 3airon 3amontmorillonite 3amunicipal wastewater 3asorption 3aviability 3awastewater treatment 0aBacterial deactivation 0aAntibacterial activity 0aMontmorillonite 0aWastewater treatment 0aDisinfection1 aChen, Chaoqi1 aShang, Chao1 aXia, Kang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4092-34030 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 01, v. 622-623 p.88-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04341naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245011300189300001800302520258500320592002802905650002102933650002102954650001302975650001402988650001503002650001703017650001403034650001403048650001603062650001503078650002403093650001403117650001003131650000903141650000903150650002103159650001703180650002103197650001503218650001203233650001403245650001303259650006203272650001003334650000903344650001103353650001903364650003503383650006803418700002003486700001903506700002103525773008803546856008403634852000903718655001203727IND60088189020221117210312.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008818902DNAL7 a210748202pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStalter, Daniel10aOzonation and activated carbon treatment of sewage effluents: Removal of endocrine activity and cytotoxicity  ap. 1015-1024.  aConcerns about endocrine disrupting compounds in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents give rise to the implementation of advanced treatment steps for the elimination of trace organic contaminants. The present study investigated the effects of ozonation (O₃) and activated carbon treatment (AC) on endocrine activities [estrogenicity, anti-estrogenicity, androgenicity, anti-androgenicity, aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonistic activity] with yeast-based bioassays. To evaluate the removal of non-specific toxicity, a cytotoxicity assay using a rat cell line was applied. Wastewater (WW) was sampled at two STPs after conventional activated sludge treatment following the secondary clarifier (SC) and after subsequent advanced treatments: O₃, O₃ + sand filtration (O₃₋SF), and AC. Conventional treatment reduced estrogenicity, androgenicity, and AhR agonistic activity by 78–99% compared to the untreated influent WW. Anti-androgenicity and anti-estrogenicity were not detectable in the influent but appeared in SC, possibly due to the more effective removal of respective agonists during conventional treatment. Endocrine activities after SC ranged from 2.0 to 2.8 ng/L estradiol equivalents (estrogenicity), from 4 to 22 μg/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen equivalents (anti-estrogenicity), from 1.9 to 2.0 ng/L testosterone equivalents (androgenicity), from 302 to 614 μg/L flutamide equivalents (anti-androgenicity), and from 387 to 741 ng/L β-naphthoflavone equivalents (AhR agonistic activity). In particular, estrogenicity and anti-androgenicity occurred in environmentally relevant concentrations. O₃ and AC further reduced endocrine activities effectively (estrogenicity: 77–99%, anti-androgenicity: 63–96%, AhR agonistic activity: 79–82%). The cytotoxicity assay exhibited a 32% removal of non-specific toxicity after O₃ compared to SC. O₃ and sand filtration reduced cytotoxic effects by 49%, indicating that sand filtration contributes to the removal of toxicants. AC was the most effective technology for cytotoxicity removal (61%). Sample evaporation reduced cytotoxic effects by 52 (AC) to 73% (O₃), demonstrating that volatile substances contribute considerably to toxic effects, particularly after O₃. These results confirm an effective removal or transformation of toxicants with receptor-mediated mode of action and non-specific toxicants during O₃ and AC. However, due to the limited extractability, polar ozonation by-products were neglected for toxicity analysis, and hence non-specific toxicity after O₃ is underestimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aactivated sludge 3aagonists 3abioassays 3abyproducts 3acytotoxicity 3aeffluents 3aestradiol 3aevaporation 3afiltration 3amechanism of action 3aozonation 3aozone 3arats 3asand 3asewage treatment 3atestosterone 3atoxic substances 3awastewater 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aCharcoal 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aOzone 2aRats 2aSewage 2aToxicity Tests 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purificationxtoxicity.1 aMagdeburg, Axel1 aWagner, Martin1 aOehlmann, Jörg,0 tWater research.g2011 Jan., v. 45, no. 3 p.1015-1024dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008000166300001600246520151900262592002801781650002601809650002001835650001501855650001001870650001501880650001601895650002201911650001201933650001401945651001201959653002201971653001501993653002502008653002102033653003202054653003502086700002102121700001602142773011602158856008502274852000902359655001202368IND60542515320221120044620.0190403e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054251532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoiman, M.,10aExclusion of large herbivores: Long-term changes within the plant community  ap. 136-144.  aSemi-natural woodlands are a globally important relict ecosystem for biodiversity, which are threatened through a range of anthropogenically induced changes, including overgrazing by large herbivores. Fencing to conserve biodiversity is increasingly used as a management tool, so the long-term impacts of large herbivore removal requires investigation. The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of large herbivore exclusion on vegetation, through time, using empirical long-term vegetation data collected over ∼40years. The responses of ground flora communities to this removal will be assessed, and it is predicted that a change in woodland vegetation will occur through time. Plant community composition was surveyed in a network of 7 large-herbivore exclosures, within protected temperate oak woodland in Ireland, at intervals up to 41years. Ground flora species abundance was quantified and time since fencing was used to standardise the survey data, with three time groups being derived from this to assess beta diversity changes through time. With total removal of large herbivores from the oak woodland ecosystem, this study has identified significant changes in ground flora composition and abundance, and a general homogenisation of the vegetation community with increasing time since large herbivore removal. Large-scale long-term fencing of oak woodlands should be replaced by large herbivore management programmes, in order to ensure the conservation of diverse woodland ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aflora 3aherbivores 3aovergrazing 3aplant communities 3asurveys 3awoodlands 3aIreland 0aVegetation change 0aExclosures 0aLong-term monitoring 0aLarge herbivores 0aPlant community composition 0aBroadleaved temperate woodland1 aMitchell, F.J.G.1 aKelly, D.L.0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 June 01, v. 321 p.136-144dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04035naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016700168300001600335520220200351592002802553650001702581650001302598650002902611650001102640650001102651650001302662650001202675650001102687650001202698650001502710650001202725650000902737650000902746650001002755650001402765650001502779650001102794650001702805650001402822650001102836650001402847650002702861650002102888650001302909650001702922650000902939653002202948653001502970653001102985653001202996653001303008700002103021700002003042700001903062700002303081700002103104700001603125700002503141773010003166856008603266852000903352655001203361IND60527093020221118033101.0190412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052709302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.06.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, Edina10aDistribution of toxic elements between biotic and abiotic components of terrestrial ecosystem along an urbanization gradient: Soil, leaf litter and ground beetles  ap. 258-264.  aUrbanization and anthropogenic activities are the major source of environmental pollution which may cause damage in terrestrial ecosystems and their organisms. Toxic elements can accumulate in soil and leave tissue; thus, through the food chain they can accumulate in predatory organisms. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of urbanization on toxic element concentration in soil, leaf litter and Carabus violaceus and Pterostichus oblongopunctatus specimens along an urbanization gradient. The studied predator species were common and their distribution is widespread along the urbanization gradient. Soil, leaf litter and ground beetles were collected from three forested area: urban park, suburban forest and rural forest. The following toxic element concentrations were analyzed in all samples: Al, Ba, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn. In the soil there was no significant difference in toxic element concentration between areas, except in seasons. Significantly higher toxic element concentration was found in autumn than in spring in the soil. In the case of leaf litter we found significant differences between areas in the following toxic elements: Ba, Cu, Mn, Sr and Zn. The concentrations of all elements were significantly higher in autumn than in spring. Significantly higher concentration was found in P. oblongopunctatus specimens than in C. violaceus for all studied elements, except Sr. We found significant differences in elemental concentrations between sexes in both species. Significantly higher Cu and Pb concentration was found in male beetles than in female ones. Just the opposite was true for the Sr concentration. We found positive correlation between toxic element concentration of C. violaceus and leaf litter for Mn and Zn. Negative correlations were found between toxic elements of ground beetles and soil for Al, Ba, Fe, Sr and Zn. Our study confirms that different breeding strategies and sexes cause differences in the accumulation of toxic elements. In summary, we demonstrated that ground beetles, leaf litter and soil were suitable bioindicators for monitoring the effects of urbanization and anthropogenic activities on terrestrial ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPterostichus 3aaluminum 3aanthropogenic activities 3aautumn 3abarium 3abreeding 3acadmium 3acopper 3afemales 3afood chain 3aforests 3airon 3alead 3amales 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3anickel 3aplant litter 3apollution 3aspring 3astrontium 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3aurbanization 3azinc 0aIndicator species 0aMonitoring 0aMP-AES 0aICP-OES 0aCarabids1 aHarangi, Sándor1 aBaranyai, Edina1 aBraun, Mihály1 aFábián, István,1 aMizser, Szabolcs1 aNagy, Leila1 aTóthmérész, Béla0 tEcological indicators.g2016 Jan., v. 60 p.258-264dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.06.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007900170300001400249520206500263592002802328650001602356650001402372650001502386650002102401650002002422650001302442650001102455650001002466650001302476650001002489650002102499653002502520653002102545653002002566653001602586700001702602700001902619700002202638700001902660773011402679856008502793852000902878655001202887IND60542515420221120042146.0190403e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054251542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCondit, Richard10aData and database standards for permanent forest plots in a global network  ap. 21-31.  aThe Center for Tropical Forest Science established a network of 50-ha forest inventory plots in the 1980s, and now assists local scientists with field and database methods at 44 large-scale plots across boreal, temperate, and tropical forest biomes. We published detailed field methods over a decade ago, but at that time, data were maintained in spreadsheet-like formats, most harboring design flaws that resulted in frequent errors. We since established detailed database methods and a normalized data model for housing multiple censuses of large plots. Our largest databases include >2 million measurements, and each has a master version on a server where all collaborators can access and edit data. This paper focuses on the data requirements for handling tree census data and how to design databases to meet these requirements and to ensure data integrity. There are six key elements of a tree census which the database must reflect: (1) measurements, including individual trees (genetic units), stems within trees, and multiple measurements of stems; both field and data methods must assure that every tree, stem, and measurement is precisely identified and can be relocated easily; (2) coordinates, including quadrats within a plot, because field mapping is usually done by assigning x–y coordinates relative to local quadrat markers; (3) taxonomy, carrying a species identity for every tree with a history of individual re-identifications; (4) personnel, with records of the people who performed field and data work per quadrat; (5) assessment of field error via random re-measurements; and (6) a log of changes and a system of archiving so that errors can be tracked and past versions can be reconstructed and cited in publications. A well-designed database model reduces a variety of integrity errors and improves access to data tables in identical formats across many plots, allowing data analyses to be easily replicated and results to be compared. The principal disadvantage is that complexity of the database requires experienced data managers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acensus data 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aforest inventory 3ahuman resources 3amanagers 3amodels 3astems 3ataxonomy 3atrees 3atropical forests 0aForest plot database 0aIntegrity errors 0aNormalized data 0aTree census1 aLao, Suzanne1 aSingh, Anudeep1 aEsufali, Shameema1 aDolins, Steven0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 316 p.21-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245014100190300001800331520150900349592002801858650001801886650001801904650001401922650001101936650001101947650002401958650002601982650001502008650001702023650000902040650002302049650001602072650002602088650001902114650001402133650001902147650001402166650003102180650001402211650001802225650001402243650003002257650003902287650004002326650001702366650004102383650004802424650002802472650003402500650004102534651001602575651001602591651001602607700001902623700001702642700002202659700001802681700001602699773008802715856008402803852000902887655001202896IND60088189220221117210315.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008818922DNAL7 a211450902pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaller, Laurence10aComposition of bacterial and archaeal communities in freshwater sediments with different contamination levels (Lake Geneva, Switzerland)  ap. 1213-1228.  aThe aim of this study was to compare the composition of bacterial and archaeal communities in contaminated sediments (Vidy Bay) with uncontaminated sediments (Ouchy area) of Lake Geneva using 16S rRNA clone libraries. Sediments of both sites were analysed for physicochemical characteristics including porewater composition, organic carbon, and heavy metals. Results show high concentrations of contaminants in sediments from Vidy. Particularly, high contents of fresh organic matter and nutrients led to intense mineralisation, which was dominated by sulphate-reduction and methanogenesis. The bacterial diversity in Vidy sediments was significantly different from the communities in the uncontaminated sediments. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a large proportion of Betaproteobacteria clones in Vidy sediments related to Dechloromonas sp., a group of dechlorinating and contaminant degrading bacteria. Deltaproteobacteria, including clones related to sulphate-reducing bacteria and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (Geobacter sp.) were also more abundant in the contaminated sediments. The archaeal communities consisted essentially of methanogenic Euryarchaeota, mainly found in the contaminated sediments rich in organic matter. Multiple factor analysis revealed that the microbial community composition and the environmental variables were correlated at the two sites, which suggests that in addition to environmental parameters, pollution may be one of the factors affecting microbial community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDechloromonas 3aEuryarchaeota 3aGeobacter 3acarbon 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphylogeny 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollution 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 2aArchaeaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBiodiversity 2aFresh Waterxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aLake Geneva 3aSwitzerland 0aSwitzerland1 aTonolla, Mauro1 aZopfi, Jakob1 aPeduzzi, Raffaele1 aWildi, Walter1 aPoté, John0 tWater research.g2011 Jan., v. 45, no. 3 p.1213-1228dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2010.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013600170300001600306520149000322592002801812650004401840650002201884650002001906650002001926650001401946650001801960650001401978650000701992650001501999650002302014650003402037650002702071650001302098650001302111650001302124650002502137700001702162700002202179773011102201856008102312852000902393655001202402IND60579085120221119161200.0170815e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057908512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-016-0859-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaddah, Bozorgmehr10aMagnetic Solid-Phase Extraction of Oxadiazon and Profenofos from Environmental Water Using Magnetite Fe3O4@SiO2–C18 Nanoparticles  ap. 770-780.  aIn this study, a method for extraction and preconcentration trace amounts of two organophosphorus pesticides (oxadiazon and profenofos) in environmental water was developed by using magnetic solid phase extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection. The Fe₃O₄@SiO₂–C₁₈ nanoparticles were synthesized by the chemical coprecipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The Fe₃O₄@SiO₂–C₁₈ nanoparticles were also easily separated via an external magnetic field during extraction process of oxadiazon and profenofos from environmental water. The influence of several variables including the pH of sample, sorption time, sorbent amount, eluent solvent and its volume and salt concentration in the extraction process was investigated. For this purpose, a multivariate strategy based on central composite design and desirability function was applied in order to optimize the significant variables. Under the optimum conditions, detection limits were 0.05 and 0.07 ng mL⁻¹ for profenofos and oxadiazon, respectively. Linear dynamic ranges were achieved in the range of 0.5–10 ng mL⁻¹ for two analytes. The relative recoveries (RR%) along with relative standard deviation (RSD%) (n = 5) were obtained to be 90 % (RSD = 9.2 %) and 86 % (RSD = 9.8 %) for oxadiazon and profenofos, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acoprecipitation 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3aoxadiazon 3apH 3aprofenofos 3asalt concentration 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorbents 3asorption 3astatistical analysis1 aSabouri, Ali1 aHasanzadeh, Mahdi0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2017 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.770-780dSpringer USx1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-016-0859-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245020200163300001600365506002800381520126700409592002801676506003701704650002901741650002001770650002401790650002501814650002501839650001901864650001801883650001501901650001101916650001201927650001301939650001401952650001301966650001601979651001401995653001302009653001602022653002402038653002602062653001302088700002502101700001102126773012502137856007602262852000902338655001202347IND60767583720221207141902.0220125e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076758372DNAL7 a10.5994/jei.18.3.1822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyint, Kay Khine10aBiological activities and chemical composition of Mentha piperita and Syzygium aromaticum essential oil fractions against cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae)  ap. 182-190.  aResource is Open Access  aCallosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius) is one of the major, common, pests of stored grains as it causes quantitative and qualitative losses in legume crops. This research sought to find the most active fraction in Mentha piperita and Syzygium aromaticumessential oils, to evaluate bioactivity of those crude essential oils and active fractions against C. maculatus,and to identify the compounds contained in the active fraction. The essential oils were fractionated using three solvents, namely n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. The n-hexanefraction was identified as the active fraction, causing mortality, oviposition deterrence, and ovicidal effects. In fumigation chambers, LD95 values of M. piperita (Mnf) and S. aromaticum n-hexane fractions (Snf) were 0.045 ml/l and 0.057 ml/l respectively. ED50 values for oviposition deterrence were 0.016 ml/l for Mnf and 0.022 ml/l for Snf. ED50 value of ovicidal effects for Mnf- and Snf-treated eggs were 0.014 ml/lfor both fractions. GC-MS analysis showed 8 dominant compounds in Mnf and 5 dominant compounds in Snf. Overall it is concluded that Mnf and Snf oils have effective biological activities against stored pest C. maculatus and have potential to be considered as alternatives to synthetic insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aMentha piperita 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3abioactive properties 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3aethyl acetate 3afumigation 3ahexane 3alegumes 3amethanol 3amortality 3aovicides 3aoviposition 3aIndonesia 0aovicidal 0aoviposition 0astored product pest 0asynthetic insecticide 0atoxicity1 aHarahap, Idham Sakti1 aDadang0 tJurnal Entomologi Indonesia.g2021 Dec., v. 18, no. 3 p.182-190dThe Entomological Society of Indonesiax2089-02577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5994/jei.18.3.1823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016700166300001800333500001900351520197800370592002802348650001102376650001702387650001202404650002002416650001902436650001102455650001602466650001102482650001502493650001602508650002002524650002202544650001602566653002302582653003402605653001802639653002702657653002902684653002102713700005702734700001602791700001702807700001402824700005602838700005502894773014402949856008503093852000903178655001203187IND60730993020221120235446.0210315e20210226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073099302DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c087802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hang10aPreparation and Formation Mechanism of Covalent–Noncovalent Forces Stabilizing Lignin Nanospheres and Their Application in Superhydrophobic and Carbon Materials  ap. 3811-3820.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelf-assembled lignin nanospheres (LNS) have attracted much attention due to the new opportunities provided for the preparation of value-added products derived from lignin. However, the internal connections of the LNS generally depend on weak intermolecular forces, leading to low solubility resistance and thermostability. In this study, we present a simple method for the fabrication of covalent–noncovalent forces stabilizing lignin nanospheres (HT-LNS) through utilizing the natural characteristic that lignin molecules undergo irreversible condensation under high-temperature stimulation. Experiments demonstrated that the action of temperature resulted in the fracture of β-O-4 ether and Cα–Cᵦ bonds, as well as hydroxyl and −OCH₃ lignin molecule groups, leading to the formation of free radicals in the LNS. In addition, a large number of adjacent intramolecular and intermolecular radicals almost simultaneously generated chemical cross-linking via α-5, β-5, β–β′ bonds, and so forth. The amount of lignin molecules participating in the cross-linking reaction increased with temperature, which gradually reduced the HT-LNS diameter from 597 to 477 nm and enhanced the maximum decomposition peak from 367.7 to 395.1 °C. The solubility of nanospheres in ethanol and tetrahydrofuran (THF) decreased from 93.92 to 10.39% and from 98.09 to 22.45% with increasing treatment temperature, respectively. The HT-LNS can be employed in the preparation of superhydrophobic coatings, replacing non-environmentally friendly silica nanoparticles. The water contact and slide angles were determined as 151.9 ± 1.4 and 9.4 ± 0.5°, respectively. Moreover, the application of HT-LNS for the preparation of lignin-based carbon nanospheres maintained a perfect spherical structure with tiny graphitic area and the content of carbon atoms reached up to 94.99%. This study provides a simple and effective technology platform for the development of green materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acrosslinking 3aethanol 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3alignin 3ananospheres 3asilica 3asolubility 3atemperature 3atetrahydrofuran 3athermal stability 3avalue added 0alignin nanospheres 0acovalent−noncovalent forces 0aself-assembly 0ahydrothermal treatment 0asuperhydrophobic coating 0acarbon materials1 aXiong, Fuquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7289-198X1 aTan, Yujiao1 aYang, Jiamei1 aQing, Yan1 aChu, Fuxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8849-353X1 aWu, Yiqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3477-21350 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Feb. 26, v. 9, no. 10 p.3811-3820dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c087803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245010800214300001500322520171800337592002802055650001002083650001202093650001102105650002002116650002902136650001002165650003502175650001702210650001402227650001002241650000902251650001202260650001102272650001102283650001302294650001402307650003402321650001502355650001302370650003702383650001102420650002302431650001802454650001802472650002802490650002502518650001502543650000902558651001202567651001002579653001402589653002502603653001002628653001402638653001102652653002802663700001902691700002002710700002402730700002402754700001702778773012102795856008802916852000903004655001203013IND60615416320221118231308.0201125e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061541632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComber, Sean D.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8180-377410aDevelopment of a chemical source apportionment decision support framework for lake catchment management  ap. 96-105.  aIncreasing pressures on natural resources has led to the adoption of water quality standards to protect ecological and human health. Lakes and reservoirs are particularly vulnerable to pressure on water quality owing to long residence times compared with rivers. This has raised the question of how to determine and to quantify the sources of priority chemicals (e.g. nutrients, persistent organic pollutants and metals) so that suitable measures can be taken to address failures to comply with regulatory standards. Contaminants enter lakes waters from a range of diffuse and point sources. Decision support tools and models are essential to assess the relative magnitudes of these sources and to estimate the impacts of any programmes of measures. This paper describes the development and testing of the Source Apportionment Geographical Information System (SAGIS) for future management of 763 lakes in England and Wales. The model uses readily available national data sets to estimate contributions of a number of key chemicals including nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), metals (copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury and nickel) and organic chemicals (Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons) from multiple sector sources. Lake-specific sources are included (groundbait from angling and bird faeces) and hydrology associated with pumped inputs and abstraction. Validation data confirms the efficacy of the model to successfully predicted seasonal patterns of all types of contaminant concentrations under a number of hydrological scenarios. Such a tool has not been available on a national scale previously for such a wide range of chemicals and is currently being used to assist with future river basin planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acadmium 3acopper 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3afeces 3ageographic information systems 3ahuman health 3ahydrology 3alakes 3alead 3amercury 3amodels 3anickel 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aphosphorus 3aplanning 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3asport fishing 3awater quality 3awater quality standards 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3azinc 3aEngland 3aWales 0aChemicals 0aSource apportionment 0aLakes 0aNutrients 0aMetals 0aEnvironmental modelling1 aSmith, Russell1 aDaldorph, Peter1 aGardner, Michael J.1 aConstantino, Carlos1 aEllor, Brian0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 May 01, v. 622-623 p.96-105dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.3133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011900168300001600287520070600303592002801009650002201037650002301059650002301082650001601105650003801121650001501159650004401174650001701218653001501235653001601250653001401266653001401280653001701294700001601311700001501327700001401342773008701356856008401443852000901527655001201536IND60529276520221120214346.0161019e20160224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052927652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.01.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaoyi10aIon complexation-controlled columnar mesophase of calix[4]arene–cholesterol derivatives with Schiff-base bridges  ap. 905-909.  aTwo novel calix[4]arene–cholesterol derivatives 7a and 7b with Schiff-base bridges were synthesized in yields of 70–80%.

It was conducted in the centre of the goat's main territory, and further comprised 4 departments of the Maradi area (Tessaoua in the east, Dakoro in the north, Madarounfa in the south and Guidan Roumdji in the west). This work was performed on 339 animals including 77 in the centre, 88 in the east, 69 in the north, 50 in the south and 55 in the west. It focused on the following measurements: height at withers, scapulo-ischial length, chest size, back length, length of the horns, ears and head, the presence of “pendeloques” and goatees, the coat color and structure of the hair. The results have shown differences between body variable measurements related to geographical position. In fact, the geographical position has significantly influenced body profiles, IGS and IAT indices (P < 0.0001). The dominant trend of the red color is probably an adaptation character of Maradi goats. Our contribution to define the standard of this breed of red goats should be summary as a population with medium size, short and erect ears, two horns (most developed in males) tilting back, short hair and the presence of a beard (beard developed in males) in both sexes. We also note the presence of “pendeloques” in some animals in the East of Maradi.  aPublisher supplied data 3achest 3acolor 3aears 3agoats 3ahead 3ahorns 3amales 3awithers 0achèvre rousse 0aMaradi 0abiométrie 0aphénotype 0acaractérisation 0ared goat 0aMaradi 0abiometrics 0abody profiles 0acharacterization 0acabra roja 0aMaradi 0aBiometría 0aperfiles corporales 0acaracterización1 aKarimou, B.1 aIssa, M.1 aChaibou, M.1 aBanoin, M.1 aYénikoye, A.1 aFalke, Dan I.1 aAyatunde, A.0 tAnimal genetic resources.g2012 Dec., v. 51 p.89-97dCambridge University PresswJournal:23118x2078-63447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S20786336120004583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007500173300001600248520106800264592002801332650004401360650002201404650001901426650001901445650001101464650002001475650001801495650001101513650001601524650001601540650000901556650000901565650002301574650000901597650001101606700002201617700002201639773011101661856008101772852000901853655001201862IND60579085320221119161600.0170815e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057908532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-016-0848-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, N.q(Nader),10aEffect of Modified Lignin Sulfonate on Controlled-Release Urea in Soil  ap. 792-799.  aThe present study reports an economically attractive improvement in fertilizer, using lignin sulfonate as a waste product in the pulp and paper manufacturing process.

FTIR analysis indicated the changes in the functional groups of acetylated lignin. Then, lignin sulfonate acetylated with oxalic acid was coated on urea through a fluidized bed column. The released amount of different concentrations of fertilizer in water and soil was measured. Sulfur-coated urea fertilizer was used to compare with the product. The results showed that acetylated lignin sulfonate coated urea could properly control urea release. The amount of released acetylated lignin sulfonate coated urea after 18 days was 79 %, while for sulfur-coated urea, 93 % was released after 11 days.

The relative influences of two sources of water stress during droughts are difficult to separate, especially for flash droughts that develop rapidly with strong land-atmospheric coupling. The dominant factors that expose ecosystems to water stress during droughts are controversial, which hinders the understanding of flash drought impacts and the related adaptation practices. Therefore, here we decouple SM and VPD stress on gross primary productivity (GPP) during flash droughts using hourly observations from 35 global FLUXNET stations with long-term eco-hydro-meteorological records. The results show that 52% of the stations have significant water stress on GPP during flash droughts, where low SM and high VPD are dominant for 46% and 6% of the stations respectively. For subsets of flash droughts with hot conditions that are defined by concurrent high temperature and above normal solar radiation (or defined by concurrent high net radiation larger than 400 W/m²), low SM and high VPD dominate water stress for 37% and 49% (31% and 50%) of the stations respectively. In addition, low SM and high VPD dominate water stress on the GPP normalized by solar radiation for 14% and 80% of the stations respectively, but the role of SM might be underestimated if flash droughts penetrate in deep soil. As compared with forest ecosystem productivity, non-forest ecosystem productivity declines quickly in response to soil water stress during the onset stage of flash droughts. Our results suggest an intensified water stress on ecosystem productivity and the dominance of high VPD stress during flash droughts with hot conditions, although the soil water stress is nontrivial for unconditional flash droughts.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3agross primary productivity 3ameteorology 3anet radiation 3asoil water 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3avapor pressure deficit 3awater stress 0aFlash drought 0aGross primary productivity 0aDecoupling 0aSoil moisture 0aVapor pressure deficit 0aWater stress1 aYuan, Xing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6983-73680 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 324 p.109100-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.1091003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015200172300001600324520141500340592002801755650001801783650002601801650001901827650000901846650001501855650001201870650001501882650001301897650001401910650002101924650001101945651001101956653002501967653001801992653002002010653002502030653001802055653002102073700001902094773013602113856008602249852000902335655001202344IND60602910820221120110409.0180914e20180818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060291082DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2018.14302502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrévost, Marcel10aLong-term growth response of black spruce advance regeneration (layers), natural seedlings and planted seedlings to scarification: 25th year update  ap. 583-593.  aCareful logging around advance growth and tree planting following site preparation or not (fill planting) have been widely used to regenerate black spruce (Picea mariana) stands in the boreal forest of Canada. An experiment was established in 1990 to compare these regeneration modes and natural seeding over a 25-year period following two types of scarification (cone- or disk-trenching) that were applied at two intensities (single- or double-pass). Without scarification, the three types of regeneration had slow height growth during the first 10 years (3.4–5.8 cm/year). Thereafter, planted seedlings (6.1–9.8 cm/year) and pre-established layers (5.8–8.5 cm/year) had 2–3 times higher growth than natural seedlings (2.6–3.1 cm/year). Scarification improved height growth of the three types of regeneration, but planted seedlings responded much earlier, and more strongly over the 25 years (+9.4 cm/year) than layers (+2.8 cm/year) and natural seedlings (+2.7 cm/year). A shift in the proportion of layers and natural seedlings was observed following treatment. Long-term monitoring revealed that double-pass scarification was beneficial to layer growth from years 15 to 20, while no positive effect was observed on natural or planted seedlings. Our results suggest that decades may be required for natural regeneration to respond to scarification in cold soils of the boreal forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3aadvanced regeneration 3aboreal forests 3acold 3acold soils 3alogging 3amonitoring 3aplanting 3aseedlings 3asite preparation 3asowing 3aCanada 0aAdvance regeneration 0aPicea mariana 0anatural seeding 0anatural regeneration 0areforestation 0asite preparation1 aDumais, Daniel0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2018 Aug. 18, v. 33, no. 6 p.583-593dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39219x1651-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2018.14302503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013000171300001800301520107400319592002801393596009601421596009601517596009601613596009601709650002301805650002101828650001401849650001001863650001401873700005701887773012001944856008502064852000902149655001202158IND60778292420221121122946.0220524e20220318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077829242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c001722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubota, Hiroyuki10aPrecise Syntheses of Alternating Cyclocopolymers via Radical Copolymerizations of Divinyl Ether with N-Substituted Maleimides  ap. 4025-4033.  aAlternating cyclocopolymers having a condensed ring structure were synthesized via radical copolymerization of the divinyl ether (DVE) carrying a gem-dimethyl group on the spacer with N-substituted maleimides (MIs). The consumption behaviors of the C=C bonds in both monomers and the values of the pseudo-monomer reactivity ratios close to zero supported the alternating propagation in the order of one of the DVE double bonds, MI, another double bond of DVE, and MI, to afford the topologically unique copolymers. The cyclocopolymerization was controlled via the RAFT process, and thus, one-pot synthesis of the multiblock alternating cyclocopolymer carrying different pendant groups on the MI units was achieved via sequential addition of MIs. The series of alternating cyclocopolymers exhibited high thermal stabilities and high glass temperatures (Tgs). In particular, Tg of the N-ethyl MI-based cyclocopolymer was much higher than the predicted value by the Fox equation, which was presumably derived from the rigid backbone including the condensed ring structure.  aPublisher supplied data  a17H06453cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a19H00911cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a20K21222cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a21J20558cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3aequations 3aglass 3asynthesis1 aOuchi, Makoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4540-78270 tMacromolecules.g2022 Mar. 18, v. 55, no. 10 p.4025-4033dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c001723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012600165300001800291500001900309520114400328592002801472650001101500650002101511650002001532650001101552650001401563650001601577653003701593653001901630653003001649653003501679653001701714653003101731700001901762700001901781700001501800700001601815700001701831700001201848700005401860700005401914700001801968773014401986856008502130852000902215655001202224IND60730993220221120235526.0210315e20210303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073099322DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c088082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Xiao10aSize-Controlled Intermetallic PtZn Nanoparticles on N-Doped Carbon Support for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction  ap. 3821-3827.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecently, Pt-based intermetallic nanoparticles (iNPs) have been intensely studied to improve the electrocatalytic activity/stability and Pt atomic utilization, but how to control the size of Pt-based iNPs is still a great challenge to date. Here, uniform PtZn intermetallic nanoparticles with a well-defined size supported on a conductive N-doped carbon (NC) were facilely synthesized by direct pyrolysis of sandwich-like zeolithic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-8@GO composites modified with tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (TCPP) anchored Pt sites. Innovatively, TCPP was used as a bifunctional coordination agent to coordinate with both Pt ions and ZIF-8. The size of intermetallic PtZn nanoparticles could be well controlled from ca. 2 to 5 and 7 nm by increasing calcination temperature. Compared to the benchmark Pt/C (E₁/₂ of 0.875 V), the 5 nm PtZn/NC composites (E₁/₂ of 0.911 V) exhibited a significantly improved electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction. The size uniformity control strategy presented in this work opens up a new way to boost the activity and stability of Pt-based catalysts in fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3agreen chemistry 3aoxygen 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aintermetallic PtZn nanoparticles 0aN-doped carbon 0aoxygen reduction reaction 0atetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine 0asize control 0ametal−organic frameworks1 aWang, Qiuxiang1 aZheng, Zhiping1 aNan, Ziang1 aZhang, Xibo1 aSong, Zhijia1 aMa, Min1 aZheng, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4828-209X1 aKuang, Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4111-291X1 aZheng, Lansun0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Mar. 03, v. 9, no. 10 p.3821-3827dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c088083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002500147245010200172500001500274520088800289592002801177650002001205650003301225650002201258650002101280650001001301650002201311650001801333650001401351650000901365651001501374653003201389700002001421773011701441852000901558856008401567655001201651IND4403076520221118020442.0181130s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440307652DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2007-1127-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEastwell, Kenneth C.10aOccurrence of Viroids in Commercial Hop (Humulus lupulus L.)

Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), the causal agent of hop stunt disease, was detected for the first time in hop plants in North America. HSVd was detected in samples from 10 of the 33 hop gardens sampled and in 19 of 126 plant samples. Infection with HSVd was associated with chlorosis and reduced plant vigor. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification, sequence identity, and pathogenicity of hop extracts on cucumber seedlings confirmed the presence of HSVd. Apple fruit crinkle viroid (AFCVd), recently reported in hops in Japan, was not detected by RT-PCR in any samples. Hop latent viroid (HLVd), which is frequently associated with hop germplasm world-wide, was detected with high frequency (98 of 126 hop plants surveyed).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHumulus lupulus 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aHop latent viroid 3aHop stunt viroid 3avigor 3adisease detection 3apathogenicity 3achlorosis 3ahops 0aWashington 0asigns and symptoms (plants)1 aNelson, Mark E.0 tPlant health progress.g2007, v. 8, no. 1dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2007-1127-01-RS3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03087naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010800172300001300280520164800293592002801941650001401969650001801983650002202001650001502023650001102038650001902049650002502068650002302093650001602116650001502132650001702147650001302164650002902177650002102206650002402227650002802251650001802279650001202297650002102309650001102330651001102341700002402352700001902376700002002395773010902415856004802524852000902572655001202581IND50061809120221117220702.0130320e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006180912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-012-0755-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarma, Saurabh Jyoti10aBio-hydrogen production by biodiesel-derived crude glycerol bioconversion: a techno-economic evaluation  ap. 1-10.  aGlobal biodiesel production is continuously increasing and it is proportionally accompanied by a huge amount of crude glycerol (CG) as by-product. Due to its crude nature, CG has very less commercial interest; although its pure counterpart has different industrial applications. Alternatively, CG is a very good carbon source and can be used as a feedstock for fermentative hydrogen production. Further, a move of this kind has dual benefits, namely it offers a sustainable method for disposal of biodiesel manufacturing waste as well as produces biofuels and contributes in greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Two-stage fermentation, comprising dark and photo-fermentation is one of the most promising options available for bio-hydrogen production. In the present study, techno-economic feasibility of such a two-stage process has been evaluated. The analysis has been made based on the recent advances in fermentative hydrogen production using CG as a feedstock. The study has been carried out with special reference to North American biodiesel market; and more specifically, data available for Canadian province, Québec City have been used. Based on our techno-economic analysis, higher production cost was found to be the major bottleneck in commercial production of fermentative hydrogen. However, certain achievable alternative options for reduction of process cost have been identified. Further, the process was found to be capable in reducing GHG emissions. Bioconversion of 1 kg of crude glycerol (70 % w/v) was found to reduce 7.66 kg CO₂ eq (equivalent) GHG emission, and the process also offers additional environmental benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3abioprocessing 3abiotransformation 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic feasibility 3aecosystem services 3aengineering 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3aglycerol 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogen production 3aindustrial applications 3amanufacturing 3amarkets 3aproduction costs 3awastes 3aQuebec1 aBrar, Satinder Kaur1 aLe Bihan, Yann1 aBuelna, Gerardo0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2013 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.1-10dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-012-0755-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010500165300001600270520158900286592002801875650001001903650001101913650001201924650002101936650001101957650001501968650001501983650001301998650001202011650001002023650002002033650001102053650001902064650001402083650001502097650001202112653001102124653001902135653002002154653001202174653001802186653001602204653002402220653001402244653001102258653001502269653002502284653001402309700001702323700001802340700001902358700001502377700001702392773011802409856008202527852000902609655001202618IND60516002720221119210051.0190805e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051600272DNAL7 a10.1017/S20786336120004712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalukande, E.10aCross-breeding cattle for milk production in the tropics: achievements, challenges and opportunities  ap. 111-125.  aThis paper reviews experiences with cross-breeding for milk production in the tropics. Data were compiled from 23 different studies evaluating the performance of different grades of cross-bred animals as well as local breeds. Relative performance of indigenous breeds compared with different grades of cross-breeds was calculated for three climatic zones. Traits considered were milk yield per lactation, age at first calving, services per conception, lifetime milk yield and total number of lactations completed. At 50 percent Bos taurus blood, lactation milk yields were 2.6, 2.4 and 2.2 times higher than those of local cattle in the highland, tropical wet and dry, and semi-arid climatic zones, respectively; lactation lengths increased by 1.2, 1.2 and 1.9 months in the above-mentioned climatic zones, respectively; there was a reduction in calving interval by 0.8 times and in age at first calving by 0.9 times. Similarly, cross-breds with 50 percent B. taurus genes had 1.8 times higher lifetime milk yields and a 1.2 times higher number of total lactations. Although cross-breeding faces a number of challenges such as better infrastructure, higher demand for health care, there are many advantages of using it. These are higher production per animal, higher income for the families and provision of high-value food. It is therefore likely to continue to be an important livestock improvement tool in the tropics in the future, where farmers can provide sufficient management for maintaining animals with higher input requirements and access to the milk market can be secured.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abreeds 3acalving 3acalving interval 3acattle 3aconception 3acrossbreds 3acrossing 3afarmers 3agenes 3ahealth services 3aincome 3ainfrastructure 3alactation 3amilk yield 3atropics 0aCattle 0across-breeding 0amilk production 0atropics 0aGanado bovino 0acruzamiento 0aproducción lechera 0atrópicos 0aBovins 0acroisement 0aproduction laitière 0atropiques1 aMulindwa, H.1 aWurzinger, M.1 aRoschinsky, R.1 aMwai, A.O.1 aSölkner, J.0 tAnimal genetic resources.g2013 June, v. 52 p.111-125dCambridge University PresswJournal:23118x2078-63447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S20786336120004713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012600175300001800301500001900319520158600338592002801924650001501952650001501967650001501982650001101997650001902008650001702027650001102044650002102055650002002076650001102096653001602107653003702123653002102160653001302181653003102194700005702225700006102282773014402343856008502487852000902572655001202581IND60730993420221123043436.0210315e20210303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073099342DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c089332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPai, Kasturi Nagesh10aPractically Achievable Process Performance Limits for Pressure-Vacuum Swing Adsorption-Based Postcombustion CO₂ Capture  ap. 3838-3849.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPractically achievable limits for pressure-vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA)-based postcombustion carbon capture are evaluated. The adsorption isotherms of CO₂ and N₂ are described by competitive Langmuir isotherms. Two low-energy process cycles are considered and a machine learning surrogate model is trained with inputs from an experimentally validated, detailed PVSA model. Several case studies are considered to evaluate two critical performance indicators, namely, minimum energy and maximum productivity. For each case study, the genetic algorithm optimizer that is coupled to the machine learning surrogate model searches tens of thousands of combinations of isotherms and process operating conditions. The framework pairs the optimum materials properties with the optimum operating conditions, hence providing the limits of achievable performance. The results indicate that pressures < 0.2 bar may be required to achieve process constraints for feeds with low CO₂ compositions (<0.15 mole fraction), indicating that PVSA may not be favorable. At higher CO₂ feed compositions, PVSA can be attractive and can be operated at practically achievable vacuum levels. Further, the gap between the energy consumption of available adsorbents and the achievable limits with the best hypothetical best adsorbent varies between 20 and 2.5% as the CO₂ feed composition changes between 0.05 and 0.4. This indicates a limited potential for the development of new adsorbents of PVSA-based CO₂ capture. Future work for PVSA should focus on gas streams with high CO₂ compositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aenergy 3afeed composition 3agreen chemistry 3amodels 0aCO2 capture 0apressure-vacuum swing adsorption 0amachine-learning 0azeolites 0ametal−organic frameworks1 aPrasad, Vinay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6865-71941 aRajendran, Arvind1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4367-48920 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Mar. 03, v. 9, no. 10 p.3838-3849dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c089333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245008900165300001600254520104900270592002801319650003001347650001001377650001101387650001701398650001101415650001501426650001701441650001701458651001201475653001801487653001501505653001701520653002001537653001501557700002301572700002101595773012801616856007601744852000901820655001201829IND60594392820221118012358.0180625e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059439282DNAL7 a10.1653/024.100.04062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenkema, Justin M.10aFirst Report of Broad Mite (Acari: Tarsonemidae) on Commercial Strawberry in Florida  ap. 804-806.  aDuring the past 2 strawberry-growing seasons in Florida (Oct to Mar in 2015–2016 and in 2016–2017), broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks), was found on the upper sides of young strawberry leaves and on fruit. Damage symptoms were similar to those reported from other affected crops: leaf curl, browning and yellowing of leaf tissue and bronzing of ripening fruit, but less than 1% of plants in surveyed fields appeared to be affected. Broad mites were found in 1 field in 2015–2016 but in at least 5 fields in 2016–2017, indicating a possible increase in their potential to affect strawberry. Small areas of a field treated with Oberon 2 SC (spiromesifen) were sampled for broad mites. Post-application counts were generally lower than preapplication counts, although there was a high degree of intra-plant variability in counts. Future efforts should be directed at monitoring broad mite populations and their influence in strawberry and implementing management practices, if necessary, that have been effective in other crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolyphagotarsonemus latus 3acrops 3afruits 3aleaf curling 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3aspiromesifen 3astrawberries 3aFlorida 0acyclamen mite 0aacaricides 0aspiromesifen 0apest management 0aBlackberry1 aLeFors, Jessica A.1 aJohnson, Donn T.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2017 Dec., v. 100, no. 4 p.804-806dFlorida Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44725x1938-51027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.100.04063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006700169300001800236520096000254536017901214592002801393596004201421650002201463650001501485651001001500653002501510653002401535653001601559653001801575653002401593700001401617700001301631700001501644773013401659856008501793852000901878655001201887IND60746923120221120200241.0210806e20210926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074692312DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2021.18978282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Chenxi10aCan China’s offshore wind power achieve grid parity in time?  ap. 1219-1228.  aFacing an increasing financial burden and declining costs, China plans to phase out supporting policies for renewable energy before 2030. In this context, whether offshore wind power can achieve grid parity by the time the subsidies are eliminated is a great concern for policy makers as well as potential investors. To address this issue, we employ the learning curve framework to analyze the critical conditions under which the key factors of offshore wind power technology should evolve to achieve grid parity in time. Ceteris paribus, to achieve grid parity in 2030, the learning rate needs to be as high as 12.0%, the annual deployment needs to be 5.9 GW, and the capacity factor needs to be improved to 40.7%. The feasibility of achieving these key conditions is discussed, and we conclude that the enhancement of innovative technologies is crucial for offshore wind power to improve its cost competitiveness in a finite time without policy support.  aThis research was funded by Economic Research Institute of State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Co., Ltd.

For birds, there are four widely used global checklists that vary in length and application. Here, we investigate the biogeographical and ecological predictors of taxonomic disagreement between the four world bird species lists. LOCATION: Global. TIME PERIOD: Present. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Birds. METHODS: We determined taxonomic agreement based on whether each bird species name represented only one species (‘agreement’), that is, no authorities have split the species, or represented multiple species (‘disagreement’) including disputed splits recognised by some authorities. We examined taxonomic agreement for all birds and for each family and biogeographical region. We then modelled taxonomic agreement as a function of six biogeographical and ecological variables: latitude, island endemism, log(mass), forest dependency, primary diet, and migratory status. RESULTS: Overall taxonomic agreement was 89.5%, and the remaining 10th of taxonomic names represented disputed splits upon which the four authorities disagreed. We found that taxonomic agreement was lowest for species in Southeast Asia/Australasia and the Southern Ocean, understudied regions where islands have driven high levels of cryptic diversification. In contrast, agreement was highest in the temperate Northern Hemisphere where diversity is lower and research is more extensive. Agreement was also higher for large, migratory species living in open habitats. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Taxonomic agreement was higher for species that are easier to study such as large, temperate species from open habitats. In addition, agreement was lower for lineages that are more likely to undergo cryptic divergence such as island endemics with intermediate forest dependency and mobility. Species with these traits should be the focus of taxonomic research in order to achieve reconciliation of the world's bird lists and to better conserve extant biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3abirds 3adiet 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3aindigenous species 3alatitude 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory species 3aAustralasian region 3aSouth East Asia1 aBlount, J.

The combined effect of different types of stresses can have a wide range of effects on plants. The present study demonstrated that various stress factors such as the combination of chemical elicitors, namely paraquat (PQ), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD), light exposure versus darkness, and mechanical shearing stress affected the defence response in peanut hairy root culture. The antioxidant activities were dramatically increased at all time points after hairy roots were subjected to elicitation with PQ + MeJA + CD under root cutting in both light and dark conditions. The stilbene compounds were highly increased in the culture medium after elicitor treatment of uncut hairy roots under dark conditions. In contrast to the high stilbene contents detected in culture medium under dark conditions, the transcription of the stilbene biosynthesis genes PAL, RS and RS3 was enhanced by the effect of light in uncut hairy root tissues. The antioxidant enzyme genes APX, GPX and CuZn-SOD of uncut and cut hairy roots were more highly expressed in light conditions than in dark conditions. The pathogenesis-related protein (PR)-encoding genes chitinase, PR4A, PR5 and PR10 of uncut hairy roots were highly expressed in response to light conditions compared to dark conditions at all time points. Recent evidence of the production of antioxidant stilbene compounds and defence response genes has implicated plant protective functions through defence responses under different stress challenges. Plant responses might therefore be regulated by the coordination of different signal responses through dynamic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiosynthesis 3achitinase 3aculture media 3aelicitors 3amechanical stress 3amethyl jasmonate 3aparaquat 3apeanuts 3astilbenes 0aArachis hypogaea 0aHairy root 0aLight 0aDark 0aStilbene1 aChayjarung, Phadtraphorn1 aTothong, Chonnikan1 aPilaisangsuree, Vijakhana1 aSomboon, Thapakorn1 aKongbangkerd, Anupan1 aLimmongkon, Apinun0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2020 Dec., v. 157 p.93-104dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009900174300002000273520134200293592002801635596008201663596008201745596008201827650001501909650002201924650002201946650001401968650001301982650000901995650001302004700002302017700002202040700002102062700002402083700002502107700002102132773015502153856008302308852000902391655001202400IND60778630820221120050433.0220718e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077863082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18370-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakovljević, Ksenija10aStrategies of accumulation of potentially toxic elements in Minuartia recurva and M. bulgarica  ap. 43421-43434.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of potentially toxic elements in soil samples and plant tissues of Minuartia recurva and M. bulgarica, predominantly or exclusively calcifuge species. Biological concentration (BCs) and translocation factors (TFs) were used to evaluate their accumulation potential. Considerable differences were observed between M. recurva and M. bulgarica assessions in terms of accumulation strategies of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). In M. recurva, most of the elements analyzed (Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Co) were transported to the shoot, whereas in M. bulgarica, these elements remained predominantly in the roots. The Cu concentrations in the shoot samples of M. recurva from an abandoned iron-copper mine at Mt. Kopaonik were clearly above the notional hyperaccumulation threshold, characterizing this species as a possible Cu hyperaccumulator. Additionally, strong accumulation potential for Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, and Cd was observed in M. recurva assessions, but without significant accumulation due to the low concentrations of these elements in the soils. The strong accumulation capacity and the different strategies in tolerance to PTEs indicate a potential of the two species for an application in phytoremediation: M. recurva for phytoextraction and M. bulgarica for phytostabilization.  aPublisher supplied data  a451-03-9/2021-14/ 200178cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  a451-03-9/2021-14/ 200178cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  a451-03-9/2021-14/ 200178cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja 3acalcifuges 3ahyperaccumulators 3aphytoaccumulation 3apollution 3aresearch 3asoil 3atoxicity1 aTomović, Gordana,1 aBaker, Alan J.

The mechanism by which C. hutchinsonii achieves cellulose digestion, however, is still largely unknown. In this study, we obtained a C. hutchinsonii mutant that was defective in utilizing filter paper or Avicel as the sole carbon source by transposon mutagenesis. The interrupted gene locus, CHU_2981, encodes a hypothetical protein with only 130 amino acids. Cell fractionation and western blot detection of CHU_2981 fused with a C-terminal green fluorescence protein (GFP) indicated that CHU_2981 is located in the periplasm. The CHU_2981-disrupted mutant cells exhibited a significant growth defect on Avicel but not on glucose and cellobiose. The absence of CHU_2981 also resulted in a significant defect in colony spreading and individual cell motility compared to wild-type cells. Further analysis demonstrated that the CHU_2981-disrupted mutant cells exhibited a different profile of cellulose-absorbed outer membrane proteins from that of wild-type cells, in which protein varieties and amounts were markedly decreased. Our results showed that CHU_2981, the periplasmic non-cellulolytic protein, plays an important role in both cellulose utilization and cell motility probably by being involved in the appropriate production of outer membrane proteins.  aPublisher supplied data  a2011CB707402cthe National Basic Research Program of China  a31170762cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31570051cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCytophaga hutchinsonii 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acids 3acarbon 3acell fractionation 3acell movement 3acellobiose 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3acellulose 3adigestion 3agenes 3aglucose 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aloci 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aouter membrane proteins 3asoil 3atransposons1 aBu, Xuliang1 aHan, Qingqing1 aWang, Xia1 aZhou, Hong1 aChen, Guanjun1 aZhang, Weixin1 aLiu, Weifeng0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Feb., v. 100, no. 4 p.1935-1944dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7204-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245004600163300001400209500001900223520074800242592002800990650001001018650001601028650001401044650003901058651001601097653000801113653001501121653001001136700002501146700001501171700001901186700002501205773009401230856008201324852000901406655001201415IND60723564620221118221608.0210303e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072356462DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.76.581792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuyck, Bart10aNew Cantharellus species from South Korea  ap. 31-47.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this third contribution involving new Cantharellus species from South Korea, two new species are introduced.

In this study, S. jambos and other trees in the Myrtales were examined on three Hawaiian Islands for the presence of Cryphonectriaceae. Bark samples with fruiting bodies were collected from infected trees and fungi were isolated directly from these structures. Pure cultures were produced and the fungi were identified using DNA sequence data for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, part of the β-tubulin (BT1) gene and the transcription elongation factor-1α (TEF1) gene. Five species in three genera of Cryphonectriaceae were identified from Myrtaceae tree samples. These included Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis, Microthia havanensis and three previously-unknown taxa described here as Celoporthe hauoliensis sp. nov., Cel. hawaiiensis sp. nov. and Cel. paradisiaca sp. nov. Representative isolates of Cel. hauoliensis, Cel. hawaiiensis, Cel. paradisiaca, Chr. deuterocubensis and Mic. havanensis were used in artificial inoculation studies to consider their pathogenicity on S. jambos. Celoporthe hawaiiensis, Cel. paradisiaca and Chr. deuterocubensis produced lesions on young S. jambos trees in inoculation trials, suggesting that, together with A. psidii, they may contribute to the death of trees. Microsatellite markers were subsequently used to consider the diversity of Chr. deuterocubensis on the Islands and thus to gain insights into its possible origin in Hawaii. Isolates of this important Myrtaceae and particularly Eucalyptus pathogen were found to be clonal. This provides evidence that Chr. deuterocubensis was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands as a single introduction, from a currently unknown source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysoporthe 3aEucalyptus 3aHawaii 3aMicrothia havanensis 3aPucciniales 3aSyzygium jambos 3abark 3adeath 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amixed infection 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3arust diseases 3atrees 0aAustropucciniapsidii 0afungi 0agenetic diversity 0aMyrtales 0apathogen introductions1 aKamgan Nkuekam, Gilbert1 aMarincowitz, Seonju1 avan der Merwe, Nicolaas A.1 aUchida, Janice Y.,1 aWingfield, Michael J.1 aChen, ShuaiFei0 tMycoKeys.g2020 Dec. 31, v. 76 p.49-79dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.76.584063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008500171300001800256520151700274536008401791592002801875596001701903650001201920650001201932650001101944650001401955650001501969650001601984650001402000650001102014650002802025650001102053650001902064650000902083650001602092650002102108650001402129650001902143650001802162653001802180653002202198653002002220700002302240700002202263700001302285773013402298856008502432852000902517655001202526IND60746923520221120205451.0210806e20210926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074692352DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2021.19044032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuynh, Van-Nam,10aCatalytic upgrading and enhancing the combustion characteristic of pyrolysis oil  ap. 1277-1288.  aBagasse’s pyrolysis oil has low calorific value, high water content, and acidity. The main components of the pyrolysis oil are acids/esters, alcohols, aldehydes/ketones, furan compounds, phenol compounds, and guaiacols, and there is not an aromatic hydrocarbon in composition. Pyrolysis oil evaporates only 66.73 wt% at a temperature of 300°C and carbonaceous residue formed is 13.41 wt%. The carbonaceous residue will limit the utilization of pyrolysis oil because it generates soot while burning and made secondary emission. Upgrading the pyrolysis oil to enhance the vaporization, prevent the formation of carbon residue, and improve combustion behaviors has been investigated in this paper. Using catalyst HZSM5, Zn/HZSM-5, and Fe/HZSM-5 for upgrading pyrolysis oil, the quality of upgrading oil is enhanced with higher heating value, lower acidity, and viscosity. The modification of chemical composition of pyrolysis oil has generated better components for evaporation. At 300 °C, 91.97 wt%, 92.93 wt%, and 94.71 wt% of upgrading oil are evaporated for HZSM-5, Zn/HZSM-5, and Fe/HZSM-5, respectively. Carbonaceous residue decreases significantly to only 4.74 wt% with HZSM-5 catalyst, 4.39 wt% with Zn/HZSM-5, and 3.39 wt% with Fe/HZSM-5. Evaluation of the upgrading oil combustion by thermal analysis method, the total combustion characteristics index increases and it is more flammable than fuel oil. The results prove that upgrading oil might be used as a fuel oil in industrial application.  aThis work was supported by the Bộ Giáo dục và Ðào tạo [B2020-BKA-09].  aPublisher supplied data  aB2020-BKA-09 3aacidity 3abagasse 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3aevaporation 3afuel oils 3afurans 3aindustrial applications 3aphenol 3apyrolysis oils 3asoot 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3aviscosity 3avolatilization 3awater content 0aPyrolysis oil 0aex situ catalysis 0aHZSM-5 catalyst1 aDang, Nguyen Thoai1 aTruong, Thanh Tam1 aVan, Tho0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2021 Sept. 26, v. 18, no. 12 p.1277-1288dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2181x1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2021.19044033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013200165300001800297520110800315592002801423650001301451650001801464650001101482650001001493650001001503650002201513650001701535700001601552700001801568700002001586773012001606856004801726852000901774655001201783IND50087926920221120085329.0140412e20110316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008792692DNAL7 a10.1080/014311609035718172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shengbo14aThe 10-day planetary wave examined by Odin/OSIRIS ozone profiles during late March 2002: comparison with UKMO and MF radar data  ap. 1531-1544.  aOzone profile data have been retrieved from the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) instrument onboard the Odin Satellite, which was launched on 20 February 2001. Considering the irregular sampling of the OSIRIS, a least-squares fit method is employed to provide the wavenumber and frequency spectra of the waves affecting the OSIRIS ozone profile distributions. Meanwhile, criteria are developed and applied for reducing spectral biases. Then spectral analysis of the global OSIRIS ozone profiles data is perfomred at altitudes of 38.5 km and 40.5 km within two latitude bins 35˚–45˚N and 45˚–55˚N during days 75–105 of the year 2002. Specifically, a westward-propagating 10-day planetary wave is detected and validated by medium frequency (MF) Radar (MFR) at Platteville (40˚N, 105˚W) and Saskatoon (52˚N, 107˚W), and UKMO global stratospheric data (UK Meteorological Office assimilated model).

Changes in the distribution of species towards the planet’s poles and mountain tops are some of the expected to biological consequences of this process. Here, we assessed the potential effects of future climate change on four cool-adapted Gripopterygidae (Insecta: Plecoptera) species [Gripopteryx garbei Navás 1936, G. cancellata (Pictet 1841), Tupiperla gracilis (Burmeister 1839), and T. tessellata (Brauer 1866)] from Southeastern Brazilian Atlantic forest. As species adapted to cold conditions, in the future scenarios of climate change, we expected these organisms to shrink/change their distributions ranges towards areas with suitable climatic conditions in Southern Brazilian regions, when compared with their predicted distributions in present climatic conditions. We used seven principal components derived from 19 environmental variables from Worldclim database for the present scenario and also seven principal components obtained from 17 different Atmosphere-Ocean Global Circulation Models (AOGCMs), considering the most severe emission scenario for green-house gases to predict the species’ distributions. Depending on the climatic scenario considered, there were polewards distribution range changes of the species. Additionally, we also observed an important decrease in the amount of protected modeled range for the species in the future scenarios. Considering that this Brazilian region may become hotter in the future and have its precipitation regime changed, as observed in the severe 2013–2014 drought, we believe these species adapted to high altitudes will be severely threatened in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlecoptera 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acold 3adatabases 3adrought 3aeconomic development 3aforests 3agases 3ahumans 3amodels 3amountains 3asociety1 aDias, A C1 aLecci, L S1 aSimião-Ferreira, J0 tNeotropical entomology.g2019 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.57-70dSpringer USwJournal:jnl69840x1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-018-0621-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245008600128300001600214520104900230592002801279650001601307650000901323650002001332650001201352650001201364650001801376650000901394650002401403650001801427650002101445653002301466653001601489653002901505700001701534773012501551852000901676655001201685IND60738439420221121165451.0210524e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073843942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlekhya, V.10aStabilization of marine soil of visakhapatnam port area by using fly ash material  ap. 955-958.  aFly ash is one of the by-products which attributes to the improvement of strength and compressibility characteristics of soils. The soil sample for the present study was taken from port trust area of Visakhapatnam inAndhra Pradesh. The raw material fly ash was also taken from Visakhapatnam unit of NTPC (National Thermal Power Corporation) and used for study and experimentation. In the present study, some of the laboratory tests have been carried out to determine the properties of marine clay taken and also highlighted the CBR (California Bearing Ratio) test which was conducted before and after addition of fly ash to determine the strength of soil. The specific gravity of the marine soil is 2.27. The Atterberg limits of the soil sample was silty sand (SM). The maximum dry density was within the range as per unified soil classification and hence can be used as sub grade material. The optimum fly ash content was in the range of 5 to 10 % and hence the soil strength can be increased by adding 5 to 10 % of fly ash to the marine soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3aclay 3acompressibility 3aecology 3afly ash 3araw materials 3asand 3asoil classification 3asoil strength 3aspecific gravity 0aSoil stabilization 0aMarine soil 0aLaboratory tests and CBR1 aRao, A.

A two end-member linear-mixture approach has been employed. A neural-network-based approach was used to simulate water and ice reflectances for all possible sun–satellite geometries. The ice-mapping technique incorporates an advanced cloud-detection algorithm with adaptive threshold values. The average percentage of cloud reduction because of the daily compositing ranged from 22% to 25%. Daily maps of ice distribution and concentration with minimal cloud coverage were produced for the winter seasons of 2007 and 2008. The retrieved ice distribution demonstrated a good agreement with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow and ice charts. The obtained correlation coefficients with IMS charts for 2007 and 2008 were 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. The technique has been proposed as one of the candidate ice-mapping techniques for the future Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R) Advance Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3asnow 3aice 3aalgorithms 3aCaspian Sea 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aRomanov, Peter1 aGhedira, Hosni1 aKhanbilvardi, Reza1 aSmith, Kim0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2011 Mar. 16, v. 32, no. 6 p.1575-1593dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160903578820  aDNAL 7aarticle03725naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245017800198300001800376500001900394500002000413520215400433592002802587650001702615650001902632650001502651650002202666650001702688650001402705650002602719650001902745650001002764651001102774651001802785700002102803700002302824700002002847700001602867700002002883700002202903700001902925700002602944700002102970700002302991773013503014856007303149852000903222655001203231IND60738366120221119223449.0210524e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073836612DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.132912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoods, Kerry D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1029-699510aMulti‐decade tree mortality in temperate old‐growth forests of Europe and North America: Non‐equilibrial dynamics and species‐individualistic response to disturbance  ap. 1311-1333.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Old‐growth, mesic temperate forests are often assumed to be structured by gap‐phase processes, resulting in quasi‐equilibrial long‐term dynamics. This assumption influences management focused on simulation of natural disturbance dynamics and is embedded in most models of forest successional dynamics. We use multi‐decade monitoring of permanent plots in old‐growth forests to assess demographic assumptions directly with respect to tree mortality rates. LOCATION: Sixteen sites in mesic, temperate old‐growth forests in eastern North America and Europe with multi‐decade monitoring. TIME PERIOD: Variable across sites, spanning c. 20–78 years from 1936 to 2014. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Tree species of late‐successional, cool‐temperate forests of Europe and eastern North America. METHODS: We calculated and compared the annualized mortality rates (m), with confidence intervals, by species, size class and measurement interval, for tree species of sufficient abundance. RESULTS: Retrospective analysis shows dynamic and diverse demographic properties across populations and sites. Stand‐scale mortality rates of 0.7–2.5%/year average higher than previous estimates for old‐growth temperate forests. Variations among species, over time and among size classes, suggest that gap‐phase models are inadequate to explain stand dynamics, implying instead that rare disturbance events of moderate severity have long‐lasting effects in old‐growth forests and that indirect anthropogenic influences affect old‐growth, unlogged forests. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Multi‐decade baseline data, essential for understanding community assembly and long‐term dynamics in these “slow systems,” are rare and poorly integrated. Our analysis demonstrates the value of the few long‐term, “legacy” data sets. Results suggest that differences in life history interact with complex disturbance histories, resulting in non‐equilibrial dynamics in old‐growth temperate tree communities, and that changes in disturbance patterns through anthropogenic climate change might, therefore, be an important driver of ecosystem change.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aforest succession 3alife history 3amortality 3aretrospective studies 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aNagel, Thomas A.1 aBrzeziecki, Bogdan1 aCowell, C.

Sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and gum Arabic (GA) or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) powders were mixed at 1:1, spray‐dried, and incubated at 60 °C and 76% of relative humidity from 0 to 72 hr. Sample infrared spectra were collected, and browning degree, conjugation efficiency, and stabilization properties of the conjugates were analyzed by spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, turbidity, and zeta potential measurements. Pairwise soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) models showed significant chemical differences among NaCAS–GA mixtures incubated for 0 (Control) and 16 hr, attributed to functional groups linked to different Maillard reaction products such as Schiff's base and pyridine compounds. Infrared spectroscopy combined with SIMCA is a powerful tool to monitor the formation of protein–polysaccharide conjugates by Maillard reaction. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Protein–polysaccharide conjugates obtained by Maillard reaction are currently used as novel food emulsifiers. However, conventional methods to study this chemical reaction are time consuming or involve the use of toxic and harmful reactants. Infrared spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis is evaluated to be used as a rapid tool to monitor Maillard reaction.  aPublisher supplied data  aMartí Franquès Program 2018‐PIPF‐7cUniversitat Rovira i Virgili funds Martí Franquès Program  aCTQ2014‐5420‐PcDirección General de Investigación Científica y Técnica 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aMaillard reaction products 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achemometrics 3aemulsifiers 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agum arabic 3amoieties 3amultivariate analysis 3anovel foods 3apowders 3apyridines 3arelative humidity 3aschiff bases 3asodium caseinate 3aspray drying 3atoxicity 3aturbidity 3azeta potential1 aKaade, Wael1 aFerrando, Montserrat1 aGüell, Carme,1 ade Lamo‐Castellví, Sílvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5261-68060 tJournal of food science.g2019 Oct., v. 84, no. 10 p.2777-2784dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.147823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245016800173300001600341500001900357520178100376592002802157650001302185650001902198650001802217650001702235650002502252650001002277650001202287650001402299650001302313650001002326650002102336650000702357650001802364650001102382650001102393650001302404651001102417700001802428700001902446700002502465700002002490773013102510856008102641852000902722655001202731IND60721517120221120174458.0201224e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072151712DNAL7 a10.1134/S19954255200600982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLjevnaić-Mašić, B.10aRelationship Between Eco-Biological Characteristics of Allergenic Plants in Assessment on Habitat Conditions Affecting on Their Development Along the Canal Network  ap. 674-684.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConsidering the increasing incidence of allergy symptoms in Europe in the past decades, it is useful to obtain precise ecological and biological data regarding the allergenic plants. This study was conducted in order to assess habitat conditions allowing the development of allergenic plants along the Danube-Tisza-Danube canal network (Banat region, Serbia). In this regard, the distribution of these plants and the relationships among their eco-biological characteristics were studied. The results represent the one step further in the assessment of the habitat conditions allowing the development of allergenic plants in the study area. Twenty four allergenic plants were found, with a predominance of wetland plants (37.50%) and geophytes (41.67%). Correlation and PCA analyses determined that the flowering time of allergenic plants is correlated with the ecological group, life form and habitat conditions (aeration, pH, humus content, moisture, and continentality). The unfavorable periods for allergy sufferers are early spring and summer. Pollen-allergenic forest phanerophytes flowered early, had the shortest flowering period, and inhabited neutral to alkaline soil with less humus content, compared to the wetland and weed-ruderal allergenic plants. Habitat moisture reduced soil aeration and modified the effects of the continental climate, favoring the development of numerous allergenic species along the canals. Most of the identified allergenic species are invasive in Europe. Moreover, these species are frequently grown in urban green areas. Therefore, the avoidance of excessive use of these allergenic species in urban ecosystems may provide healthier environments for allergy sufferers and contribute to the preservation of the native flora biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aalkaline soils 3aallergenicity 3abiodiversity 3acontinental climates 3aflora 3aforests 3ageophytes 3ahabitats 3ahumus 3ahypersensitivity 3apH 3aphanerophytes 3aspring 3asummer 3awetlands 3aSerbia1 aNikolić, Lj.1 aDžigurski, D.1 aBrdar-Jokanović, M.1 aMeseldžija, M.0 tContemporary problems of ecology.g2020 Nov., v. 13, no. 6 p.674-684dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000001736x1995-42557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S19954255200600983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245016000173300001600333500001900349520151000368536002701878592002801905650001701933650002401950650001001974650003001984650002202014650002102036650001402057650001102071651001002082653001902092653001702111653002202128653001702150653001702167653002702184653001802211653002102229700001602250700002402266700001802290700002002308773009602328856008102424852000902505655001202514IND60723565020221118222051.0210114e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072356502DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.63.500492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBustamante, Ramiro O.12aA classification system for predicting invasiveness using climatic niche traits and global distribution models: application to alien plant species in Chile  ap. 127-146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFunctional traits that predict plant invasiveness are a central issue in invasion ecology. However, in many cases they are difficult to determine, especially for a large set of species. Climatic niche traits can overcome this problem due to the ease of acquiring them for a large number of species. This effort is critical given that knowledge of species invasiveness is necessary (although not sufficient) to anticipate/manage invasive species. In this study, we examined thermal and hydric niche traits to predict plant invasiveness. We used a set of 49 alien plant species, representative of the alien flora of Chile. Niche traits were obtained using environmental information (WorldClim) and global occurrences. Invasiveness was estimated using global niche models and projection of the potential distribution in Chile. As a final step, we reviewed the literature for a subset of species, documenting their impacts on a) biodiversity, b) crop agriculture and c) livestock. Thermal niche breadth and thermal niche position were the most important niche traits to predict potential distribution (a proxy of invasiveness). Using thermal niche breadth and niche position traits, we constructed a graphical model that classifies alien species as highly invasive (wide thermal niche breadth and low niche position) or low potential to be invasive (narrow niche breadth and high niche position). We also found no association between our invasiveness classification and the documented impact of alien species.  aICM P05-002 and PFB-23  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aecological invasion 3aflora 3ageographical distribution 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3alivestock 3amodels 3aChile 0aclimatic niche 0aalien plants 0afunctional traits 0ahydric niche 0ainvasiveness 0apotential distribution 0athermal niche 0ainvasion ecology1 aAlves, Lúa1 aGoncalves, Estefany1 aDuarte, Milen1 aHerrera, Ileana0 tNeoBiota.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 63 p.127-146dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.63.500493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245008600138300001600224520126400240592002801504650001201532650001501544650001401559650000901573650001201582650001601594650001601610651000901626653001501635653003101650653001701681653002501698653001101723700002201734773012501756852000901881655001201890IND60738439720221121210454.0210524e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073843972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Khafaji, Sattar J.10aSpatial characteristics and heavy metals pollution in urban soils of Basrah, Iraq  ap. 969-978.  aA detailed study was conducted to determine the concentrations for ten heavy metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) in 16 urban soil samples of Basrah city by using Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry technique to assess the pollution levels according to some pollution indices. The samples were collected from four traverses, includes the industrial, urban park, open space, commercial and residential sites. The mean values ofAs, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were 9.03, 0.23, 6.10, 509.19, 47.49, 23971.06, 415.04, 130.02, 33.08 and 71.77 mg/kg, respectively, these values indicate that vehicle exhausts and industrial emissions are the main sources of these metals in soil. The results of Igeo and PI indices showed high pollution levels for Cr and Ni. Er index indicated that most metals caused low risk in all stations excepted As, Cd and Pb have a moderate risk in industrial areas. IPI indicates medium to high pollution levels of heavy metals. Spatial distribution patterns of heavy metals indicated that the hotspot areas of metal pollution were mainly concentrated at the northern and western parts (commercial, residential and industrial areas) closely related to high traffic conditions and the industrial activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3aopen space 3apollution 3arisk 3atraffic 3aurban parks 3aurban soils 3aIraq 0aUrban soil 0aIntegrated pollution index 0aHeavy metals 0aSpatial distribution 0aBasrah1 aJalal, Ghadeer K.0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2020 Dec., v. 47, no. 4 p.969-978dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009200166300001600258500001900274520140600293592002801699650001101727650001301738650001001751650002201761650002101783700001901804700001901823700002201842700001901864773013101883856008102014852000902095655001202104IND60721517420221120185633.0201224e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072151742DNAL7 a10.1134/S19954255200601282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavkin, Yu.

Seventy-one bird watchers participated in collecting material. Based on the results of bird counting, a hierarchical classification and structural similarity graph are compiled for ornithocomplexes in the Pacific part of Russia, including Wrangel Island. The hierarchical classification contains 3 overtypes, 16 types, and 17 subtypes of the bird assemblage. The similarity graph is built at the type level and is represented by seven series (trends), two of which relate to undeveloped land communities of mainly the North Pacific and Amur-Sakhalin physico-geographical countries. One series consists of ornithocomplexes of residential and recreational territories and four series consist of water and near-water communities (mainland and marine). The given characteristics of classification taxa contain information on the five most numerous bird species (leaders in abundance), their part in communities, assemblage density, and background species richness and avifauna types that are prevailing in abundance. The composition of taxa was used as a basis to reveal 10 environmental factors and 32 natural and anthropogenic regimes that correlate with spatial heterogeneity of ornithocomplexes. The strength and generality of the variability of bird communities and their habitats are estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3aavifauna 3abirds 3aspatial variation 3aspecies richness1 aBabenko, V.

Annealing of as-deposited (amorphous) films was performed at 1100 °C for 2 hours to realize a stable crystalline phase. The effect of the Ti target power (200 and 250 W) and nitrogen doping on the structural, morphological and optical properties of post-annealed NiTiO₃ thin films were investigated besides photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. X-ray diffraction measurement on the films revealed a pure ilmenite phase at 250 W Ti power. Preferential orientation changed from [104] to [110] as Ti power increased from 200 to 250 W. Raman studies on NiTiO₃ thin films showed almost all the active modes (5Ag + 5Eg) of a crystalline structure. Two different microstructures were observed by scanning electron microscopy, films showed rounded (250 nm) grains at 200 W Ti target power while facet forms (500 nm) develop in the films deposited at 250 W. Chemical bonding and valence states of the involved ions such as Ni 2p, Ti 2p and O 1s were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Nitrogen doping modifies the rms roughness from 12 nm to 17 nm as demonstrated on 200 W grown films and contributes also to modify the indirect optical band gap from 2.50 to 2.43 eV in films obtained at 250 W Ti target power. As a crucial role of nitrogen doping, photocatalytic activity in a broad visible light range was observed with a good efficiency for the degradation of methylene blue by nitrogen doped NiTiO₃ thin films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aannealing 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3afilms (materials) 3aions 3airradiation 3alight 3amethylene blue 3amicrostructure 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aoptical properties 3aphotocatalysis 3aquartz 3aradio waves 3aroughness 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature1 aRuiz-Preciado, Marco Alejandro1 aEdely, Mathieu1 aSzade, Jacek1 aJouanneaux, Alain1 aKassiba, Abdel Hadi0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 19, v. 5, no. 14 p.10551-10559dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra12516a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245016800204300001800372500002000390520187900410592002802289650001802317650001502335650001102350650001502361650002402376650002302400650001802423650001102441650001602452650001702468650001002485650001202495650002302507650002102530650002302551700001902574700001502593700001802608700002102626700002202647700006002669700006602729773012602795856007902921852000903000655001203009IND60672465620221119231704.0191016e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067246562DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.148002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCecchi, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9332-704X10aSensory Profiling and Consumer Acceptance of Pasta, Bread, and Granola Bar Fortified with Dried Olive Pomace (Pâté): A Byproduct from Virgin Olive Oil Production  ap. 2995-3008.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn olive pomace (pâté) obtained from virgin olive oil production, was used for the fortification of pasta, bread, and granola bar. For each food, a control (without pâté) and a fortified sample (with pâté, 7% in pasta and 5% in bread and granola bar) were manufactured. Descriptive analysis showed that pâté strongly affected the appearance of pasta and bread and increased the bitterness of bread and granola bar but not pasta. Granola bar was less affected in general, likely because of its higher ingredient complexity. In a central location test with 175 Californian consumers, both the control and the fortified samples of all three foods were well accepted overall, with only the mean liking of the appearance of the fortified pasta falling below the “neither like nor dislike” mark. Approximately 30% of consumers preferred the fortified sample over the control for each food and 50% were willing to pay more for the fortified products. The percentage of phenols from pâté recovered in the prepared samples was such that 63 g of pasta, 18 g of bread, and 12 g of granola bar would be sufficient to meet the EFSA health claim for olive oil phenols. This study demonstrates that pâté can be used for fortification of foods for human consumption, thus adding potential economic value to the virgin olive oil production chain and allowing for a higher daily intake of phenols from Olea europaea L., whose beneficial health properties are well recognized. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The dried olive oil pomace (pâté) that we developed and tested in this research can be used to fortify pasta, bread, and granola bars with health‐beneficial phenols with only slight alterations of their sensory profiles and slight reduction in consumer acceptance. Virgin olive oil producers can use this byproduct and gain further economic value from olive oil production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3abitterness 3abreads 3abyproducts 3aconsumer acceptance 3aeconomic valuation 3ahealth claims 3ahumans 3aingredients 3aolive pomace 3apasta 3aphenols 3asensory evaluation 3avirgin olive oil 3awillingness to pay1 aSchuster, Noah1 aFlynn, Dan1 aBechtel, Rose1 aBellumori, Maria1 aInnocenti, Marzia1 aMulinacci, Nadia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7873-52591 aGuinard, Jean‐Xavier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6386-30550 tJournal of food science.g2019 Oct., v. 84, no. 10 p.2995-3008dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.148003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003500152245011300187300001600300520127500316592002801591650001701619650000901636650001401645650001501659650001801674650002101692650001401713650000701727650002201734650000901756700003001765700002501795700001801820773011601838856008601954852000902040655001202049IND60099760620221116154047.0141105e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009976062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.04.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Francisco Adriano O.10apH effect upon HbGp oligomeric stability: characterization of the dissociated species by AUC and DLS studies  ap. 333-341.  aGlossoscolex paulistus (HbGp) extracellular hemoglobin is a giant oligomeric protein. It is constituted by 144 heme containing subunits and non-heme structures (linkers), with a total molecular mass of 3.6MDa. AUC and DLS studies were developed for three HbGp forms, oxy-, met- and cyanomet-, at several pH values, in order to characterize the species in solution upon oligomeric dissociation. Isolated SEC fractions, trimer and dodecamer, are less stable as compared to the whole oxy-HbGp. The monomer d displays a large thermal stability up to 59°C. Hydrodynamic properties of the isolated subunits are very similar to those described for them in the whole protein, in the presence of urea or at pH 10.0. The degree of HbGp oligomeric dissociation, in alkaline pH, depends significantly on the iron oxidation state. Also on the ligand coordinated to the heme iron. Thus, at pH 8.0, the oxy-HbGp is partially dissociated, while the met-form is fully dissociated. The cyanomet-HbGp remains undissociated. Our present results show that the effect of pH on the HbGp oligomeric stability is similar to that associated to the urea-induced unfolding. Simultaneous use of AUC and DLS allowed the characterization of the species in the SEC fractions of isolated HbGp subunits.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3aheme 3aheme iron 3ahemoglobin 3ahydrodynamics 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3apH 3athermal stability 3aurea1 aCarvalho, José Wilson P.1 aAlves, Fernanda Rosa1 aTabak, Marcel0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2013 Aug., v. 59 p.333-341dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.04.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01430naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245006100205300001800266520045700284592002800741650001300769650002300782650002300805650002200828650002000850700001800870700001900888773013300907856007901040852000901119655001201128IND60604707720221119052938.0180717e20180216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060470772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b001772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mengyang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1983-857010aCu(OAc)2 Mediated Synthesis of 3-Sulfonyl Chromen-4-ones  ap. 2361-2368.  aCopper acetate mediated (4 + 2) annulation of sulfonylacetylenes with salicylic acids provides sulfonyl chromen-4-ones in the presence of benzotriazol-1-yloxy tri(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP, Castro’s reagent) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in MeNO₂ at reflux for 3 h.

Accordingly, in the present study, an innovative trigeneration system including a gas turbine cycle, a gasification unit, a heating unit, alongside a single effect absorption refrigeration cycle is proposed. The system operates on natural gas and municipal solid waste (MSW) for cooling, heating, and power generation. The designed system was simulated using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software through two scenarios; constant power output and constant biomass feed rate, considering seasonal and annual periods. In the first scenario, considering the constant power capacity, the basic design state was considered with the biomass mixing ratio of 50%, and the results of the seasonal study showed that the system capacity is 30 MW, 41.9 MW, and 39.24 MW in terms of electricity, heating, and cooling, respectively. The exergy analysis revealed that the combustion chamber, the evaporator of Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), and the gasifier in both hot and cold seasons have the highest exergy destruction rate, while the economizers and the evaporators of both HRSGs have the lowest exergy efficiency. The constant mass flow rate of MSW was assumed to be 1.5 kg/s and accordingly, the feed rate of natural gas was also 1.5 kg/s for the mixing ratio of 50% in basic design state of the second scenario, and the results indicated that the annual average capacity of the system for electricity, heating, and cooling generation is 27.43 MW, 40 MW, and 34.15 MW, respectively. Furthermore, the system was capable of providing the domestic hot water supply of end-user with an average capacity of 7.5 MW during a year. The annual Energy Utilization Factor (EUF) and the annual exergy efficiency of the overall system were shown to be 71.25% and 30.79%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadministrative management 3abiogasification 3abiomass 3acold 3acombustion 3acomputer software 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aequations 3aexergy 3agenerators (equipment) 3aheat recovery 3amass flow 3amunicipal solid waste 3anatural gas 3apower generation 3arefrigeration 3awater supply 0aAbsorption chiller 0aCCHP 0aExergy analysis 0aGasification 0aGas turbine 0aSeasonal study1 aKhoshbakhti Saray, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1567-545X1 aMirmasoumi, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9545-23380 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 220 p.113096-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1130963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245014400166300001800310500002000328520202300348592002802371650001202399650000902411650002002420650001202440650001202452650001102464650001402475650002502489650001402514650001702528650001102545650001202556650001002568650001102578650002302589650001502612650000902627650001202636650001402648650001402662650001302676650001102689650002602700650000902726650001402735650001002749650001502759650000902774700001702783700002102800700005702821773012602878856007903004852000903083655001203092IND60620582220221121235206.0181114e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062058222DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.143772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yianna Y.10aBioaccessibility of Some Essential Minerals in Three Selected Australian Pulse Varieties Using an In Vitro Gastrointestinal Digestion Model  ap. 2873-2881.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAustralian produced pulse grains are exported worldwide, predominantly to developing countries where severe essential mineral deficiencies putatively subsist. An in vitro digestion model that simulates human gastric, intestinal and colonic digestion and fermentation, was used to examine the bioaccessibility of Fe, Mg, K, Ca, P, Zn, Mn, and Cu in commercially available cultivars of Australian field pea, lentil, and sweet lupin. The hull and dehulled seeds were prepared following a traditional cooking method, and quantities of bioaccessible minerals were assessed at each stage of in vitro digestion using ICP‐OES elemental analyses. Results revealed that dehulled field pea (100 g dry weight) had the highest bioaccessible quantity of Fe (2.44 ± 0.73 mg), K (717.10 ± 56.66 mg), P (272.88 ± 9.30 mg), Zn (1.72.028 ± 0.28 mg), and Cu (0.41 ± 0.02 mg). Dehulled lupin was the best source of Mg (138.62 ± 1.53 mg) and Mn (1.28 ± 0.0.06 mg), and lentil hull showed the greatest Ca bioaccessible quantity (116.33 ± 16.73 mg/100 g dry weight). Additionally, the fed state digestion (11.7 mg bile/mL sample) increased the bioaccessibility of all elements significantly (P < 0.05) compared to fasted (1.95 mg bile/mL sample), except for Zn and Mn in lupin and lentils. These results demonstrated that dehulled seeds possess higher mineral bioaccessibility on a percentage basis compared with hulls, and that the fed state of in vitro digestion generally improved the mineral solubility significantly (P < 0.05). PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This research aimed to assess the prospective biological accessibility of various essential elements in three commercially available Australian pulses. Results of the study provided an insight into the contents of essential minerals in Australian pulses and illustrated the impact of traditional cooking of dehulled pulses on these minerals bioaccessibility. These findings will provide the consumers with information about some nutritional aspects of major Australian pulses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLupinus 3abile 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3acooking 3acopper 3acultivars 3adeveloping countries 3adigestion 3afermentation 3agrains 3ahulling 3ahulls 3ahumans 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3airon 3alentils 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aminerals 3amodels 3anutrient deficiencies 3apeas 3apotassium 3aseeds 3asolubility 3azinc1 aPanozzo, Joe1 aHall, Michael S.1 aAjlouni, Said1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6896-55090 tJournal of food science.g2018 Nov., v. 83, no. 11 p.2873-2881dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.143773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245013300201300001600334520163000350592002801980596007502008650001102083650001902094650001402113650001702127650001502144650002002159650001202179650001102191650001802202650001002220650001302230650001602243650001202259650002402271650001902295650003702314650001402351650002002365700001702385700001902402773013902421856008302560852000902643655001202652IND60755031820221122124925.0211122e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075503182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10142-021-00802-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0792-953910aIdentification of potential pathways associated with indole-3-butyric acid in citrus bud germination via transcriptomic analysis  ap. 619-631.  aIndole-3-butyric acid (IBA) is widely used to encourage root development in cuttings of general field crops, vegetables, forest trees, fruit trees, and flowers. However, previous studies reported that IBA inhibited the germination of citrus buds via an unknown molecular mechanism. This study aimed to unravel the regulatory mechanisms underlying this inhibition. Citrus apical buds were sprayed with 100 mg ⋅ L⁻¹ IBA. Subsequently, the plant hormone levels were analyzed, and transcriptomic analysis was performed. The results identified 3325 upregulated genes and 2926 downregulated genes in the citrus apical buds. The gene set enrichment analysis method was used to determine the Gene Ontology related to the treatment. Genes were enriched into 157 sets, including 17 upregulated sets and 140 downregulated sets, after indole butyric acid treatment. The upregulated gene sets were related to glucose import, sugar transmembrane transporter activity, and photosynthesis. The downregulated genes were mainly related to the ribosomal subunit and cell cycle process under butyric acid treatment. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed the enrichment of 11 pathways. Of note, genes related to the ribosome and proteasome pathways were significantly downregulated. Only one pathway was significantly upregulated: the autophagy pathway. Overall, these results provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning the IBA-mediated inhibition of citrus bud germination inhibition. Also, the study provided a large transcriptomics dataset that could be used for further research.  aPublisher supplied data  a202002N3019cNingbo Public Welfare Science and Technology Plan Project 3aCitrus 3aacid treatment 3aautophagy 3abutyric acid 3acell cycle 3adata collection 3aforests 3afruits 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agenomics 3agermination 3aglucose 3aindole butyric acid 3aphotosynthesis 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aribosomes 3atranscriptomics1 aXie, Rangjin1 aZhang, Hongjin0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2021 Nov., v. 21, no. 5-6 p.619-631dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl61464x1438-793X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-021-00802-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245010000200300001600300520175900316592002802075650001502103650002402118650002602142650001302168650002602181650002202207650001702229650001602246650001502262650001002277700001502287700001202302700001902314700001602333700001902349700001602368700001302384700001602397700001802413773013902431856008302570852000902653655001202662IND60755032020221122193651.0211122e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075503202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10142-021-00804-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4649-116X10aUntargeted metabolomic analysis of urine samples for diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders  ap. 645-653.  aMetabolomics has become an important tool for clinical research, especially for analyzing inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs). The purpose of this study was to explore the performance of metabolomics in diagnosing IMDs using an untargeted metabolomic approach. A total of 40 urine samples were collected: 20 samples from healthy children and 20 from pediatric patients, of whom 13 had confirmed IMDs and seven had suspected IMDs. Samples were analyzed by Orbitrap mass spectrometry in positive and negative mode alternately, coupled with ultra-high liquid chromatography. Raw data were processed using Compound Discovery 2.0 ™ and then exported for partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) by SIMCA-P 14.1. After comparing with m/zCloud and chemSpider libraries, compounds with similarity above 80% were selected and normalized for subsequent relative quantification analysis. The uncommon compounds discovered were analyzed based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to explore their possible metabolic pathways. All IMDs patients were successfully distinguished from controls in the PLS-DA. Untargeted metabolomics revealed a broader metabolic spectrum in patients than what is observed using routine chromatographic methods for detecting IMDs. Higher levels of certain compounds were found in all 13 confirmed IMD patients and 5 of 7 suspected IMD patients. Several potential novel markers emerged after relative quantification. Untargeted metabolomics may be able to diagnose IMDs from urine and may deepen insights into the disease by revealing changes in various compounds such as amino acids, acylcarnitines, organic acids, and nucleosides. Such analyses may identify biomarkers to improve the study and treatment of IMDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiomedical research 3adiscriminant analysis 3agenomics 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3anucleosides 3aurinalysis 3aurine1 aZhu, Jiang1 aLi, Qiu1 aWang, Dongjuan1 aWan, Kexing1 aYuan, Zhaojian1 aZhang, Juan1 aZou, Lin1 aHe, Xiaoyan1 aMiao, Jingkun0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2021 Nov., v. 21, no. 5-6 p.645-653dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl61464x1438-793X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-021-00804-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011200162300001600274520171200290592002802002650001802030650001402048650001702062650001302079650002002092650001302112650001502125650001202140650001202152650001402164650001002178650001202188650001202200650001202212650001002224650001802234650002302252650001002275650001102285650002602296650001402322650001102336650002502347650001002372650001502382651001002397651001102407700002702418700001902445700002102464700001602485700001802501700001702519700001602536700002202552773012202574856008102696852000902777655001202786IND60584651220221123002238.0171027e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058465122DNAL7 a10.1007/s00334-017-0636-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Furong10aRelative pollen productivity estimates for major plant taxa of cultural landscapes in central eastern China  ap. 587-605.  aIn this study we estimate relative pollen productivity (RPP) for plant taxa characteristic of human-induced vegetation in ancient cultural landscapes of the low mountain ranges of Shandong province in eastern temperate China. RPP estimates are required to achieve pollen-based reconstructions of Holocene plant cover using modelling approaches based on Prentice’s and Sugita’s theoretical background and models (REVEALS and LOVE). Pollen counts in moss samples and vegetation data from 36 sites were used in the Extended R-Value (ERV) model to estimate the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) of moss polsters and RPP of major plant taxa. The best results were obtained with the ERV sub-model 3 and Prentice’s taxon-specific method (using a Gaussian Plume dispersal model) to distance weight vegetation data. RSAP was estimated to 145 m using the maximum likelihood method. RPP was obtained for 18 taxa of which two taxa had unreliable RPP (Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae and Vitex negundo). RPPs for Castanea, Cupressaceae, Robinia/Sophora, Aster/Anthemis-type, Cannabis/Humulus, Caryophyllaceae, Brassicaceae and Galium-type are the first ones for China. Trees, except Robinia/Sophora (RPP = 0.78 ± 0.03) have larger RPPs than herbs other than Artemisia (RPP = 24.7 ± 0.36). The RPPs for Quercus, Pinus and Artemisia are comparable with other RPPs obtained in China, the RPPs for Pinus, Quercus, Ulmus, Cyperaceae and Galium-type with the mean RPPs obtained in Europe, and RPP for Cupressaceae with that for Juniperus in Europe. The values for Aster/Anthemis-type, Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae SF Cichorioideae and Juglans differ from the few RPPs available in China and/or Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthaceae 3aArtemisia 3aBrassicaceae 3aCannabis 3aCaryophyllaceae 3aCastanea 3aCyperaceae 3aHumulus 3aJuglans 3aJuniperus 3aPinus 3aQuercus 3aRobinia 3aSophora 3aUlmus 3aVitex negundo 3acultural landscape 3aherbs 3amodels 3amosses and liverworts 3amountains 3apollen 3astatistical analysis 3atrees 3avegetation 3aChina 3aEurope1 aGaillard, Marie-José,1 aSugita, Shinya1 aMazier, Florence1 aXu, Qinghai1 aZhou, Zhongze1 aZhang, Yuyun1 aLi, Yuecong1 aLaffly, Dominique0 tVegetation history and archaeobotany.g2017 Nov., v. 26, no. 6 p.587-605dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0939-63147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-017-0636-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003800147245010600185520135800291592002801649650002801677650002801705650002901733650002201762650002501784650001301809650001501822650001101837650001601848650001401864650001401878650001301892650001601905650001501921650002001936650001901956650001401975653002201989653001602011653002402027653001502051653001302066700003902079700003602118700006502154773012202219856008102341852000902422655001202431IND60723305020221118051555.0211030e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072330502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1108882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Anay Priscilla David10aSymbiotic goat milk ice cream with umbu fortified with autochthonous goat cheese lactic acid bacteria  aAutochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from goat cheese were selected for the preparation of symbiotic goat milk ice cream (GMIC) with the inclusion of umbu fruit (Spondias tuberosa). Its sensory attributes, microbiological and physical-chemical characteristics and its antioxidant capacity were measured in the GMIC produced with autochthonous isolates (GMIC 2) and with commercial cultures (GMIC 1). Three isolates from goat cheese identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Pediococcus acidilactici were selected for their physiological, metabolic, protective, safety and functional characteristics for the production of GMIC 2. GMIC 2 showed greater viability of the microorganisms over time compared to GMIC 1. The selection of autochthonous cultures (AC) significantly influenced (P < 0.01) the protein content in the water phase, melting rate and antioxidant capacity of GMIC 2. The GMIC 2 was designated as tastier (P = 0.0167), and with the greater preference and purchase intention (P < 0.001) among the tasters. The combination of probiotic cultures and umbu fruit sensorially favoured both GMIC. However, the AC have distinct properties that certify the authenticity of the umbu-flavoured GMIC from the Caatinga biome of the northeastern semi-arid region and have potential applications in the local industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3aSpondias tuberosa 3aantioxidant activity 3acaatinga 3aecosystems 3afruits 3agoat cheese 3agoat milk 3aice cream 3aindustry 3alactic acid 3aprobiotics 3aprotein content 3asemiarid zones 3aviability 0aSpondias tuberosa 0aPediococcus 0aCholesterol removal 0aProbiotics 0aHeat map1 ade Oliveira Almeida, Tássio José1 aSantos, Tamires Marques Bezerra1 aDias, Francesca Silva1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0174-43970 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Apr., v. 141 p.110888-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1108883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024002300170024004100193024002500234040001800259100005700277245009300334300001800427520177000445592002802215650002302243650001302266650001602279650001402295650002102309650001302330650001702343650001802360650001402378650003002392650002102422650001402443650001002457651001202467651001302479700001802492700001602510700002002526700002102546700001702567700001802584700001602602773013802618856011402756856008302870961001302953852000902966655001202975IND60785775620221214231432.0220918e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078577562DNAL7 a3934212aris7 a10113/78577562hdl7 a10.1007/s00122-022-04145-52doi7 a3934212seq_no_1157 a3072-21000-009-000D2aris_project_no7 a4343322aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiangyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1364-794110aIdentification and characterization of the novel leaf rust resistance gene Lr81 in wheat  ap. 2725-2734.  aKEY MESSAGE: The novel, leaf rust seedling resistance gene, Lr81, was identified in a Croatian breeding line and mapped to a genomic region of less than 100 Kb on chromosome 2AS. Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is the most common and widespread rust disease in wheat. Races of Puccinia triticina evolve rapidly in the southern Great Plains of the USA, and leaf rust resistance genes often lose effectiveness shortly after deployment in wheat production. PI 470121, a wheat breeding line developed by the University of Zagreb in Croatia, showed high resistance to Puccinia triticina races collected from Oklahoma, suggesting that PI 470121 could be a leaf rust resistance source for the southern Great Plains of the USA. Genetic analysis based on an F₂ population and F₂:₃ families derived from the cross PI 470121 × Stardust indicated that PI 470121 carries a dominant seedling resistance gene, designated as Lr81. Linkage mapping delimited Lr81 to a genomic region of 96,148 bp flanked by newly developed KASP markers Xstars-KASP320 and Xstars-KASP323 on the short arm of chromosome 2A, spanning 67,030,206–67,132,354 bp in the Chinese Spring reference assembly (IWGSC RefSeq v1.0). Deletion bin mapping assigned Lr81 to the terminal bin 2AS-0.78–1.00. Allelism tests indicated that Lr81 is a distinctive leaf rust resistance locus with the physical order Lr65-Lr17-Lr81. Marker-assisted selection based on a set of markers closely linked to leaf rust resistance genes in PI 470121 and Stardust enabled identification of a recombinant inbred line RIL92 carrying Lr81 only. Lr81 is a valuable leaf rust resistance source that can be rapidly introgressed into locally adapted cultivars using KASP markers Xstars-KASP320 and Xstars-KASP323.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia recondita 3aallelism 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3agenetic analysis 3agenomics 3ainbred lines 3aintrogression 3aleaf rust 3amarker-assisted selection 3aresistance genes 3aseedlings 3awheat 3aCroatia 3aOklahoma1 aKolmer, James1 aLi, Genqiao1 aTan, Chengcheng1 aCarver, Brett F.1 aBian, Ruolin1 aBernardo, Amy1 aBai, Guihua0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2022 Aug., v. 135, no. 8 p.2725-2734dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/78577563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-022-04145-53Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245015900171520119000330592002801520650002201548650002001570650001901590650001201609650002101621650001701642650002101659650001201680650003401692650003001726650001301756650001101769651001601780653001701796653000901813653002601822653002101848653001901869700001101888700002001899700001601919700002801935700001401963700001801977700001401995700001502009700001702024700001502041700001702056700001902073773010602092856008802198852000902286655001202295IND60752420620221123021540.0220110e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075242062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1128962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStockin, K.A.10aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), trace elements and life history parameters of mass-stranded common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in New Zealand  aProfiles of 33 PFAS analytes and 12 essential and non-essential trace elements were measured in livers of stranded common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) from New Zealand. PFAS concentrations reported were largely comparable to those measured in other marine mammal species globally and composed mostly of long-chain compounds including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) and perfluorooctanesulfonamide (FOSA). PFAS profiles did not vary significantly by location, body condition, or life history. Notably, significant positive correlations were observed within respective PFAS and trace elements. However, only negative correlations were evident between these two contaminant types, suggesting different exposure and metabolic pathways. Age-associated concentrations were found for PFTrDA and four trace elements, i.e. silver, mercury, cadmium, selenium, indicating differences in the bioaccumulation biomagnification mechanisms. Overall, our results contribute to global understanding of accumulation of PFAS by offering first insights of PFAS exposure in cetaceans living within South Pacific Australasian waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphinus delphis 3abioaccumulation 3abody condition 3acadmium 3achemical species 3alife history 3amarine pollution 3amercury 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorotridecanoic acid 3aselenium 3asilver 3aNew Zealand 0aReproduction 0aDiet 0aEmerging contaminants 0aSentinel species 0aMarine mammals1 aYi, S.1 aNorthcott, G.L.1 aBetty, E.L.1 aMachovsky-Capuska, G.E.1 aJones, B.1 aPerrott, M.R.1 aLaw, R.J.1 aRumsby, A.1 aThelen, M.A.1 aGraham, L.1 aPalmer, E.I.1 aTremblay, L.A.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Dec., v. 173 p.112896-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1128963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01559naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010200157300001800259520046400277592002800741650002200769650002300791650002300814650002200837650001400859700001600873700001800889700001700907700001800924700001800942700002000960700001400980773011900994856007501113852000901188655001201197IND60550005820221123040013.0160909e20130621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055000582DNAL7 a10.1021/jo40020362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Huiliang10aSynthesis and Structure of Bull’s Horn-Shaped Oligothienoacene with Seven Fused Thiophene Rings  ap. 6271-6275.  aA novel bull’s horn-shaped oligothienoacene with seven fused thiophene rings (1) based on dithieno[2,3-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene (2) was efficiently synthesized.

A significant challenge in the successful and widespread application of μBRs in biotechnology remains the lack of appropriate software and automated data interpretation of μBR experiments. Here, it is demonstrated how mathematical models can be usedas helpful tools, not only to exploit the capabilities of microfluidic platforms, but also to reveal the critical experimental conditions when monitoring cascade enzymatic reactions. A simplified mechanistic model was developed to describe the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase and glucose in the presence of catalase inside a commercial microfluidic platform with integrated oxygen sensor spots. The proposed model allowed an easy and rapid identification of the reaction mechanism, kinetics and limiting factors. The effect of fluid flow and enzyme adsorption inside the microfluidic chip on the optical sensor response and overall monitoring capabilities of the presented platform was evaluated via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Remarkably, the model predictions were independently confirmed for μL- and mL- scale experiments. It is expected that the mechanistic models will significantly contribute to the further promotion of μBRs in biocatalysis research and that the overall study will create a framework for screening and evaluation of critical system parameters, including sensor response, operating conditions, experimental and microbioreactor designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aautomation 3abiocatalysis 3abiotechnology 3acatalase 3acomputer software 3acost effectiveness 3aenzymatic reactions 3afluid mechanics 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3amechanistic models 3amonitoring 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3areaction mechanisms 3ascreening 3awastes 0aCat 0aCFD 0aCSTR 0aGOx 0aμBR 0aODEs 0aMechanistic modeling 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aMicrobioreactor 0aEnzymatic biocatalysis 0aOxygen monitoring 0aBioprocess modeling1 aFernandes, Ana C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9204-09791 aBolivar, Juan M.1 aRosinha Grundtvig, Inês P.1 aVadot, Barbara1 aGalvanin, Silvia1 aMayr, Torsten1 aNidetzky, Bernd1 aZubov, Alexandr1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2494-99341 aGernaey, Krist V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0364-17730 tNew biotechnology.g2020 May 25, v. 56 p.27-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2019.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03863naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002500167245015800192300001600350520161300366592002801979650001702007650001202024650001402036650001402050650002602064650004302090650001802133650002102151650001302172650003102185650001002216650004702226650002702273650003402300650002302334650002802357650002802385650005902413650001102472650002202483650004502505650003502550650001102585650005902596650001902655650002102674650001502695650000902710650003102719650001602750650003502766650005602801700002302857700002602880700001702906700002602923700002002949700002702969773009002996856008203086852000903168655001203177IND60112272320221120045258.0141110e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011227232DNAL7 a229638812pmid7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2012.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsteghamati, Alireza10aEffects of metformin on markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant reserve in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: A randomized clinical trial  ap. 179-185.  aBACKGROUND & AIMS: Given the long term benefits observed with metformin use in diabetes patients, a role in modulating oxidative stress is imputable. Effects of metformin on markers of oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, and HDL-c associated antioxidant enzymes were investigated. METHODS: In a clinical trial setting (Registered under Clinical Trials.gov Identifier no. NCT01521624) 99 medication-naïve, newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients were randomly assigned to either metformin or lifestyle modification. AOPP, AGE, FRAP, activities of LCAT, and PON were measured at baseline and after 12-weeks. RESULTS: Baseline values of the oxidative stress markers did not differ significantly between the two groups. In cases, after three months treatment, there was a significant reduction in AOPP (137.52 ± 25.59, 118.45 ± 38.42, p < 0.001), and AGE (69.28 ± 4.58, 64.31 ± 8.64, p = 0.002). FRAP and PON increased significantly (1060.67 ± 226.69, 1347.80 ± 251.40, p < 0.001 and 29.85 ± 23.18, 37.86 ± 27.60, p = 0.012 respectively). LCAT levels remained unchanged (45.23 ± 4.95, 46.15 ± 6.28, p = 0.439). Comparing the two groups in a final multivariate model, AOPP, FRAP, and AGE levels changed more significantly in metformin compared with lifestyle modification alone (p = 0.007, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 respectively). Escalation in LCAT or PON activities did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.199 and 0.843 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Use of metformin is more effective in reducing oxidative stress compared with lifestyle modification alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aenzymes 3alifestyle 3ametformin 3amultivariate analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anormal values 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 2aAdult 2aAdvanced Oxidation Protein Productsxblood 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aAryldialkylphosphatasexblood 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdiet therapyxdrug therapy. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGlycation End Products, Advancedxblood. 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxanalysis. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aInsulinxblood 2aLecithinsxblood 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMetforminxtherapeutic use 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPhosphatidylcholine-Sterol O-Acyltransferasexblood1 aEskandari, Delaram1 aMirmiranpour, Hossein1 aNoshad, Sina1 aMousavizadeh, Mostafa1 aHedayati, Mehdi1 aNakhjavani, Manouchehr0 tClinical nutrition.g2013 Apr., v. 32, no. 2 p.179-185dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2012.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008100160300001800241520084800259592002801107650001601135650001401151650001101165650001501176650002301191650001101214650001201225650001301237650001301250650002201263650001701285650000901302700002001311700001901331700002001350700002101370773011901391856007501510852000901585655001201594IND60550005920221123040039.0160909e20130621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055000592DNAL7 a10.1021/jo400408t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMineno, Masahiro10aDouble Reformatsky Reaction: Divergent Synthesis of δ-Hydroxy-β-ketoesters  ap. 5843-5850.  aThe double Reformatsky reaction, tandem addition of two molecules of zinc alkanoate to a carbonyl compound, and its synthetic application to a series of δ-hydroxy-β-ketoesters has been developed. The key to accelerate the double Reformatsky reaction is considered to be a complex-induced proximity effect of the in situ generated zinc alkoxide coordinated with the pyridyl group of the substrate or bidentate amines. A noteworthy feature of the reaction system is its high tolerance of functional groups due to the moderate nucleophilicity of organozinc reagents and the mild reaction conditions. Moreover, spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses of the zinc complex of the double Reformatsky product support the proposed mechanism of reaction site discrimination for ketones, aldehydes, nitriles, carboxylic acid anhydrides, and esters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aaldehydes 3aamines 3aanhydrides 3achemical reactions 3aesters 3aketones 3amoieties 3anitriles 3aorganic chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3azinc1 aSawai, Yasuhiro1 aKanno, Kazuaki1 aSawada, Naotaka1 aMizufune, Hideya0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 June 21, v. 78, no. 12 p.5843-5850dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo400408t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010900168520106600277592002801343650001401371650001501385650001201400650002101412650001101433650001901444650001501463650001401478650002801492653002501520653002001545653002601565653001501591653001901606653000801625700006101633700001801694700002501712773012101737856008201858852000901940655001201949IND60723305420221118051619.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072330542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1108932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahmasbian, Iman13aAn automated non-destructive prediction of peroxide value and free fatty acid level in mixed nut samples  aThis study aimed to develop an automated technique, which is rapid, non-destructive and inexpensive, to test for rancidity of nuts. A visible to near infrared benchtop hyperspectral camera was used to capture images from blanched canarium, unblanched canarium and macadamia samples. Support vector machine classification (SVC) and PLSR models were developed to segregate the pooled spectra of the nuts and predict their peroxide values (PV) and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. The SVC and PLSR models were then used in a hierarchical model to develop an automated system for predicting PV and FFA. The automated model was then tested using a test set providing classification accuracy of 87% and R² between 0.60 and 0.76 and RPD between 1.6 and 2.7 for PV and FFA prediction. Overall, the automated system has the potential commercial application in nut processing to detect rancidity of mixed nut samples non-destructively and in real-time. It is suggested to train other machine learning models with more samples to improve the accuracy of predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacadamia 3aautomation 3acameras 3afree fatty acids 3amodels 3aperoxide value 3aprediction 3arancidity 3asupport vector machines 0aFood quality control 0aFree fatty acid 0aHyperspectral imaging 0aOleic acid 0aPeroxide value 0aSVM1 aWallace, Helen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8801-44011 aGama, Tsvakai1 aHosseini Bai, Shahla0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 May, v. 143 p.110893-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1108933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245007000176300001400246520087500260592002801135650004401163650002401207650002501231650003501256650001701291650002801308650002401336650001301360650002801373650001701401650002701418650003701445700002001482700002201502773011401524856008601638852000901724655001201733IND60099761520221116154115.0141105e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009976152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Nitin Kumar10aEffect of surfactants on preformed fibrils of human serum albumin  ap. 39-45.  aThe central reason behind pathogenesis of various neurological disorders is usually attributed to the accumulation of aggregated proteins particularly in fibrillar morphology in vivo. One of the plausible remedial treatments for such disorders may be to identify molecules which are capable of either preventing formation of fibrils or disintegrating formed fibrils. The effect of cationic surfactants cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in vitro toward mature HSA fibrils has been investigated. The process has been monitored using ThT fluorescence, FTIR, circular dichroism, fluorescence microscopy and HRTEM. It was observed that the micelles of cationic surfactants were able to effectively disrupt the HSA fibrils, among which CTAB was found to be the most potent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanionic surfactants 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahuman serum albumin 3amicelles 3anervous system diseases 3apathogenesis 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aGhosh, Sudeshna1 aDasgupta, Swagata0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2013 Aug., v. 59 p.39-45dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012000167300001600287500001900303520167700322592002801999650002002027650001402047650001602061650001102077650001102088650001902099650001202118650002802130650001202158653002302170653003402193653001702227653002202244653002602266653002602292700002102318700002002339700001702359700002202376700002102398773014802419856008202567852000902649655001202658IND60718623620221120183132.0201202e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071862362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2020.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenzoni, Luca10aClassification and modeling of load profiles of isolated mini-grids in developing countries: A data-driven approach  ap. 208-225.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReaching universal access to electricity by 2030 requires a massive deployment of mini-grids in rural areas of developing countries. Among the many challenges hindering this process, there are the high uncertainties in assessing demand patterns in rural communities, the costs of field survey campaigns, and the absence of ample and reliable datasets coming from existing projects. This paper tries to address these issues by presenting and discussing a database of load profiles from sixty-one off-grid mini-grids from developing countries worldwide, gathered from the literature, private developers and fieldworks, and reported with technical, socio-economic and geographical characterization factors. A clustering procedure led to the identification of five archetypal load profile clusters, which are presented and analyzed together with their load duration curves. Subsequently, the distribution among the clusters of the various characterization factors selected is studied. The proposed approach allows to widen the range of load profiles usually considered, and to seek correlations between the load profile shapes, the peak power and average energy consumption per connection, the number of customers, the age of measurement, geographical position, operator model, type of tariff and generation technologies present. This work establishes a first step in the creation of a shared database for load profiles of rural mini-grids, helping to overcome the lack of available data and difficulties of demand assessment, proposing original insights for researchers to understand load patterns, and contributing to reduce risks and uncertainties for mini-grid developers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3amodels 3asocioeconomics 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3atariffs 0aIsolated microgrid 0aOff-grid hybrid energy system 0aLoad profile 0aDemand assessment 0aRural electrification 0aElectric consumptions1 aCherubini, Paolo1 aFioriti, Davide1 aPoli, Davide1 aMicangeli, Andrea1 aGiglioli, Romano0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2020 Dec., v. 59 p.208-225dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2020.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245008800164500001900252520090200271592002801173650002201201650001201223650001401235650001401249650001301263650001601276650001401292650002201306650001201328650001701340650002101357653001301378653001101391653001201402700001401414700001601428700001901444700001501463700001501478700001601493773010601509856008701615852000901702655001201711IND60693623520221119015337.0200523e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069362352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1234752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hui10aEffect of lime mud on the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics of biomass pyrolysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe solid waste from papermaking factory, lime mud (LM), was previously demonstrated as an effective catalyst in biomass pyrolysis. Since understanding the kinetics and thermodynamics is the critical step for pyrolysis development, thereby the effect of LM on the kinetics and thermodynamics for biomass pyrolysis was systematically investigated in this study. More specifically, two representative biomasses, herbaceous corncob and woody aspen sawdust, were blended with LM at different mass ratio of 0:0, 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1. Based on this, pyrolysis was conducted through thermogravimetry under nitrogen atmosphere. The kinetic parameters of activation energy and pre-exponential factor were calculated by iso-conventional method. While the Avrami theory was used to determine the reaction order. Thermodynamic parameters were also calculated and compared with those of non-catalytic pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acorn cobs 3anitrogen 3apapermaking 3apyrolysis 3areaction kinetics 3asawdust 3asolid wastes 3athermogravimetry 0aLime mud 0aWastes 0aBiofuel1 aZhou, Nan1 aDai, Leilei1 aCheng, Yanling1 aCobb, Kirk1 aChen, Paul1 aRuan, Roger0 tBioresource technology.g2020 Aug., v. 310 p.123475-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1234753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094024001900118040001800137100002100155245009300176300001600269520139800285592002801683650002801711650001801739650001101757650001501768650001901783650000901802650001001811650001401821650001001835650001101845650001401856650001401870650002201884650000901906651001501915773013701930856007002067852000902137655001202146IND60597615420221118053823.0180625e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059761542DNAL7 a10.1645/15-7472doi4 apara-102-06-09  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeinstein, S. B.10aBaylisascaris procyonis Demography and Egg Production in a California Raccoon Population  ap. 622-628.  aCalifornia has more reported human raccoon roundworm cases than any other state due to large and overlapping human and raccoon populations. Infection by this parasite, Baylisascaris procyonis, is relatively benign in raccoons but can cause severe pathology in other species. Disease risk is driven by environmental egg contamination which increases with raccoon density, worm intensity, and worm prevalence. To improve knowledge about risk to humans and other species, 189 raccoons from southern California were examined to investigate how host age and season affect worm abundance, demography, and fecundity. Adult worms were present in animals as young as 10 wk and 100% of 4-mo-old raccoons were infected. Although 80% of sampled raccoons hosted adult B. procyonis, prevalence and abundance were lower in older animals. There were more worms in juvenile than in adult raccoons, resulting in a convex age-intensity profile. Coupled with raccoon demography, this drove fall peaks in parasite abundance and egg production. Eggs per-gram feces averaged 4,606 ± 661 (SE), and this output increased with worm intensity, with no evidence that crowding reduced parasite size or fecundity. High parasite egg outputs from hosts in this California raccoon population increase human exposure risk, and this risk could be reduced by management strategies that target heavily infected juvenile raccoons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaylisascaris procyonis 3aProcyon lotor 3aadults 3ademography 3aegg production 3aeggs 3afeces 3afecundity 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ajuveniles 3aparasites 3apopulation growth 3arisk 3aCalifornia0 tJournal of parasitology.g2016 Dec., v. 102, no. 6 p.622-628dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/15-7473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011000165300001400275520097800289592002801267650001101295650002401306650001501330650001201345650001001357650001001367650001501377650000901392650002701401650002501428700002301453700001901476773010301495856004801598852000901646655001201655IND4474939620221118000917.0121003e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447493962DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-010-9293-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvens, A.

We found up to 9 alleles per locus, with an average of 4.8. We also report polymorphic cross-amplification of eleven of these markers between different pairs of study species. Furthermore, we tested previously published aphid microsatellites and found one locus developed for Pemphigus bursarius to be polymorphic in G. utricularia. These microsatellite markers will be useful to study the population structure of aphids associated with the ant Lasius flavus and possibly other ants. Such studies are relevant because: 1. L. flavus mounds and their associated flora and fauna are often key components in protected temperate grasslands, and 2. L. flavus and its diverse community of root-aphids provide an interesting model system for studying the long-term stability of mutualistic interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasius 3aPemphigus bursarius 3aTetraneura 3aalleles 3afauna 3aflora 3agrasslands 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure1 aKronauer, D.

However, an increase in resolution does not necessarily mean an increase in realism and accuracy if local spatial features, such as elevational effects, cannot be considered in developing higher-resolution climate data. The Gradient plus Inverse Distance Squared (GIDS) is a broadly accepted elevation-dependent method for spatial interpolation of climate data but is relatively less effective in predicting climate variables in mountainous regions. We developed a new method called Clustering-Assisted Regression (CAR). Instead of using a fixed number of neighboring observed stations within a moving window, we repeated cluster analysis to derive a new subset of stations for each estimated site in CAR. We used both GIDS and CAR to estimate monthly mean temperature and monthly precipitation across mainland China based on observation data from 719 national meteorological stations. Both GIDS and CAR interpolation methods behaved reasonably well in developing 1 km resolution spatial data of monthly mean temperature and monthly precipitation at a national scale in mainland China. The accuracy of monthly mean temperature in summer was higher than in winter whereas that of monthly precipitation in winter was better than in summer. Overall comparisons indicate that CAR was slightly more accurate than GIDS, especially for predicting local climate patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3acluster analysis 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aenvironmental models 3aprediction 3aspatial data 3asummer 3awinter 3aChina1 aSu, Xiaodan1 aShao, Guofan1 aZhang, Hao1 aZhao, Jingzhu0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2012 Dec., v. 38 p.122-128dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012300172520188300295592002802178650001702206650001102223650001902234650002502253650001502278650001902293650001502312650001102327650002602338650003202364650002302396650001502419650001502434650001302449651001302462651001002475653002302485653002702508653001402535653001302549653001502562653002902577700002202606700001802628700002202646700002002668700001802688700002402706700002002730700002002750700003002770700002102800700002002821773010702841856008502948852000903033655001203042IND60791328520221122232447.0220906e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079132852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2022.1097112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Chelsea V.10aPopulation and habitat connectivity of Grevy's zebra Equus grevyi, a threatened large herbivore in degraded rangelands  aLand degradation, competition with livestock, infrastructure development, and climate change have reduced habitat availability and reduced population connectivity for many wildlife species. Large herbivores are particularly vulnerable, and approximately 90 % of global large herbivore diversity is in Africa. The endangered Grevy's zebra illustrates the decline and fragmentation of large mammalian herbivore populations, with extensive population loss across their range in northern Kenya and Ethiopia. A better understanding of the factors influencing population connectivity and movement patterns of Grevy's zebra, highlighted in national strategies, offers valuable insights for other threatened species. Using location and movement data for Grevy's zebra from GPS collars deployed between 2010 and 2017, seasonally-explicit landscape resistance was modelled as a function of water availability, vegetation, cattle density, topography and proximity to roads and settlements. Maximum entropy models identified habitat suitability during wet and dry seasons respectively. Population connectivity analyses using least-cost paths and circuit theory determined landscape resistance to movement and highlighted linkage pathways. Movement was modelled over a range of distances, using GPS data. Grevy's zebra reliance on water was confirmed, with an apparent trade-off between habitat suitability and proximity to people. Connectivity models highlighted potentially isolated populations, with reduced seasonal connectivity being most apparent between north to south distribution areas. These results can inform sustainable land management planning in northern Kenya and offer support for Grevy's zebra conservation actions. These results also provide insights that can be applied to other large herbivores occurring in this region and in arid or degraded environments elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquus grevyi 3acattle 3aclimate change 3ahabitat connectivity 3aherbivores 3ainfrastructure 3alandscapes 3apeople 3arangeland degradation 3asustainable land management 3athreatened species 3atopography 3avegetation 3awildlife 3aEthiopia 3aKenya 0aEndangered species 0aLandscape permeability 0aDispersal 0aMovement 0aResistance 0aPopulation fragmentation1 aGilbert, Tania C.1 aWoodfine, Tim1 aKraaijeveld, Alex1 aChege, Geoffrey1 aKimiti, David1 aLow-Mackey, Belinda1 aMutinda, Mathew1 aNgene, Shadrack1 aRubenstein, Daniel Blake,1 aWandera, Anthony1 aRiordan, Philip0 tBiological conservation.g2022 Oct., v. 274 p.109711-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2022.1097113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012600165300001800291520142300309592002801732650000801760650001501768650001201783650002101795650001501816650001301831650001901844650002401863650002401887650001801911650003101929650002101960650002901981650001902010650002102029650001602050653001802066653001702084653004302101653003902144653001902183653003102202700003102233700002402264773009902288856008502387852000902472655001202481IND60708898220221118042919.0201118e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070889822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jinyi12aA novel solar cooling cycle – A ground coupled PV/T desiccant cooling (GPVTDC) system with low heat source temperatures  ap. 1273-1284.  aThis study investigates the performance of a novel desiccant air dehumidification and cooling cycle that utilises ground source heat exchange and flat plate photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) collectors (the GPVTDC system) to provide conditioned air. The system was modelled in TRNSYS using verified components with a focus on three climates: (i) an oceanic climate (Cfb) (ii) a humid sub-tropical climate (Cfa), and (iii) a hot semi-arid climate (BSh). The GPVTDC system pre-cools the entry air by utilising a ground source heat exchange. This allows the desiccant regeneration process to operate at low temperatures ranging from 43 °C to 62 °C, which enables the use of glazed water type PV/T collectors as the main heat source. The collectors were sized to match both thermal and electrical energy requirements to drive the GPVTDC system. The system was simulated for a whole year in each climate to provide fresh air ventilation, dehumidification and cooling process for an office space. Evaluation of the annual cooling performance of the GPVTDC system shows that it can maintain an office space within the thermal comfort zone for up to 93% of the time, with an average system cooling coefficient of performance (COP) between 9.6 and 16.3 for the three analysed climates. In addition, electrical energy saving up to 87% is achieved in comparison to a conventional dew point air dehumidification and cooling process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acollectors 3acooling 3adehumidification 3adesiccants 3adewpoint 3aelectric power 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy requirements 3aheat transfer 3ahumid subtropical climates 3amaritime climate 3arenewable energy sources 3asemiarid zones 3asolar collectors 3atemperature 0aSolar cooling 0aSolar energy 0aPhotovoltaic thermal (PV/T) collectors 0aDesiccant dehumidification cooling 0aGround cooling 0aLow temperature desiccants1 aBilbao, J.

For this reason, their results are affected by systematic errors. This bias makes it difficult to get reliable uncertainty estimates of model parameters and predictions. A relatively simple way of considering this bias when using deterministic models is to add a statistical representation of the bias to the model output in addition to observation error and to jointly estimate model parameters, bias and observation error. When assuming Normal distributions for bias and observation error, this leads to a relatively simple likelihood function that can easily be evaluated. Nevertheless, the sampling from the posterior distribution still requires long Markov chains to be calculated which can be prohibitive for computationally demanding models. In order to extend the range of applicability of this technique to computationally demanding models, we suggest to replace Markov chain sampling by a Normal approximation to the posterior of the parameters and to estimate prediction uncertainty by linearized error propagation. We tested this procedure for a didactical example and for an application of the biogeochemical-ecological lake model BELAMO to long-term data from Lake Zurich. This is a good test application because the strong coupling of output variables makes it difficult to avoid bias in the results of this model. These tests demonstrate the applicability of the suggested procedure, the approximate reproduction of the results of the full procedure for the didactical example, and meaningful results for the lake model. For the latter, the results demonstrate that the assumption of a realistic likelihood function leads to the conclusion that prediction uncertainty may be high.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3alakes 3aprediction 3auncertainty 3awater quality1 aReichert, Peter0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2012 Dec., v. 38 p.129-146dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011700162300001800279520134900297592002801646596005901674596005901733596010401792596003701896650002001933650001401953650002001967650001201987650001301999650001102012650002502023650003002048650001102078651001102089700005602100700002002156700001402176700001402190700001702204773012702221856008202348852000902430655001202439IND60609191420221118024611.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060919142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-4004-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanjie10aTwo leading modes of the interannual variability in South American surface air temperature during austral winter  ap. 2141-2156.  aThe first two empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of the surface air temperature (SAT) interannual variability in the South American (SA) continent have been revealed in several previous studies. This presentation focuses on winter season and furtherly investigates the detailed advection and cloud-radiation processes and teleconnections from tropical sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) combining statistical analysis with Rossby wave dynamics and modelling experiments. The EOF1, featured with the anomalous center in the central part, is related to the tropical eastern Pacific SSTA, which may impact on the SA SAT variability through the Walker circulation and a regional Hadley cell. The anomalous center is largely attributed to low-level advection transported by the Hadley cell. The EOF2, as a fluctuation between anomalies in the southeast Brazil and the southern tip, is related to the SSTA surrounding the Maritime Continent, which may generate a barotropic wave train propagating to the SA continent. This wave train can strengthen high latitude westerly flow transporting warm advection to the southern tip, and generate southeast anomalous flow transporting cold advection to the southeast Brazil. Meanwhile, the cloud-radiation processes are also involved to enhance the advection-induced SAT anomalies in both areas.  aPublisher supplied data  a41575060cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91437216cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGASI-IPOVAI-03cThe SOA International Cooperation Program on Global Change and Air-Sea Interactions  a2016YFA0601801cMOST Key Project 3aSouth Americans 3aadvection 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3alatitude 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3asurface water temperature 3awinter 3aBrazil1 aLi, Jianping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0625-15751 aKucharski, Fred1 aFeng, Jin1 aZhao, Sen1 aZheng, Jiayu0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Sept., v. 51, no. 5-6 p.2141-2156dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-4004-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012500164300001300289500001900302520161300321592002801934650002001962650001601982650001701998650002202015650002102037650001502058650001802073650002802091653002302119653002902142653003402171653001402205653003302219700001902252700002202271700001602293700002202309773014502331856008202476852000902558655001202567IND60718623920221120204240.0210121e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071862392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2020.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Haoshan10aRefrigerator cost trap for low-income households: Developments in measurement and verification of appliance replacements  ap. 1-14.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnergy efficiency of domestic refrigerators has markedly improved over recent years. Despite these improvements, low-income households in Australia still tend to own older and less energy-efficient refrigerators. Replacement of old refrigerators with energy-efficient appliances presents an important opportunity to reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and the electricity bills of households for sustainable development. This paper presents the measurement and verification of energy savings from a sample of 16 household refrigerator replacements under the Appliance Replacement Offer of the New South Wales Government, Australia. In-home monitoring and laboratory testing were conducted for both old and new refrigerators. A key challenge for this study was to estimate the energy savings of the replacement in each household based on limited in-home monitoring data. The annual energy savings from the refrigerator replacement in the households were estimated using the artificial neural networks (ANN) models for indoor air temperature prediction and the empirical models for the refrigerator energy consumption estimation. The experimental and estimation results both showed that most of the households achieved substantial energy savings from the replacement. The average annual energy cost savings and the average payback period of the refrigerator replacements were 53% and 4.3 years, respectively. It was also found that the energy savings could be compromised if the size of the new refrigerator was much larger than the old unit or if the efficiency of the old refrigerator was reasonably good.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aelectricity 3aenergy costs 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gases 3aprediction 3arefrigerators 3asustainable development 0aIn-home monitoring 0aRefrigerator replacement 0aEnergy consumption estimation 0aANN model 0aMeasurement and verification1 aTibbs, Michael1 aMcLauchlan, Craig1 aMa, Zhenjun1 aHarrington, Lloyd0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2021 Feb., v. 60 p.1-14dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2020.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001200188245007600200300001100276506007600287520151500363592002801878596009201906506003701998650001902035650001002054650001302064650001502077650001002092650001002102650003302112650001402145650003002159650002202189650001002211650001202221651001002233700001602243700001902259700001702278700002102295700001802316700002002334700001702354700002002371773011002391856008202501852000902583655001202592IND60548557720221207143618.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054855772DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1304-02doi7 aPMC50248522pmcid7 a267827422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Ke10aMolecular survey of Enterocytozoon bieneusi in sheep and goats in China  ap. 23.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Over recent years, several studies have conducted genotyping of Enterocytozoon bieneusi in various hosts worldwide using sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), however, relatively little is known about E. bieneusi in sheep and goats in China. Therefore this research was conducted to understand the prevalence and genotype distribution of E. bieneusi in farmed sheep and goats in China. RESULTS: A total of 1025 fecal specimens from farmed animals in various geographic areas were collected. Overall, PCR and sequence analysis of the ITS detected E. bieneusi in 34.4 % (353/1025) of isolates; of which the prevalence in goats was 28.8 % (176/611) and in sheep was 42.8 % (177/414). Phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences identified 42 genotypes (nine known and 33 novel ones). These consisted of four known genotypes (D, KIN-1, EbpC, and F) and 10 novel genotypes (CHG6, CHG7, CHG9, CHG19, CHG23, CHG25, CHS5 and CHS10–CHS12) which all belonged to the so-called zoonotic group 1. A further four known genotypes (CD6, COS-I, BEB6, and J) and 22 novel genotypes (CHG1–CHG3, CHG5, CHG8, CHG10–CHG14, CHG16–CHG18, CHG20, CHG22, CHG24, CHS3, CHS4 and CHS6–CHS9) formed a clade within the group 2. One novel genotype (CHG21) was clustered in the group 9 with the genotype CM4. CONCLUSIONS: E. bieneusi is highly prevalent, widely distributed, and genetically diverse in Chinese farmed goats and sheep. Some of the genotypes identified are potentially zoonotic.  aPublisher supplied data  anycytx-39cthe Earmarked Fund for China Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterocytozoon 3afeces 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3agoats 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3asurveys 3aChina1 aLi, Mengjie1 aWang, Xiaoxing1 aLi, Junqiang1 aKarim, Md Robiul1 aWang, Rongjun1 aZhang, Longxian1 aJian, Fuchun1 aNing, Changshen0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.23-23dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1304-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245011400207300001600321520139800337592002801735653002901763653001401792653003701806653003801843773011401881856008201995852000902077655001202086IND60555135620221120081922.0161026e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055513562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcte.2015.10.0012doi7 aPMC56850262pmcid7 a291591202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kam-Pui,10aPsycholosocial factors associated with psychological insulin resistance in primary care patients in Hong Kong  ap. 157-162.  aPatients with diabetes mellitus (DM) often delay the initiation of insulin treatment and titration due to psychological factors. This phenomenon is called psychological insulin resistance (PIR). The insulin treatment appraisal scale (ITAS) that was initially developed for Western populations has been translated and validated to measure PIR in Taiwanese populations (C-ITAS). This study aims to estimate the prevalence of PIR in primary care patients with DM in Hong Kong and to examine the relationship between PIR and psychosocial factors.402 DM patients from a government-funded general outpatient clinic completed the C-ITAS and a health questionnaire (the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9). Patient demographics were recorded and associations among C-ITAS scores, PHQ-9 scores and demographic data were evaluated.There was no relationship between the presence of depression and PIR. Furthermore, the prevalence of PIR was 47.2% in insulin-naive patients but only 8.7% in current insulin users. Tools such as the C-ITAS may help clinicians understand the etiology of PIR, which this study suggests is likely the result of multiple risk factors. Factors associated with a lower prevalence of PIR included current insulin use, a family history of insulin use, a high education level, male sex, and having received counseling from a physician about insulin within the previous 6 months.  aPublisher supplied data 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aHong Kong 0aPsychological insulin resistance 0aInsulin Treatment Appraisal Scale0 tJournal of Clinical & Translational Endocrinology.g2015 Dec., v. 2 p.157-162dElsevier Inc.x2214-62377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcte.2015.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014500165300001400310520135500324592002801679650001101707650001001718650002501728650001401753650001101767650001701778650001401795650001001809650003301819650001101852650001201863650001001875700001801885700002001903700002001923700001801943773012601961856008102087852000902168655001202177IND4469496620221119015005.0141112e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446949662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeppÃ¤, Laila10aFrom profiles to practice: Communicating the sensory characteristics of apples to the wider audience through simplified descriptive profiles  ap. 46-55.  aA lexicon and procedure for the descriptive analysis of Finnish apples was developed to be used in research, horticulture and marketing. The lexicon developed by 13 panellists consisted of 20 attributes: four related to appearance (green, red, area of redness, amount of skin wax), five to odour (intensity, grassy, sour, sweet, fruity), six to texture (hard, crispy, mealy, juicy, soggy, tough peel) and five to flavour (intensity, sour, sweet, astringent, diverse). Using these attributes, seven autumn and eight winter cultivars were rated for intensity when the apples had reached their full maturity and again 2â3 weeks later. In principal component analysis, the odour and flavour attributes loaded mainly on the first principal component, named âsour-sweetâ, and the textural attributes on the second and third principal components, called âmealy-juicyâ and âcrispy-mealyâ, respectively. Individual graphs for each cultivar were drawn based on the attributes best differentiating the cultivars and reflecting the principal components and (colour: red, green; odour: fruity; texture: crispy, juicy, mealy; flavour: sour, sweet, diverse). These simplified profiles are suggested to be used for communicating the characteristics of the cultivars to a wider audience, to facilitate relevant consumer information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acolor 3aconsumer information 3acultivars 3aflavor 3ahorticulture 3amarketing 3aodors 3aprincipal component analysis 3asweets 3atexture 3awaxes1 aRailio, Jenna1 aMononen, Riikka1 aTahvonen, Risto1 aTuorila, Hely0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2012 June, v. 47, no. 1 p.46-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013000166300001600296520113100312592002801443650001601471650001101487650003101498650002101529650001701550650001901567650002401586650002901610650001301639650001801652650001601670653001201686653001101698653001901709653001801728653001901746700001101765700001801776700001301794700001801807700001601825700001701841700001901858700001401877700001701891773009701908856008502005852000902090655001202099IND60708898320221118042849.0201209e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070889832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jianhua10aTailoring in-situ N, O, P, S-doped soybean-derived porous carbon with ultrahigh capacitance in both acidic and alkaline media  ap. 375-385.  aIn order to improve electrochemical capacitance properties of biomass-derived porous carbon materials, this work develops a low temperature pre-carbonization, hydrothermal stabilization and KOH activation method to derive N, O, P, S co-doped porous carbon materials from protein-rich soybeans and effectively enhances specific capacitances in both acidic and alkaline aqueous electrolytes.

Moreover, a superior cycling stability is achieved with a capacitance retention of 80% after 13,000 cycles at a current density of 20 A g⁻¹ in 2 M KOH. An asymmetric supercapacitor consisting of soybean-derived carbon and NiCo-sulfide delivers a high energy density of 41.8 Wh kg⁻¹ at a power density of 750 W kg⁻¹. The findings above indicate hydrothermal process can effectively stabilize heteroatoms (N and P), improve graphitization and thereby enhance capacitive properties of biomass-derived carbon materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3apotassium hydroxide 3arenewable energy sources 3asoybeans 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 0aBiomass 0aDoping 0aEnergy storage 0aPorous carbon 0aSupercapacitor1 aLi, Xu1 aCui, Zhenxing1 aChen, Di1 aPang, Xiancai1 aZhang, Qian1 aShao, Feifei1 aDong, Hongzhou1 aYu, Liyan1 aDong, Lifeng0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Jan., v. 163 p.375-385dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009300164300001600257520089400273536045401167592002801621596006001649596006301709596005201772596014401824650002601968650002001994650002802014650001902042650001702061650002102078650003202099650001902131650001302150650001002163650001702173653002902190653002302219653003302242653002902275700001802304700001902322700001402341700001802355700001402373700001202387700001802399700001602417773012202433856008502555852000902640655001202649IND60687487220221120095236.0200331e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068748722DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.15436872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuze10aNew cytotoxic bufadienolides from the roots and rhizomes of Helleborus thibetanus Franch  ap. 950-957.  aThree new bufadienolides 14β, 16β-dihydroxy-3β-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-(β-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy]-5α-bufa-20, 22-dienolide (1), 14β-hydroxy-3β-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-(β-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy]-5α-bufa-20, 22-dienolide (2) and hellebrigenin-3-O-β-D-glucosyl-(1→4)-β-D-glucoside (3), together with eight known bufadienolides (4–11) were isolated from the roots and rhizomes of Helleborus thibetanus.

Here, a statistical analysis of the observed rainfall variability was applied as first step towards better understanding causes for these long-term trends. Gridded seasonal rainfall from 1920 to 2012 is used to perform an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The leading EOF components are correlated with three indices of natural climate variations (El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Pacific North American (PNA)), and multiple linear regression (MLR) is used to model the leading components with climate indices. PNA is the dominant mode of wet season (November–April) variability, while ENSO is most significant in the dry season (May–October). To assess whether there is an anthropogenic influence on rainfall, two methods are used: a linear trend term is included in the MLR, and pattern correlation coefficients (PCC) are calculated between recent rainfall trends and future changes in rainfall projected by downscaling methods. PCC results indicate that recent observed rainfall trends in the wet season are positively correlated with future expected changes in rainfall, while dry season PCC results do not show a clear pattern. The MLR results, however, show that the trend term adds significantly to model skill only in the dry season. Overall, MLR and PCC results give weak and inconclusive evidence for detection of anthropogenic signals in the observed rainfall trends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aNorth Americans 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adry season 3amodels 3arain 3aregression analysis 3awet season1 aElison Timm, Oliver1 aGiambelluca, Thomas W.1 aDiaz, Henry F.0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Sept., v. 51, no. 5-6 p.2127-2140dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-4003-43Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002700135040001800162100001500180245011400195300001800309506007600327520117600403592002801579506003701607650002501644650001901669650001401688650001601702650003201718650002401750650001101774650001401785650002501799650002701824650001901851650001201870650001201882653001901894653002501913653000901938653000901947653001601956653002001972700002301992700001602015773012002031856007402151852000902225655001202234IND60690290920221207054541.0220901e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069029092DNAL7 a229904432pmid7 aPMC35488652pmcid7 a10.4161/psb.220882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLouis, Joe10aGreen peach aphid infestation induces Arabidopsis PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4 expression at site of insect feeding  ap. 1431-1433.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Arabidopsis thaliana PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT4 (PAD4) protein, which has homology to lipases, is required for phloem-based resistance against the green peach aphid (GPA; Myzus persicae Sülzer). PAD4 modulates antibiotic and antixenotic defenses against GPA. PAD4 in conjunction with its interacting partner ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1 (EDS1) also functions in basal resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens by promoting salicylic acid (SA)-dependent and SA-independent defenses. By contrast, neither EDS1 nor SA is required for PAD4-controlled defense against GPA. Distinct molecular activities of PAD4 are involved in different aspects of Arabidopsis defense against GPA and pathogens. Histochemical analysis of plants containing a PAD4 ₚ:GUS chimera, which expresses the GUS reporter from the PAD4 promoter, indicated strong PAD4 promoter activity at the site of penetration of the vasculature by the insect stylet. GUS activity was also observed in non-vascular tissues of GPA-infested leaves, thus raising the possibility that a combination of distinct PAD4 activities in vascular and non-vascular tissues contribute to Arabidopsis defense against GPA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aMyzus persicae 3aOomycetes 3aantibiotics 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3ainsect infestations 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant-insect relations 3asalicylic acid 3astylets 3atissues 0aMyzus persicae 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aPAD4 0aEDS1 0aantixenosis 0avascular tissue1 aMondal, Hossain A.1 aShah, Jyoti0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 7, no. 11 p.1431-1433dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.220883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011800169500001900287520100700306592002801313650002401341650001401365650001501379650002201394650001801416650001301434650001201447650002301459650001601482650001101498653002101509653002101530700001901551700002001570700001801590700002801608773010701636856008701743852000901830655001201839IND60693623920221119021211.0201024e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069362392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1234792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xuezhi10aImproved methane production from corn straw using anaerobically digested sludge pre-augmented by nanobubble water  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanobubble water (NBW) has been proven to efficiently improve methane production from organic solid wastes. However, the increase in reactor volume due to addition of NBW hinders its practical applications. In this study, anaerobically digested sludge was first pre-augmented by N₂-NBW and O₂-NBW using corn straw as sole substrate for methane production with electron transfer activity being monitored. 20%, 33% and 38% of cellulose and 29%, 35% and 35% of hemicellulose were reduced respectively from the control, N₂-NBW and O₂-NBW pre-augmented sludge reactors. N₂-NBW and O₂-NBW pre-augmented sludge reactors achieved methane yields of 127 and 142 mL/g-VS, about 10% and 22% higher than that from the control. Results show that use of NBW pre-augmented anaerobically digested sludge as inoculum can remarkably enhance methane yield from corn straw, providing a novel concept for NBW-based anaerobic digestion system with no increase of reactor volume and construction cost in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3acellulose 3acorn straw 3aelectron transfer 3ahemicellulose 3ainoculum 3amethane 3amethane production 3ananobubbles 3asludge 0aPre-augmentation 0aNanobubble water1 aLei, Zhongfang1 aShimizu, Kazuya1 aZhang, Zhenya1 aLee, D.

This paper sought to study the potential of colorimetry in the segregation of logging wastes for bioenergy in Brazilian Amazon. Branches of twenty forest species were sampled at the Forest Management Area Rio Capim, Pará, Brazil. Analyses of the wood physical, chemical, energy, and colorimetric properties (CIEL∗a∗b∗ system) were performed. Our study detected relevant variations for basic density (0.525–0.895 g cm⁻³); energy density (10.2–18.2 GJ m⁻³); total extractives (1.8–17.9%); total lignin (30.2–38.1%); lightness (39–63); green/red axis (5–11); blue/yellow axis (9–23); color saturation (13–25), and hue angle (45–74). The parameters L∗, b∗, C, and h∗ presented negative relations with BD and ED. The most promising wood group (Manilkara elata and Dinizia excelsa) for bioenergy formed by principal component analysis presented darker (purplish-brown) and densest woods (0.895 and 0.891 g cm⁻³), in addition to greater stored energy (17.8 and 18.2 GJ m⁻³). Thus, this research proved that colorimetry has a high potential to segregate logging wastes for the production of chips and charcoal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinizia excelsa 3aManilkara elata 3abioenergy 3abranches 3acharcoal 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aforests 3alignin 3alogging 3aprincipal component analysis 3aslash 3asustainable forestry 3awastes 3awood 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aCIEL∗a∗b∗ system 0aWaste biomass 0aSustainable source 0aCharcoal 0aFirewood1 aPatrício, Evelym Poliana Santos1 aBarros Junior, Udson de Oliveira1 aSilva, Rita de Cássia Carvalho1 aBufalino, Lina1 aNumazawa, Sueo1 aHein, Paulo Ricardo Gherardi1 aProtásio, Thiago de Paula0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Jan., v. 163 p.792-806dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01979naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100002800186245005700214300001100271506007600282520054100358592002800899506003700927650001700964650000900981650001900990650003101009650001301040650002301053650001201076650002801088650000901116650004701125650000901172650004001181700002701221700002101248700001801269700002601287773011901313856008001432852000901512655001201521IND50066745620221207071845.0190131e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006674562DNAL7 aPMC36626262pmcid7 a235574892pmid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-55-282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, Marina Verena10aEpidural myelolipoma in a Husky-cross: a case report  ap. 28.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEpidural spinal myelolipoma was diagnosed in an 11.5-year-old castrated male Husky-cross that was evaluated at the veterinary teaching hospital due to progressive thoracolumbar spinal hyperaesthesia and mild proprioceptive pelvic limb ataxia.

The mass was identified histopathologically as an epidural myelolipoma.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3adogs 3ahistopathology 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3anecropsy 3aveterinary clinics 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxpathology 2aDogs 2aEpidural Neoplasmsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMyelolipomaxpathologyxveterinary.1 aLudwig, Davina Claudia1 aLempp, Charlotte1 aHaist, Verena1 aStein, Veronika Maria0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2013 Dec., v. 55, no. 1 p.28-28dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-55-283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002800158245012800186300001600314500001900330520154800349592002801897650002301925650001101948650001901959650001601978653001601994653000902010653001802019653002102037700002302058700003302081700004502114700004102159700003202200700002802232700003402260700003402294773010102328856009302429852000902522655001202531IND60698337020221119044634.0201023e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069833702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueira, Lucas Machado10aEmbryo yield and quality are associated with progestogen treatment during superovulation protocol in lactating Lacaune ewes  ap. 132-138.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study assessed the effect of progestogen treatment length on ovarian parameters and embryo yield in superovulated Lacaune ewes collected by nonsurgical embryo recovery. Twenty-three lactating ewes were superovulated 30 d apart using a cross-over design. All ewes received 60 mg of MAP intravaginal sponges for 6 (G-6 group) or 9 (G-9 group) d. A total dose of 133 mg pFSH was given in six decreasing doses (twice a day) starting at 60 h before device removal. Ultrasound examination of the ovaries was performed at the first pFSH injection and one day before embryo recovery, which was performed 6–7 d after the onset of estrus. Embryo recovery was conducted only in ewes that expressed estrus and were mated. There was no difference (P > 0.05) in the total number of follicles between G-6 (15.7 ± 1.0) and G-9 (15.6 ± 0.8) at the time of the first pFSH treatment. The percentage of responding donors with ≥3 corpora lutea (CL; 78.2% [18/23] vs 69.5% [16/23]), mean (±SEM) CL number (7.0 ± 1.2 vs 8.1 ± 1.6), transcervical passage rate (94.4% [17/18] vs 83.3% [15/18], and ova/embryo recovery rate (54.5% [60/110] vs 68.0% [83/122]) were not different (P > 0.05) between the G-6 and G-9 groups. However, the mean number of viable embryos was lower (P < 0.05) in the G-6 group (1.8 ± 0.7) than in the G-9 group. (3.5 ± 1.1). In conclusion, treatment with an intravaginal MAP sponge for 9 d during a superovulation protocol is beneficial for viable embryo yield in Lacaune ewes out of the breeding season.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-over studies 3aestrus 3asuperovulation 3aultrasonics 0aDairy sheep 0aMOET 0aTranscervical 0aUterine flushing1 aAlves, Nadja Gomes1 aMaia, Ana Lucia Rosa e Silva1 aSouza-Fabjan, Joanna Maria Gonçalves de1 aBatista, Ribrio Ivan Tavares Pereira1 aMorais, Maria Clara da Cruz1 aLima, Renato Ribeiro de1 aOliveira, Maria Emilia Franco1 aFonseca, Jeferson Ferreira da0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 155 p.132-138dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04038naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015400159300002000313520210800333592002802441650001302469650001202482650001202494650001402506650001002520650001602530650001302546650001502559650001802574650002202592650001202614650001202626650001802638650001402656650001902670650001502689650003002704650001502734650001602749650002102765650001102786650002402797650001702821650001502838650001602853650001702869650001202886650002202898650002202920650000902942650000902951650001902960650001302979650001002992700001703002700001903019700001503038700001503053700001503068700001903083700001903102773012403121856007403245852000903319655001203328IND60664994820221118040218.0190912e20140605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066499482DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra02421d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guangmang10aNMR-based metabolomic studies reveal changes in biochemical profile of urine and plasma from rats fed with sweet potato fiber or sweet potato residue  ap. 23749-23758.  aDietary fiber has attracted more interest in recent years because many studies have uncovered its disease preventive and health-promoting features: containing blood cholesterol and/or glucose attenuation and reducing obesity risk. However, the health effects of sweet potato fiber (SF) and sweet potato residue (SR) and the knowledge of their exact mechanisms of action are still not fully understood. This study investigates the effect of SF and SR administration on rat metabolism. Rats were randomly assigned to one of three dietary groups of 11 rats each and given a basal diet containing 15% SF, 15% SR, or no supplemental fiber (control). The groups were observed for 30 days, and urine and plasma samples were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. Compared with the rats in the control group, those administered the diet containing SF exhibited significantly increased plasma levels of lipid, lactate, and myo-inositol, as well as urine levels of acetate, citrulline, N-acetylglutamate, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate. SF significantly decreased the plasma levels of glutamine, glutamine/glutamate, lysine, phosphorylcholine/glycerolphosphocholine, tyrosine, and glucose, as well as the urine level of allantoin. Moreover, SR significantly increased the plasma levels of acetone, lipid, and lactate, as well as the urine levels of acetamide, alanine, citrulline, ethanol, lactate, methylamine, methylmalonate, N-acetylglutamate, and α-hydroxybutyrate, compared with the control group. SR significantly decreased the plasma levels of citrate, glutamate, glutamine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, and glucose, as well as the urine level of isobutyrate. These results suggest that SF and SR supplementation have certain systemic metabolic processes in common, including lipid metabolism, glycogenolysis and glycolysis metabolism, energy metabolism, protein biosynthesis, and gut microbiota metabolism. This study demonstrates the potential for the routine use of metabolomics in nutritional studies to characterize metabolic effects and understand the influence of diet on animal metabotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetone 3aalanine 3aallantoin 3ablood 3acholesterol 3acitrates 3acitrulline 3adietary fiber 3aenergy metabolism 3aethanol 3aglucose 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3aglycogenolysis 3aglycolysis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aisoleucine 3alactic acid 3alipid metabolism 3alysine 3amechanism of action 3ametabolomics 3amethionine 3amethylamine 3amyo-inositol 3aobesity 3aphosphorylcholine 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3arisk 3asweet potatoes 3atyrosine 3aurine1 aYang, Genjin1 aFang, Tingting1 aCai, Yimin1 aWu, Caimei1 aWang, Jing1 aHuang, Zhiqing1 aChen, Xiaoling0 tRSC advances.g2014 June 05, v. 4, no. 45 p.23749-23758dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra02421d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245007700206300001800283520161000301592002801911596014101939650001202080650001902092650002102111650001602132650001502148651001302163651001802176700002002194700002002214700002002234773012702254856008202381852000902463655001202472IND60609191920221118024558.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060919192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-4010-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSierra, Juan P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7001-594310aHow well do CMIP5 models simulate the low-level jet in western Colombia?  ap. 2247-2265.  aThe Choco jet is an important atmospheric feature of Colombian and northern South America hydro-climatology. This work assesses the ability of 26 coupled and 11 uncoupled (AMIP) global climate models (GCMs) included in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archive to simulate the climatological basic features (annual cycle, spatial distribution and vertical structure) of this jet. Using factor and cluster analysis, we objectively classify models in Best, Worst, and Intermediate groups. Despite the coarse resolution of the GCMs, this study demonstrates that nearly all models can represent the existence of the Choco low-level jet. AMIP and Best models present a more realistic simulation of jet. Worst models exhibit biases such as an anomalous southward location of the Choco jet during the whole year and a shallower jet. The model skill to represent this jet comes from their ability to reproduce some of its main causes, such as the temperature and pressure differences between particular regions in the eastern Pacific and western Colombian lands, which are non-local features. Conversely, Worst models considerably underestimate temperature and pressure differences between these key regions. We identify a close relationship between the location of the Choco jet and the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and CMIP5 models are able to represent such relationship. Errors in Worst models are related with bias in the location of the ITCZ over the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, as well as the representation of the topography and the horizontal resolution.  aPublisher supplied data  aProgram: 5509-543-31966 grant:115-660-44588cDepartamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación de Colombia (Colciencias) 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acluster analysis 3atemperature 3atopography 3aColombia 3aPacific Ocean1 aArias, Paola A.1 aVieira, Sara C.1 aAgudelo, Jhoana0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Sept., v. 51, no. 5-6 p.2247-2265dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-4010-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245008600204300001800290506007600308520106200384592002801446506003701474650002301511650001001534650001001544650001801554650002601572650001401598650001001612650001901622650002901641650002601670653000801696653001401704653001801718653001201736653001801748700001701766700002101783773012001804856007301924852000901997655001202006IND60690291220221207085325.0200426e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069029122DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.220972doi7 aPMC35789132pmcid7 a230730222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThatcher, Louise F.10aLateral organ boundaries domain transcription factorsbNew roles in plant defense  ap. 1702-1704.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOver the last two decades, several transcription factor gene families have been identified with some of them characterized in detail for their roles on transcriptional regulation of plant defense responses against pest or pathogen attack. We have recently added another transcription factor gene family to this list through the characterization of the LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) DOMAIN (LBD)-CONTAINING PROTEIN20 (LBD20). We showed LBD20 acts as a repressor of a subset of jasmonate mediated defenses and in susceptibility to the root-infecting fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. However, possible roles for other members of this gene family in plant defense are currently unknown. Here we searched publically available microarray expression data and provide an overview of the expression patterns of selected members of the LBD gene family for their response to other fungal pathogens and soil nematodes. Distinct expression patterns of the LBD genes suggest that certain members of this gene family have previously undescribed roles in plant defense.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium oxysporum 3afungi 3agenes 3ajasmonic acid 3amicroarray technology 3apathogens 3apests 3asoil nematodes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aLBD 0ajasmonate 0atranscription 0adefense 0abiotic stress1 aKazan, Kemal1 aManners, John M.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 7, no. 12 p.1702-1704dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.220973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012700177300001600304520245400320592002802774650001302802650002202815650002502837650003002862651002202892653003202914653000902946653000802955653002402963653002702987653002703014700001903041700001903060700002003079773009903099856008503198852000903283655001203292IND60086812120221119222251.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008681212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuruncoglu, Ufuk Utku10aToward self-describing and workflow integrated Earth system models: A coupled atmosphere-ocean modeling system application  ap. 247-262.  aThe complexity of Earth system models and their applications is increasing as a consequence of scientific advances, user demand, and the ongoing development of computing platforms, storage systems and distributed high-resolution observation networks. Multi-component Earth system models need to be redesigned to make interactions among model components and other applications external to the modeling system easier. To that end, the common component interfaces of Earth system models can be redesigned to increase interoperability between models and other applications such as various web services, data portals and science gateways. The models can be made self-describing so that the many configuration, build options and inputs of a simulation can be recorded. In this paper, we present a coupled modeling system that includes the proposed methodology to create self-describing models with common model component interfaces. The designed coupled atmosphere-ocean modeling system is also integrated into a scientific workflow system to simplify routine modeling tasks and relationships between these tasks and to demonstrate the enhanced interoperability between different technologies and components. Later on, the work environment is tested using a realistic Earth system modeling application. As can be seen through this example, a layered design for collecting provenance and metadata has the added benefit of documenting a run in far greater detail than before. In this way, it facilitates exploration and understanding of simulations and leads to possible reproducibility. In addition to designing self-describing Earth system models, the regular modeling tasks are also simplified and automated by using a scientific workflow which provides meaningful abstractions for the model, computing environment and provenance/metadata collection mechanisms. Our aim here is to solve a specific instance of a complex model integration problem by using a framework and scientific workflow approach together. The reader may also note that the methods presented in this paper might be also generalized to other types of Earth system models, leading to improved ease of use and flexibility. The initial results also show that the coupled atmosphere-ocean model, which is controlled by the designed workflow environment, is able to reproduce the Mediterranean Sea surface temperature when it is compared with the used CCSM3 initial and boundary conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3asurface water temperature 3aMediterranean Sea 0aCoupled Earth system models 0aROMS 0aWRF 0aScientific workflow 0aSelf-describing models 0aProvenance information1 aDalfes, Nuzhet1 aMurphy, Sylvia1 aDeLuca, Cecelia0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2013 Jan., v. 39 p.247-262dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245009500208300001300303520159400316592002801910653001101938653000901949653000801958653000701966653000901973653000801982653000901990653001001999653000902009653000802018653000902026653001002035653001602045653002302061653001402084653003102098653001302129653001702142700005702159700002702216700002302243700005702266773008902323856008402412852000902496655001202505IND60555136220221120061655.0161026e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055513622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbacli.2013.12.0012doi7 aPMC46339462pmcid7 a266754762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Yuen Yee10aCells from the skin of patients with systemic sclerosis secrete chitinase 3-like protein 1  ap. 2-11.  aThe chitinase-like protein, Chi3L1, is associated with increased fibrotic activity as well as inflammatory processes. The capacity of skin cells from systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients to produce Chi3L1, and the stimulation of its synthesis by cytokines or growth factors known to be associated with SSc, was investigated.Cells were isolated from forearm and/or abdomen skin biopsies taken from SSc patients and normal individuals and stimulated with cytokines and growth factors to assess Chi3L1 expression. Chi3L1-expressing cells were characterized by immunohistochemical staining.Chi3L1 was not secreted by skin cells from normal individuals nor was its synthesis induced by any of the cytokines or growth factors investigated. In contrast, Chi3L1 secretion was induced by OSM or IL-1 in cells from all forearm biopsies of SSc patients, and endogenous secretion in the absence of cytokines was detected in several specimens. Patients with Chi3L1-producing cells at both the arm and abdomen had a disease duration of less than 3years. Endogenous Chi3L1 production was not a property of the major fibroblast population nor of myofibroblasts, but rather was related to the presence of stem-like cells not present in normal skin. Other cells, however, contributed to the upregulation of Chi3L1 by OSM.The emergence of cells primed to respond to OSM with increased Chi3L1 production appears to be associated with pathological processes active in SSc.The presence of progenitor cells expressing the chilectin Chi3L1 in SSc skin appears to play a role in the initiation of the disease process.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChi3L1 0aDAPI 0aECM 0aIL 0amRSS 0aOSM 0aPDGF 0aαSMA 0aSBTI 0aSSc 0aTIE2 0aTGFβ 0aScleroderma 0aSystemic sclerosis 0aStem cell 0aChitinase 3-like protein 1 0aCytokine 0aOncostatin M1 aBaron, Murray1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0435-61651 aRecklies, Anneliese D.1 aRoughley, Peter J.1 aMort, John S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8434-21010 tBBA Clinical.g2014 June, v. 1 p.2-11dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23400x2214-64747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbacli.2013.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245010900191300001800300520103100318592002801349650001301377650004601390650002801436650002301464650001001487650001601497650001601513650001501529650001501544650001001559650001601569650002001585650001301605650001601618650001401634650001101648650001301659650000801672650002101680650001401701650001001715650000901725650001301734650002301747650001501770650002901785650003501814650003801849650003301887650002501920650003801945650002901983650004002012700002002052700002202072700002302094773012302117856004802240852000902288655001202297IND50058952720221118000701.0121011e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005895272DNAL7 a228067532pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-012-1127-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuwannarach, Nakarin10aBiocontrol of Rhizoctonia solani AG-2, the causal agent of damping-off by Muscodor cinnamomi CMU-Cib 461  ap. 3171-3177.  aRhizoctonia solani is a damping-off pathogen that causes significant crop loss worldwide. In this study, the potential of Muscodor cinnamomi, a new species of endophytic fungus for controlling R. solani AG-2 damping-off disease of plant seedlings by biological fumigation was investigated. In vitro tests showed that M. cinnamomi volatile compounds inhibited mycelial growth of pathogens. Among nine solid media tested, rye grain was the best grain for inoculum production. An in vivo experiment of four seedlings, bird pepper, bush bean, garden pea and tomato were conducted. The results indicated that treatment with 30 g of M. cinnamomi inoculum was the minimum dose that caused complete control of damping-off symptoms of all seedlings after one month of planting. The R. solani-infested soil showed the lowest percentage of seed germination. In addition, M. cinnamomi did not cause any disease symptoms. From the results it is clear that M. cinnamomi is effective in controlling R. solani AG-2 both in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMuscodor 3aPisum sativum subsp. sativum var. sativum 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3abiological control 3abirds 3acrop losses 3adamping off 3aendophytes 3afumigation 3afungi 3agreen beans 3ain vivo studies 3ainoculum 3anew species 3apathogens 3apepper 3aplanting 3arye 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil 3atomatoes 3avolatile compounds 2aAntibiosis 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aMyceliumxgrowth & development 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aRhizoctoniaxgrowth & development 2aSeedlingsxmicrobiology. 2aXylarialesxmetabolismxphysiology.1 aKumla, Jaturong1 aBussaban, Boonsom1 aLumyong, Saisamorn0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.3171-3177dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-012-1127-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245013800208300001600346500001900362520170600381592002802087650000802115650001502123650002002138650001502158650001402173650002302187650001702210650001702227650002602244650002802270650002202298650002302320650001602343650001402359653001602373653002102389653002602410700005402436700001402490700005702504700001302561773012402574856008502698852000902783655001202792IND60718624520221120224333.0210121e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071862452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Keliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6791-739910aDeterioration of orthodox seeds during ageing: Influencing factors, physiological alterations and the role of reactive oxygen species  ap. 475-485.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeed viability is an important trait in agriculture which directly influences seedling emergence and crop yield. However, even when stored under optimal conditions, all seeds will eventually lose their viability. Our primary aims were to describe factors influencing seed deterioration, determine the morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes that occur during the process of seed ageing, and explore the mechanisms involved in seed deterioration. High relative humidity and high temperature are two factors that accelerate seed deterioration. As seeds age, frequently observed changes include membrane damage and the destruction of organelle structure, an increase in the loss of seed leachate, decreases of respiratory rates and ATP production, and a loss of enzymatic activity. These phenomena could be inter-related and reflect the general breakdown in cellular organization. Many processes can result in seed ageing; it is likely that oxidative damage caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) is primarily responsible. ROS can have vital interactions with any macromolecule of biological interest that result in damage to various cellular components caused by protein damage, lipid peroxidation, chromosomal abnormalities, and DNA lesions. Further, ROS may also cause programmed cell death by inducing the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores and the release of cytochrome C. Some repairs can occur in the early stages of imbibition, but repair processes fail if sufficient damage has been caused to critical functional components. As a result, a given seed will lose its viability and eventually fail to germinate in a relatively short time period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acrop yield 3aenzyme activity 3aimbibition 3aleachates 3alipid peroxidation 3amitochondria 3apermeability 3aprogrammed cell death 3areactive oxygen species 3arelative humidity 3aseedling emergence 3atemperature 3aviability 0aSeed ageing 0aOxidative stress 0aProtein carbonylation1 aZhang, Yin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2877-80041 aSun, Jing1 aMeng, Jiasong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0147-69861 aTao, Jun0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Jan., v. 158 p.475-485dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03803naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007300167300001600240520230000256592002802556650002202584650002202606650001402628650002502642650001202667650001302679650002402692650001402716650003102730650001302761650001302774650001902787650003402806650002202840653002502862653001602887653001302903653001602916653001502932653001102947700002002958700002302978700001903001700001903020700002203039700001903061773009903080856008503179852000903264655001203273IND60086812320221119222337.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008681232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnapen, Rob10aEvaluating OpenMI as a model integration platform across disciplines  ap. 274-282.  aFor decision makers in the domains of agriculture and environment, for instance in government agencies, farmers, environmental NGOs and farmers' unions, it is beneficial to evaluate ex-post or to asses ex-ante the impacts of their choices. To research these interdisciplinary relationships, models developed by different scientific disciplines and often operating at different scales can be integrated into model chains that cover processes across disciplines. In order to assemble models into an operational model chain conceptual, semantic and technical levels of integration have to be taken into account.The main focus of this paper is on technical integration to ensure repeatability and reproducibility of model chain runs and to optimize use of computer hardware for model simulations. Technical integration itself can be achieved by different approaches (i.e. manual, scripting, building or using a proprietary framework, using an open framework based on standards). From the many available modelling frameworks (e.g. OMS, TIME, KEPLER, FRAMES, MODCOM, OpenMI) the emphasis will be on OpenMI, the Open Modelling Interface and its use and usefulness as a readily available, generally accepted and open standards based framework.OpenMI is an open source software standard for dynamically linking models at runtime, which can potentially be used in many domains, but is currently mainly applied in the water and environmental domains. This paper describes and evaluates the use of OpenMI in several multi-disciplinary large projects that worked on integrated models. These projects operated in the disciplines of agriculture, land use, nitrogen cycling, forestry, hydrology and economics.To this end two workshops were organized to acquire feedback from both software developers and modellers that contributed to the aforementioned projects on the use of OpenMI. Perceived advantages and disadvantages of OpenMI differed between modellers and software engineers, although both identified the lack of standard functionality as a major disadvantage and the prescription of a way of working through OpenMI as a standard as a major advantage. In conclusion, OpenMI can be used as a standard for technical model integration across disciplines, and it is not limited to one particular discipline.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer hardware 3acomputer software 3aeconomics 3aenvironmental models 3afarmers 3aforestry 3agovernment agencies 3ahydrology 3ainterdisciplinary research 3aland use 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3anongovernmental organizations 3asimulation models 0aModelling frameworks 0aIntegration 0aSemantic 0aDisciplines 0aSimulation 0aOpenMI1 aJanssen, Sander1 aRoosenschoon, Onno1 aVerweij, Peter1 ade Winter, Wim1 aUiterwijk, Michel1 aWien, Jan-Erik0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2013 Jan., v. 39 p.274-282dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008900176500002200265520169800287592002801985650001402013650002302027650001302050650001502063650001202078650001202090650001102102650001702113650001102130650001402141650001202155650000902167651001402176653001802190653001302208653000902221653001502230653002102245653002002266700002502286700003202311700002402343700002102367700002402388773006902412856008402481852000902565655001202574IND60565250520221122134215.0170320s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056525052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2016.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaruso Fermé, Laura,10aMultiproxy study of plant remains from Cerro Casa de Piedra 7 (Patagonia, Argentina)  aPre-press version  aThe objective of this work is to carry out an integral study of macro and microbotanical remains with the aim of providing information to the palaeoenvironmental reconstruction and understanding the different practices employed in the acquisition of woody material used by hunter-gatherer societies from the northwestern region of the Santa Cruz Province, Argentine Patagonia, during the early and middle Holocene. For this purpose, we study macrobotanical remains (carbonized and non-carbonized wood) recovered from different combustion structures and from the sediment of the three stratigraphic levels dated by 14C and resulting in ages of 9640 ± 190 years BP; 8380 ± 120 years BP and 6150 ± 105 years BP, of the Cerro Casa de Piedra 7 site. Also, pollen and small plant fragments of human and camelid coprolites were studied. The analysis conducted show differences in the taxonomic resolution obtained by each one of the proxies. The marked representation of Nothofagus pumilio among charcoal and wood makes clear that the forest was an environment recurrently used by hunter-gatherers occupying CCP7. The study of pollen and plant fragments coming from coprolites, allowed the identification of grass species typical of the steppe environments and forest-steppe ecotonal areas. In this way, plant fragments provide higher level of taxonomic resolution and a greater diversity for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The results obtained by means of the multi-proxy analysis allowed us not only to enlarge the reconstruction of the hunter-gatherers livable environment, but also to recognize the availability and use of the plant resources in the Early-Mid-Holocene in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelidae 3aNothofagus pumilio 3acharcoal 3acombustion 3aforests 3agrasses 3ahumans 3apaleoecology 3apollen 3asediments 3asteppes 3awood 3aArgentina 0aArchaeobotany 0aCharcoal 0aWood 0aCoprolites 0aHunter-gatherers 0aSouth patagonia1 aVelázquez, Nadia J.1 aMartínez Tosto, A.

During 1979–1998, there is a negative precipitation-SST relationship over the SCS, with a larger magnitude over the northeastern SCS (NESCS) than over the southwestern SCS (SWSCS). The remote effect of warmer SST over the tropical Indian Ocean plays a crucial role in a strong anticyclone and suppressed rainfall over the SCS and western North Pacific. Due to greater mixed-layer depth over the SWSCS than over the NESCS, entrainment heat flux makes a larger contribution to a positive precipitation-SST tendency over the SWSCS than over the NESCS. The cloud-radiation effect has a dominant and positive contribution to the SST tendency over the NESCS, whereas it has a negative contribution to SST tendency over the SWSCS. In contrast, the precipitation-SST correlation becomes weakly negative over the NESCS and significantly positive over the SWSCS during 1999–2013. The CESM-CAM5 model demonstrates that cooler SST over the tropical central-eastern Pacific (TCEP) triggers a weak anticyclone, slightly suppressing rainfall over the SCS. The cloud-radiation effect still contributes mostly to a positive SST tendency over the NESCS. Warmer SST over the SWSCS induces an increase in surface evaporation and low-level moisture convergence and causes enhanced rainfall. That offsets the remote effect of TCEP SST and results in a negative precipitation-SST tendency with negative cloud-radiation feedback. The interdecadal change in remote forcing to SCS rainfall around the late 1990s is related to the evolution of TCEP SST anomalies from the preceding winter to summer, which is possibly modulated by the phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.  aPublisher supplied data  a41506004, 41506003cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a9360126cthe project of Guy Carpenter Asia-Pacific Climate Impact Centre  aXDA11010403cthe Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2016YFA0600601cNational Key Basic Research and Development Projects of China  a41675062cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aclimate 3aevaporation 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3arain 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3awinter 3aIndian Ocean 3aSouth China Sea1 aWang, Xin1 aZhou, Wen1 aWen, Zhiping0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Sept., v. 51, no. 5-6 p.2229-2246dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-4009-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245011000182520134200292592002801634650001201662650001201674650001901686650001401705650001601719650000901735650001101744650001901755650001401774650002901788650001701817650001301834650001601847650001501863650001101878650002001889650001801909650002001927653002301947653002601970653001701996653000802013653002402021700002702045700002502072700006302097700002502160700002502185700006902210773012202279856008802401852000902489655001202498IND60698337420221119044433.0200711e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069833742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1041462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaramillo Roman, Viviana10aDifferential responses to salt stress in ion dynamics, growth and seed yield of European quinoa varieties  aQuinoa is a nutritious seed crop with a great potential to grow in saline soils. Here, we studied ion concentrations in quinoa tissues throughout the life cycle of the plant, and linked ion dynamics to responses in growth parameters, seed yield and efficiency of photosynthesis under salinity (0–400 mM NaCl). Ion dynamics changed from high ion exclusion (>99 %, root contents lower than root medium and low accumulation of ions in the leaves) before flowering, to a build-up of ions during seed filling. This indicates a change in strategy in maintaining the necessary gradient of water potential from the root medium to the leaves. K⁺ concentrations in leaves also increased by more than 100 % in response to prolonged severe salt stress, which may point to a role of this ion in leaf osmotic adjustment. Accumulation of ions in epidermal bladder cells did not contribute substantially to Na⁺-exclusion as it was less than 6 % of the total Na⁺ taken up in leaves. Growth under salt stress was mostly impaired by anatomical adaptations (reduced SLA), while initial light use efficiency (Fv/Fm) and NAR were not affected. The variety Pasto showed a “survival strategy” to high salinity with higher ion exclusion and a higher reduction in transpiration than the other varieties, at the expense of lower biomass and seed yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abladder 3afilling period 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3aions 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3aradiation use efficiency 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseed yield 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3atranspiration 3awater potential 0aChenopodium quinoa 0aSalt stress tolerance 0aNa+exclusion 0aRGR 0aSurvival and growth1 aden Toom, Leonardus A.1 aCastro Gamiz, Carlos1 avan der Pijl, Niels1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8806-28361 aVisser, Richard G.F.1 avan Loo, Eibertus N.1 avan der Linden, C.

The problems are characterized by the extent of the environmental system involved, dynamic and interdependent nature of stressors and their impacts, diversity of stakeholders, and integration of social, economic, and environmental considerations. IEM provides a science-based structure to develop and organize relevant knowledge and information and apply it to explain, explore, and predict the behavior of environmental systems in response to human and natural sources of stress. During the past several years a number of workshops were held that brought IEM practitioners together to share experiences and discuss future needs and directions. In this paper we organize and present the results of these discussions. IEM is presented as a landscape containing four interdependent elements: applications, science, technology, and community. The elements are described from the perspective of their role in the landscape, current practices, and challenges that must be addressed. Workshop participants envision a global scale IEM community that leverages modern technologies to streamline the movement of science-based knowledge from its sources in research, through its organization into databases and models, to its integration and application for problem solving purposes. Achieving this vision will require that the global community of IEM stakeholders transcend social, and organizational boundaries and pursue greater levels of collaboration. Among the highest priorities for community action are the development of standards for publishing IEM data and models in forms suitable for automated discovery, access, and integration; education of the next generation of environmental stakeholders, with a focus on transdisciplinary research, development, and decision making; and providing a web-based platform for community interactions (e.g., continuous virtual workshops).  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acommunity development 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3adecision making 3aeducation 3aenvironmental models 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aproblem solving 3astakeholders 0aIntegrated environmental modeling 0aCommunity of practice 0aRoadmap 0aModel integration1 aOlchin, Gabriel1 aGoodall, Jonathan1 aVoinov, Alexey1 aHill, Mary1 aGlynn, Pierre1 aWhelan, Gene1 aGeller, Gary1 aQuinn, Nigel1 aBlind, Michiel1 aPeckham, Scott1 aReaney, Sim1 aGaber, Noha1 aKennedy, Robert1 aHughes, Andrew0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2013 Jan., v. 39 p.3-23dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100002400191245014200215300001600357506007600373506003100449520140600480592002801886596008301914596005401997506003702051650001502088650002102103650001202124650001602136650001402152650002302166650003102189650002102220650001502241650001202256650001802268650001102286650001902297650001102316650002402327650002902351650002002380653002302400653002602423653002102449653002102470653001902491700001902510700001802529700002002547700001802567700002402585773009702609856008502706852000902791655001202800IND60708899220221207102043.0201209e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070889922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.0922chorus7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakaboylu, Gunes A.10aEngineered hierarchical porous carbons for supercapacitor applications through chemical pretreatment and activation of biomass precursors  ap. 276-287.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFor a better process and property control, the effect of chemical pretreatment time on the chemistry and electrochemical performance of activated carbons derived from Miscanthus grass biomass was examined. The microstructure, chemistry and active functional groups were controlled by tuning the pretreatment duration, which provided the removal of certain concentrations of hemicellulose and lignin, as well as, pore development at the initial stage. The optimal KOH pretreatment (12–18 h) resulted in interconnected pore structure, rich oxygen content (18–21 at.%), significant changes in their chemistry and functional groups, and a sheet-like morphology. A high specific capacitance up to 188 F/g and a high cycling stability of 85–91% retention (after 1000–2500 cycles) at 0.1 A/g were achieved. The optimization of the pretreatment time also resulted in high specific energy (8.0 W h/kg) and specific power (377 W/kg) at 0.5 A/g. The micro/mesopore volume, cellulose content, C/O ratio, and surface chemistry were identified to be major contributors to the electrochemical performance as a result of enhanced electro-adsorption, double layer formation, and rapid ion transport. This understanding creates a simple and cost-effective route for controlling the pore network and chemistry, as well as, the resultant performance of the porous activated carbon supercapacitor electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cTürkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMiscanthus 3aactivated carbon 3abiomass 3acapacitance 3acellulose 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agrasses 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3amicrostructure 3aoxygen 3apotassium hydroxide 3arenewable energy sources 3aspecific energy 0aBiomass conversion 0aChemical pretreatment 0aMiscanthus grass 0aActivated carbon 0aSupercapacitor1 aJiang, Changle1 aYumak, Tugrul1 aZondlo, John W.1 aWang, Jingxin1 aSabolsky, Edward M.0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Jan., v. 163 p.276-287dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012600208300001600334520137000350592002801720650001201748650001601760650002201776650001001798650001601808650001201824650001401836650001101850650001101861650003101872650002101903650002901924650003301953650003301986650002102019650001702040650001702057650001602074653001502090653001202105653001702117653002402134653002202158653001202180700006902192700006402261700006402325700007002389700006902459773009702528856008502625852000902710655001202719IND60708899320221118040814.0201209e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070889932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarlaki, Ehsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0158-557910aValorization of lignite wastes into humic acids: Process optimization, energy efficiency and structural features analysis  ap. 105-122.  aThe present work investigates the optimization of humic acids (HAs) production from lignite processing wastes using a developed mechanical agitated (MA) tank reactor based on the results of response surface methodology (RSM). The structures of the obtained HAs were characterized using elemental analysis, spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), particle size distribution (PSD), acidic functional groups, and ash content. The highest extraction efficiency of HA was 54.2%, which was obtained from the MA tank reactor under optimal conditions of using 0.5 M NaOH, the reaction time of 4 h, stirring speed of 850 rpm, and temperature of 70 °C. The developed MA tank reactor was capable of improving the HA extraction and energy efficiency of the process up to 26.9% and 24.8%, respectively, compared to the conventional magnetic stirred (MS) glass reactor. The extracted HA from the MA tank reactor exerted better quality indices, including higher oxygen content (37.02%), higher C/N and O/C ratios (61.26 and 0.47, respectively), higher total acidity and phenolic-OH contents (8.87 and 5.6 meq.g⁻¹, respectively), higher E₄/E₆ ratio (3.765), more homogeneously porous structure, higher specific surface area, lower H/C ratio (0.64), and lower ash content (2.2%), than the MS method, which indicate its suitability in agricultural applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aash content 3aenergy efficiency 3aglass 3ahumic acids 3alignite 3amagnetism 3amixing 3aoxygen 3aparticle size distribution 3aprocessing waste 3arenewable energy sources 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aHumic acid 0aLignite 0aOptimization 0aStructural features 0aEnergy efficiency 0aReactor1 aVakilian, Keyvan Asefpour1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5035-77271 aPaghaleh, Ali Sharif1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2061-38271 aSharif Paghaleh, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2061-38271 aKianmehr, Mohammad Hossein1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8169-38031 aAsefpour Vakilian, Keyvan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5035-77270 tRenewable energy.g2021 Jan., v. 163 p.105-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005700171300001600228520073600244592002800980650002301008650002301031650002201054650002001076650001801096650002401114650001501138653000801153653000801161653000801169653000801177653003501185653004801220653002301268653003501291653001501326700002001341773011201361856008601473852000901559655001201568IND60606983820221118030811.0180829e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060698382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Myunghwan,10aDynamic panels with threshold effect and endogeneity  ap. 169-186.  aThis paper addresses an important issue of modeling nonlinear asymmetric dynamics and unobserved individual heterogeneity in the threshold panel data framework, simultaneously. As a general approach, we develop the first-differenced GMM estimator, which allows both threshold variable and regressors to be endogenous. When the threshold variable becomes strictly exogenous, we propose a more efficient two-step least squares estimator. We provide asymptotic theory and develop the testing procedure for threshold effects and the threshold variable exogeneity. Monte Carlo studies provide a support for theoretical predictions. We present an empirical application investigating an asymmetric sensitivity of investment to cash flows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3aleast squares 3amathematical theory 3aprediction 0aC13 0aC33 0aG31 0aG35 0aDynamic panel threshold models 0aEndogenous threshold effects and regressors 0aFD-GMM and FD-2SLS 0aLinearity and exogeneity tests 0aInvestment1 aShin, Yongcheol0 tJournal of econometrics.g2016 Dec., v. 195, no. 2 p.169-186dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2016.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245020900155300002000364520155100384592002801935650001401963650002201977650001301999650001302012650002102025650001902046650001702065650001102082650001202093650000802105700001702113700002402130700001402154773012402168856007402292852000902366655001202375IND60664995520221118040133.0190912e20140422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066499552DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra02429j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Weikun10aSynthesis of mixed poly(ε-caprolactone)/polystyrene brushes from Y-initiator-functionalized silica particles by surface-initiated ring-opening polymerization and nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization  ap. 18772-18781.  aThis article reports on the synthesis of mixed homopolymer brushes grafted on silica particles composed of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), a chemically and biologically degradable polymer, and polystyrene (PS), a vinyl polymer, by sequential surface-initiated ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-caprolactone (εCL) at 75 °C and nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMRP) of styrene at 120 °C. The silica particles were functionalized with an asymmetric difunctional initiator (Y-initiator) bearing a hydroxyl group, an initiator for ROP, and an alkoxyamine moiety, an initiator for NMRP. We found that for ROP, PCL with Mₙ,SEC values of ∼25 kDa and narrow polydispersity indexes (≤1.20) relative to PS standards can be reproducibly synthesized at 75 °C using tin(ii) 2-ethylhexanoate as catalyst after the Y-initiator-functionalized silica particles and the catalyst were thoroughly dried. Both surface-initiated ROP and NMRP polymerizations were carried out in the presence of a free initiator. The polymer brushes were cleaved from silica particles using hydrofluoric acid, and the SEC analysis showed that the molecular weights of the grafted polymers were close to those of the free polymers formed from the free initiators. The overall grafting density of mixed PCL/PS brushes can be tuned from 1.24 to 0.40 chains per nm² by varying the mass ratio of Y-initiator-terminated triethoxysilane to bare silica particles in the initiator immobilization step, though the grafting density of PS was always higher than that of PCL.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3ahydrofluoric acid 3alactones 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3asilica 3astyrene 3atin1 aBao, Chunhui1 aWright, Roger A.

We now demonstrate that the breakdown of PFKFB3 during S phase occurs specifically via a distinct residue (S273) within the conserved recognition site for SCF-Î²-TrCP. Glutaminase 1 (GLS1), the first enzyme in glutaminolysis, is also targeted for destruction by APC/C-Cdh1 and, like PFKFB3, accumulates after the activity of this ubiquitin ligase decreases in mid-to-late G1. However, our results show that GLS1 differs from PFKFB3 in that its recognition by APC/C-Cdh1 requires the presence of both a Lys-Glu-Asn box (KEN box) and a destruction box (D box) rather than a KEN box alone. Furthermore, GLS1 is not a substrate for SCF-Î²-TrCP and is not degraded until cells progress from S to G2/M. The presence of PFKFB3 and GLS1 coincides with increases in generation of lactate and in utilization of glutamine, respectively. The contrasting posttranslational regulation of PFKFB3 and GLS1, which we have verified by studies of ubiquitination and protein stability, suggests the different roles of glucose and glutamine at distinct stages in the cell cycle. Indeed, experiments in which synchronized cells were deprived of either of these substrates show that both glucose and glutamine are required for progression through the restriction point in mid-to-late G1, whereas glutamine is the only substrate essential for the progression through S phase into cell division.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell division 3acell proliferation 3aglucose 3aglutaminase 3aglutamine 3ainterphase 3aligases1 aPalacios-Callender, Miriam1 aFrakich, Nanci1 aCarcamo, Saul1 aKovács, István,1 aTudzarova, Slavica1 aMoncada, Salvador0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Dec. 27, v. 108, no. 52 p.21069-21074dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11175001083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009500170300001600265520186300281592002802144650001102172650002502183650002202208650002502230650001502255650001502270650001302285650001402298650001402312650001802326650001202344650001702356653002302373653002202396653001502418653002702433700002302460700002502483773009902508856008502607852000902692655001202701IND60086812920221119222237.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008681292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOvereem, Irina10aStrategies for integrated modeling: The community surface dynamics modeling system example  ap. 314-321.  aThe Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) is a community of earth scientists promoting the modeling of earth surface processes by developing and disseminating integrated software modules that predict the movement of fluids, and the flux of sediment and nutrients in landscapes and their sedimentary basins. Members of CSDMS are largely from academic institutions (∼75%), followed by federal agencies (∼17%), and oil and gas companies (∼5%). As an organization that relies on volunteer participation, CSDMS faces unique challenges to scientific collaboration. Encouraging volunteerism among its members to provide and adapt metadata and model code to be sufficiently standardized for coupling is crucial to building an integrated community modeling system. CSDMS must provide the appropriate technical tools and cyberinfrastructure to support a variety of user types, ranging from advanced to novice modelers. In addition, application of these advances in science is key, both into the educational realm and for managers and decision-makers. We here present data on community contributions and novice user engagement and evaluate the effectiveness of CSDMS’ strategies toward these two challenges over the first 5 years based on member and user data, surveys, computing logs and web log analysis. Analysis shows that sponsored member participation in annual meetings (∼30%) is relatively high. Direct CSDMS governance relies on ∼4% of members. About 15% of members contributed code and metadata, and a similar 15% use the common supercomputing resources. Technological development and documentation lie predominantly in hands of the funded members, and a small number of others (∼3% together). Potential new users are trained in clinics and courses, with positive effects on self-efficacy and recruitment of new advanced developers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abusiness enterprises 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3agovernance 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3anutrients 3asediments 3aself-efficacy 3asurveys 3avolunteerism 0aCommunity modeling 0aModel integration 0aGovernance 0aEarth surface dynamics1 aBerlin, Maureen M.1 aSyvitski, James P.M.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2013 Jan., v. 39 p.314-321dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245013600210300001200346500001500358506007600373520160100449592002802050506003702078650002702115650001502142650002002157650002302177650002202200650001102222650002302233650001902256650001702275650001102292650002202303650002102325650002302346650001102369653001402380700003002394700002602424700002602450700002502476773011202501856008202613852000902695655001202704IND60548558720221207143621.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054855872DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1482-92doi7 aPMC48488472pmcid7 a271215022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavan, Márcio G.10aRhodnius prolixus and R. robustus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) nymphs show different locomotor patterns on an automated recording system  ap. 239.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Circadian rhythms of triatomines, vectors of the etiological agent Trypanosoma cruzi responsible for Chagas disease, have been extensively studied in adults of the two most epidemiologically relevant vector species, Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma infestans. However, little attention has been dedicated to the activity patterns in earlier developmental stages, even though triatomine nymphs are equally capable of transmitting T. cruzi to humans. Because circadian rhythms may differ even between closely related species, studies that focus on this behavioral trait can also be used to shed light on the taxonomy of controversial taxa, which becomes especially relevant regarding vector species. METHODS: We compared the daily locomotor activity patterns of second- and third-instar nymphs of Rhodnius prolixus and Rhodnius robustus in order to unveil possible behavioral differences between these cryptic species. Mitochondrial and nuclear markers were sequenced to confirm species identification. RESULTS: Nymphs of both species had a bimodal pattern of locomotion and similar daily activity patterns, but R. prolixus is more active under light/dark cycles and depicts a more pronounced activity rhythm under constant darkness conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the implementation of an often-used automated method for the recording of individual locomotor activity to differentiate sibling species of Rhodnius with distinct epidemiological relevance. The higher levels of activity observed in the nymphs of R. prolixus could potentially contribute to increased vector capacity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aspecies identification 3alocomotion 3asibling species 3aetiological agents 3aRhodnius prolixus 3ahumans 3aTriatoma infestans 3aChagas disease 3amitochondria 3anymphs 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3acircadian rhythm 3avectorial capacity 3aadults 0aHemiptera1 aCorrêa-Antônio, Jessica1 aPeixoto, Alexandre A.1 aMonteiro, Fernando A.1 aRivas, Gustavo B.

Sediment exposure (+clean food) resulted in increased Zn body burdens, increased mortality and decreased body mass when the molar concentrations of simultaneously extracted Zn were greater than the molar concentration of Acid Volatile Sulfide (SEMZₙ–AVS>0), suggesting that dissolved Zn was a dominant route of exposure. No adverse effect was noted in the foodexposure (+clean sediment), suggesting selective feeding or regulation. Combined exposure (sediment+food) significantly increased adverse effects in comparison with sediment exposure, indicating contribution of dietary Zn to toxicity and bioaccumulation. The observed enhanced toxicity also supports the assumption on the presence of an avoidance/selective feeding reaction of the amphipods in the single sediment or food exposures. During 14d post-exposure in clean medium, the organisms from the same combined exposure history received two feeding regimes, i.e. clean food and Zn spiked food. Elevated Zn bioaccumulation and reduced reproduction were noted in amphipods that were offered Zn spiked food compared to the respective organisms that were fed clean food. This was explained by the failure of avoidance/selective feeding behavior in the absence of an alternative food source (sediment), forcing the amphipods to take up Zn while feeding. Increasing Zn body burdens rejected the assumption that Zn uptake from food was regulated by H. azteca. Our results show that the selective feeding behavior should be accounted for when assessing ecological effects of Zn or other contaminants, especially when contaminated food is a potential exposure route.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzteca 3aHyalella azteca 3aadverse effects 3abioaccumulation 3acleaning 3aexposure pathways 3afeeding behavior 3afood contamination 3afoods 3amortality 3areproduction 3asediments 3asulfides 3atoxicity 2aAmphipoda 2aAnimals 2aBody Burden 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effects 2aFood 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aToxicity Testsxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aZincxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxtoxicity.1 aMuyssen, Brita T.A.1 aJanssen, Colin R.0 tChemosphere.g2012 Mar., v. 87, no. 1 p.84-90dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.11.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245013100161300001300292520144300305592002801748650002701776650001501803650001101818650001301829650001101842650001101853650001701864650001001881650001501891650001201906650000901918650000901927650001401936650001101950650001101961650001401972650000901986651001701995653001802012653001102030653001702041653001402058653001802072700002202090700002402112773015002136856007202286852000902358655001202367IND60597616720221118053715.0180625e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059761672DNAL7 a10.2317/151230.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaha, EL-Kazafy A.10aHoney Bees, Bee-collected Pollen and Honey as Monitors of Environmental Pollution at an Industrial Cement Area in Saudi Arabia  ap. 1-10.  aThe present study was conducted in a cement production area in Al-Ahsa Province, in eastern Saudi Arabia. The study aimed to investigate the intensity of heavy metal contents at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 km from the cement factory by determining, quantifying and measuring certain heavy metal contents in honey, bee collected-pollen and forager bee samples from the hybrid Carniolan honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica Pollmann colonies. Values of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) in honey, bee pollen and forager bees were variable and significantly dependent on the distance from the cement factory. The largest values of tested heavy metals were obtained from samples collected from the 1ˢᵗ location (3 km), except for Cu in honey, and Cu and Ni in forager bees collected from the 2ⁿᵈ location (6 km). In addition, these values were variable and significantly dependent on the type of product. The largest values of Mn, Zn and Cu were obtained from forager bees, while the maximum values of Fe and Ni were found in bee-pollen. On the other hand, harmful elements including lead (Pb), cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) were not detected in any of the samples. From results obtained in this study, it can be concluded that heavy metal pollution was most intense in zones closest to the cement-industry area. Finally, honey bees and their products can be used as an indicator of environmental pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera carnica 3abee pollen 3acement 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3ahybrids 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3apollen 3apollution 3azinc 3aSaudi Arabia 0aBioindicators 0acement 0aheavy metals 0ahoney bee 0ahive products1 aAl-Jabr, Ahmed M.1 aAl-Kahtani, Saad N.0 tJournal of the Kansas Entomological Society.g2017 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.1-10dThe Kansas Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44728x0022-85677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2317/151230.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002900150245008700179300001800266500001500284520115900299592002801458650001301486650001501499650001601514650001401530650001901544650001701563650002301580650001901603650001901622650002301641653001101664700002101675700003001696773009101726856008601817852000901903655001201912IND4465308620221118075555.0141111e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446530862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomínguez-Perles, Raúl10aAnalysis of the tumoral cytotoxicity of green tea-infusions enriched with broccoli  ap. 1197-1206.  a2019-12-06  aBroccoli has risen as rich in bioactive phytochemicals (glucosinolates and phenolic compounds) closely linked with the reduction of cancer risk. Green tea infusion is a beverage that also contains anticarcinogenic compounds, mainly represented by flavanols. The compounds present in new broccoli-enriched green tea drinks and their potential antitumoral activity in vitro were evaluated. The distinct compounds present in the prepared beverages were identified by HPLC–PAD–ESI-MSn and quantified by HPLC–PAD. Caco-2 and CCD-18Co cell lines were exposed to growing percentages (0.2–5%) of infusions of distinct combinations of plant material. The time-dependent cytotoxicity on the malignant cells was also achieved. Cell death was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and a more efficient specific cytotoxic effect on Caco-2 cells was observed on the cells incubated with the mixture of broccoli and green tea than on cells exposed to control infusions. Broccoli added to green tea resulted in a combination of phytochemicals with antitumoral activity with potential for further developments in mechanistic models and the design of novel foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroccoli 3acell death 3anovel foods 3agreen tea 3aphytochemicals 3acytotoxicity 3amechanistic models 3atea (beverage) 3arisk reduction 3aphenolic compounds 0aplants1 aMoreno, Diego A.1 aGarcía-Viguera, Cristina0 tFood chemistry.g2012 June 1, v. 132, no. 3 p.1197-1206dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009600170300001600266520153700282592002801819596001901847650001201866650001401878650002401892650003801916650001201954650001001966650001101976650002101987650002202008650001202030650002602042650000902068650001302077651001002090653001602100653002002116653001002136653001802146653001202164700002602176700001802202700002302220700003102243700001702274773012502291856008502416852000902501655001202510IND60687488320221120120728.0200331e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068748832DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2020.17119702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaju, Nagaraju10aGluten contamination in labelled and naturally gluten-free grain products in southern India  ap. 531-538.  aConsumption of a gluten-free diet or avoiding exposure to gluten is the only feasible and effective treatment available for coeliac patients to date. Although many grains and their products are naturally gluten-free, the possibility of gluten cross-contamination must be considered. Since such data are not available for Indian markets, we carried out this pilot study (n = 160) to assess gluten contamination in various grain-based food products from the category of breakfast products, flours, and batters made from grain that are naturally gluten free. The gluten was extracted from samples using 60% ethanol and gluten analysis was carried out using a commercially available competitive ELISA, which utilises a monoclonal antibody. Nearly 9.8% of the products labelled as gluten-free and 36.7% of the products made from naturally gluten-free grain were found to contain gluten above 20 mg/kg. Among products made from naturally gluten-free grain, 35.9% of the flour samples and 85% of the oat samples (11.67–1830 mg/kg) were contaminated with gluten. In the case of flours, unbranded samples collected from local markets (70%) and directly from local mills (30%) showed gluten content above Codex safety levels (20–400 mg/kg). Among products labelled as gluten free (n = 51), only 5 samples showed gluten contamination above 20 mg/kg although levels were well within 100 mg/kg (32.5 ± 5.8). Our study suggests that there is a likelihood of gluten contamination in products that are sourced from local retailers and millers.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcIntramural 3abatters 3abreakfast 3across contamination 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aethanol 3aflour 3agluten 3agluten-free diet 3agluten-free foods 3amarkets 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aoats 3apatients 3aIndia 0aGluten free 0acoeliac disease 0aELISA 0amilling flour 0acereals1 aJoshi, Apurva Kumar R1 aVahini, Raidu1 aDeepika, Thappatla1 aBhaskarachari, Kandlakunta1 aDevindra, S.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 37, no. 4 p.531-538dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2020.17119703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245014900170300001600319520151900335592002801854650001101882650001701893650001301910650001201923653002801935653002701963653002901990653002402019700002002043700002102063700002202084700002402106773019902130856008402329852000902413655001202422IND60718625120220517000000.0220517e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071862512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2020.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelattre, Thomas10aLorsque le dépistage nutritionnel est confié au patient : une étude prospective observationnelle au sein d’un hôpital universitaire belge  ap. 301-306.  aUndernutrition is a major problem when you have to take in charge a patient. Nutritional screening, essential prerequisite, is insufficiently done for various reasons: lack of time, lack of human resources… A prospective observational monocentric study has been conducted during nine weeks to validate the hypothesis that it was possible to empower the patient by asking him/her to provide the information needed to establish a nutritional diagnosis within 48hours of admission. On admission, the patient completed a document containing the nutritional data needed to establish the nutritional diagnosis. Then, the same survey was conducted by the dietician of the investigative team who made the nutritional diagnosis based on both the elements shared by the patient (patient's diagnosis) and the ones of his own data (dietician's diagnosis). The correlation between these two diagnosis has been analyzed by Cohen's kappa and the quadratic kappa. 281 patients filled in the document; 167 documents were compared to the one made by the dietician. Based on the patients’ forms, a diagnosis was possible for 158 out of 167 questionnaires. The Cohen's kappa and quadratic kappa were respectively of 0,74 and 0,84. As far as the timing of the screening is concerned, 162 of these 167 patients submitted their questionnaires within 48hours of the admission. This study validates the hypothesis of making the patient the main actor of a qualitative nutritional screening and available within 48hours of admission.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3amalnutrition 3apatients 3asurveys 0aDépistage dénutrition 0aAutonomisation patient 0aUndernutrition screening 0aPatient empowerment1 aMichel, Céline1 aNoël, Dominique1 aVanesse, Virginie1 aLacrosse, Dominique0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2020 Dec., v. 34, no. 4 p.301-306dElsevier Masson SASaSociété francophone nutrition clinique et métabolisme (SFNCM)wJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2020.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010200169300001400271520126500285592002801550650001301578650001901591650002201610650002101632650001401653650002501667650001401692650001201706650002001718650002601738650003501764650002201799650001901821653002801840653001501868653003401883653002701917653000801944653002801952700001701980700001301997700001902010700001702029700001602046700001402062700001502076700001502091700001602106700001602122700001502138700001302153700001302166700001702179700002202196700001502218773009702233856008502330852000902415655001202424IND60086813120221119222302.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008681312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergez, J.-E.13aAn open platform to build, evaluate and simulate integrated models of farming and agro-ecosystems  ap. 39-49.  aDue to significant changes in agro-ecological contexts, farmers need new solutions to produce goods. Modelling complements field experiments in the design of new farming systems. French researchers involved in such design issues developed a specific modelling platform to help model, simulate and evaluate cropping systems. After testing several existing environments, the RECORD platform was developed under the VLE environment, allowing the design of atomic and coupled models. It integrates different time steps and spatial scales and proposes some standard formalisms used to model agro-ecosystems (e.g. difference equations, differential equations, state charts…). A graphic user interface was designed to simplify coding tasks. A variety of research projects already use this platform. Examples are given showing the ability to recode simple models, encapsulate more complex models, link with GIS and databases, and use the R statistical package to run models and analyse simulation outputs. The option to use web interfaces enables application by non-scientist end-users. As the models follow a given standard, they can be placed in a repository and used by other researchers. Linking RECORD to other international platforms is now a compelling issue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagroecosystems 3acomputer software 3acropping systems 3adatabases 3aenvironmental models 3aequations 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afield experimentation 3ageographic information systems 3aresearch projects 3auser interface 0aAgro-ecological systems 0aSimulation 0aIntegrated modelling platform 0aCropping system design 0aVLE 0aSimulation-based design1 aChabrier, P.1 aGary, C.1 aJeuffroy, M.H.1 aMakowski, D.1 aQuesnel, G.1 aRamat, E.1 aRaynal, H.1 aRousse, N.1 aWallach, D.1 aDebaeke, P.1 aDurand, P.1 aDuru, M.1 aDury, J.1 aFaverdin, P.1 aGascuel-Odoux, C.1 aGarcia, F.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2013 Jan., v. 39 p.39-49dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01762naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245010300166300002000269520074200289592002801031650001501059650001901074650002001093650001101113650001301124650003701137650001301174650002201187700002001209773012401229856007401353852000901427655001201436IND60664995820221118040232.0190912e20140616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066499582DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra02435d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrakash Rao, H.

Solvatochromic studies revealed that solvent polarity did not have a noticeable effect on the absorption or the emission spectra. While benzofuran annulation enhanced the quantum yield in most of the solvents, appending a methyl group, in fact, reduced the quantum yield.

In Europe, the domestic dog is apparently the main definitive host, but patent infections occur also in other species of carnivores. The rapid spread of the golden jackals (Canis aureus) throughout Europe opens a question of involvement of this species in the sylvatic cycle of pathogens in the colonised territories, including Dirofilaria spp. METHODS: Between January 2014 and May 2015, 54 golden jackals from 18 localities in Romania were examined by full necropsy for the presence of adult filarioid nematodes and blood samples from all animals were screened for the presence of microfilariae of D. immitis, D. repens and Acanthocheilonema reconditum by multiplex PCR DNA amplification. RESULTS: Nematodes morphologically identified as D. immitis were found in 18.52 % of the animals, originating from the southern part of Romania. No D. repens or A. reconditum were found at necropsy. The molecular prevalence in blood samples from the same animals was 9.26 % for D. immitis and 1.85 % for D. repens. All samples were negative by PCR for A. reconditum. CONCLUSION: The relatively high prevalence of Dirofilaria spp. infections in golden jackals from Romania together with the increasing density of the jackal populations highlight their potential role in the transmission of these zoonotic parasites and in the maintenance of natural disease foci.  aPublisher supplied data  aTE299/2015cUEFISCDI0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcanthocheilonema 3aCanis aureus 3aDNA 3aDirofilaria immitis 3aDirofilaria repens 3aadults 3ablood sampling 3acarnivores 3adefinitive hosts 3adogs 3aheartworms 3ajackals 3amicrofilariae 3anecropsy 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3askin lesions 3aRomania1 aMatei, Ioana Adriana1 aD’Amico, Gianluca1 aDaskalaki, Aikaterini Alexandra1 aJuránková, Jana1 aIonescu, Dan Traian1 aMihalca, Andrei Daniel1 aModrý, David,1 aGherman, Călin Mircea0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.240-240dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1524-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245011100181300001400292520087200306592002801178650001601206650001201222650002101234650002201255650001301277650001601290650001901306650001601325653002401341653002101365653001501386653001901401653001801420700003601438700004101474700003501515700002701550773010001577856008501677852000901762655001201771IND60564028520221116211757.0190403e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056402852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.beproc.2017.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoura, Clarissa de Almeida10aTime place learning and activity profile under constant light and constant dark in zebrafish (Danio rerio)  ap. 49-57.  aThe ability to learn about the signs of variability in space and time is known as time place learning (TPL). To adjust their circadian rhythms, animals use stimuli that change regularly, such as the light-dark cycle, temperature, food availability or even social stimuli. Because light-dark cycle is the most important environmental temporal cue, we asked how a diurnal animal would perform TPL if this cue was removed. Zebrafish has been extensively studied in the chronobiology area due to it diurnal chronotype, thus, we studied the effects of constant light and constant dark on the time-place learning and activity profile in zebrafish. Our data show that while under constant light and dark condition zebrafish was not able of TPL, after 30days under the constant conditions, constant light led to higher activity level and less significant (robust) 24h rhythm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aanimals 3acircadian rhythm 3afood availability 3alearning 3aphotoperiod 3aspace and time 3atemperature 0aTime-place learning 0aCircadian rythym 0aChronotype 0aConstant light 0aConstant dark1 aLima, Jéssica Polyana da Silva1 aSilveira, Vanessa Augusta Magalhães1 aMiguel, Mário André Leocadio1 aLuchiari, Ana Carolina0 tBehavioural processes.g2017 May, v. 138 p.49-57dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2017.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04039naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016200172520244300334592002802777650004102805650001402846650001102860650001202871650001902883650001902902650001302921650002302934650001502957650001002972650001502982650001302997650002403010650001503034650001103049650001003060650002503070650001503095651001303110651001503123653001903138653001203157653000903169653001403178653000903192653002003201653001903221700002103240700002403261773010503285856008603390852000903476655001203485IND60723302520221118051652.0210423e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072330252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1259742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGetachew, Birhan10aModeling projected impacts of climate and land use/land cover changes on hydrological responses in the Lake Tana Basin, upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia  aThis study is being conducted in Lake Tana Basin, Upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. This work focuses on the assessment of the separate and combined impacts on water balance components of both climate and LULC change. For calibration, validation and uncertainty analysis, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used in conjunction with the IPEAT (Integrated Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Analysis Tool) package. To produce high resolution future climate data from CanESM2 GCM that could be used for impact assessment, the Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM) was used while the future LULC prediction was generated using Cellular Automata-Markov Chain model. The hydrological response of the basin was assessed by dividing the future time periods in to 2020s (2011–2040), 2050s (2041–2070), and 2080s (2071–2100) through incorporating three scenarios, such as LULC change alone, climate change alone and combined climate and LULC change. The prediction of the LULC change using the CA-Markov chain model indicates that cropland, tree cover, and built-up areas are likely to increase by 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s at the expense of grassland and shrub cover areas, leading to an increase in evapotranspiration, baseflow and streamflow conditions in the basin. By considering basin average, the climate prediction result suggests an increase in both Tmax (up to 2.14 °C) and Tmin (up to 3.2 °C) temperatures, whereas precipitation would increase by up to 25% in the basin. The results show an increase of evapotranspiration by up to 0.84%, 59.8% and 55.5% under LULC, climate and combined climate and LULC change by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline period, respectively. Furthermore, both stream-flow and lateral flow are projected to increase by up to 12.85% (9.9%), 28.5% (20.03%) and 26.4% (29.12%) under LULC, climate and combined climate and LULC change scenarios, respectively. As predicted, the shift in magnitude in RCP8.5 emissions is greater than RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. The impacts of climate change on water balances are relatively higher than the combined effects of changes in climate and LULC. Future LULC shifts, on the other hand, change comparatively offsetting hydrological components. In order to devise local-scale adaptation and mitigation strategies, the inclusion of predicted climate and LULC change for hydrological impact studies, is therefore, very useful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3abase flow 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acropland 3aevapotranspiration 3agrasslands 3alakes 3aland cover 3aland use 3ameteorological data 3aprediction 3ashrubs 3atrees 3auncertainty analysis 3awatersheds 3aEthiopia 3aNile River 0aLakeTana basin 0aCanESM2 0aSWAT 0aHydrology 0aLULC 0aCA-Markov chain 0aClimate change1 aManjunatha, B.R.1 aBhat, H.

Statistical forecast models are developed through generalised linear model (GLM) and generalised additive model (GAM) for tropical cyclone trajectories over the NIO using atmospheric climate variables as predictors. TC from the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre and sets of climate predictor data were analysed for a period of 35-year (1979–2013). The velocity field is predicted by fitting GAM in each month and season. Hindcast validation method is applied to assess the reliability of the model. The skill of the GAM model is compared with GLM and found to be more successful in forecasting TC movement over the NIO region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3ahurricanes 3alinear models 3aprediction 3atyphoons 3aIndian Ocean 0aCyclone movement 0aAtmospheric climate variables 0aGeneralised additive model 0aGeneralised linear model 0aNorth Indian Ocean1 aYeasmin, Alea1 aLuo, Jing-Jia0 tAtmospheric research.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 245 p.105089-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.1050893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005100147245014000198520137100338592002801709650001801737650001401755650001201769650001101781650001501792650001601807650000901823650001101832650001701843650002201860650000901882653001601891653002101907653002101928653002001949653001801969653000801987653001201995653001002007653001002017653000902027653001902036653001302055653000802068653000802076653000802084653000902092653001102101700001902112700001702131700001502148700001702163700001502180700001602195700005202211700001902263773012502282856008102407852000902488655001202497IND60752417920221118232749.0220222e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075241792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1125572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9466-265910aEffects of divalent cations on the physical, conformational and immunological properties of bovine allergen β-lactoglobulin aggregates  aβ-lactoglobulin is a major allergen in whey and always forms aggregates under different conditions. In our study, four kinds of divalent cations (Cu²⁺, Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺ and Ca²⁺) were used to induce the aggregation of β-lactoglobulin. The molecular interactions and characteristics, thermal stability and conformational structure of aggregates were monitored by silver staining, RP-HPLC, differential scanning calorimetry and spectroscopic methods, respectively. The immunological properties of Cu²⁺-induced β-lactoglobulin aggregates and dimers were evaluated in a Balb/c mouse model. The results showed that Cu²⁺ promoted the highest β-lactoglobulin dimer levels compared with other metal ions. The thermal stability of aggregates induced by the four ions was more stable than that of native protein. The specific molecular interaction of aggregates induced by Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺ and Ca²⁺ was disulfide bonding, while Cu²⁺-induced β-lactoglobulin aggregates were connected by disulfide bonds combined with other bonds. Specially, Cu²⁺-induced dimer showed decreased allergenicity and a shift from the Th2 response to the Th1 response that balances homeostasis compared with native BLG and Cu²⁺-induced aggregates. The results may provide a possible method to alleviate the allergenicity of bovine β-lactoglobulin by forming more dimers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3acalcium 3acattle 3adisulfides 3ahomeostasis 3amice 3asilver 3aspectroscopy 3athermal stability 3awhey 0aAggregation 0aβ-lactoglobulin 0aDivalent cations 0aCharacteristics 0aAllergenicity 0aBLG 0a(BLG-W) 0aBLG-A 0aBLG-D 0aUSDA 0aUSDA DRI table 0aSDS-PAGE 0aANS 0aHRP 0aDSC 0aFTIR 0amMCP-11 aFei, Shuangwen1 aXie, Xiuling1 aTong, Ping1 aYuan, Juanli1 aWu, Zhihua1 aYang, Anshu1 aWu, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9840-940X1 aChen, Hongbing0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 154 p.112557-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1125573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014000169520210200309592002802411650001502439650001902454650001202473650000902485650000902494651001002503653001202513653004302525653006002568653002302628653001002651700001702661700001802678700001902696773010502715856008702820852000902907655001202916IND60699709120221122110158.0201104e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069970912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.1051122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Guirong10aProjections of future meteorological drought events under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of CMIP5 over Kenya, East Africa  aUnderstanding future evolution of drought scenario across localized domains remains an imperative process in bid to adapt tailor suit innovative solutions to drought risks and their impacts. The present study examines drought events by characterizing the trend, intensity, severity and frequency based on Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), over Kenya, East Africa for near future (2010–2039), mid-century (2040–2069), and late century (2070–2100). The study utilizes Multi-model mean ensemble (MME) of five selected regional climate models (RCMs). Further, the models are bias corrected based on a quantile mapping bias corrected algorithm in order to minimize possible bias for accurate projections. The changes in annual and seasonal precipitation over Kenya is examined in order to associate with changes in drought occurrence. Results demonstrate positive shift, indicating an increase in projected rainfall change during all the three timescales. Projections of possible future meteorological drought events under RCPs scenario over study locale was conducted using SPI. The results demonstrate relatively better performance of biased corrected MME derived from Rossby Centre regional climate model (RCA4) in simulating drought indices over the Kenya. The MME projections for drought duration show an increase in moderate drought incidences with fewer incidences of extreme events across the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios respectively. However, the duration of occurrences varies from one region to another with most hotspots located around northeastern sides of the country. Examination of projected changes in drought frequency and severity depict an occurrence of severe to extreme drought incidences that are expected to intensify during the near future time slice while overall projections show that more wet scenarios is depicted, with fewer cases of drought expected to occur during mid and towards end of the century of projection period. The study calls for enactment of appropriate mitigation measures to cope with possible scenarios of drought risks over Kenya in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclimate models 3adrought 3arain 3arisk 3aKenya 0aDrought 0aStandardized precipitation index (SPI) 0aRossby centre atmospheric regional climate model (RCA4) 0aFuture projections 0aKenya1 aAyugi, Brian1 aNgoma, Hamida1 aOngoma, Victor0 tAtmospheric research.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 246 p.105112-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.1051123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245017800174300001200352520197400364592002802338596007402366596003002440650001602470650001202486650001502498650001202513650001502525650003602540650001302576650002402589650002202613650003902635650002302674650001702697650003702714700002302751700002602774700001902800700003302819700002002852700002602872700002602898700006402924773014702988856008303135852000903218655001203227IND60785773220221118114849.0220824e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078577322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-022-04467-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDos Santos, Altair B.10aSleep-controlling neurons are sensitive and vulnerable to multiple forms of α-synuclein: implications for the early appearance of sleeping disorders in α-synucleinopathies  ap. 450.  aParkinson’s disease, Multiple System Atrophy, and Lewy Body Dementia are incurable diseases called α-synucleinopathies as they are mechanistically linked to the protein, α-synuclein (α-syn). α-syn exists in different structural forms which have been linked to clinical disease distinctions. However, sleeping disorders (SDs) are common in the prodromal phase of all three α-synucleinopathies, which suggests that sleep-controlling neurons are affected by multiple forms of α-syn. To determine whether a structure-independent neuronal impact of α-syn exists, we compared and contrasted the cellular effect of three different α-syn forms on neurotransmitter-defined cells of two sleep-controlling nuclei located in the brainstem: the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. We utilized size exclusion chromatography, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to precisely characterize ​​timepoints in the α-syn aggregation process with three different dominating forms of this protein (monomeric, oligomeric and fibril) and we conducted an in-depth investigation of the underlying neuronal mechanism behind cellular effects of the different forms of the protein using electrophysiology, multiple-cell calcium imaging, single-cell calcium imaging and live-location tracking with fluorescently-tagged α-syn. Interestingly, α-syn altered membrane currents, enhanced firing, increased intracellular calcium and facilitated cell death in a structure-independent manner in sleep-controlling nuclei, and postsynaptic actions involved a G-protein-mediated mechanism. These data are novel as the sleep-controlling nuclei are the first brain regions reported to be affected by α-syn in this structure-independent manner. These regions may represent highly important targets for future neuroprotective therapy to modify or delay disease progression in α-synucleinopathies.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a2015-2666cLundbeckfonden 3aLewy bodies 3aatrophy 3abrain stem 3acalcium 3acell death 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adementia 3adisease progression 3aelectrophysiology 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agel chromatography 3atherapeutics 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSkaanning, Line K.1 aThaneshwaran, Siganya1 aMikkelsen, Eyd1 aRomero-Leguizamón, Cesar R.1 aSkamris, Thomas1 aKristensen, Morten P.1 aLangkilde, Annette E.1 aKohlmeier, Kristi A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0183-38160 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2022 Aug., v. 79, no. 8 p.450-450dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04467-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245008800165520138200253592002801635650001501663650003001678650002501708650000901733650002601742650002501768650001701793650002701810650002301837650001801860650001701878650003001895650001501925650002101940650001801961700002201979700002402001700002502025700002602050700003502076700001902111700002002130700001902150700002902169700002602198700002002224700001902244773012102263856007502384852000902459655001202468IND60751428220221120163901.0210925e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075142822DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110926042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrisi, Paolo Emidio14aThe Fatty Acid-Based Erythrocyte Membrane Lipidome in Dogs with Chronic Enteropathy  aCanine chronic enteropathies (CEs) are inflammatory processes resulting from complex interplay between the mucosal immune system, intestinal microbiome, and dietary components in susceptible dogs. Fatty acids (FAs) play important roles in the regulation of physiologic and metabolic pathways and their role in inflammation seems to be dual, as they exhibit pro–inflammatory and anti–inflammatory functions. Analysis of red blood cell (RBC) membrane fatty acid profile represents a tool for assessing the quantity and quality of structural and functional molecular components. This study was aimed at comparing the FA membrane profile, determined by Gas Chromatography and relevant lipid parameter of 48 CE dogs compared with 68 healthy dogs. In CE patients, the levels of stearic (p < 0.0001), dihomo–gamma–linolenic, eicosapentaenoic (p = 0.02), and docosahexaenoic (p = 0.02) acids were significantly higher, and those of palmitic (p < 0.0001) and linoleic (p = 0.0006) acids were significantly lower. Non-responder dogs presented higher percentages of vaccenic acid (p = 0.007), compared to those of dogs that responded to diagnostic trials. These results suggest that lipidomic status may reflect the “gut health”, and the non–invasive analysis of RBC membrane might have the potential to become a candidate biomarker in the evaluation of dogs affected by CE.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adigestive system diseases 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3adogs 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aerythrocyte membrane 3aerythrocytes 3afatty acid composition 3agas chromatography 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipidomics 3amucosal immunity 3avaccenic acid1 aLuciani, Alessia 1 aDi Tommaso, Morena 1 aPrasinou, Paraskevi 1 aDe Santis, Francesca 1 aChatgilialoglu, Chryssostomos 1 aPietra, Marco 1 aProcoli, Fabio 1 aSansone, Anna 1 aGiordano, Maria Veronica1 aGramenzi, Alessandro 1 aFerreri, Carla 1 aBoari, Andrea 0 tAnimals.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110926043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245006500216520119200281592002801473650002201501650002801523650001401551650002101565650001801586650001401604650002101618650001401639650002001653650001101673651002301684653000801707653001001715653000701725653000701732653000701739653000701746653000601753653000801759653000701767653000701774653000801781653000701789653000801796653000601804653000701810653000801817653000701825653000701832653000701839653002201846653001801868653002401886653001601910653001401926700002401940700005701964773012602021856008302147852000902230655001202239IND60742291820221122145505.0220606e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074229182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1040532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHlanga, Nokuthula Cherry1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0040-570510aEvaluating nutritional content among Bambara groundnut lines  aBambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc) has the potential to address food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a lack of cultivars with improved nutritional quality hinders its potential. This study evaluated nutritional content in the grain of 19 Bambara groundnut lines. The nutritional content of the lines varied significantly (p < 0.05) with lines Mix, Tiganecuru, and Pong-Br-UNK exhibiting the highest means for starch protein and fat contents, respectively. The first principal component (PC) accounted for 21.9 % of the variation and was strongly correlated with K (which contributed 20.1 %), ash (19.5 %), NDF (16.4 %) and ADF (14.8 %). The second PC explained 16.1 % of the variation and was significantly correlated to magnesium (19.7 %), starch (17.3 %) and protein (10.7 %). This is essential to select superior lines for developing Bambara groundnut breeding populations for improving nutrition in SSA. The negative correlations between some of the nutrient such as NDF and ash, NDF and K, and Mg and Mn would be a challenge for simultaneous selection to breed nutritious Bambara groundnut lines. Further, analyses of anti-nutrient chemicals is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna subterranea 3aantinutritional factors 3acultivars 3afood composition 3afood security 3amagnesium 3anutrient content 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3astarch 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aADF 0aANOVA 0aCa 0aCu 0aCV 0aFe 0aK 0aLSD 0aMg 0aMn 0aNDF 0aPC 0aKZN 0aP 0aNa 0aSSA 0aSE 0aUK 0aZn 0aBambara groundnut 0aFood security 0aNutritional content 0aUtilization 0aVariation1 aModi, A.

In this work, these interactions are comprehensively revealed via a “flow field analysis scheme” that combines theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. In this analysis, three operation regimes are proposed given the features of reacting flow: reaction dominated, mass transfer dominated, and axial flow dominated. Based on a detailed study of mass transfer mechanisms, including Taylor dispersion introduced to the gas channel, two dimensionless numbers are further proposed to quantify the transport-reaction interactions inside PEM fuel cells. The modified Damköhler number, defined as the ratio of the reaction rate constant and mass transfer coefficient, clarifies the relative dominance of the external mass transfer and reaction, and its critical value equals 5. Furthermore, a new dimensionless number, β, is defined as the ratio of the characteristic time of mass transfer and that of the axial flow in the gas channel. The combined effects of flow channel configuration and operating parameters affecting the transport-reaction are covered in β number with a threshold of 1. The incoordination of those effects causes starved or excessive flows that impair performance, while a positive and minor deviation from the β threshold is optimum. Adopting three classic flow channel layouts (i.e., parallel, serpentine, and pin-type) as case studies via numerical simulation, the theoretical analysis is further validated and quantified with specific values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aataxia (disorder) 3acase studies 3aenergy conversion 3aflow 3afuel cells 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3aserpentine 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cell 0aTransport phenomenon 0aReaction 0aFlow channel configuration 0aOperating condition 0aFlow channel design1 aWang, Penghui1 aChen, Xueli1 aWang, Fuchen1 aDai, Gance0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 220 p.113046-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1130463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245010300164520125200267592002801519650000801547650001301555650002001568650003101588650001601619650002001635650001201655650002101667650001201688650002101700650001801721650002001739700001701759700002101776700002501797700002101822700002001843773012101863856007501984852000902059655001202068IND60751428520221120205750.0210925e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075142852DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110926062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinpru, Panpradub 10aJejunal Transcriptomic Profiling for Differences in Feed Conversion Ratio in Slow-Growing Chickens  aImproving feed efficiency is an important breeding target for the poultry industry; to achieve this, it is necessary to understand the molecular basis of feed efficiency. We compared the jejunal transcriptomes of low- and high-feed conversion ratio (FCR) slow-growing Korat chickens (KRs). Using an original sample of 75 isolated 10-week-old KR males, we took jejunal samples from six individuals in two groups: those with extremely low FCR (n = 3; FCR = 1.93 ± 0.05) and those with extremely high FCR (n = 3; FCR = 3.29 ± 0.06). Jejunal transcriptome profiling via RNA sequencing revealed 56 genes that were differentially expressed (p < 0.01, FC > 2): 31 were upregulated, and 25 were downregulated, in the low-FCR group relative to the high-FCR group. Functional annotation revealed that these differentially expressed genes were enriched in biological processes related to immune response, glutathione metabolism, vitamin transport and metabolism, lipid metabolism, and neuronal and cardiac maturation, development, and growth, suggesting that these are important mechanisms governing jejunal feed conversion. These findings provide an important molecular basis for future breeding strategies to improve slow-growing chicken feed efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3achickens 3afeed conversion 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione 3aimmune response 3ajejunum 3alipid metabolism 3aneurons 3apoultry industry 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aRiou, Cindy 1 aKubota, Satoshi 1 aPoompramun, Chotima 1 aMolee, Wittawat 1 aMolee, Amonrat 0 tAnimals.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110926063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245010500160520151600265592002801781650002101809650001801830650002601848650002201874650002301896650001501919650001401934650001101948650001201959650001501971650001901986650002402005650001302029650001302042650001802055700002202073700002802095700003602123700002102159700003502180700001702215700002202232700002502254773012102279856007502400852000902475655001202484IND60751428620221120184115.0210925e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075142862DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110926072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarany, Andre 10aOsmoregulatory Plasticity of Juvenile Greater Amberjack (Seriola dumerili) to Environmental Salinity  aOsmotic costs in teleosts are highly variable, reaching up to 50% of energy expenditure in some. In several species, environmental salinities close to the isosmotic point (~15 psu) minimize energy demand for osmoregulation while enhancing growth. The present study aimed to characterize the physiological status related to osmoregulation in early juveniles of the greater amberjack, Seriola dumerili, acclimated to three salinities (15, 22, and 36 psu). Our results indicate that plasma metabolic substrates were enhanced at the lower salinities, whereas hepatic carbohydrate and energetic lipid substrates decreased. Moreover, osmoregulatory parameters, such as osmolality, muscle water content, gill and intestine Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase activities, suggested a great osmoregulatory capacity in this species. Remarkably, electrophysiological parameters, such as short-circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial electric resistance (TER), were enhanced significantly at the posterior intestine. Concomitantly, Isc and TER anterior-to-posterior intestine differences were intensified with increasing environmental salinity. Furthermore, the expression of several adeno-hypophyseal genes was assessed. Expression of prl showed an inverse linear relationship with increasing environmental salinity, while gh mRNA enhanced significantly in the 22 psu-acclimated groups. Overall, these results could explain the better growth observed in S. dumerili juveniles kept at salinities close to isosmotic rather than in seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSeriola dumerili 3acarbohydrates 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrophysiology 3aenergy expenditure 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3alipids 3amuscles 3aosmolality 3aosmoregulation 3aphysiological state 3asalinity 3aseawater 3awater content1 aGilannejad, Neda 1 aAlameda-López, María 1 aRodríguez-Velásquez, Liliana 1 aAstola, Antonio 1 aMartínez-Rodríguez, Gonzalo 1 aRoo, Javier 1 aMuñoz, Jose Luis1 aMancera, Juan Miguel0 tAnimals.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110926073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245018400164300001600348520188400364592002802248596007102276596009402347596006602441650002202507650001702529650001802546650001002564650001802574650001202592650001002604650001802614650001202632650001502644650001702659700005002676700001302726700001602739700001902755773011102774856008302885852000902968655001202977IND60755030120221122193918.0211029e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075503012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10126-021-10063-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yijing10aShell Biosynthesis and Pigmentation as Revealed by the Expression of Tyrosinase and Tyrosinase-like Protein Genes in Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) with Different Shell Colors  ap. 777-789.  aThe widely recognized color polymorphisms of molluscan shell have been appreciated for hundreds of years by collectors and scientists, while molecular mechanisms underlying shell pigmentation are still poorly understood. Tyrosinase is a key rate–limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of melanin. Here, we performed an extensive multi-omics data mining and identified two tyrosinase genes, including tyrosinase and tyrosinase-like protein 2 (Tyr and Typ-2 respectively), in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and investigated the expression patterns of tyrosinase during adults and embryogenesis in black and white shell color C. gigas. Tissue expression analysis showed that two tyrosinase genes were both specifically expressed in the mantle, and the expression levels of Tyr and Typ-2 in the edge mantle were significantly higher than that in the central mantle. Besides, Tyr and Typ-2 genes were black shell-specific compared with white shell oysters. In situ hybridization showed that strong signals for Tyr were detected in the inner surface of the outer fold, whereas positive signals for Typ-2 were mainly localized in the outer surface of the outer fold. In the embryos and larvae, the high expression of Tyr mRNA was detected in eyed-larvae, while Typ-2 mRNA was mainly expressed at the trochophore and early D-veliger. Furthermore, the tyrosinase activity in the edge mantle was significantly higher than that in the central mantle. These findings indicated that Tyr gene may be involved in shell pigmentation, and Typ-2 is more likely to play critical roles not only in the formation of shell prismatic layer but also in shell pigmentation. In particular, Typ-2 gene was likely to involve in the initial non-calcified shell of trochophores. The work provides valuable information for the molecular mechanism study of shell formation and pigmentation in C. gigas.  aPublisher supplied data  a31772843 and 3197278cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020LZGC016cEarmarked Fund for Agriculture Seed Improvement Project of Shandong Province  a20-3-4-16-nshcIndustrial Development Project of Qingdao City 3aCrassostrea gigas 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acolor 3aembryogenesis 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahybridization 3amelanin 3amultiomics 3apigmentation1 aLi, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3937-93241 aYu, Hong1 aLiu, Shikai1 aKong, Lingfeng0 tMarine biotechnology.g2021 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.777-789dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870069x1436-22287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-021-10063-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010900174300001600283520144100299592002801740650002001768650002501788650001101813650001701824653003401841653002401875653001001899653001101909653002101920700001401941700002001955700001901975700002301994700001902017700002402036700002602060700001902086773011202105856008502217852000902302655001202311IND60564029520221122043207.0180830e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056402952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolfus, Jonathan M.10aOxygen permeation and creep behavior of Ca1−xSrxTi0.6Fe0.15Mn0.25O3−δ (x=0, 0.5) membrane materials  ap. 172-178.  aOxygen permeation measurements were performed on dense symmetric samples of Ca0.5Sr0.5Ti0.6Fe0.15Mn0.25O3−δ and compared to CaTi0.6Fe0.15Mn0.25O3−δ in order to assess the influence of the perovskite lattice volume on oxygen permeation. Oxygen flux measurements were performed in the temperature range 700–1000°C and as function of feed side pO2 from 10⁻² to 1bar, and at high pressures up to 4bar with a pO2 of 3.36bar. The O2 permeability of the Sr-doped sample was significantly lower than that of the Sr-free sample, amounting to 3.9×10⁻³mLmin⁻¹ cm⁻¹ at 900°C for a feed side pO2 of 0.21bar. The O2 permeability of CaTi0.6Fe0.15Mn0.25O3−δ shows little variation with increased feed side pressures and reaches 1.5×10⁻²mLmin⁻¹cm⁻¹ at 900°C for a feed side pO2 of 3.36bar. This is approximately 1.5 times higher than the O2 permeability with a feed side pO2 of 0.21bar. Furthermore, in order to assess the applicability of CaTi0.6Fe0.15Mn0.25O3−δ as an oxygen membrane material, creep tests were performed under compressive loads of 30 and 63MPa, respectively, in air in the temperature range 700–1000°C; the results indicate a high creep resistance for this class of materials. The measured O2 permeabilities and creep rates are compared with other state-of-the-art membrane materials and their performance for relevant applications is discussed in terms of chemical and mechanical stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aartificial membranes 3aoxygen 3apermeability 0aDense ceramic oxygen membrane 0aAmbipolar transport 0aCreep 0aCaTiO3 0aCalcium titanate1 aXing, Wen1 aPećanac, Goran1 aFossdal, Anita1 aHanetho, Sidsel M.1 aLarring, Yngve1 aMalzbender, Jürgen1 aFontaine, Marie-Laure1 aBredesen, Rune0 tJournal of membrane science.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 499 p.172-178dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007400170520087300244592002801117650001701145650001401162650002001176650001201196650001501208650001301223650003401236650001401270653001801284653001101302653001001313700002001323700002401343700002001367700002201387773009801409856008201507852000901589655001201598IND60752418520221118232251.0211023e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075241852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1199842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkbarzadeh, Maryam10aCrosstalk between miRNA and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in cancer  aPhosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is one of the most important proliferative signaling pathways with critical undeniable function in various aspects of cancer initiation/progression, including proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. On the other hand, numerous genetic alterations in the key genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway have been identified in multiple solid and hematological tumors. In addition, accumulating recent evidences have demonstrated a reciprocal interaction between this signaling pathway and microRNAs, a large group of small non-coding RNAs.

The purpose of this study is to identify and assess domains (leisure, school, transport, home) and subdomains (e.g., recess, playgrounds, and urban green space) for week day moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) using objective measures and investigate gender and age differences. METHODS: Participants included 367 Danish children and adolescents (11–16 years, 52% girls) with combined accelerometer and Global Positioning System (GPS) data (mean 2.5 days, 12.7 hrs/day). The Personal Activity and Location Measurement System and a purpose-built database assessed data in 15-second epochs to determine PA and assign epochs to 4 domains and 11 subdomains. Frequencies and proportions of time spent in MVPA were determined and differences assessed using multi-level modeling. RESULTS: More than 90% of MVPA was objectively assigned to domains/subdomains. Boys accumulated more MVPA overall, in leisure, school and transport (all p < 0.05). Children compared with adolescents accumulated more MVPA, primarily through more school MVPA (p < 0.05). Boys spent a large proportion of time accumulating MVPA in playgrounds, active transport, Physical Education, sports facilities, urban green space and school grounds. Girls spent a significant proportion of time accumulating MVPA in active transport and playgrounds. No gender or age differences were found in the home domain. CONCLUSIONS: Large variations were found in PA frequency and intensity across domains/subdomains. Significant gender differences were found, with girls being less active in almost all domains and subdomains. Objectively measured patterns of PA across domains/subdomains can be used to better tailor PA interventions and inform future policies for promoting child PA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3aboys 3achildren 3adatabases 3aeducation 3agender differences 3agirls 3aglobal positioning systems 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3asports 2aAccelerometryxinstrumentation 2aAdolescent 2aAge Factors 2aChild 2aChild Behavior 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aLeisure Activities 2aMale 2aMotor Activity 2aSchools 2aSex Factors 2aTransportation 0aDenmark1 aSchipperijn, Jasper1 aChristian, Hayley1 aKerr, Jacqueline1 aErsbøll, Annette K1 aTroelsen, Jens0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.8-8dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-11-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245015500167520207900322592002802401650002802429650001602457650001202473650001402485650001602499650001802515650001402533650000902547650002002556650001602576650001802592650001202610650002902622700003402651700002302685700002202708700002002730773012102750856007502871852000902946655001202955IND60751428720221120163801.0210925e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075142872DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110926082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLudwiczak, Agnieszka 10aReproductive Performance of Hycole Rabbit Does, Growth of Kits and Milk Chemical Composition during Nine Consecutive Lactations under Extensive Rhythm  aThe goal of this study was to analyze the reproductive performance of does, growth of their kits, and chemical composition of their milk over nine consecutive parities in order to indicate the boundary of female reproductive profitability. The novelty of this study results from the combinations of three factors: extensive reproductive rhythm, commercial farming conditions, and a period of nine consecutive parities, showing the actual lifespan of a rabbit doe on commercial farms. The data was collected on 60 Hycole females kept at a commercial rabbit farm. Throughout the study, 32 does were excluded due to different reasons (e.g., excluded by means of selection—43.8% and mortalities—25.0%). The does were first inseminated at 28 weeks of age. Following artificial inseminations were conducted 14–15 days after each parturition. All kits were weaned at the age of 35 days. The following characteristics were analysed: body weight of rabbit does at artificial insemination, milk production per lactation, litter size, litter weight, average kit weight, and milk chemical composition. Rabbit does had a significant decrease in kindling rate between the eighth and the ninth parity (by 10.0 percentage points; p = 0.039). The litter size at weaning in the ninth parity was significantly lower to litters weaned at other analysed parities. The amount of milk produced per lactation was affected by the parity order (6.31–6.76 kg; p = 0.042). The litter weights on day 21 and 35 were the lowest at ninth parity. The content of total solids (TS), solids-not-fat, and fat was affected by the parity order on both analysed lactation days. The content of TS and fat in rabbit milk was characterized with a decreasing trend over the analysed period, on both lactation days. The results clearly indicate that rabbit does under extensive reproductive cycles characterize with a very good reproductive performance and can be successfully used for reproduction even up to the eighth parity. However, further research is needed if keeping them longer will not be profitable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3abody weight 3afemales 3alactation 3alitter size 3alitter weight 3alongevity 3amilk 3amilk production 3aparturition 3aprofitability 3arabbits 3areproductive performance1 aSkładanowska-Baryza, Joanna 1 aKuczyńska, Beata 1 aSell-Kubiak, Ewa 1 aStanisz, Marek 0 tAnimals.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110926083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245008700204520163000291592002801921650000801949650001501957650001001972650001601982650001301998650001302011650000902024650001202033650002202045650001602067650002502083653000702108653000702115653000702122653000802129653001102137653001502148653001402163653002302177700005702200700002102257700005902278700002102337700005502358773011902413856008202532852000902614655001202623IND60723303420221118051602.0210320e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072330342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2020.1667892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoğan, Deniz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3427-320510aCENP-A Nucleosome is a Sensitive Allosteric Scaffold for DNA and Chromatin Factors  aCentromeric loci of chromosomes are defined by nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A, which bind their DNA termini more permissively than their canonical counterpart, a feature that is critical for the mitotic fidelity. A recent cryo-EM study demonstrated that the DNA termini of CENP-A nucleosomes, reconstituted with the Widom 601 DNA sequence, are asymmetrically flexible, meaning one terminus is more clearly resolved than the other. However, an earlier work claimed that both ends could be resolved in the presence of two stabilizing single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies per nucleosome, and thus are likely permanently bound to the histone octamer. This suggests that the binding of scFv antibodies to the histone octamer surface would be associated with CENP-A nucleosome conformational changes, including stable binding of the DNA termini. Here, we present computational evidence that allows to explain at atomistic level the structural rearrangements of CENP-A nucleosomes resulting from the antibody binding. The antibodies, while they only bind the octamer façades, are capable of altering the dynamics of the nucleosomal core, and indirectly also the surrounding DNA. This effect has more drastic implications for the structure and the dynamics of the CENP-A nucleosome in comparison to its canonical counterpart. Furthermore, we find evidence that the antibodies bind the left and the right octamer façades at different affinities, another manifestation of the DNA sequence. We speculate that the cells could use induction of similar allosteric effects to control centromere function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantibodies 3acells 3acentromeres 3adynamics 3ahistones 3aloci 3amitosis 3amolecular biology 3anucleosomes 3anucleotide sequences 0aAB 0aVH 0aVL 0aCDR 0aCENP-A 0anucleosome 0aallostery 0amolecular dynamics1 aArslan, Merve1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6135-510X1 aUluçay, Tuğçe1 aKalyoncu, Sibel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2264-07571 aDimitrov, Stefan1 aKale, Seyit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7903-85430 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 Mar. 19, v. 433, no. 6 p.166789-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.1667893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011500175520177900290592002802069650002102097650003002118650001102148650001502159650001402174650002202188650001202210650001902222650002102241650001002262650001502272650001702287651001102304653001002315653001802325653002602343653002102369653002202390700002702412700002302439700003102462700002102493700002302514773010802537856008502645852000902730655001202739IND60745045020221120075236.0210924e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074504502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2021.1092512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, Madson A.B.10aIntensification of açaí palm management largely impoverishes tree assemblages in the Amazon estuarine forest  aThe exploitation of non-timber forest products has been encouraged in order to reconcile economic uses, biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services. In this paper we investigate how increments on the açaí palm density (Euterpe oleracea) via forest management change tree assemblages across 47 plots in the Amazon estuarine forest (Brazil). Assemblage attributes were confronted to açai clump density, soil fertility, canopy openness and elevation. Both tree species density and richness were negatively affected by acai, but species richness was also affected by tree abundance. Species-accumulation curves also indicated higher alpha and beta diversity across low-intensity forest patches with high-intensity patches lacking half of the tree species. A small set of species dominated forest patches, but açaí density did not correlate with the abundance of valuable species. Explanatory variables, including açai density, explained a small fraction of the variation on the functional profile of tree assemblages, but functional richness was reduced by a half across forest stands exceeding 600 açaí clumps per ha. Our results suggest that açaí intensification alters the structure of woody plant assemblages in estuarine forest. Tree abundance and species richness consistently declines as açaí clump density increases, with some forest stands being dominated by açaí and almost lacking any tree species. Accordingly, landscapes dominated by high-intensity forest stands are largely impoverished in terms of understory, canopy and emergent tree species. These findings question the current legal regulations and thresholds adopted for açai management, while alert for potential disasters caused by poorly-regulated extractions of NTFPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuterpe oleracea 3abiodiversity conservation 3acanopy 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aforest management 3aforests 3asoil fertility 3aspecies richness 3atrees 3aunderstory 3awoody plants 3aBrazil 0aNTFPs 0aAmazon forest 0aChronicle disturbance 0aForest integrity 0aLegal regulations1 aMagalhães, José L.L.1 aCarmona, Carlos P.1 aArroyo-Rodríguez, Víctor1 aVieira, Ima C.G.1 aTabarelli, Marcelo0 tBiological conservation.g2021 Sept., v. 261 p.109251-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.1092513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245015300177300001800330520175600348592002802104650002102132650001902153650002502172650002502197650002302222650001402245650001002259650000902269650001702278650001902295650001402314650004302328650001302371650005202384650001302436650002902449650002602478650002002504650002202524700001702546700001402563700001402577700001702591700001802608700001802626700001502644700003102659700001602690773010702706856008102813852000902894655001202903IND60584649620221120060519.0171027e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058464962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-017-2190-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaranja, Bernard Kinuthia10aGenome-wide characterization of the WRKY gene family in radish (Raphanus sativus L.) reveals its critical functions under different abiotic stresses  ap. 1757-1773.  aKEY MESSAGE : The radish WRKY gene family was genome-widely identified and played critical roles in response to multiple abiotic stresses. The WRKY is among the largest transcription factors (TFs) associated with multiple biological activities for plant survival, including control response mechanisms against abiotic stresses such as heat, salinity, and heavy metals. Radish is an important root vegetable crop and therefore characterization and expression pattern investigation of WRKY transcription factors in radish is imperative. In the present study, 126 putative WRKY genes were retrieved from radish genome database. Protein sequence and annotation scrutiny confirmed that RsWRKY proteins possessed highly conserved domains and zinc finger motif. Based on phylogenetic analysis results, RsWRKYs candidate genes were divided into three groups (Group I, II and III) with the number 31, 74, and 20, respectively. Additionally, gene structure analysis revealed that intron–exon patterns of the WRKY genes are highly conserved in radish. Linkage map analysis indicated that RsWRKY genes were distributed with varying densities over nine linkage groups. Further, RT-qPCR analysis illustrated the significant variation of 36 RsWRKY genes under one or more abiotic stress treatments, implicating that they might be stress-responsive genes. In total, 126 WRKY TFs were identified from the R. sativus genome wherein, 35 of them showed abiotic stress-induced expression patterns. These results provide a genome-wide characterization of RsWRKY TFs and baseline for further functional dissection and molecular evolution investigation, specifically for improving abiotic stress resistances with an ultimate goal of increasing yield and quality of radish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaphanus sativus 3aabiotic stress 3aamino acid sequences 3abioactive properties 3achromosome mapping 3adatabases 3agenes 3aheat 3aheavy metals 3alinkage groups 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aradishes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalinity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3avegetable crops 3azinc finger motif1 aFan, Lianxue1 aXu, Liang1 aWang, Yan1 aZhu, Xianwen1 aTang, Mingjia1 aWang, Ronghua1 aZhang, Fei1 aMuleke, Everlyne M’mbone1 aLiu, Liwang0 tPlant cell reports.g2017 Nov., v. 36, no. 11 p.1757-1773dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-017-2190-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245015900170300001800329520098100347592002801328650001401356650002001370650002301390650002301413650001401436650001401450650001401464650001601478650001101494650001101505650002201516650002901538650001401567650002401581650001301605700002501618700002401643700002701667700006601694773013301760856007901893852000901972655001201981IND60604706420221119053202.0180717e20180316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060470642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b001552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoronin, Vladimir V.10a[3 + 2]-Cycloaddition of in Situ Generated Nitrile Imines and Acetylene for Assembling of 1,3-Disubstituted Pyrazoles with Quantitative Deuterium Labeling  ap. 3819-3828.  aA novel synthetic methodology for the preparation of 1,3-disubstituted pyrazoles from in situ generated nitrile imines and acetylene is reported. The reactions are performed in a simple two-chamber reactor. One part of the reactor is loaded with hydrazonoyl chloride precursors of active nitrile imine species and a base. The other part is used to generate acetylene from CaC₂ and water. Partitioning of the reactants improves the yields of desired pyrazoles up to 99% and simplifies their isolation to a simple procedure of solvent evaporation. The approach requires no complex equipment and utilizes inexpensive, safe, and easy to handle calcium carbide as a starting material. A model deuterium incorporation is carried out according to the developed methodology, producing a series of novel 4,5-dideuteropyrazoles with excellent deuterium enrichment. Theoretical calculations on reaction mechanism and characterization of possible intermediate structures were performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3acalcium carbide 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3achlorides 3adeuterium 3aequipment 3aevaporation 3aimines 3amodels 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apyrazoles 3areaction mechanisms 3asolvents1 aLedovskaya, Maria S.1 aGordeev, Evgeniy G.1 aRodygin, Konstantin S.1 aAnanikov, Valentine P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6447-557X0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 83, no. 7 p.3819-3828dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b001553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01553naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007500157300001800232520048600250592002800736650001300764650002400777650002300801650002300824650001200847650002200859700001300881700001900894700001700913700001600930700001700946700002500963773011900988856007501107852000901182655001201191IND60550003920221122040459.0160909e20130607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055000392DNAL7 a10.1021/jo40065742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yongda10aSolvent-Free Methallylboration of Ketones Accelerated by tert-Alcohols  ap. 5775-5781.  aA solvent- and metal-free process has been developed for the direct methallylboration of ketones employing the stable B-methallylborinane 1, which was accelerated by tertiary alcohols.

Dietary intake was assessed according to data of the completed food frequency questionnaire, containing 58 food items. Principal component analysis was performed to reduce food items into dietary groups, followed by linear regression analyses to test the association between dietary groups and fT3, fT4, and TSH levels.Among the 4585 healthy individuals, we observed lower plasma fT3 and fT4 levels and higher TSH levels in women than in men. Smokers were found to have significantly lower TSH levels than non-smokers and ex-smokers, and participants with higher fasting glucose levels had higher fT4 levels. Different dietary groups (factors) showed association with fT3, fT4, and TSH levels. It was observed that dietary factors (with frequent consumption of fruit juices, Cedevita vitamin drink, and non-alcoholic drinks) that negatively affected TSH levels simultaneously had a positive effect on fT4, satisfying the expected pattern of effects.In our study, frequent consumption of foods with a high glycemic index showed a positive association with fT3 and fT4 levels and a negative association with TSH levels, whereas foods rich in saturated fatty acids and with a high protein concentration showed a negative association with fT3 and fT4 levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDalmatian 3across-sectional studies 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3afruits 3aglucose 3aglycemic index 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3athyrotropin 3atriiodothyronine 3aCroatia 0aTSH 0afT4 0afT3 0aDiet 0aNutrition1 aGunjača, Ivana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7056-64431 aPleić, Nikolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5672-871X1 aTorlak, Vesela1 aKnežević, Petra1 aPunda, Ante1 aPolašek, Ozren1 aHayward, Alfred,cMrs.1 aZemunik, Tatijana0 tNutrition.g2021 Nov.,  Dec., v. 91-92 p.111394-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.1113943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164500001400280520181300294592002802107650003202135650001602167650001402183650001002197650003302207650002102240650001102261650002202272650002002294650001602314653001302330653001302343653000802356653002202364653001402386700005202400700001902452700002002471700002202491700002702513700002902540700001902569700002102588700001802609700002002627700002502647700002202672700002102694700001802715700002602733773011902759856008202878852000902960655001202969IND60723303520221118051645.0210212e20210219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072330352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2020.1667902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qiuyan13aAn Eight Amino Acid Segment Controls Oligomerization and Preferred Conformation of the two Non-visual Arrestins  aNAL-light  aG protein coupled receptors signal through G proteins or arrestins. A long-standing mystery in the field is why vertebrates have two non-visual arrestins, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3. These isoforms are ~75% identical and 85% similar; each binds numerous receptors, and appear to have many redundant functions, as demonstrated by studies of knockout mice. We previously showed that arrestin-3 can be activated by inositol-hexakisphosphate (IP₆). IP₆ interacts with the receptor-binding surface of arrestin-3, induces arrestin-3 oligomerization, and this oligomer stabilizes the active conformation of arrestin-3. Here, we compared the impact of IP₆ on oligomerization and conformational equilibrium of the highly homologous arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 and found that these two isoforms are regulated differently. In the presence of IP₆, arrestin-2 forms “infinite” chains, where each promoter remains in the basal conformation. In contrast, full length and truncated arrestin-3 form trimers and higher-order oligomers in the presence of IP₆; we showed previously that trimeric state induces arrestin-3 activation (Chen et al., 2017). Thus, in response to IP₆, the two non-visual arrestins oligomerize in different ways in distinct conformations. We identified an insertion of eight residues that is conserved across arrestin-2 homologs, but absent in arrestin-3 that likely accounts for the differences in the IP₆ effect. Because IP₆ is ubiquitously present in cells, this suggests physiological consequences, including differences in arrestin-2/3 trafficking and JNK3 activation. The functional differences between two non-visual arrestins are in part determined by distinct modes of their oligomerization. The mode of oligomerization might regulate the function of other signaling proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aamino acids 3aarrestins 3acells 3aconformational isomerization 3aknockout mutants 3alength 3amolecular biology 3aoligomerization 3avertebrates 0aoligomer 0aisoforms 0aIP6 0asignaling protein 0astructure1 aZhuo, Ya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3068-37921 aSharma, Pankaj1 aPérez, Ivette,1 aFrancis, Derek J.1 aChakravarthy, Srinivas1 aVishnivetskiy, Sergey A.1 aBerndt, Sandra1 aHanson, Susan M.1 aZhan, Xuanzhi1 aBrooks, Evan K.1 aAltenbach, Christian1 aHubbell, Wayne L.1 aKlug, Candice S.1 aIverson, T.M.1 aGurevich, Vsevolod V.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 Feb. 19, v. 433, no. 4 p.166790-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2020.1667903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245007200189300001600261520159200277592002801869650001301897650001501910650000901925650001901934650001501953650001001968650001501978650004301993650001502036650001402051650001702065650002602082650001102108650002402119650001202143650001602155650002602171650001202197650002602209650001702235651001102252700002602263700001802289700001602307773013302323856005502456852000902511655001202520IND4477363920221121035152.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447736392DNAL7 a223561292pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2012.01280.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrajewski, J.10aOccurrence of mycotoxins in Polish animal feed in years 2006–2009  ap. 870-877.  aWe performed a 4‐year survey (2006–2009, 1255 samples) of fungal secondary metabolites in feed material (cereal and corn grains) and feedstuffs (silages, mixed feeds). Five major mycotoxin groups were studied, including aflatoxins (AF), ochratoxin A (OTA), trichothecenes [deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), T‐2 toxin, HT‐2 toxin], zearalenone (ZEA) and fumonisins (FUM). The metabolites were identified using HPLC methods with fluorescent, UV and MS/MS detection. Both immunoaffinity and SPE columns were used for sample preparation. In eleven samples, the concentration of several mycotoxins exceeded the recommended guidelines for feedstuffs. DON was detected at the highest concentration in the majority of analysed samples (cereal grains, silages and mixed feeds, maximum values ranged from 409 to 14 470 ng/g). Corn grains also contained other Fusarium toxins (FUM) at maximum levels ranging from 435 to 9409 ng/g. The highest averagepositive concentration of the other trichothecenes (NIV, T‐2 and HT‐2 toxins) was <5.0–139 ng/g. ZEA was found at the highest concentration in corn grains and silages (maximum values ranging from 292 to 603 ng/g and 116 to 1150 ng/g, respectively). The highest averagepositive concentration and the maximum level of OTA were detected in cereal grains (33.0 ng/g in 2009 and 760 ng/g in 2007, respectively). Less than 7% of the 557 samples were contaminated with AF at low levels (maximum of 0.61 ng/g). Our results support the need for further monitoring of mycotoxins in Polish feedstuffs and their components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aaflatoxins 3acorn 3adeoxynivalenol 3afumonisins 3afungi 3aguidelines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3anivalenol 3aochratoxin A 3asecondary metabolites 3asilage 3asmall cereal grains 3asurveys 3azearalenone 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aMycotoxinsxchemistry 2aTime Factors 0aPoland1 aBłajet‐Kosicka, A.1 aTwarużek, M.1 aKosicki, R.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2012 Oct., v. 96, no. 5 p.870-877dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2012.01280.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007300147245025900220520182600479592002802305650002902333650001602362650001302378650001402391650002002405650001002425650002702435650001302462650001402475650001602489650001202505650002302517650002102540650001202561653003602573653002102609653001502630653001002645700002902655700003802684700007202722700007902794773010302873856008202976852000903058655001203067IND60742292520221121054705.0211114e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074229252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2021.1113952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Priscila Vaz de Melo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6996-179610aEffect of the consumption of yacon flour and energy-restricted diet on glycation markers, and association between these markers and factors linked to obesity in adults with excess body weight: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial  aRegardless of the positive effect of yacon on metabolic markers, this food contains fructose molecules, which can originate advanced glycation end products (AGEs). High AGEs serum concentrations can contribute to excess body weight. We evaluated the effect of consuming an energy-restricted diet and yacon flour on glycation markers concentrations, and the associations between these markers and factors linked to obesity in adults with excess body weight.Twenty-six adults with excess body weight were included in this randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week clinical trial. Subjects were randomly allocated to the control group (n = 13) or the yacon-flour group (n = 13), and daily consumed a breakfast drink either not containing or containing 25 g of yacon flour (8.7 g of fructooligosaccharides). Energy-restricted diets were prescribed for both groups. Biochemical markers, anthropometric variables, and body composition were evaluated at baseline and the end of the study.AGEs and early glycation products did not increase in the yacon flour group. Soluble receptor for AGEs (sRAGE) decreased regardless of group. Besides, changes in AGEs were positively associated with changes in body fat (β = 0.04, P = 0.038) and in sRAGE, with insulin (β = 0.02, P = 0.035) and homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (β = 0.01, P = 0.049).The consumption of 25 g of yacon flour associated with an energy-restricted diet did not increase concentrations of glycation markers. Changes in glycation markers were positively associated with changes in consolidated anthropometric and biochemical markers related to being overweight. Assessing glycation markers may be a useful strategy for monitoring responses to dietary interventions in subjects with excess body weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSmallanthus sonchifolius 3ablood serum 3abody fat 3abreakfast 3aclinical trials 3aflour 3afructooligosaccharides 3afructose 3aglycation 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alow calorie diet 3aobesity 0aAdvanced glycation end products 0aAmadori products 0aOverweight 0asRAGE1 aMachado, Adriane Moreira1 ada Silva, Nayara Benedito Martins1 ade Oliveira, Leandro Licursi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4353-70111 aAlfenas, Rita de Cássia Gonçalves1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2290-16110 tNutrition.g2021 Nov.,  Dec., v. 91-92 p.111395-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.1113953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245012300210300001400333506007600347520175500423592002802178506003702206650001102243650001202254650002002266650001002286650003502296650000902331650001202340650001802352650001202370650001402382653001202396653001502408653001002423653001102433653000902444653000802453700002702461773011102488856008102599852000902680655001202689IND60552280220221207052107.0161020e20150205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055228022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2014.11.0252doi7 aPMC43127302pmcid7 a254989612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemaan, Sheila J.10aDaily successive changes in reproductive gene expression and neuronal activation in the brains of pubertal female mice  ap. 84-97.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPuberty is governed by the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), but the roles and identities of upstream neuropeptides that control and time puberty remain poorly understood. Indeed, how various reproductive neural gene systems change before and during puberty, and in relation to one another, is not well-characterized. We detailed the daily pubertal profile (from postnatal day [PND] 15 to PND 30) of neural Kiss1 (encoding kisspeptin), Kiss1r (kisspeptin receptor), Tac2 (neurokinin B), and Rfrp (RFRP-3, mammalian GnIH) gene expression and day-to-day c-fos induction in each of these cell types in developing female mice. Kiss1 expression in the AVPV/PeN increased substantially over the pubertal transition, reaching adult levels around vaginal opening (PND 27.5), a pubertal marker. However, AVPV/PeN Kiss1 neurons were not highly activated, as measured by c-fos co-expression, at any pubertal age. In the ARC, Kiss1 and Tac2 cell numbers showed moderate increases across the pubertal period, and neuronal activation of Tac2/Kiss1 cells was moderately elevated at all pubertal ages. Additionally, Kiss1r expression specifically in GnRH neurons was already maximal by PND 15 and did not change with puberty. Conversely, both Rfrp expression and Rfrp/c-fos co-expression in the DMN decreased markedly in the early pre-pubertal stage. This robust decrease of the inhibitory RFRP-3 population may diminish inhibition of GnRH neurons during early puberty. Collectively, our data identify the precise timing of important developmental changes – and in some cases, lack thereof – in gene expression and neuronal activation of key reproductive neuropeptides during puberty, with several changes occurring well before vaginal opening.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3afemales 3agene expression 3agenes 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3amice 3aneurons 3aneuropeptides 3apuberty 3asecretion 0aPuberty 0aKisspeptin 0aKiss1 0aRFRP-3 0aGnIH 0aNKB1 aKauffman, Alexander S.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2015 Feb. 05, v. 401 p.84-97dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2014.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001900167245005500186300001600241520138500257592002801642650001901670650001101689650002901700650001901729650002201748650001701770650001301787650001001800650000901810650002201819650004601841650005501887650002001942650001101962650002201973650002301995650002302018650002102041650001102062650000902073650006702082650001602149650004102165650001802206650001502224650001602239651001602255651003102271700001902302700002602321700002502347700002302372700002302395773009002418856008202508852000902590655001202599IND60112270520221120224644.0141110e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011227052DNAL7 a227899312pmid7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2012.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreijer, Karen14aThe economic costs of disease related malnutrition  ap. 136-141.  aBACKGROUND & AIMS: Disease related malnutrition (under-nutrition caused by illness) is a worldwide problem in all health care settings with potentially serious consequences on a physical as well as a psycho-social level. In the European Union countries about 20 million patients are affected by disease related malnutrition, costing EU governments up to € 120 billion annually. The aim of this study is to calculate the total additional costs of disease related malnutrition in The Netherlands. METHODS: A cost-of-illness analysis was used to calculate the additional total costs of disease related malnutrition in adults (>18 years of age) for The Netherlands in 2011 in the hospital, nursing- and residential home and home care setting, expressed as an absolute monetary value as well as a percentage of the total Dutch national health expenditure and as a percentage of the total costs of the studied health care sectors in The Netherlands. RESULTS: The total additional costs of managing adult patients with disease related malnutrition were estimated to be € 1.9 billion in 2011 which equals 2.1% of the total Dutch national health expenditure and 4.9% of the total costs of the health care sectors analyzed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that the additional costs of disease related malnutrition in adults in The Netherlands are considerable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aadults 3acost of illness analysis 3aeconomic costs 3ahealth care costs 3amalnutrition 3apatients 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCachexiaxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aCost of Illness 2aFemale 2aHealth Care Costs 2aHome Care Services 2aHomes for the Aged 2aHospital Charges 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMalnutritionxdiet therapyxeconomicsxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasmsxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aNursing Homes 2aPrevalence 2aYoung Adult 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlandsxepidemiology.1 aTan, Siok Swan1 aKoopmanschap, Marc A.1 aMeijers, Judith M.M.1 aHalfens, Ruud J.G.1 aNuijten, Mark J.C.0 tClinical nutrition.g2013 Feb., v. 32, no. 1 p.136-141dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2012.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011600174300001600290520102000306592002801326650002901354650004401383650002601427650002101453650002201474650001801496650001301514650002001527650002201547650001501569650001401584650002401598650000701622650000901629650003301638650002001671650001101691700002001702773011601722856008601838852000901924655001201933IND60099759420221118015827.0141105e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009975942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2013.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayak, Amit Kumar10aFormulation optimization and evaluation of jackfruit seed starch–alginate mucoadhesive beads of metformin HCl  ap. 264-272.  aThe present study deals with the formulation optimization of jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam., family: Moraceae) seed starch (JFSS)–alginate mucoadhesive beads containing metformin HCl through ionotropic gelation using 3² factorial design.

Sfp1 is a multimodular protein composed of four subunits (Sfp1 Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma) displaying different functional domains. We recombinantly produced two fragments of Sfp1 comprising most of its functional domains: the C-terminal part of the Beta subunit (rSfp1 Beta C-term) and the Delta subunit (rSfp1 Delta). Surface plasmon resonance analyses of protein adsorption onto different model surfaces showed that rSfp1 Beta C-term exhibits a significantly higher adsorption than the fibrinogen control on hydrophobic, hydrophilic protein-resistant, and charged self-assembled monolayers, while rSfp1 Delta adsorbed more on negatively charged and on protein-resistant surfaces compared to fibrinogen. Truncated recombinant rSfp1 Beta C-term proteins were produced in order to investigate the role of the different functional domains in the adsorption of this protein. The analysis of their adsorption capacities on glass showed that two mechanisms are involved in rSfp1 Beta C-term adsorption: (1) one mediated by the EGF-like domain and involving Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions, and (2) one mediated by the sequence of Sfp1 Beta with no homology with known functional domain in databases, in the presence of Na⁺, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiotechnology 3acalcium 3afibrinogen 3aglass 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3asecretion 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aEderth, Thomas1 aMasai, Thibault1 aWattiez, Ruddy1 aLeclère, Philippe1 aFlammang, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9938-11541 aHennebert, Elise1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7911-46490 tMarine biotechnology.g2021 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.724-735dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870069x1436-22287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-021-10059-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015200167300001800319520167800337592002802015650002302043650001702066650001802083650002002101650004302121650002102164650005202185650000902237650002202246650001402268700002002282700001902302700002402321700001702345700002002362700001602382700001802398700002202416773010702438856008102545852000902626655001202635IND60584649920221120051913.0171027e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058464992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-017-2189-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, Mandeep10aCo-transformation mediated stacking of blast resistance genes Pi54 and Pi54rh in rice provides broad spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae  ap. 1747-1755.  aKEY MESSAGE: This is the first report of stacking two major blast resistance genes in blast susceptible rice variety using co-transformation method to widen the resistance spectrum against different isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae. Single resistance (R-) gene mediated approach for the management of rice blast disease has met with frequent breakdown in resistance response. Besides providing the durable resistance, gene pyramiding or stacking also imparts broad spectrum resistance against plant pathogens, including rice blast. In the present study, we stacked two R-genes; Pi54 and Pi54rh having broad spectrum resistance against multiple isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). Both Pi54 and Pi54rh expressed under independent promoters were transferred into the blast susceptible japonica rice Taipei 309 (TP309) using particle gun bombardment method. Functional complementation analysis of stacked transgenic rice lines showed higher level of resistance to a set of highly virulent M. oryzae isolates collected from different rice growing regions. qRT-PCR analysis has shown M. oryzae induced expression of both the R-genes in stacked transgenic lines. The present study also demonstrated the effectiveness of the strategy for rapid single step gene stacking using co-transformation approach to engineer durable resistance against rice blast disease and also this is the first report in which two blast R-genes are stacked together using co-transformation approach. The two-gene-stacked transgenic line developed in this study can be used further to understand the molecular aspects of defense-related pathways vis-a-vis single R-gene containing transgenic lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aOryza sativa 3ablast disease 3aplant pathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresistance genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3atransgenic plants 3avirulence1 aRai, Amit Kumar1 aDevanna, B.

However, studies on marine ectoparasites have scarcely been conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms of pesticide resistance. Herein, we explored the sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi miRNome responses exposed to delousing drugs and the interplaying with coding/non-coding RNAs. Drug sensitivity in sea lice was tested by in vitro bioassays for the pesticides azamethiphos, deltamethrin, and cypermethrin. Ectoparasites strains with contrasting susceptibility to these compounds were used. Small-RNA sequencing was conducted, identifying 2776 novel annotated miRNAs, where 163 mature miRNAs were differentially expressed in response to the drug testing. Notably, putative binding sites for miRNAs were found in the ADME genes associated with the drugs’ absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Interactions between the miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were also found, suggesting putative molecular gene regulation mechanisms. This study reports putative miRNAs correlated to the coding/non-coding RNAs modulation, revealing novel pharmacological mechanisms associated with drug resistance in sea lice species.  aPublisher supplied data  a1180867cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico  a11200813cFondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico  a15110027cFONDAP 3aCaligus rogercresseyi 3aabsorption 3aazamethiphos 3abiotechnology 3acypermethrin 3adeltamethrin 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3aectoparasites 3aexcretion 3agenes 3amicroRNA 3apesticide resistance 3apharmacokinetics 3atranscriptome1 aValenzuela-Muñoz, Valentina1 aValenzuela-Miranda, Diego1 aGallardo Escárate, Cristian,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7094-67020 tMarine biotechnology.g2021 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.710-723dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870069x1436-22287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-021-10058-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011400168300001600282520116000298592002801458650001101486650002101497650003001518650002301548650001401571650003701585653001301622653002901635653001001664653002301674653003001697653003201727700005101759700001501810700001901825700005501844700001701899700001201916700005601928773009001984856008502074852000902159655001202168IND60745045520221122030118.0220830e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074504552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.07.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Weiwei10aSmallest carbon nanowires made easy: Long linear carbon chains confined inside single-walled carbon nanotubes  ap. 571-577.  aThe carbon nanowires are defined as long linear carbon chains (LLCCs) or carbynes confined inside carbon nanotubes (CNTs). LLCCs were synthesized previously inside multi-walled CNTs (LLCCs@MWCNTs) and double-walled CNTs (LLCCs@DWCNTs). In this work, a feasible, efficient, controllable and scalable method was developed to mass-produce the smallest carbon nanowires (LLCCs@SWCNTs) consisting of LLCCs encapsulated inside single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) with diameters of 0.70–0.95 nm. The polyynes were inserted into the open-ended SWCNTs, and then polyynes@SWCNTs were heated at 700 °C in argon gas. A combination of Raman spectra studies and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations demonstrated the formation of LLCCs@SWCNTs nanostructure. Density functional theory calculations and reactive molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the polyynes could fuse and grow to LLCCs inside the hollow space of SWCNTs. This work opened new avenues for exploring various physical properties of both LLCCs (carbyne) and LLCCs@SWCNTs, as well as their potential applications in nanoelectronics, nanomechanics and composite nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3adensity functional theory 3amolecular dynamics 3ananowires 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPolyynes 0aLong linear carbon chain 0aSWCNT 0aRaman spectroscopy 0aDensity functional theory 0aReactive molecular dynamics1 aLiu, Fu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8507-78101 aLiu, Yifan1 aZhu, Tianxiang1 aFang, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8014-63621 aLi, Qianqian1 aLiu, Yi1 aZhao, Xinluo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2139-85830 tCarbon.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 183 p.571-577dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.07.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012600170520131700296592002801613650001401641650001001655650001601665650001601681650001901697650001301716650001601729650001801745650003101763650001701794650002301811650001401834650001401848653002101862653002001883653002201903653002101925653002601946700002501972700002001997700002202017773012202039856008102161852000902242655001202251IND60723303820221118051610.0211030e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072330382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1108732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoh, Andrea Shi'en10aInvestigating phytosterol as a potential functional component in milk through textural, flavour and oral perception study  aPhytosterols (PS) are functional ingredients capable of providing health benefits. This study investigated the potential of incorporating different levels of PS ester (0.8, 1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 g/100 g) into skim milk (0.1 g/100 mL milk fat) to replace the milk fat. PS-enriched milk were analysed for its physical characteristics (colour, viscosity, tribology, particle size and microstructure) and compared to commercial milk (0.1, 1.3, 2 g/100 mL fat, and 1.3 g/100 mL fat with 0.3 g/100 mL PS). Furthermore, the flavour profiles and sensory acceptability of the PS-enriched milk were evaluated. All samples exhibited a characteristic shear-thinning flow behaviour, with 2 g/100 g PS ester milk displaying the highest viscosity (4.46 ± 1.93 mPa s) at 50/s shear rate and 35 °C. Confocal images and particle size distribution suggest fat coalescence resulting in larger fat globules (0.53 ± 0.14 μm) in 2 g/100 g PS ester milk. In general, the addition of PS ester increased the fatty acid and aldehyde compounds of PS-enriched milk, providing comparable lubrication properties and whiteness to commercial milk with the same fat levels. Sensory evaluation revealed that the PS-enriched milk did not possess any off-flavour and milk with 1.6 g/100 g PS ester were the most preferred.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acolor 3afatty acids 3alubrication 3amicrostructure 3amilk fat 3aoff flavors 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aphytosterols 3asensory evaluation 3askim milk 3aviscosity 0aReduced-fat milk 0aFunctional milk 0aPhytosterol ester 0aFlavour profiles 0aLubrication behaviour1 aNingtyas, Dian Widya1 aBhandari, Bhesh1 aPrakash, Sangeeta0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Apr., v. 141 p.110873-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1108733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012400165500001400289520150500303592002801808650001201836650001401848650000901862650001601871650001801887650001101905650001101916650002101927650002101948650001401969650001801983650001302001650001202014650001902026650002602045650001202071650001002083650002102093650001402114650001302128650001202141650002402153650001702177650002302194650001902217650001002236653001802246653002802264653003702292653002002329700001502349700001502364700001702379700001402396700001302410773010802423856008202531852000902613655001202622IND60719792220221117203015.0210215e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071979222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1031432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanxiang10aEvaluation of quality deterioration of dried whole-wheat noodles with extrusion-stabilized bran and germ during storage  aNAL-light  aThe prepared DWWN samples were placed under 60% humidity, at 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C and stored for 300 days, 150 days, and 35 days, respectively. Changes in chemical-physical, volatile compounds and sensory quality of DWWN were monitored during storage. During the whole storage period, the water activity ranged from 0.60 to 0.66, and the free fatty acid showed an overall increasing trend. As the storage temperature increased, the acidity value showed a significant logarithmic increasing trend; the relative content of ketones, esters and pyrazines increased, and the aldehydes decreased. The content of linolenic acid, trans-linoleic acid and palmitoleic acid increased mutationally for a certain period of time, then decreased rapidly and became stable when stored at 35 °C and 45 °C. The freshness decreased, the inherent fresh wheat aroma diminished with the prolongation of storage time, and the higher storage temperature, the worse deterioration within a short time for DWWN. The changes in the relative content of 44 volatile flavor compounds were evaluated through GARS-PLS multivariate statistics, revealing that 10 identified compounds could be related to the loss in wheat aroma or the accumulation of unpleasant flavor. Combined with a correlation analysis of volatile compounds and physicochemical indexes, the quality of DWWN was mainly related to the acidity and free fatty acid, and closely related to the content of palmitoleic acid, linolenic acid and gadoleic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aaldehydes 3abran 3acorrelation 3adeterioration 3aesters 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3afree fatty acids 3afreshness 3agadoleic acid 3ahumidity 3aketones 3alinolenic acid 3amultivariate analysis 3anoodles 3aodors 3apalmitoleic acid 3apyrazines 3asampling 3astorage 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3avolatile compounds 3awater activity 3awheat 0aBran and germ 0aExtrusion stabilization 0aDried whole-wheat noodles (DWWN) 0aStorage quality1 aGuan, Lina1 aMeng, Ning1 aWang, Liping1 aLiu, Ming1 aTan, Bin0 tJournal of cereal science.g2021 Jan., v. 97 p.103143-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2020.1031433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012500173520096100298592002801259650002401287650002001311650001901331650001901350653002101369653001601390653002201406653001101428653001201439653001601451653002001467700002301487700001901510700002001529700002201549700002001571773009901591856008501690852000901775655001201784IND60768749420221119013504.0220321e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076874942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2022.1172242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDüsenberg, Björn10aTemperature influence on the triboelectric powder charging during dry coating of polypropylene with nanosilica particles  aThe influence of process temperature on the triboelectric charge during dry coating of cohesive polymer powders is investigated. The purpose of heating is to decrease the surface moisture of the powder, which results in an increase of electrical charge of the powder. The effect of the hydrophilicity of the SiO₂ guest particles on the quality of the dry coating of PP host particles was investigated with respect to the integral charge of the dry coated powder. Furthermore, the flowability, crystallization behavior and degree of coverage (DOC) were investigated to determine the influence of the increased charge on these topics. Increased process temperature increases the electrical charge of the powder, which leads to a higher DOC with guest particles and, thus, drastically improved flowability compared to dry coating at ambient temperature. Furthermore, changes in the crystallization behavior of polypropylene are observed, due to more nuclei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acrystallization 3ahydrophilicity 3apolypropylenes 0aTriboelectricity 0aDry coating 0aThermal treatment 0aMixing 0aPolymer 0aFlowability 0aCrystallization1 aTischer, Florentin1 aValayne, Erika1 aSchmidt, Jochen1 aPeukert, Wolfgang1 aBück, Andreas,0 tPowder technology.g2022 Feb., v. 399 p.117224-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2022.1172243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01707naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002300157245002700180300001600207520076500223592002800988650002201016650002701038650001201065650001901077650001401096650001701110650002101127650001301148773009701161856009101258990002301349852000901372655001201381IND60098802720221120155807.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009880272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiochev, Stefan I.10aFree radical paradoxes  ap. 232-233.  aUnlike bigger and more advanced animals, Caenorhabditis elegans does not generate NO, yet it was recently found that NO produced by chemical or biological sources exerts profound effects in that animal, leading to increased life span and thermotolerance.

Because menthol in cigarettes can attenuate nicotine bitterness, choice of menthol/nonmenthol cigarettes may be influenced by ability to perceive bitterness. We examined chemosensory function of chronic smokers, hypothesizing they would show altered function in comparison to non-smokers and by menthol cigarette preference. In laboratory-based measures, chronic smokers (N = 135; 84 menthol smokers) self-reported their chemosensory function and participated in smell (identification task with perceived intensity) and taste (quinine and NaCl intensity on tongue-tip and whole mouth) testing. A taste genetics probe (propylthiouracil (PROP) bitterness) also was assessed. Self-reported and measured chemosensory function were compared with nationally-representative 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data generated with similar measures. The taste measures also were compared between smokers and age- and sex-matched non-smokers from a laboratory database. Frequencies of self-reported smell and taste alterations among smokers exceeded NHANES prevalence estimates for non-smokers. The rate of measured smell dysfunction also exceeded NHANES prevalence for hyposmia. Compared to non-smokers, smokers reported elevated tongue-tip and whole mouth intensities from 1 M NaCl, with no significant differences in whole mouth quinine or 0.32 M NaCl. Inconsistent with previous hypotheses, smokers were not more likely to report depressed PROP bitterness than non-smokers. However, as expected, menthol smokers reported greater PROP bitterness than non-menthol smokers. In conclusion, chemosensory alterations were more frequent among chronic smokers, including hyposmia and heightened intensity from NaCl at an oral-irritant concentration. PROP supertasters were most likely to prefer mentholated cigarettes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abitterness 3acigarettes 3adatabases 3agenetics 3amenthol 3amouth 3anicotine 3aolfactory disorders 3apropylthiouracil 3aquinine 3asmell 3asmoking (habit) 3asodium chloride 3ataste 0aHyposmia 0aOral irritation 0aSmell 0aTaste 0aTobacco 0aTaste genetics 0aCigarettes 0aSmoking1 aGlennon, Sarah-Grace1 aLarsen, Brittany A.1 aRawal, Shristi1 aOncken, Cheryl1 aLitt, Mark D.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 201 p.111-122dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010500161300001600266520176900282592002802051650002202079650001502101650001902116650001102135650001202146650001202158650001702170650001202187650001502199650002502214650001302239650001802252650001502270650001502285650001502300650003302315650001102348650001602359653002002375653001902395653002202414653002302436653001502459700001302474700001402487700002102501700001702522700001502539700001802554700001502572773012202587856008202709852000902791655001202800IND60684250620221116152246.0200517e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068425062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2020.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yujun10aVariation on leaching behavior of caustic compounds in bauxite residue during dealkalization process  ap. 141-150.  aBauxite residue, a byproduct of alumina manufacture, is a serious environmental pollutant due to its high leaching contents of metals and caustic compounds. Four typical anions of CO₃²⁻, HCO₃⁻, Al(OH)₄⁻ and OH⁻ (represented caustic compounds) and metal ions (As, B, Mo and V) were selected to assess their leaching behavior under dealkalization process with different conditions including liquid/solid ratio (L/S ratio), temperature and leaching time. The results revealed that washing process could remove the soluble composition in bauxite residue effectively. The leaching concentrations of typical anions in bauxite residue decreased as follows: c(CO₃²⁻) > c(HCO₃⁻) > c[Al(OH)₄⁻] > c(OH⁻). L/S ratio had a more significant effect on leaching behavior of OH⁻, whilst the leaching concentration of Al(OH)₄⁻ varied larger underleaching temperature and time treatment. Under the optimal leaching, the total alkaline, soluble Na concentrations, exchangeable Ca concentrations were 79.52, 68.93, and 136.0 mmol/L, respectively, whilst the soluble and exchangeable content of As, B, Mo and V in bauxite residue changed slightly. However, it should be noted that water leaching has released metal ions such as As, B, Mo and V in bauxite residue to the surrounding environment. The semiquantitative analysis of XRD revealed that water leaching increased the content of gismondine from 2.4% to 6.4%. The SEM images demonstrated the dissolution of caustic compounds on bauxite residue surface. The correlation analysis indicated that CO₃²⁻ and HCO₃⁻ could effectively reflect the alkalinity of bauxite residue, and may be regarded as critical dealkalization indicators to evaluate alkalinity removal in bauxite residue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkalinity 3aaluminum oxide 3aanions 3aarsenic 3abauxite 3abicarbonates 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3aexchangeable calcium 3aleaching 3amanufacturing 3ametal ions 3amolybdenum 3apollutants 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3atemperature 0aBauxite residue 0aDealkalization 0aCaustic compounds 0aSoluble alkalinity 0aMetal ions1 aLi, Meng1 aZhu, Feng1 aHartley, William1 aLiao, Jiaxin1 aAn, Wenhui1 aXue, Shengguo1 aJiang, Jun0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2020 June, v. 92 p.141-150dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245013600214520107000350592002801420650001801448650002401466650001601490650001301506650001701519650002401536650002101560650001201581650002101593650000701614650002501621653001201646653001301658653002501671653001801696653002301714700002001737773009501757856008301852852000901935655001201944IND60766140820221121051037.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1015792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitehead, Felicity A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6669-926X10aModelling the mechanism and kinetics of ascorbic acid diffusion in genipin-crosslinked gelatin and chitosan networks at distinct pH  aCrosslinked biopolymers were prepared for controlled release to investigate the diffusion of ascorbic acid from swelling high-solid networks in neutral and acidic pH conditions. Polymer swelling was measured at pH 2.8 and pH 6.8 and change in microstructural properties, including network mesh size and average molecular weight between crosslinks of genipin-crosslinked gelatin and genipin-crosslinked chitosan systems, were predicted. Variable mathematical modelling was applied to the first 60% of ascorbic acid diffusion and statistical analysis was used to determine the model that best fits the experimental data. Molecular transport from the gelatin-based networks was best described by the Peppas-Sahlin model whereas the distinct effect of pH on chitosan structure formation brought into consideration the zero-order model. Mathematical modelling of bioactive compound release from swelling biopolymer matrices at different pH conditions is essential for the design of efficient targeted delivery matrices for functional food and nutraceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abioactive compounds 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3adietary supplements 3afunctional foods 3agelatin 3amolecular weight 3apH 3astatistical analysis 0aGelatin 0aChitosan 0aGenipin crosslinking 0aAscorbic acid 0aDiffusion kinetics1 aKasapis, Stefan0 tFood bioscience.g2022 Apr., v. 46 p.101579-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1015793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245008200184300002000266520089400286592002801180650001201208650001601220650002701236650002001263650001501283650001501298650001501313650001101328650001601339650001901355650001501374650001801389650001201407650003801419650001201457650001601469650002701485650001101512650001801523650003101541650001001572650001501582650002201597650002801619650004501647650001101692650001601703650003501719650004101754650003201795700001801827700002801845773010001873856008601973852000902059655001202068IND4466902420221121220228.0141110e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446690242DNAL7 a219834132pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiaño, B.10aTreatment of fish processing wastewater with microalgae-containing microbiota  ap. 10829-10833.  aTwo photobioreactors inoculated with microalgae from a lagoon containing aerobically treated swine slurry and with sludge from a membrane submerged bioreactor treating winery wastewater were established to treat fish processing wastewater (FPW) at 23 and 31°C, respectively.

In this regard, microwave assisted extraction have emerged as a novel process for extraction of bioactive compounds. This process observed to consume less time and energy but have higher extraction efficiency. Additionally, the functionality of bioactive compounds has not degraded in this process. Therefore, this article explores the potential of microwave-based extraction as a green and ecofriendly technique. Moreover, it has been coupled with conventional technique (e.g. steam distillation, steam diffusion, hydrodistillation, air hydrodistillation, and hydro-diffusion and gravity) to ease the process and increase the efficiency. Available data highlights the importance of various hybrid techniques (microwave + conventional ones) for the extraction of bioactive compounds from fruit & vegetable waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy 3afood waste 3afruits 3agravity 3ahydrodistillation 3amicrowave treatment 3asolvents 3asteam 3asteam distillation 3asustainable technology 3avegetable residues 0aEcofriendly 0aGreen extraction 0aSustainable 0aSolvent free extraction 0aFruit waste 0aBACs 0aMAE 0aMSD 0aSFME 0aMHG 0aMHD1 aAsif, Zarnab1 aIqbal Khan, Muhammad Kashif0 tFood bioscience.g2022 Apr., v. 46 p.101580-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2022.1015803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010800167300001600275520135800291592002801649650002201677650003701699650001501736650001501751650001401766650003101780650001401811650001601825650001801841650001501859650001501874650001901889650001301908650000701921650001501928650001701943650001601960650001301976650001401989653002602003653002102029653001402050700001302064700001502077700001602092700001702108700001702125700002302142773012102165856008202286852000902368655001202377IND60684250720221116152252.0200318e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068425072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2020.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkram, Muhammad10aAdsorptive removal of phosphate by the bimetallic hydroxide nanocomposites embedded in pomegranate peel  ap. 189-198.  aThis study aimed to fabricate new and effective material for the efficiency of phosphate adsorption. Two types of adsorbent materials, the zirconium hydroxides embedded in pomegranate peel (Zr/Peel) and zirconium-lanthanum hydroxides embedded in pomegranate peel (Zr–La/Peel) were developed. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were evaluated to give insight into the physicochemical properties of these adsorbents. Zr–La/Peel exceeded the adsorption efficiency of Zr/Peel adsorbents in batch adsorption experiments at the same pH level. The peel as a host can strive to have a strong “shielding effect” to increase the steadiness of the entrenched Zr and La elements. La and Zr are hydroxide metals that emit many hydrogen ions during the hydrolysis reaction, which contribute to protonation and electrostatic attraction. The highest adsorption capacity of La–Zr/Peel for phosphate was calculated to be 40.21 mg/g, and pseudo second-order equation is very well fitted for kinetic adsorption. Phosphate adsorption efficiency was reduced by an increase of pH. With the background of coexisting Cl⁻, little effect on adsorption efficiency was observed, while adsorption capacities were reduced by almost 20–30% with the coexistence of SO42−, NO3− and humic acid (HA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achlorides 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aequations 3ahumic acids 3ahydrogen ions 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxides 3ananocomposites 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphates 3apomegranates 3aprotonation 3asulfates 3azirconium 0aBimetallic hydroxides 0aPomegranate peel 0aPhosphate1 aXu, Xing1 aGao, Baoyu1 aYue, Qinyan1 aYanan, Shang1 aKhan, Rizwan1 aInam, Muhammad Ali0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2020 May, v. 91 p.189-198dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2020.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245011000176300001400286506002800300520085500328592002801183506003701211650001601248650001301264650001201277650001901289650000901308650001601317650001101333650002001344650001701364650001701381650001001398650001901408650002101427650001201448650002801460653001901488653002201507653001501529653000901544773020401553856009001757852000901847655001201856IND60739871520221207103145.0210106e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073987152DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.afssaae.2020.003.02.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauderes, Archie10aEnergy bill and CO2 emissions of white corn (Zea mays) production systems of Calbayog, Samar, Philippines  ap. 40-45.  aResource is Open Access  aLow production in white corn is usually encountered by many farmers due to the reduction of production areas, incidence of pest and diseases, soil degradation in terms of fertility and acidity and climate change. As the world population continues to expand, there is greater pressure on resources essential for food production, including fossil energy. Hence, quest for additional calorie food sources that will require less energy and less water are needed. Data in this study were gathered using formal survey questionnaire to account the energy bill, CO2 emissions, and identify the high consuming practices in all production stages of corn. Under the farming conditions of Calbayog, Samar, at the energy audit analyses showed that white corn had 2,822.43 Mcal or 247.28 Liter Diesel Oil Equivalent (LDOE) which emits 978.12 kg of CO2 per hectare.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhilippines 3aZea mays 3aacidity 3aclimate change 3acorn 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy 3afood production 3afood science 3afossil fuels 3apests 3aquestionnaires 3asoil degradation 3asurveys 3asustainable agriculture 0aenergy balance 0aenergy efficiency 0aenergy use 0aldoe0 tAdvances in Food Science, Sustainable Agriculture, and Agroindustrial Engineering.g2020 Dec., v. 3, no. 2 p.40-45dUniversitas Brawijaya, Fakultas Teknologi PertanianwJournal:27915x2622-59217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21776/ub.afssaae.2020.003.02.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03914naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002200184245020300206300001200409506007600421520186600497592002802363506003702391650002402428650002802452650002602480650001502506650001102521650002602532650001802558650004502576650000902621650001402630650001402644650001002658650001602668650001202684650001102696650005102707650001402758650004602772650003402818650001002852650003302862650003802895650003102933651001202964651001202976700002202988700001903010700002203029700002003051700002403071700002203095773010403117856004603221852000903267655001203276IND4461684620221207082040.0120921e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446168462DNAL7 a202190932pmid7 aPMC28451362pmcid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-52-212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTirkkonen, Taneli10aComparison of Variable-Number Tandem-Repeat Markers typing and IS1245 Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism fingerprinting of Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis from human and porcine origins  ap. 589.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Animal mycobacterioses are regarded as a potential zoonotic risk and cause economical losses world wide. M. avium subsp. hominissuis is a slow-growing subspecies found in mycobacterial infected humans and pigs and therefore rapid and discriminatory typing methods are needed for epidemiological studies. The genetic similarity of M. avium subsp. hominissuis from human and porcine origins using two different typing methods have not been studied earlier. The objective of this study was to compare the IS1245 RFLP pattern and MIRU-VNTR typing to study the genetic relatedness of M. avium strains isolated from slaughter pigs and humans in Finland with regard to public health aspects. METHODS: A novel PCR-based genotyping method, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing of eight mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs), was evaluated for its ability to characterize Finnish Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis strains isolated from pigs (n = 16) and humans (n = 13) and the results were compared with those obtained by the conventional IS1245 RFLP method. RESULTS: The MIRU-VNTR results showed a discriminatory index (DI) of 0,92 and the IS1245 RFLP resulted in DI 0,98. The combined DI for both methods was 0,98. The MIRU-VNTR test has the advantages of being simple, reproducible, non-subjective, which makes it suitable for large-scale screening of M. avium strains. CONCLUSIONS: Both typing methods demonstrated a high degree of similarity between the strains of human and porcine origin. The parallel application of the methods adds epidemiological value to the comparison of the strains and their origins. The present approach and results support the hypothesis that there is a common source of M. avium subsp. hominissuis infection for pigs and humans or alternatively one species may be the infective source to the other.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium avium 3aepidemiological studies 3agenetic relationships 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3aminisatellite repeats 3apublic health 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arisk 3ascreening 3aslaughter 3aswine 3avalue added 2aAnimals 2aHumans 2aMycobacterium aviumxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aTandem Repeat Sequencesxgenetics 2aTuberculosisxmicrobiology 3aFinland 0aFinland1 aPakarinen, Jaakko1 aRintala, Elina1 aAli-Vehmas, Terhi1 aMarttila, Harri1 aPeltoniemi, Olli AT1 aMäkinen, Johanna0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2010 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.589-589dSpringer-Verlagx1751-01477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-52-21  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010900171300001400280520171300294592002802007650001402035650001702049650001502066650002402081650001502105650001802120650001402138650001302152650001202165650001302177651001102190651001802201653001302219653001702232653001702249653001702266653001602283653001602299700002202315700002102337700001702358700002102375773010302396856008502499852000902584655001202593IND60608056820221122235142.0190408e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060805682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2015.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCameron, Erin K.10aEarthworm databases and ecological theory: Synthesis of current initiatives and main research directions  ap. 85-90.  aEarthworms are a key group of detritivores and ecosystem engineers in many ecosystems worldwide, yet we have a limited understanding of how their diversity varies globally. Synthesis of global data on earthworms would allow a range of important ecological, evolutionary, and applied questions to be addressed. We conducted a survey on global earthworm data at the 10th International Symposium on Earthworm Ecology (ISEE10) and sent an electronic survey to additional earthworm researchers. Respondents were asked about existing databases, research interests, required data, and research locations. Most researchers were aware of at least one database with earthworm data, with a total of 19 current databases being identified. Most of the top questions listed by researchers related to distributions and diversity at global scales, but traits, evolution, genetics, taxonomy, invasions, ecosystem functioning/impacts, ecotoxicology, and bioindicators were also key themes of interest. Correspondingly, distributional, environmental, and trait data were the primary data types required. Global data coverage was poor, with research being especially concentrated in Europe and the United States. Encouragingly, all researchers who currently had data indicated they would be willing to contribute it to a global database. While there are a number of key challenges associated with synthesis of earthworm data on a global scale (data limitations, taxonomic inconsistencies, logistical issues), the wide range of questions involving global data listed by researchers, and their willingness to contribute their own data, suggests there is strong interest in developing a comprehensive global database on earthworms.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3adetritivores 3aearthworms 3aecosystem engineers 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3aevolution 3agenetics 3asurveys 3ataxonomy 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0aAnnelida 0aBiodiversity 0aBiogeography 0aDistribution 0aGlobal data 0aOligochaeta1 aDecaëns, Thibaud1 aLapied, Emmanuel1 aPorco, David1 aEisenhauer, Nico0 tApplied soil ecology.g2016 Aug., v. 104 p.85-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2015.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012900172520130100301592002801602650001501630650001501645650002501660650001501685650001501700650001401715650001501729650001501744650001401759650001701773650001101790650000701801650001101808650001301819650001301832650002501845653003501870653003301905653003601938700002701974700002102001700005902022700006202081700006002143773011402203856008602317852000902403655001202412IND60745233120221119092352.0210904e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074523312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiknam, S.

The defatted pomace was further treated by ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). The optimal phenol extraction conditions of 10 min, 40% amplitude and 4% (w/v) solid:solvent ratio, yielded to 14.70 mg/g total phenols, 2.48 mg/g total flavonoids and 0.924 mmol Trolox/g antioxidant activity. In order to purify valuable biophenols, two polymeric resins (XAD4 and XAD16) and two activated charcoals (NPAC and GAC) were tested as adsorbents using a magnetic stirrer and an incubator shaker. XAD16 (100 g/L) in magnetic stirrer showed the optimal adsorption ratios with 74.36%, 39.25%, 68.79% and 100% for total phenols, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and oleuropein, respectively. Desorption using acidified 50% (v/v) ethanol-water at pH = 2.3 proved 57.65% recovery of total phenols, 19.27% of hydroxytyrosol and 45.73% of tyrosol. These results indicate that extraction and selective purification of biophenols from olive pomace can be achieved by the proposed UAE using 50% v/v ethanol-water as solvent, followed by adsorption-desorption stages with the XAD16 polymeric resin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3adesorption 3aflavonoids 3amagnetism 3aoleic acid 3aoleuropein 3aolive oil 3aolive pomace 3aolives 3apH 3aphenol 3apolymers 3asolvents 3aultrasonic treatment 0aUltrasound-assisted extraction 0aResponse surface methodology 0aPhenolics adsorption-desorption1 aKashaninejad, Mansoore1 aEscudero, Isabel1 aSanz, M.

Based on these optimised conditions, our model predicted TPC of 291.8 mg GAE/100g which was in the close agreement with experimental value of 285.2 mg GAE/100g for TPC with %CV of 2.2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCydonia oblonga 3afruits 3amathematical models 3amilk production 3aquinces 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aExtraction 0aQuince 0aRSM 0aTotal phenols1 aHussain, Peerzada Rashid1 aSuradkar, Prashant1 aMir, Nazir Ahmad0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2018 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.310-315dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.DR-14043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245012900197300001800326500002000344520160800364592002801972650001302000650003902013650001302052650001902065650002502084650002502109650001602134650002402150700002102174700002102195700002202216700001902238700002002257773011902277856007502396961001302471852000902484655001202493IND60786327820221122104050.0220803e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078632782DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.202272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Rongzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3366-317X10aCover cropping increased phosphorus stocks in surface sandy Ultisols under long‐term conservation and conventional tillage  ap. 3163-3173.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLow use‐efficiency and high environmental significance of phosphorus (P) requires a better understanding of its stocks and behavior in soils. We investigated P fractions in sandy Coastal Plain Ultisols, where long‐term conservation agriculture driven by conservation tillage and residue return for ∼40 yr and the integration of cover cropping for 4 yr has been demonstrated to improve soil organic matter. Soils were collected from fields at 0‐ to 5‐ and 5‐ to 15‐cm depths to study the effects of tillage (conservation vs. conventional) and cover crop (with vs. without) on soil stocks of various chemically defined P pools and the phosphatase potential activities. Conservation tillage increased KCl‐extractable inorganic P (KCl‐Pi) stocks in top soils (0–5 cm) when compared to conventional tillage, but had no effects on other pools at both soil depths. Cover cropping caused significant accumulations of NaOH‐extractable organic P (NaOH‐Po) in top soils (0–5 cm). Nonetheless, neither conservation tillage nor cover crop changed the contributions of the chemically defined pools to soil total P with NaOH‐Po dominating at both soil depths followed by NaOH‐extractable inorganic P (NaOH‐Pi) and HCl‐extractable Pi (HCl‐Pi). Conservation tillage increased phosphatase potential activities by 128% in the 0‐ to 5‐cm soils, whereas no cover crop effects were observed. Conservation tillage improved P availability potentially through its effects on microbial activities, whereas cover cropping increased P stocks and availability by promoting Po accumulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUltisols 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aagronomy 3acoastal plains 3aconservation tillage 3aconventional tillage 3acover crops 3asoil organic matter1 aParajuli, Binaya1 aDucey, Thomas F.1 aNovak, Jeffrey M.1 aBauer, Phil J.1 aSzogi, Ariel A.0 tAgronomy journal.g2020 July, v. 112, no. 4 p.3163-3173dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.202273Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03967naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016600163520238500329592002802714650001202742650001502754650002002769650002002789650001902809650001602828650002302844650001502867650001102882650001602893650001902909650001502928650002202943650001502965653003202980653001703012653001203029653001003041700001703051700002103068700001803089700001303107700001903120700001703139700001503156700001803171700001903189700001603208773011003224856008203334852000903416655001203425IND60768749920221119013626.0220321e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076874992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2022.1129622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuai12aA classification-based spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model for the evaluation of remotely sensed evapotranspiration in heterogeneous irrigated agricultural area  aRemotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) with high spatial and temporal resolution is frequently required to understand the regional hydrological processes, particularly in agricultural areas with complex planting structures. Most of the existing spatio-temporal fusion models lacked the fusion of ET because they ignored the physiological characteristics of the vegetation moisture condition. Therefore, we propose a classification-based spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (CSAFM) for the evaluation of remotely sensed ET in an irrigated agricultural area with a complex planting structure. This model combines the unmixing-based and weight-based fusion approaches to produce ET maps with high spatiotemporal resolution. It uses the mainstream weight-based fusion algorism—the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM)—in the fusion step. However, in contrast to the existing reflectance-based fusion algorithms, the CSAFM considers the effects of soil moisture and crop category on evapotranspiration rates. It replaces the unmixing window with an irregular hydrological response unit (HRU) containing homogeneous meteorological and irrigation conditions, and then unmixing the mixed pixels using a planting structure map. Moreover, an ET correction method was proposed in CSAFM to restore the spatial heterogeneity. The performance of CSAFM was compared to that of two mainstream fusion models using Landsat-ET and MODIS-ET based on the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL): the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion method (FSDAF). The models were validated with ground-based ET monitored by eddy covariance observed ET and Landsat inverted ET. It was found that the CSAFM model (mean MAE: 0.40 mm/day) beat the ESTARFM model (mean MAE: 0.49 mm/day) and the FSDAF (mean MAE: 0.53 mm/day) in accurately fusion ET and reproduce the details of complex surface landscapes. Additionally, CSAFM (RMSE: 0.66–1.10 mm/day) is less sensitive to the update frequency of input data in the crop growing season than ESTARFM (RMSE: 0.79–1.36 mm/day) and FSDAF (RMSE: 0.79–1.17 mm/day), indicating its suitability in areas with limited input dataset. Overall, the proposed CSAFM model can greatly improve the ET fusion accuracy in irrigated agricultural areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy balance 3aenvironment 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation 3amodels 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3aspatial variation 3avegetation 0aIrrigated agricultural area 0aFusion model 0aESTRAFM 0aFSDAF1 aWang, Chaozi1 aZhang, Chenglong1 aXue, Jingyuan1 aWang, Pu1 aWang, Xingwang1 aWang, Weishu1 aZhang, Xin1 aLi, Wangcheng1 aHuang, Guanhua1 aHuo, Zailin0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2022 May, v. 273 p.112962-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.1129623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002300146245009400169300001000263500000900273500001500282520158500297592002801882650001601910650002201926650001301948650002201961650001601983650002001999650001702019650001802036650002002054651001102074653001502085773010802100852000902208856008302217655001202300IND4380612820221118064605.0191122e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438061282DNAL7 a10.1094/CM-2003-1112-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelley, Kenneth W.10aDouble-cropping Winter Wheat and Soybean Improves Net Returns in the Eastern Great Plains  ap. 0.  aepub  a2019-12-06  aIn the eastern Great Plains, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and different soybean [Glycine max(L.) Merr.] maturity groups (MG) are grown in various cropping systems to diversify crop production. A 10-year field study was conducted in southeastern Kansas to evaluate effects of multi-cropping systems on grain yield and net economic returns. Cropping systems evaluated were: (i) annual double-cropping of wheat and soybean (MG IV); (ii) four 2-year rotations of wheat-soybean double-cropped followed by full-season soybean the next year, where the same soybean MG (I, III, IV, and V) was grown both years; and (iii) a 3-year rotation of wheat, wheat, and full-season (MG V) soybean. On average, wheat yields ranged from 51 bu/acre following early MG I soybean in the 2-year double-crop rotation to 36 bu/acre following MG IV soybean in the annual double-cropping system. Wheat yield differences were primarily determined by planting date. Full-season (MG V) soybean yields were highest (35 bu/acre) following two years of wheat in the 3-year rotation. Double-crop soybean yields in the annual double-cropping system averaged 26 bu/acre for MG IV. Full-season and double-crop soybean yields in the 2-year double-crop rotation system were significantly greater for traditional MGs (III, IV, and V) than MG I. Net economic returns averaged $101/acre for annual double-cropping, which was $10 to $25/acre higher than 2-year systems with MGs III, IV, and V; whereas, net returns were lowest for the 3-year rotation ($51/acre) and for the 2-year system with MG I soybean ($44/acre).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3acosts and returns 3asoybeans 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3amaturity groups 3awinter wheat 3acrop rotation 3adouble cropping 3aKansas 0acrop yield0 tCrop management.g2003 Nov., v. 2, no. 1 p.0-0dPlant Management NetworkwJournal:6161x1543-78337nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CM-2003-1112-01-RS3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02363naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245006700183506010400250506007600354520094100430592002801371506003701399650001601436650000901452650001301461650001901474650001101493650001201504650002701516650002601543650000901569650001101578650002001589653001101609653001001620653001301630653001401643653000801657653002601665700002601691773009401717856008501811852000901896655001201905IND60766141320221207101141.0220517e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foostr.2022.1002572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacias-Rodriguez, Braulio A.10aElastic reinforcement and yielding of starch-filled lipid gels  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany foods involve complex suspensions of assorted particles in a Newtonian liquid or viscoelastic medium. In this work, we study the case of suspensions of non-Brownian non-interacting rigid particles: starch, embedded in a soft solid: a colloidal lipid gel. We relate the macroscopic properties of the suspensions to the mechanics of the colloidal gel and the particle volume fraction. As particle volume fraction increases, the suspension gradually stiffens and becomes brittle as the system approaches its maximum packing fraction. The latter is independently determined from a geometric theory of random close packing for polydisperse hard spheres based on the log normal distribution of starch particles dispersed in oil. The elastic modulus, yield stress and yield strain are interrelated through simple scaling laws from a micromechanical homogenization analysis of hard spheres isotropically-distributed in yield stress fluids.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrittleness 3agels 3ageometry 3ahomogenization 3alipids 3aliquids 3alognormal distribution 3amodulus of elasticity 3aoils 3astarch 3aviscoelasticity 0aStarch 0aLipid 0aGranular 0aColloidal 0aGel 0aRandom-closed-packing1 aVelikov, Krassimir P.0 tFood structure.g2022 Apr., v. 32 p.100257-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23298x2213-32917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foostr.2022.1002573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245022700166520119600393592002801589650002601617650000901643650001801652650001301670650004101683650001201724650001501736650003001751650001601781653002601797653001801823653003501841653002501876653002401901700001701925700001901942700001701961773010901978856008302087852000902170655001202179IND60766141420221121175739.0220517e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Inyoung10aIdentification of the major active compounds in cinnamon bark with Plodia interpunctella repellent properties and insect-proof activity of poly(vinyl alcohol), xanthan gum, and trans-cinnamaldehyde-based strips and sachets  aPlodia interpunctella is the primary insect that penetrates food packaging during storage, causes significant economic losses, and poses great health risks to consumers. In this study, we identified the repellent compounds and component with the strongest insect-repellent activity in cinnamon bark extract using solvent–solvent partitioning, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Trans-cinnamaldehyde (TC), which was the strongest insect-repellent compound, was used to fabricate insect-proof packaging. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and xanthan gum (XG) blended with different weight mixing ratios [100:0, 90:10 (PVA90/XG10), 80:20, and 70:30] were used to fabricate strips, and the TC content and TC loading efficiency of the fabricated strips were evaluated. Thereafter, insect-proof sachets with or without the optimal TC-containing strips, which comprised PVA90/XG10, were fabricated, and their characteristics, such as the TC release profile and pest-repellent and insecticidal properties were evaluated. According to the repellent and infestation assays, TC-containing sachets can protect food from P. interpunctella infestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlodia interpunctella 3abark 3abark extracts 3acinnamon 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainsects 3ashelf life 3athin layer chromatography 3axanthan gum 0aPlodia interpunctella 0aCinnamon bark 0aSolvent–solvent partitioning 0atrans-cinnamaldehyde 0aInsect-proof sachet1 aBaek, Yunhee1 aChang, Yoonjee1 aHan, Jaejoon0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2022 June, v. 32 p.100813-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169300001800272520133100290592002801621650002401649650001401673650001601687650001501703650001301718650002701731650001801758650001401776650001001790650001701800650002101817650002101838650000901859650001901868650003001887650001401917650001801931650003201949650001201981650002201993650001302015653002402028653001702052653001302069653001302082653002202095700002202117700001902139700003202158700001702190700002302207700002202230773009902252856008602351852000902437655001202446IND60610245320221120114415.0200717e20180816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061024532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhasemi, Amir10aImmunization with a recombinant fusion protein protects mice against Helicobacter pylori infection  ap. 5124-5132.  aMore than 50% of the world's population is infected with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. If left untreated, infection with H. pylori can cause chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, which may progress into gastric cancer. Owing to the limited efficacy of anti-H. pylori antibiotic therapy in clinical practice, the development of a protective vaccine to combat this pathogen has been a tempting goal for several years. In this study, a chimeric gene coding for the antigenic parts of H. pylori FliD, UreB, VacA, and CagL was generated and expressed in bacteria and the potential of the resulting fusion protein (rFUVL) to induce humoral and cellular immune responses and to provide protection against H. pylori infection was evaluated in mice. Three different immunization adjuvants were tested along with rFUVL: CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN), Addavax, and Cholera toxin subunit B. Compared to the control group that had received PBS, vaccinated mice showed significantly higher cellular recall responses and antigen-specific IgG2a, IgG1, and gastric IgA antibody titers. Importantly, rFUVL immunized mice exhibited a reduction of about three orders of magnitude in their stomach bacterial loads. Thus, adjuvanted rFUVL might be considered as a promising vaccine candidate for the control of H. pylori infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aadjuvants 3aantibiotics 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3acell-mediated immunity 3acholera toxin 3agastritis 3agenes 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3amicrobial load 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apathogens 3apeptic ulcers 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3astomach 3astomach neoplasms 3avaccines 0aHelicobacter pylori 0aImmunization 0aChimeric 0aAdjuvant 0aFusion protection1 aMohammad, Nazanin1 aMautner, Josef1 aTaghipour Karsabet, Mehrnaz1 aAmani, Jafar1 aArdjmand, Abolfazl1 aVakili, Zarichehr0 tVaccine.g2018 Aug. 16, v. 36, no. 34 p.5124-5132dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245008700176300001600263520178600279592002802065650002202093650001802115650002002133650003502153650002202188650001602210650002202226650002402248650002002272650001102292650001202303651001102315651001102326651001102337651001902348653002402367653000802391653001102399653001302410653001202423653002702435653001602462653001102478700001802489700001902507700002202526773011102548856008702659852000902746655001202755IND60636398120221121002807.0200717e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063639812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2017.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartmann, Christina10aEuropean consumer healthiness evaluation of ‘Free-from’ labelled food products  ap. 377-388.  aThis study aimed to find out how “free-from labelling” shapes consumers’ perception of food products and whether the absence of an ingredient is considered an indicator of improved nutritional value of the product. An online survey was conducted in four European countries: the United Kingdom, Sweden, Poland, and France (overall N = 1950). Four “free-from labels” (lactose-free, gluten-free, GMO-free, and palm oil-free) were tested using different product categories that these labels typically appear on. Healthiness perception was evaluated by comparing products with the free-from labels to identical products without the labels. Potential predictors for healthiness evaluation and intention to pay a price premium were assessed, including nutrition knowledge, information-seeking on food packages, preference for food naturalness, general health interest, trust in actors in the food domain, and affect regarding the absent ingredients. Products with a free-from label were considered healthier than products without such a label, with the strongest effects occurring for labels indicating that products were free of GMOs and free of palm oil. Some differences were observed among countries in the evaluation of the product-label combinations. Information-seeking, nutrition knowledge, and affect were significant predictors of healthiness evaluation. Furthermore, healthiness evaluation, information-seeking, nutrition knowledge, and preference for naturalness predicted intention to pay a price premium for products labelled free-from. When shaping consumers’ food shopping behaviour using certain food labels, it is important to know how consumers interpret those labels. A false interpretation of labels might lead to unintended changes in consumer behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer behavior 3afood labeling 3afood purchasing 3agenetically modified organisms 3agluten-free foods 3aingredients 3alactose free diet 3anutrition knowledge 3anutritive value 3aprices 3asurveys 3aFrance 3aPoland 3aSweden 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFree-from labelling 0aGMO 0aGluten 0aPalm oil 0aLactose 0aHealthiness perception 0aNaturalness 0aAffect1 aHieke, Sophie1 aTaper, Camille1 aSiegrist, Michael0 tFood quality and preference.g2018 Sept., v. 68 p.377-388dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2017.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011200162520173000274592002802004650000902032650002002041650002002061650001202081650002602093650001502119653002202134653002702156653003502183653003802218653002702256653001402283700001602297700002502313700001902338700001702357773010902374856008302483852000902566655001202575IND60766141520221121175708.0220207e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuffo, M.10aCharacterization and production of agglomerated cork stoppers for spirits based on a factor analysis method  aThe decision-making in the investment of a new line of stoppers based on agglomerated cork requires knowledge of the composition and its contribution to its performance. For this, it is necessary to observe the leading products on the market and to test a series of prototypes with different formulations. The development of manufacturing products made by cork, such as bottle stoppers, benefits strongly from accurate chemical and structural characterizations, correlated to the final material performance. A wise starting point to fulfill such requirement consist of comparing available products in the market to be compared with different prototypes with varying composition. This work presents a blind characterization of a series of cork samples through a non-supervised exploratory analysis designed to select agglomerated corks for spirits and still wines in the packaging industry. A total of 18 batches, with 3 of them being high-end commercial products, were used to build 15 different prototypes. They were subsequently characterized with the exact composition of microgranulated cork as the unknown variable. Statistical results based on 14 parameters related to the physic-thermo-mechanical properties indicate that the suitability of selecting the stopper relies on the study of only 4 or 5 of the initial parameters. Hence, it is shown that a reduced number of parameters may be considered to properly describe the mechanical behavior of agglomerated cork, allowing the wise choice of the most convenient material for the intended application. The factorial map reveals that the only sample batch manufactured based on the tested prototypes correlates with the three of the products supplied by the competence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acork 3adecision making 3afactor analysis 3amarkets 3amechanical properties 3ashelf life 0aAgglomerated cork 0aStill wine and spirits 0aPhysical-mechanical properties 0aMultivariate statistical analysis 0aBlind characterization 0aPackaging1 aSales, D.L.1 aCortés-Triviño, E.1 ade la Mata, M.1 aJiménez, E.0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2022 Mar., v. 31 p.100815-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1008153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100011200181245013600293300001600429506007600445520115900521592002801680506003701708650002001745650001601765650001101781650001401792650001401806650001201820650002601832650002601858700001901884700001901903700002401922700002001946700002701966773012501993856007402118852000902192655001202201IND60639940820221207133027.0190503e20160808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994082DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ib00093b2doi7 aPMC49811882pmcid7 a274704422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeñalver BernabéCurrent address: Department of Surgery, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA., Beatriz10aDynamic transcription factor activity networks in response to independently altered mechanical and adhesive microenvironmental cues  ap. 844-860.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultiple aspects of the local extracellular environment profoundly affect cell phenotype and function. Physical and chemical cues in the environment trigger intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately activate transcription factors (TFs) – powerful regulators of the cell phenotype. TRACER (TRanscriptional Activity CEll aRrays) was employed for large-scale, dynamic quantification of TF activity in human fibroblasts cultured on hydrogels with a controlled elastic modulus and integrin ligand density. We identified three groups of TFs: responders to alterations in ligand density alone, substrate stiffness or both. Dynamic networks of regulatory TFs were constructed computationally and revealed distinct TF activity levels, directionality (i.e., activation or inhibition), and dynamics for adhesive and mechanical cues. Moreover, TRACER networks predicted conserved hubs of TF activity across multiple cell types, which are significantly altered in clinical fibrotic tissues. Our approach captures the distinct and overlapping effects of adhesive and mechanical stimuli, identifying conserved signaling mechanisms in normal and disease states.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell structures 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3aintegrins 3aligands 3amodulus of elasticity 3atranscription factors1 aShin, Seungjin1 aRios, Peter D.1 aBroadbelt, Linda J.1 aShea, Lonnie D.1 aSeidlits, Stephanie K.0 tIntegrative biology.g2016 Aug. 8, v. 8, no. 8 p.844-860dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ib00093b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011900154300001800273520141300291592002801704650001401732650004401746650002201790650003701812650001501849650001501864650001901879650001101898650000701909650003301916650002301949650001601972650003701988650002502025700001602050700001402066700001502080700001502095700001202110773012102122856007402243852000902317655001202326IND60631261720221119093254.0190220e20190208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063126172DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra10025j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Shuai10aPreparation of gemini surfactant/graphene oxide composites and their superior performance for Congo red adsorption  ap. 4908-4916.  aGemini surfactant/GO composites (10-2-10/GO, 12-2-12/GO, and 14-2-14/GO) have been successfully prepared using three gemini surfactants with different tail chain lengths. The morphology and physicochemical properties of the as-synthesized composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The gemini surfactant/GO composites were applied to the adsorption of Congo red dye, and from the experimental data, optimum adsorption conditions, adsorption kinetics, and isotherms were obtained. The removal process was favorable at acidic pH and reached equilibrium in ∼60 min. The results showed that the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm were a good fit for the adsorption of Congo red onto gemini surfactant/GO composites. Compared with other adsorbents reported in the literature, these composites showed superior Congo red adsorption capabilities, with absorption capacities as high as 2116, 2193, and 2325 mg g⁻¹ for 10-2-10/GO, 12-2-12/GO, and 14-2-14/GO, respectively. Moreover, the adsorption capacities were more than 1000 mg g⁻¹ even for the fifth cycle. The results of the present study substantiate that the gemini surfactant/GO composites are promising adsorbents for the removal of organic dyes in wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCongo red 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3agraphene oxide 3amodels 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater treatment1 aLiu, Xingli1 aYan, Ping1 aWang, Anqi1 aSu, Jinzhu1 aSu, Xin0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 08, v. 9, no. 9 p.4908-4916dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra10025j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245011900204300001600323520117700339592002801516650001501544650002501559650001301584650002101597650001101618650001801629650001601647650001501663650003701678650001401715650001401729650002401743650003601767700001101803700001901814700001501833700001901848700001401867700001601881700001601897700001401913700001201927700001701939700001701956773012701973856007402100852000902174655001202183IND60639940920221121233934.0190503e20160912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994092DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ib00097e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJinThese authors contributed equally to this work., Meiling10aToll-like receptor 2-mediated MAPKs and NF-κB activation requires the GNAO1-dependent pathway in human mast cells  ap. 968-975.  aToll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on mast cells are essential for effective host defense against a wide variety of pathogens. Previous studies have demonstrated that both TLR2 agonists Pam3CSK4 and PGN stimulated IL-8 release in human mast cells. To determine the molecular basis for this phenomenon, we utilized human mast cell line LAD2 cells. We found that only the release of IL-8 stimulated by Pam3CSK4 was TLR2-mediated, which was confirmed by specific TLR2 shRNA. Heterotrimeric G proteins have been previously implicated in TLR signaling in macrophages and monocytes. In the current study, we showed that PamCSK4 induced the activation of MAPKs, NF-κB, PI3K-Akt and Ca²⁺-calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascades in LAD2 cells. Gₒ proteins were required for the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB in TLR2 stimulated LAD2 cells. Therefore, the genetic depletion of Gαₒ proteins also led to the reduction of the release of IL-8 in LAD2 cells. Taken together, the data presented here suggest that TLR2 activation in human mast cells promotes the release of inflammatory mediators via distinct signaling pathways that partially depend on the action of Gₒ proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-proteins 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aagonists 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-8 3amacrophages 3amast cells 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amonocytes 3apathogens 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aYu, Bo1 aZhang, Weizhen1 aZhang, Wei1 aXiao, Zhangang1 aMao, Zhuo1 aLai, Yihong1 aLin, Dongxu1 aMa, Qiang1 aPan, En1 aZhang, Yarui1 aYu, Yangyang0 tIntegrative biology.g2016 Sept. 12, v. 8, no. 9 p.968-975dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ib00097e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007000168300001400238520113700252592002801389650001601417650002701433650001501460651002201475653002601497653002201523653001101545653001101556653001301567653001201580700002001592773010601612856008501718852000901803655001201812IND60607427920221120022530.0180904e20160808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060742792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharon, Gonen14aThe emergence of the Acheulian in Europe – A look from the east  ap. 25-33.  aAfter nearly 150 years of research, many aspects of the emergence of the Acheulian techno-complex in Europe are still under debate. They include: the chronology of the appearance of the Acheulian, its geographical origin, the technology and typology of its assemblages, the actual stages (if any) of its development and the tempo and intensity of its spread into Europe. In this paper, we offer an eastern perspective for exploring these issues. We examine the European evidence in light of the current knowledge of the Lower Paleolithic sequence in the Levant. The primary contribution of this viewpoint is the identification of a ‘Large Flake’ stage within the European Acheulian which, we suggest, should be seen as the earliest stage of the Acheulian presence in this part of the world. While well-defined elsewhere, the Large Flake Acheulian sites of Europe are found primarily in the Iberian Peninsula.

The Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein levels of genotype Chinese Holstein dairy cows. The results showed that one SNP -105G>A was detected, designating three genotypes (GG, GA and AA) with respective frequencies of 0.38, 0.46, and 0.16. The significant association of the SNP -105G>A with somatic cell score (SCS) was identified. Genotype GG had a significantly lower SCS than genotype GA or AA (P < 0.01), and the relative mRNA expression and protein level of GG was found to be the highest. These results suggest that the genotype GG may be a useful genetic marker for mastitis resistance selection and breeding in Chinese Holstein dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aWestern blotting 3abovine mastitis 3abreeding 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3adisease resistance 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3ainterleukin-8 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asomatic cells 3aChina 0aChinese holstein 0aInterleukin 8 0aMastitis 0aPolymorphism 0aSomatic cell score1 aWang, Zhenzhen1 aYang, Zhangping1 aZhu, Xiaorong1 aJi, Dejun1 aMao, Yongjiang0 tAnimal biotechnology.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 26, no. 2 p.143-147dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10495398.2014.9396573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245012400203300002000327500001900347520131700366592002801683650002401711650002101735650002501756650001701781650001901798650004101817650004301858650001101901650000701912650002401919650001501943650001901958650002901977653001602006653001502022653002102037653002402058653003202082653005102114700005902165700006002224773015002284856008002434852000902514655001202523IND60718044920221120224819.0201118e20200205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071804492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b076892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMertens, Nils1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9769-134010aOxidative Fragmentation of Aspalathin Leads to the Formation of Dihydrocaffeic Acid and the Related Lysine Amide Adduct  ap. 13111-13120.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present study, the degradation of C-glucosidic dihydrochalcone aspalathin as the major phenolic compound in rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) was investigated. Analyses by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry of aqueous aspalathin–lysine incubations after silylation showed the formation of dihydrocaffeic acid [3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid] under oxidative conditions as a novel degradation product up to 10 mol %. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed the concurrent formation of the dihydrocaffeic acid lysine amide at about 30-fold lower concentrations, which was unequivocally verified by synthesis of an authentic reference standard. The amide was also verified in aspalathin–protein incubations after enzymatic hydrolysis by high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analyses. Thus, the covalent interaction of phenolic plant compounds with proteins under mild conditions (ambient temperatures and neutral pH) was confirmed for the first time. Acid and free amide were also quantitated in rooibos teas with significantly higher values in fermented varieties. The mechanism of formation was clarified to be initiated by singlet oxygen and to include a rearrangement–fragmentation mechanism with 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene as the counterpart.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspalathus linearis 3achemical bonding 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alysine 3apH 3areference standards 3asilylation 3asinglet oxygen 3atandem mass spectrometry 0arooibos tea 0aaspalathin 0adihydrochalcones 0adihydrocaffeic acid 0apolyphenol−protein adduct 0ahigh-performance countercurrent chromatography1 aHeymann, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9472-86111 aGlomb, Marcus A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8826-08080 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Feb. 05, v. 68, no. 46 p.13111-13120dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b076893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013500171300001400306520128200320592002801602650002201630650001101652650001401663650003801677650001301715650002101728650002601749650001901775650001101794650003301805650001201838650001201850650001601862650001501878653001901893653000801912653002701920653001401947653002701961653003401988700002302022700002202045700002202067700001902089700006302108773010102171856008102272852000902353655001202362IND60604075120221117063805.0180716e20150220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060407512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2014.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchumacher, Philipp10aQuench-induced precipitates in Al–Si alloys: Calorimetric determination of solute content and characterisation of microstructure  ap. 63-73.  aThe present study introduces an experimental approach to investigate mechanical properties of well-defined non-equilibrium states of Al–Si alloys during cooling from solution annealing. The precipitation behaviour of binary Al–Si alloys during the cooling process has been investigated in a wide cooling rate range (2–0.0001K/s) with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). To access the low cooling rate range close to equilibrium an indirect DSC measurement method is introduced. Based on the enthalpy change measured by DSC a physically-based model for the calculation of remaining solute Si amount as function of temperature and cooling rate is presented. Microstructural analyses via light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atom probe tomography and X-ray diffraction have been performed to evaluate the introduced model and for information on cooling rate dependent precipitate formation. It was found that quench-induced particles of different morphology are formed during cooling. Thermomechanical analyses on clearly distinct undercooled Al–Si states show that flow stress during cooling is dependent on temperature as well as cooling rate. The mechanical behaviour is therefore influenced by solute Si content and quench-induced precipitates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalloys 3aannealing 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenthalpy 3alight microscopy 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3asolutes 3atemperature 3atomography 0aAl–Si alloys 0aDSC 0aPrecipitation enthalpy 0aModelling 0aMicrostructure control 0aMechanical properties testing1 aPogatscher, Stefan1 aStarink, Marco J.1 aSchick, Christoph1 aMohles, Volker1 aMilkereit, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4896-623X0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Feb. 20, v. 602 p.63-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2014.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012500154300001800279520108700297592002801384650002201412650001001434650001301444650002001457650001401477650001301491650001001504650002201514650003301536650001601569650001201585700001701597700001801614700001401632700001601646700002001662700001301682773012101695856007401816852000901890655001201899IND60631262120221119093324.0190220e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063126212DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra10059d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Dan10aLuminescence properties and energy transfer of K₃LuF₆:Tb³⁺,Eu³⁺ multicolor phosphors with a cryolite structure  ap. 4295-4302.  aIn recent years, compounds with a cryolite structure have become excellent hosts for luminescent materials. In this paper, Tb³⁺ doped and Tb³⁺/Eu³⁺ co-doped K₃LuF₆ phosphors were prepared via a high temperature solid phase sintering method. The XRD, SEM, as well as photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and emission (PL) spectra were measured to investigate the structure and luminescence properties of the as-prepared samples. In the Tb³⁺/Eu³⁺ co-doped K₃LuF₆ samples, both characteristic emission spectra of Tb³⁺ and Eu³⁺ could be observed and the emission color of the K₃LuF₆:0.12Tb³⁺,xEu³⁺ phosphors could be adjusted from green to yellowish pink and the corresponding CIE values could be regulated from (0.2781, 0.5407) in the green area to (0.4331, 0.3556) in the yellowish pink area by controlling the concentration ratio of Eu³⁺/Tb³⁺. In addition, the energy transfer mechanism in Tb³⁺/Eu³⁺ co-doped K₃LuF₆ was calculated to be a quadrupole–quadrupole interaction from Tb³⁺ to Eu³⁺ based on the Dexter's equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acolor 3acryolite 3aenergy transfer 3aequations 3aeuropium 3ahosts 3aphotoluminescence 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3aterbium1 aLiao, Libing1 aGuo, Qingfeng1 aMei, Lefu1 aLiu, Haikun1 aZhou, Tianshuai1 aYe, Huan0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 9, no. 8 p.4295-4302dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra10059d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245010400205300001400309520158000323592002801903650001101931650001501942650001301957650001101970650001401981650001501995650001402010650001002024650002102034650001502055650000902070651002502079651001002104653002402114653001502138653001702153653001502170653001002185653001002195700001702205700001502222700001302237700001402250773010602264856008502370852000902455655001202464IND60607428520221117163401.0180904e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060742852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalvo, F.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5834-144410aGranulometrical, mineralogical and geochemical characterization of loess deposits in the Tajo Basin  ap. 14-28.  aLoess research has the merit of enabling reconstructions of Pleistocene sedimentation dynamics in many parts of the world. However, there is still very few information regarding the occurrence of loess deposits in the Mediterranean area, even though such records may provide a unique opportunity to investigate landscape evolution for a period for which terrestrial archives are very rare in this region. This paper presents the first results of investigations on a loess sequence in the middle Tajo Valley in central Spain. Findings from detailed granulometrical, mineralogical, geochemical, and grain morphological analyses help to give a first overview on character and composition of these deposits. Very high levels of carbonates (∼60%), but also of gypsum, both to large extents of primary origin, indicate the incorporation of material derived from marls and limestone. Furthermore, we found evidence that allows deduction of possible loess proveniences more precisely. Dolomite contents of up to 20% indicate that the Iberian Range might have been an important source area of loess sediments. The fact that these uplands are located to the east seems to be opposed to the common assumption of prevailing west winds for glacial periods. The studied sequence (Paraiso profile) is one of seven sections that have been investigated as part of a programme to reconstruct Upper Pleistocene landscape dynamics in central Spain. In this context, the detailed characterisation of sediment properties is crucial for discussing loess proveniences and sedimentary environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acarbonates 3adolomite 3agypsum 3ahighlands 3alandscapes 3alimestone 3aloess 3aloess deposition 3aprovenance 3awind 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 0aGrain-size analysis 0aMineralogy 0aGeochemistry 0aCarbonates 0aLoess 0aSpain1 aSánchez, J.1 aAcosta, A.1 aWolf, D.1 aFaust, D.0 tQuaternary international.g2016 July 02, v. 407 p.14-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100007800146245014100224300001800365500001900383520122400402592002801626650002801654650001501682650001301697650002101710650001101731650002001742650002201762650001701784700005801801700002101859700001901880700002201899700002401921700006601945773013602011856008002147852000902227655001202236IND60731243220210618000000.0210318e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073124322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c098352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatnahalli Gangadharappa, Sathish1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8317-283010aIntermolecular Interactions and Self-Assembly in Pt(II) Complex–Nanoclay Hybrids as Luminescent Reporters for Spectrally Resolved PLIM  ap. 5739-5747.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEfficient shielding of phosphorescent transition metal complexes against diffusion-controlled collisional quenching by triplet molecular dioxygen as well as reduction of microenvironment-related radiationless deactivation pathways is crucial for their applications in bioimaging and optoelectronics. In this report, we present a straightforward yet efficient approach to safeguard emissive triplet states from external influences by adsorbing phosphorescent Pt(II) complexes onto a layered nanoclay, namely Laponite. These hybrids facilitate the dispersion of otherwise insoluble transition metal complexes in aqueous media while shielding them from physical quenching. Self-assembly of the nanoclay and intermolecular stacking between molecules adsorbed at different nanodisc units are mirrored in the photophysical, colloidal, and morphological properties of the hybrids, which were herein characterized by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and atomic force microscopy. We also show that the hybrids are noncytotoxic and can be exploited as luminescent reporters in spectrally resolved phosphorescence lifetime imaging implemented by confocal optical microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3abioimaging 3alaponite 3alight microscopy 3aoxygen 3aphosphorescence 3aphotoluminescence 3aspectroscopy1 aMaisuls, Iván1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6494-14461 aSalto, Ileana P.1 aNiemann, Silke1 aBachtin, Viktoria1 aHerrmann, Fabian C.1 aStrassert, Cristian A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1964-01690 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 125, no. 10 p.5739-5747dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c098353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245006900168300001800237520142800255592002801683650002201711650001201733650001901745650001401764650002301778650002001801650001901821650001001840650002401850650001801874650001501892650001301907650001701920650003301937650001101970650001701981650001601998700005402014700001302068773012002081856008702201852000902288655001202297IND60673199920221120074057.0191018e20191008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067319992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b025652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Meiqiu10aDecarboxylation of Oleic Acid over Ordered Mesoporous Pt/SAPO-11  ap. 9956-9964.  aOrdered mesoporous SAPO-11 molecular sieves (OMSMS) with a single mesoporous structure were prepared via a one-step hydrothermal method. Metal–acid bifunctional Pt/SAPO-11 (Pt/OMSMS-700) catalysts with Pt loadings of 1% and 2% were synthesized by a deposition–precipitation method using OMSMS-700 as a carrier. The OMSMS and Pt/OMSMS-700 were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (N₂-BET) analysis, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). TEM and small-angle XRD results revealed that the degree of order in the OMSMS increased as the calcination temperature increased from 500 to 700 °C. The N₂-BET analysis revealed that the OMSMS had a mesoporous structure with an average pore diameter of 6.4–7.8 nm and a BET surface area of 149–171 m²/g. The sizes of the Pt nanoparticles supported on OMSMS-700 were in the range of 3 to 6 nm and displayed good dispersibility. The catalytic performance of Pt/OMSMS-700 during the decarboxylation of oleic acid to form C8–C17 alkanes under a CO₂ atmosphere was investigated. As the reaction temperature increased from 320 to 360 °C, the total yield of C8–C17 alkanes initially increased and then decreased. Increasing the Pt loading led to an increased yield of C8–C17 alkanes. The total yield of C8–C17 alkanes reached 78% when 2 wt % Pt/OMSMS-700 was used at 340 °C for 3 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkanes 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adecarboxylation 3adispersibility 3afuels 3ahot water treatment 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3aplatinum 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asieves 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aYuan, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0342-52421 aLiu, Wei0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Oct. 08, v. 33, no. 10 p.9956-9964dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b025653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245010200158300001800260520129700278592002801575650001501603650001501618650001401633650003801647650001701685650001901702650001901721650001801740650002501758700001401783700001401797700001501811700005401826700001201880700005601892700005801948773014702006856007602153852000902229655001202238IND60639213820221121224331.0190501e20190405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063921382DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b006882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiachao10aAutomated Stoichiometry Analysis of Single-Molecule Fluorescence Imaging Traces via Deep Learning  ap. 6976-6985.  aThe stoichiometry of protein complexes is precisely regulated in cells and is fundamental to protein function. Singe-molecule fluorescence imaging based photobleaching event counting is a new approach for protein stoichiometry determination under physiological conditions. Due to the interference of the high noise level and photoblinking events, accurately extracting real bleaching steps from single-molecule fluorescence traces is still a challenging task. Here, we develop a novel method of using convolutional and long-short-term memory deep learning neural network (CLDNN) for photobleaching event counting. We design the convolutional layers to accurately extract features of steplike photobleaching drops and long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent layers to distinguish between photobleaching and photoblinking events. Compared with traditional algorithms, CLDNN shows higher accuracy with at least 2 orders of magnitude improvement of efficiency, and it does not require user-specified parameters. We have verified our CLDNN method using experimental data from imaging of single dye-labeled molecules in vitro and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) on cells. Our CLDNN method is expected to provide a new strategy to stoichiometry study and time series analysis in chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3ableaching 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3aphotobleaching 3astoichiometry 3atime series analysis1 aQin, Gege1 aLuo, Fang1 aWang, Lina1 aZhao, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2169-39531 aLi, Nan1 aYuan, Jinghe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6456-76961 aFang, Xiaohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2018-05420 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Apr. 05, v. 141, no. 17 p.6976-6985dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b006883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012900171300001800300500001500318520195100333592002802284650001602312650001802328650002902346650002402375650002502399650001202424650001302436650002102449650001202470650002002482650001802502650001802520650001302538650001202551650000902563651001002572653003602582653002902618653001102647653001902658653002002677700001702697700001802714700002502732773013102757856008402888852000902972655001202981IND60121786520221117200518.0150325e20131011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012178652DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.8035612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDharumarajan, S.10aWater-Retention Characteristics and Available Water Capacity in Three Cropping Systems of Lower Indo-Gangetic Alluvial Plain  ap. 2734-2745.  a2019-12-04  aThis study was conducted in Chinchura-Mogra and Polba-Dapur Blocks of Hugli District, West Bengal to determine the changes in cropping systems on water-retention characteristics (WRC) and available water capacity (AWC) and their relations with other soil properties. In the present study, three sites contained adjacent cropping systems of banana and mango orchard, paddy–paddy, and paddy–potato–vegetables were selected. Soil samples were collected from depths of 0–30 and 30–60 cm in three representative sites of each cropping system with three replications guided by land use and soil map of study area. Analysis of variance was performed to compare the impact of cropping systems on available water content and water-retention characteristics. The mean clay content was greater both on the surface (61.70%) and in the subsurface (55.06%) in the soils under the paddy–paddy cropping system than banana and mango orchard and paddy–potato–vegetable cropping systems. Paddy–potato–vegetables cropping system (0.55%) has lower soil organic carbon compared to the banana and mango orchard (0.63 %) and paddy–paddy cropping system (0.65%) at 0–30 cm deep, whereas no significant difference in soil organic carbon was recorded in 30–60 cm deep. The results of available water capacity indicated that paddy–paddy cropping system recorded lower available water capacity at both ranges of depth. Available water capacity is significantly positively correlated with silt and organic carbon. The results of water-retention studies indicated that 75 and 85% of available water was removed from the soil of paddy–potato–vegetable cropping system by 0.5 M Pa at 0–30 and 30–60 cm deep, respectively, whereas only 56–62% of available water was removed by 0.5 M Pa in the other two systems. The results show that the paddy–potato–vegetable cropping system is more vulnerable to moisture stress during drought periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aclay fraction 3aavailable water capacity 3asoil organic carbon 3aanalysis of variance 3amangoes 3asoil map 3acropping systems 3adrought 3aalluvial plains 3awater content 3asoil sampling 3aland use 3abananas 3asilt 3aIndia 0awater-retention characteristics 0aAvailable water capacity 0acarbon 0aorganic carbon 0acropping system1 aSingh, S.

The knowledge of macroglass molding process no longer applies to the fabrication of glass microparts by hot embossing. To investigate the size effect of the mold cavity on glass flow behavior during squeeze flow, patterned molds with different length scales and shapes were used for glass embossing. The experimental results demonstrated that glass structures with ultrafine and atomic scale surface could be fabricated by using precision embossing. The nanostructures of embossed glass at 100 and 500 nm wide cavity were found to exhibit nanoscale effect during squeeze flow. Molecular confinement accelerates the tectonic deformation of embossed glass at smaller length scales. At the microscale filling, the tectonic deformation of embossed glass is mainly dominated by elastic recovery, surface tension, hydrostatic pressure, and viscous flow. As the length scale reduces to submicron, the dual-peak filling mode gradually transfers to the single-peak filling mode. Additionally, deformation modes have little influence on the shapes of the mold cavity. This work sheds light on the fabrication of glass nano/microstructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aglass 3ahydrostatic pressure 3amicrostructure 3ananomaterials 3asurface tension 3atectonics 0ahot embossing 0aglass flow behavior 0asize effect 0afilling modes 0aglass nanostructures1 aXu, Gang1 aLiu, Xiaohua1 aGong, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1796-90990 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 23, v. 12, no. 32 p.36311-36319dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c084353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245009600201300001800297506007600315520147200391592002801863506003701891650001001928650001501938650002301953650001701976650001601993650001502009650001102024650001902035650001202054700002402066700001902090700002402109700002502133773012902158856007402287852000902361655001202370IND60639941620221207122430.0190503e20161010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994162DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ib00120c2doi7 aPMC50965852pmcid7 a277139972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLam, Ngoc Thien10aValve interstitial cell contractile strength and metabolic state are dependent on its shape  ap. 1079-1089.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe role of valvular interstitial cell (VIC) architecture in regulating cardiac valve function and pathology is not well understood. VICs are known to be more elongated in a hypertensive environment compared to those in a normotensive environment. We have previously reported that valve tissues cultured under hypertensive conditions are prone to acute pathological alterations in cell phenotype and contractility. We therefore aimed to rigorously study the relationship between VIC shape, contractile output and other functional indicators of VIC pathology. We developed an in vitro model to engineer VICs to take on the same shapes as those seen in normal and hypertensive conditions. VICs with longer cellular and nuclear shapes, as seen in hypertensive conditions, had greater contractile response to endothelin-1 that correlated with increased anisotropy of the actin architecture. These elongated VICs also demonstrated altered cell metabolism through a decreased optical redox ratio, which coincided with increased cellular proliferation. In the presence of actin polymerization inhibitor, however, these functional responses were significantly reduced, suggesting the important role of cytoskeletal actin organization in regulating cellular responses to abnormal shape.

Their particular features, such as shallowness, relative isolation and protection from the sea, and the presence of boundaries with strong physical and ecological gradients help explain this high productivity. Despite the fact that coastal lagoons are among the most studied ecosystems in the world, our knowledge on fisheries in coastal lagoons or why some lagoons capable of maintaining profitable fisheries seem inadequate for intensive aquaculture remains limited. Scarce, too, is our knowledge of the characteristics of target species, their exploitation status, and the ecological processes that are affected by fisheries or that influence them, including the impact of human activities or climatic change. Here, we review present day knowledge on lagoon fisheries and analyse gaps in the science, stressing the need for adequate management of these important resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquaculture 3aclimate change 3acoastal water 3aecosystems 3afisheries1 aMarcos del Olmo, María Concepción,0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Sept. 10, v. 110 p.15-31dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.05.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245018700205300001400392520207600406592002802482650001302510650001602523650001502539650001802554651001202572651002802584653002502612653003102637653003402668653002302702653001502725700002002740700002102760773010602781856008502887852000902972655001202981IND60607428720221122065518.0180904e20160625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060742872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreau, Luc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2357-859910aDid prehistoric foragers behave in an economically irrational manner? Raw material availability and technological organisation at the early Gravettian site of Willendorf II (Austria)  ap. 84-94.  aWillendorf II provides the longest and best-studied MIS 3 sequence in the Middle Danube region, and represents one of the key reference sequences for this time period in Central Europe. The assemblage chosen for analysis derives from archaeological horizon (AH) 5, attributed to the period of the first Gravettian between 30 and 27 ka uncal. BP. Previous analyses were all based on a selected inventory (mainly tools and cores) derived from the 1908/1909 excavations. The discovery of labelled wooden boxes containing numerous additional artefacts from the 1908/1909 excavations at the end of the 1990s in the cellar of the Natural History Museum in Vienna considerably raises the total number of finds for all archaeological horizons, and opens new perspectives for investigating Upper Palaeolithic behavioural variability in the Middle Danube region. For the first time, all artefacts have been assigned to a raw material source area, thus providing a picture of the geographic extent of the foraging territory, and allowing for quantified observations on raw material economy and technological variability in the early Gravettian of the Middle Danube region. Willendorf II provides an excellent basis for the study of Gravettian lithic assemblage variability due to the wide array of local and nonlocal lithic resources available at varying distances from the settlement. Source provenance information and patterns of raw material use offer complementary measures of mobility. We discuss the results in the light of the concepts of “technological provisioning” developed by S.L. Kuhn. Distance to source alone is not suitable to predict and explain raw material frequencies and the character of transported technologies on nonlocal material at Willendorf II-AH5. We argue that other factors such as the degree of anticipation of foreseeable activities and occupation span might account for the observed economic patterns. Our results clearly have broader relevance for understanding assemblage variability in the Gravettian of Central Europe and further afield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforaging 3ainventories 3aprovenance 3araw materials 3aAustria 3aCentral European region 0aRaw material economy 0aTechnological provisioning 0aBlank selection and transport 0aUpper Palaeolithic 0aGravettian1 aBrandl, Michael1 aNigst, Philip R.0 tQuaternary international.g2016 June 25, v. 406 p.84-94dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100005400191245010500245300001800350506007600368520165000444592002802094506003702122650001102159650001002170650001502180650001902195650001602214650002102230650001202251650000902263650001902272650002402291700002302315700002102338700002402359700002102383700001702404773012802421856008502549852000902634655001202643IND60598661120221207111724.0181020e20180523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059866112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b011342doi7 aPMC68304442pmcid7 a297907412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8882-636210aEntrapment of Prostate Cancer Circulating Tumor Cells with a Sequential Size-Based Microfluidic Chip  ap. 7526-7534.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCirculating tumor cells (CTCs) are broadly accepted as an indicator for early cancer diagnosis and disease severity. However, there is currently no reliable method available to capture and enumerate all CTCs as most systems require either an initial CTC isolation or antibody-based capture for CTC enumeration. Many size-based CTC detection and isolation microfluidic platforms have been presented in the past few years. Here we describe a new size-based, multiple-row cancer cell entrapment device that captured LNCaP-C4-2 prostate cancer cells with >95% efficiency when in spiked mouse whole blood at ∼50 cells/mL. The capture ratio and capture limit on each row was optimized and it was determined that trapping chambers with five or six rows of micro constriction channels were needed to attain a capture ratio >95%. The device was operated under a constant pressure mode at the inlet for blood samples which created a uniform pressure differential across all the microchannels in this array. When the cancer cells deformed in the constriction channel, the blood flow temporarily slowed down. Once inside the trapping chamber, the cancer cells recovered their original shape after the deformation created by their passage through the constriction channel. The CTCs reached the cavity region of the trapping chamber, such that the blood flow in the constriction channel resumed. On the basis of this principle, the CTCs will be captured by this high-throughput entrapment chip (CTC-HTECH), thus confirming the potential for our CTC-HTECH to be used for early stage CTC enrichment and entrapment for clinical diagnosis using liquid biopsies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiopsy 3ablood 3ablood flow 3ablood sampling 3adeformation 3adisease severity 3aliquids 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aprostatic neoplasms1 aFoster, Brittni M.1 aGhassemi, Parham1 aStrobl, Jeannine S.1 aKerr, Bethany A.1 aAgah, Masoud0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 May 23, v. 90, no. 12 p.7526-7534dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b011343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010100167300001800268520091500286592002801201650002001229650001601249650001401265650001301279650001501292650001601307650001501323650000901338650001101347650002001358650001201378653002501390653003101415653003301446653002301479700002001502700001801522700001701540773013101557856008401688852000901772655001201781IND60121786620221117200604.0150325e20131011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012178662DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.8115152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seul Bi10aImpacts of Molybdate Unreactive Phosphorus on Phosphate Release from Intensively Fertilized Soil  ap. 2746-2756.  aTotal phosphorus (P) in soil is classified as molybdate-reactive P (MRP) and molybdate-unreactive P (MUP) based on bioavailability, and P tests are generally focused on MRP fraction of soil, despite the fact that MUP can contribute significantly to total extracted P. This survey study indicated that water-soluble P (WP) contributed as much as 9% to total P (TP) in two intensively fertilized (rice–onion cropping upland and greenhouse) soils, and most (ca. 80%) of WP was present in MUP form. The total P lost through runoff and leaching was high (>5 ppm), due to rotating greenhouse into submerged paddy soil, especially at the initial stage of rice cultivation, and MUP contributed 43% and 77% to total P lost through runoff and leaching, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor MUP to develop suitable soil-management strategies to reduce MUP release and P loss from high-P-containing soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3agreenhouses 3ahighlands 3aleaching 3amolybdates 3apaddy soils 3aphosphorus 3arice 3arunoff 3asoil management 3asurveys 0aDissolved phosphorus 0amolybdate-reactive P (MRP) 0amolybdate-unreactive P (MUP) 0aphosphorus release1 aLee, Chang Hoon1 aLee, Yong Bok1 aKim, Pil Joo0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2013 Oct. 11, v. 44, no. 18 p.2746-2756dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.8115153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009300168300001600261520133300277592002801610650001301638650001201651650001901663650001901682650001601701650001501717650002301732650002401755650002701779650002201806650002601828650001601854650002201870650001401892650001401906650001901920650001601939650002301955700002501978700002302003700002102026700002102047773009502068856008102163852000902244655001202253IND60519524520221121010312.0160503e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051952452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-016-1606-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasegawa, Tomoko10aEconomic implications of climate change impacts on human health through undernourishment  ap. 189-202.  aThis study quantified the impacts of climate change on human health through undernourishment using two economic measures. First, changes in morbidity and mortality due to nine diseases caused by being underweight as a child were analyzed using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with changes in the labor force, population, and demands for healthcare taken into consideration. Second, changes in mortality were taken from the CGE simulation and assessed economically by the value of lives lost and willingness to pay to reduce the risk. Model uncertainties in future crop yields and climate conditions were considered using future projections from six global crop models and five global climate models. We found that the economic valuation of healthy lives lost due to undernourishment under climate change was equivalent to −0.4 % to 0.0 % of global gross domestic product (GDP) and was regionally heterogeneous, ranging from −4.0 % to 0.0 % of regional GDP in 2100. In contrast, the actual economic losses associated with the effects of additional health expenditure and the decrease in the labor force due to undernourishment resulting from climate change corresponded to a − 0.1 % to 0.0 % change in GDP and a − 0.2 % to 0.0 % change in household consumption, respectively, at the global level.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3aeconomic valuation 3afinancial economics 3agross domestic product 3ahealth care costs 3ahousehold consumption 3alabor force 3amodel uncertainty 3amorbidity 3amortality 3arisk reduction 3aunderweight 3awillingness to pay1 aFujimori, Shinichiro1 aTakahashi, Kiyoshi1 aYokohata, Tokuta1 aMasui, Toshihiko0 tClimatic change.g2016 May, v. 136, no. 2 p.189-202dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-016-1606-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007100159300001800230520128000248592002801528650001501556650001701571650002101588650002301609650001401632650001701646650001101663650001301674700002401687700002101711700002301732700001701755700001801772700002301790700001601813700002201829773012801851856007401979852000902053655001202062IND60639941720221121201547.0190503e20161107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994172DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ib00125d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLunova, Mariia10aModulation of collective cell behaviour by geometrical constraints  ap. 1099-1110.  aIntracellular and extracellular mechanical forces play a crucial role during tissue growth, modulating nuclear shape and function and resulting in complex collective cell behaviour. However, the mechanistic understanding of how the orientation, shape, symmetry and homogeneity of cells are affected by environmental geometry is still lacking. Here we investigate cooperative cell behaviour and patterns under geometric constraints created by topographically patterned substrates. We show how cells cooperatively adopt their geometry, shape, positioning of the nucleus and subsequent proliferation activity. Our findings indicate that geometric constraints induce significant squeezing of cells and nuclei, cytoskeleton reorganization, drastic condensation of chromatin resulting in a change in the cell proliferation rate and the anisotropic growth of cultures. Altogether, this work not only demonstrates complex non-trivial collective cellular responses to geometrical constraints but also provides a tentative explanation of the observed cell culture patterns grown on different topographically patterned substrates. These findings provide important fundamental knowledge, which could serve as a basis for better controlled tissue growth and cell-engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acell culture 3acell engineering 3acell proliferation 3achromatin 3acytoskeleton 3aforces 3ageometry1 aZablotskii, Vitalii1 aDempsey, Nora M.1 aDevillers, Thibaut1 aJirsa, Milan1 aSyková, Eva,1 aKubinová, Šárka1 aLunov, Oleg1 aDejneka, Alexandr0 tIntegrative biology.g2016 Nov. 7, v. 8, no. 11 p.1099-1110dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ib00125d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245009200202300001400294506007600308520182100384592002802205506003702233650001402270650002002284650002202304650001302326650001402339650002002353650002102373650001102394650001202405650002402417650001902441651001802460653001402478653001602492653001202508653001502520653002302535700002402558700002502582700002402607700001802631700001702649700002502666700002202691773011502713856007702828852000902905655001202914IND60559009020221207134322.0170124e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900902DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2016.01362doi7 aPMC52788062pmcid7 a278750762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Junghyun10aCorrelates of Resource Empowerment among Parents of Children with Overweight or Obesity  ap. 63-71.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Few studies have examined correlates of resource empowerment among parents of children with overweight or obesity.Methods: We studied baseline data of 721 parent–child pairs participating in the Connect for Health randomized trial being conducted at six pediatric practices in Massachusetts. Parents completed the child weight management subscale (n = 5 items; 4-point response scale) of the Parent Resource Empowerment Scale; items were averaged to create a summary empowerment score. We used linear regression to examine the independent effects of child (age, sex, and race/ethnicity), parent/household characteristics (age, education, annual household income, BMI category, perceived stress, and their ratings of their healthcare quality), and neighborhood median household income, on parental resource empowerment.Results: Mean (SD) child age was 7.7 years (2.9) and mean (SD) BMI z-score was 1.9 (0.5); 34% of children were white, 32% black, 22% Hispanic, 5% Asian, and 6% multiracial/other. The mean parental empowerment score was 2.95 (SD = 0.56; range = 1–4). In adjusted models, parents of older children [β −0.03 (95% CI: −0.04, −0.01)], Hispanic children [−0.14 (−0.26, −0.03)], those with annual household income less than $20,000 [−0.16 (−0.29, −0.02)], those with BMI ≥30.0 kg/m² [−0.17 (−0.28, −0.07)], and those who reported receiving lower quality of obesity-related care [−0.05 (−0.07, −0.03)] felt less empowered about resources to support their child's healthy body weight.Conclusions: Parental resource empowerment is influenced by parent and child characteristics as well as the quality of their obesity-related care. These findings could help inform equitable, family-centered approaches to improve parental resource empowerment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHispanics 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aeducation 3ahealth services 3ahousehold income 3amodels 3aparents 3aregression analysis 3aweight control 3aMassachusetts 0achildhood 0aempowerment 0aobesity 0aoverweight 0aparental resources1 aDavison, Kirsten K.1 aJurkowski, Janine M.1 aHoran, Christine M.1 aOrav, E.

Plants respond to insect attack by inducing and accumulating a large set of defense proteins. Two homologues of a barley wound-inducible protein (BARWIN), sugarcane wound-inducible proteins SUGARWIN1 and SUGARWIN2, have been identified in sugarcane by an in silico analysis. Antifungal properties have been described for a number of BARWIN homologues. We report that a SUGARWIN::green fluorescent protein fusion protein is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the extracellular space of sugarcane plants. The induction of sugarwin transcripts occurs in response to mechanical wounding, D. saccharalis damage, and methyl jasmonate treatment. The accumulation of transcripts is late induced and is restricted to the site of the wound. Although the transcripts of sugarwin genes were strongly increased following insect attack, the protein itself did not show any effect on insect development; rather, it altered fungal morphology, leading to the apoptosis of the germlings. These results suggest that, in the course of evolution, sugarwin-encoding genes were recruited by sugarcane due to their antipathogenic activity. We rationalize that sugarcane is able to induce sugarwin gene expression in response to D. saccharalis feeding as a concerted plant response to the anticipated invasion by the fungi that typically penetrate the plant stalk after insect damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiatraea saccharalis 3aantifungal properties 3aapoptosis 3abarley 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aevolution 3aextracellular space 3afluorescent proteins 3afungal morphology 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainsect development 3ainsects 3amethyl jasmonate 3aplant response 3asugarcane1 aFranco, Flávia P.1 aMatos, Juliana L.1 ade Castro, Patrícia A.1 aSantos-Silva, Ludier K.1 aHenrique-Silva, Flávio1 aGoldman, Gustavo H.1 aMoura, Daniel S.1 aSilva-Filho, Marcio C.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.613-624dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-09-11-02543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245010800203300001800311500001900329520165500348592002802003650002302031650002202054650001502076650002002091650002802111650001402139650002102153650001902174700002502193700001602218700002302234700005902257700005302316700002202369700002502391773013602416856008002552852000902632655001202641IND60731243720210618000000.0210318e20210303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073124372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c105272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuejian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6663-591210aFrom Semiconducting to Metallic: Jahn–Teller-Induced Phase Transformation in Skyrmion Host GaV₄S₈  ap. 5771-5780.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLacunar spinels, GaM₄X₈ (M = V, Nb, Mo, Ta, W; X = S, Se, Te), constitute a rare class of compounds with multiferroic properties. Recently, one member of this family, GaV₄S₈, received global attention due to the Néel-type skyrmions discovered in this material. Previous investigations strongly indicate the important role of the structure behind the multiferroicity, for example, the strong impact of ferroelectric transition on the exchange interactions at ∼40 K. Inspired by the delicate entanglement of lattice, spin, and charge degrees of freedom, in the present work, we aimed to use pressure to alter the structure and thus change the material’s properties to establish the inter-relation between the structural, optical, and electrical properties for a better understanding of this skyrmion host material. Upon this objective, in situ high-pressure measurements of single crystal/powder X-ray diffraction, electrical conductivity, and Raman spectroscopy were carried out by using a diamond anvil cell. These studies revealed the pressure-induced structural transformation from cubic to orthorhombic, along with a transition from semiconductor to metallic state in GaV₄S₈. The phase changes coincide with the variation in the optical property in this material explored by Raman spectra. We also determined the bulk modulus of the two phases of GaV₄S₈ by fitting the data set of unit cell volumes against pressure with the second-order birth-Murnaghan equation of state, and explained the mechanisms of phase transitions by means of the Jahn–Teller effect and the anisotropic changes in bonding lengths during compression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanisotropy 3adata collection 3aelectrical conductivity 3aequations 3aphase transition 3asemiconductors1 aRaḥmān, S̲āqib,1 aSun, Elaine1 aKnill, Christopher1 aZhang, Dongzhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6679-892X1 aWang, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2931-76291 aTsurkan, Vladimir1 aKézsmárki, István0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 03, v. 125, no. 10 p.5771-5780dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c105273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245016200159300001600321520134400337592002801681650001601709650003201725650002701757650003001784650002401814650003701838650001901875650001301894650003001907650001201937650001901949650001901968650001601987650001002003650001702013700001602030700001702046700001502063700001902078773013302097856008102230852000902311655001202320IND60548864320221118163936.0160905e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054886432DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-10-11-02742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fang14aThe GCR1 and GPA1 Participate in Promotion of Arabidopsis Primary Root Elongation Induced by N-Acyl-Homoserine Lactones, the Bacterial Quorum-Sensing Signals  ap. 677-683.  aMany gram-negative bacteria use N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) as quorum-sensing signals to coordinate their collective behaviors. Accumulating evidence indicates that plants can respond to AHL. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of plants reacting to these bacterial signals. In this study, we show that the treatment of Arabidopsis roots with N-3-oxo-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL) and N-3-oxo-octanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC8-HSL) resulted in significant root elongation. The genetic analysis revealed that the T-DNA insertional mutants of gcr1, encoding a G-protein-coupled receptor GCR1, were insensitive to 3OC6-HSL or 3OC8-HSL in assays of root growth. The loss-of-function mutants of the sole canonical Gα subunit GPA1 showed no response to AHL promotion of root elongation whereas Gα gain-of-function plants overexpressing either the wild type or a constitutively active version of Arabidopsis Gα exhibited the exaggerated effect on root elongation caused by AHL. Furthermore, the expression of GCR1 and GPA1 were significantly upregulated after plants were contacted with both AHL. Taken together, our results suggest that GCR1 and GPA1 are involved in AHL-mediated elongation of Arabidopsis roots. This provides insight into the mechanism of plant responses to bacterial quorum-sensing signals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aGram-negative bacteria 3again-of-function mutation 3agene overexpression 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agroup behavior 3alactones 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants 3aplant response 3aquorum sensing 3aroot growth 3aroots 3atransfer DNA1 aBian, Ziriu1 aJia, Zhenhua1 aZhao, Qian1 aSong, Shuishan0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.677-683dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-10-11-02743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010800175300001800283520160600301592002801907650002501935650001301960650001501973650001401988650001302002650002002015650001802035650000902053650000902062650001402071650001602085650001902101653001402120653001302134653002802147700001802175700002002193700001602213700002302229700002102252700002402273700001902297773009902316856008602415852000902501655001202510IND60589640920221120051034.0200509e20180307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058964092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebrie, Anne-Sophie10aConstruction and evaluation of Bordetella pertussis live attenuated vaccine strain BPZE1 producing Fim3  ap. 1345-1352.  aPertussis or whooping cough is currently the most prevalent vaccine-preventable childhood disease despite >85% global vaccination coverage. In recent years incidence has greatly increased in several high-income countries that have switched from the first-generation, whole-cell vaccine to the newer acellular vaccines, calling for improved vaccination strategies with better vaccines. We have developed a live attenuated pertussis vaccine candidate, called BPZE1, which is currently in clinical development. Unlike other pertussis vaccines, BPZE1 has been shown to provide strong protection against infection by the causative agent of pertussis, Bordetella pertussis, in non-human primates. BPZE1 is a derivative of the B. pertussis strain Tohama I, which produces serotype 2 (Fim2) but not serotype 3 fimbriae (Fim3). As immune responses to fimbriae are likely to contribute to protection, we constructed a BPZE1 derivative, called BPZE1f3, that produces both serotypes of fimbriae. Whereas nasal vaccination of mice with BPZE1 induced antibodies to Fim2 but not to Fim3, vaccination with BPZE1f3 elicited antibodies to both Fim2 and Fim3 at approximately the same level. In mice, both BPZE1 and BPZE1f3 provided equal levels of protection against clinical isolates that either produce Fim2 alone, both Fim2 and Fim3, or no fimbriae. However, vaccination with BPZE1f3 provided significantly stronger protection against Fim3-only producing B. pertussis than vaccination with BPZE1, indicating that immune responses to fimbriae contribute to serotype-specific protection against B. pertussis infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBordetella pertussis 3aPrimates 3aantibodies 3achildhood 3afimbriae 3aimmune response 3alive vaccines 3amice 3anose 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3awhooping cough 0aPertussis 0aFimbriae 0aLive attenuated vaccine1 aCoutte, Loïc1 aRaze, Dominique1 aMooi, Frits1 aAlexander, Frances1 aGorringe, Andrew1 aMielcarek, Nathalie1 aLocht, Camille0 tVaccine.g2018 Mar. 07, v. 36, no. 11 p.1345-1352dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245015400162300001800316520174800334592002802082650002202110650001102132650002202143650002102165650001302186650001902199650001502218650001202233650002202245650004402267650002102311650002402332650001102356650001402367650001202381650002002393650001602413700001902429700002902448700006102477700006402538700005802602773014702660856007602807852000902883655001202892IND60639214320221121210509.0190501e20190409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063921432DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b015892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitada, Keitaro10aUnraveling the Reaction Mechanisms of SiO Anodes for Li-Ion Batteries by Combining in Situ⁷Li and ex Situ⁷Li/²⁹Si Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy  ap. 7014-7027.  aSilicon monoxide is a promising alternative anode material due to its much higher capacity than graphite, and improved cyclability over other Si anodes. An in-depth analysis of the lithium silicide (LiₓSi) phases that form during lithiation/delithiation of SiO is presented here and the results are compared with pure-Si anodes. A series of anode materials is first prepared by heating amorphous silicon monoxide (a-SiO) at different temperatures, X-ray diffraction and ²⁹Si NMR analysis revealing that they comprise small Si domains that are surrounded by amorphous SiO₂, the domain size and crystallinity growing with heat treatment. In and ex situ ⁷Li and ²⁹Si solid-state NMR combined with detailed electrochemical analysis reveals that a characteristic metallic LiₓSi phase is formed on lithiating a-SiO with a relatively high Li concentration of x = 3.4–3.5, which is formed/decomposed through a continuous structural evolution involving amorphous phases differing in their degree of Si–Si connectivity. This structural evolution differs from that of pure-Si electrodes where the end member, crystalline Li₁₅Si₄, is formed/decomposed through a two-phase reaction. The reaction pathway of SiO depends, however, on the size of the ordered Si domains within the pristine material. When crystalline domains of >3 nm within a SiO₂ matrix are present, a phase resembling Li₁₅Si₄ forms, albeit at a higher overpotential. The continuous formation/decomposition of amorphous LiₓSi phases without the hysteresis and phase change associated with the formation of c-Li₁₅Si₄, along with a partially electrochemically active SiO₂/lithium silicate buffer layer, are paramount for the good cyclability of a-SiO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanodes 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3aheat treatment 3ahysteresis 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphase transition 3areaction mechanisms 3asilica 3asilicates 3asilicon 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aPecher, Oliver1 aMagusin, Pieter C.

Here we report a simple method for the synthesis of Ru octahedral nanocrystals with an fcc structure and an edge length of 9 nm. The success of this synthesis relies on the use of 4.5 nm Rh cubes as seeds to facilitate the heterogeneous nucleation and overgrowth of Ru atoms. We choose Rh because it can resist oxidative etching under the harsh conditions for Ru overgrowth, it can be readily prepared as nanocubes with edge lengths less than 5 nm, and its atoms have a size close to that of Ru atoms. During the seed-mediated growth, the atomic packing of Ru overlayers follows an fcc lattice, in contrast to the conventional hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice associated with bulk Ru. The final product takes an octahedral shape, with the surface enclosed by {111} facets. Our in situ measurements suggest that both the octahedral shape and the fcc crystal structure can be well preserved up to 400 °C, which is more than 100 °C higher than what was reported for Ru octahedral nanocages. When utilized as catalysts, the Ru octahedral nanocrystals exhibited 4.4-fold enhancement in terms of specific activity toward oxygen evolution relative to hcp-Ru nanoparticles. We also demonstrate that Ru{111} facets are more active than Ru{100} facets in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction. Altogether, this work offers an effective method for the synthesis of Ru nanocrystals with an fcc structure and well-defined {111} facets, as well as enhanced thermal stability and catalytic activity. We believe these nanocrystals will find use in various catalytic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen production 3arhodium 3aruthenium 3athermal stability1 aChen, Zitao1 aLyu, Zhiheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1343-40571 aHood, Zachary D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5720-43921 aXie, Minghao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3781-51181 aVara, Madeline1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8968-87341 aChi, M.q(Miaofang),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0764-15671 aXia, Younan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2431-70480 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Apr. 11, v. 141, no. 17 p.7028-7036dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b016403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245011000203300001800313506007600331520147000407592002801877506003701905650002501942650001401967650001601981650001001997650002602007650001102033650001902044650001402063650003102077650001702108650004202125650002802167650001502195650001502210650002002225700002902245700002502274773012902299856007402428852000902502655001202511IND60639942320221207130946.0190503e20161010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994232DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ib00153j2doi7 aPMC51665692pmcid7 a277139752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Alberto,10aModeling of the mechano-chemical behaviour of the nuclear pore complex: current research and perspectives  ap. 1011-1021.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent evidence suggests that mechanical deformation of the cell nucleus regulates the nuclear import of the transcriptional activators of genes involved in primary physiological cell responses such as stem cell differentiation. In addition, this nuclear mechanosensing response is de-regulated in pathological states, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. One hypothesis that could greatly advance the field is that the deformation of the nuclear envelope activates nuclear pore complexes through a direct mechanical link. The understanding of this possible mechanism for nuclear pore complex stretch-activation entails studying the mechanical connection of this complex to the nuclear envelope at the nanoscale. The nanomechanics of the nuclear pore complex is thus emerging as a novel research field, bridging nanoscience with nanotechnology. This review examines the frontier of research methodologies that are potentially useful for building a computational model of this interaction. This includes, for example, electron tomography to assess the geometrical features of the nuclear pore complex and nanoindentation to estimate its mechanical properties and that of the nuclear envelope. In order to summarize the state-of-the-art and perspectives in the field of NPC nanomechanics, this review covers highly interdisciplinary experimental and theoretical research methodologies pertaining to the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, materials and mechanics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell differentiation 3achemistry 3adeformation 3agenes 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3ananotechnology 3aneoplasms 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3anuclear pore 3apathological processes and conditions 3aphysiological transport 3astem cells 3atomography 3atransactivators1 aRodriguez Matas, Jose F.1 aRaimondi, Manuela T.0 tIntegrative biology.g2016 Oct. 10, v. 8, no. 10 p.1011-1021dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ib00153j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007700170300001800247520099300265592002801258650001401286650002201300650001701322650001901339650001801358650001101376650001701387650001301404650001301417650001101430700001501441700001501456700001801471700005701489773012801546856008501674852000901759655001201768IND60598661720221119124017.0181020e20180509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059866172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b011592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Longjiang10aFully Reversible Optical Sensor for Hydrogen Peroxide with Fast Response  ap. 7544-7551.  aA fully reversible optical sensor for hydrogen peroxide with fast response is presented. The sensor was fabricated by in situ growing ultrasmall platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) inside the pores of fibrous silica particles (KCC-1). The nanocomposite was then embedded into a hydrogel matrix and form a sensor layer, the immobilized PtNPs can catalytically convert hydrogen peroxide into molecular oxygen, which is measured via luminescent quenching based oxygen sensor underneath. Owing to the high porosity and permeability of KCC-1 and high local concentration of PtNPs, the sensor exhibits fast response (less than 1 min) and full reversibility. The measurement range of the sensor covers 1.0 μM to 10.0 mM, and a very small amount of sample is required during measurement (200 μL). Because of its high stability, excellent reversibility and selectivity, and extremely fast response, the sensor could fulfill all industry requirements for real-time measurement and fill market vacancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aluminescence 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3aplatinum 3aporosity 3asilica1 aChen, Siyu1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhang, Yinglu1 aWang, Xu-dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3402-79950 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 May 09, v. 90, no. 12 p.7544-7551dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b011593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245009300201300001800294506007600312520096200388592002801350506003701378650001601415650001201431650002001443650002001463650001001483650001901493650003501512650001601547650001301563650001901576650002201595650002801617650001801645700001801663700002101681700002201702700002201724773012101746856007401867852000901941655001201950IND60631263020221207071302.0190220e20190205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063126302DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra10181g2doi7 aPMC63948932pmcid7 a309311082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiewert, Bianka12aA convenient workflow to spot photosensitizers revealed photo-activity in basidiomycetes  ap. 4545-4552.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is an alternative approach for the treatment of neoplastic diseases employing photosensitizers activated by light. In order to discover new natural photosensitizers, a convenient workflow was established. To validate the workflow, fungi were selected, because we hypothesized that fruiting bodies and mycelia are an overlooked source. The results proved the hypothesis, as exorbitant high photo-cytotoxicity values were detected. For example, the acetone extract of Cortinarius croceus was characterized by an EC₅₀, ₉.₃ J cₘ₋₂ of 1 µg mL⁻¹ against cells of a lung cancer cell-line (A549). In sum, a low-cost workflow for the detection and biological evaluation of photosensitizers is presented and discussed. Furthermore, this paper provides the first experimental evidence for phototoxic metabolites in basidiomycetes. This hints towards a new assignable function of fungal pigments, i.e. photochemical defense.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCortinarius 3aacetone 3afruiting bodies 3afungal pigments 3afungi 3alung neoplasms 3amedian effective concentration 3ametabolites 3amycelium 3aphotochemistry 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aphototoxicity1 aVrabl, Pamela1 aHammerle, Fabian1 aBingger, Isabella1 aStuppner, Hermann0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 9, no. 8 p.4545-4552dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra10181g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016300169300001600332520147500348592002801823650000801851650001201859650002301871650001001894650002201904650001301926650001801939650001801957650002501975650003002000650001302030650001202043650001302055650001902068700002002087700002102107700002302128700002602151700001402177700002202191773015102213856008102364852000902445655001202454IND60548864620221118164956.0160905e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054886462DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-12-11-0318-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuirin, Edmund A.10aEvolutionary Meta-Analysis of Solanaceous Resistance Gene and Solanum Resistance Gene Analog Sequences and a Practical Framework for Cross-Species Comparisons  ap. 603-612.  aCross-species comparative genomics approaches have been employed to map and clone many important disease resistance (R) genes from Solanum species—especially wild relatives of potato and tomato. These efforts will increase with the recent release of potato genome sequence and the impending release of tomato genome sequence. Most R genes belong to the prominent nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) class and conserved NBS-LRR protein motifs enable survey of the R gene space of a plant genome by generation of resistance gene analogs (RGA), polymerase chain reaction fragments derived from R genes. We generated a collection of 97 RGA from the disease-resistant wild potato S. bulbocastanum, complementing smaller collections from other Solanum species. To further comparative genomics approaches, we combined all known Solanum RGA and cloned solanaceous NBS-LRR gene sequences, nearly 800 sequences in total, into a single meta-analysis. We defined R gene diversity bins that reflect both evolutionary relationships and DNA cross-hybridization results. The resulting framework is amendable and expandable, providing the research community with a common vocabulary for present and future study of R gene lineages. Through a series of sequence and hybridization experiments, we demonstrate that all tested R gene lineages are of ancient origin, are shared between Solanum species, and can be successfully accessed via comparative genomics approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSolanum 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahybridization 3ameta-analysis 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apotatoes 3asurveys 3atomatoes 3awild relatives1 aMann, Harpartap1 aMeyer, Rachel S.1 aTraini, Alessandra1 aChiusano, Maria Luisa1 aLitt, Amy1 aBradeen, James M.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.603-612dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-12-11-0318-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245008700178300001800265500001900283520065600302536009400958592002801052596004901080596006501129650002601194650002101220650001801241650002201259651001301281653006701294653003301361653002301394700002201417773011201439856008501551852000901636655001201645IND60688903720221119133422.0200417e20171117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068890372DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2017.13592372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegwegoh, Alexander F.10aHigh food prices in urban Cameroon: coping strategies and suggested policy actions  ap. 1064-1077.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGovernments tend to focus on short-term policies to address the immediate effects of high food prices when spikes occur, while in the long term, urban residents are left to their own devices struggling to ensure adequate household food consumption.

The combined methods indicate that P.A. anion binds as the N-deprotonated tautomer (PhSO₂NOH–) to [Feᴵᴵ(N3PyS)]⁺, leading to 2. Complex 2 is the first spectroscopically characterized example, to our knowledge, of P.A. anion bound to a redox-active metal center. Warming of 2 above −60 °C yields the stable {FeNO}⁷ complex [Fe(NO)(N3PyS)]BF₄ (4), as evidenced by ¹H NMR, ATR-IR, and Mössbauer spectroscopies. Isotope labeling experiments with ¹⁵N-labeled P.A. confirm that the nitrosyl ligand in 4 derives from P.A. In contrast, addition of a second equivalent of a strong base leads to S–N cleavage and production of an {FeNO}⁸ species, the deprotonated analog of an Fe–HNO complex. This work has implications for the targeted delivery of HNO/NO–/NO· to nonheme Fe centers in biological and synthetic applications, and suggests a new role for nonheme Feᴵᴵ complexes in the assisted degradation of HNO donor molecules.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aacetonitrile 3airon 3aisotope labeling 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3atautomers 3atemperature1 aVilbert, Avery C.1 aDey, Aniruddha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7162-04831 aLancaster, Kyle M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7296-128X1 aGoldberg, David P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4645-10450 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Apr. 17, v. 141, no. 17 p.7046-7055dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b017003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006200144245007800206300002000284520140300304592002801707650002401735650001101759650001801770650001301788650002001801650001501821650001501836650001301851650002001864650001601884650001501900650001801915650001501933650001401948650001101962650001801973650001401991650001602005653002402021653002102045653002102066653001902087653002102106700002102127773014202148856007802290852000902368655001202377IND60707059920221119165417.0200812e20200728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070705992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c087182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakajima, Tomohiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6171-467810aUltrathin Highly Flexible Featherweight Ceramic Temperature Sensor Arrays  ap. 36600-36608.  aWe fabricated highly flexible Sr- and Ni-doped perovskite SmMnO₃ thermistor film sensor arrays on an ultrathin (5 μm thick) and lightweight (21 mg) polyimide sheet for healthcare monitoring devices. The Ag nanowire and nanoparticle-impregnated carbon microcone array, which was prepared by precisely controlled surface laser carbonization of polyimide, showed sufficiently low resistance as a bottom electrode and good stability against sharp bending angles. The dot-shaped (diameter: 900 μm) perovskite thermistor film with a thickness of 900 nm was crystallized by pulsed ultraviolet laser irradiation of a precursor film printed with perovskite nanoparticle dispersion ink, and the film functioned well as the thermistor with a thermistor constant of 2820 K. The thermistor sensor sheet exhibited rapid responses to temperature variation and high stability in the temperature cycle tests over 1000 cycles between room temperature and 80 °C. The bending durability for a bending angle of 60° with a small bending radius (500 μm) was also high. During the bending test over 1000 cycles, the monitoring temperature variation was suppressed only within 0.1 °C. This ultrathin sensor array sheet can be mounted on surfaces with shape variations, and we used the sensor for real-time monitoring in healthcare to detect precise temperature variations on the human skin during physical exercise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3aceramics 3acrystallization 3adurability 3aelectrodes 3aexercise 3ahealth services 3airradiation 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3anickel 3askin (animal) 3astrontium 3athermistors 0atemperature sensors 0aflexible devices 0alaser processing 0abio-monitoring 0afilm thermistors1 aTsuchiya, Tetsuo0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 28, v. 12, no. 32 p.36600-36608dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c087183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245012500183300001800308520131700326592002801643650001401671650001501685650000901700650002401709650001301733650001401746650001201760650001001772650001701782650001701799650001101816650001101827650001201838650002201850650001301872653001601885653001701901653002101918653001101939653001301950700002601963773009901989856008602088852000902174655001202183IND60610242520221120114426.0200717e20180809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061024252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangsupanimitchai, Napawan10aMixing is required for uniform reconstitution of filter-dried protein antigens in a single-injection vaccine formulation  ap. 5058-5064.  aAmbient temperature filter dried vaccine formulations have been proposed to simultaneously achieve thermostability and offer a ready-to-use immunisation device that combines reconstitution and injection. Vaccine concentration should be uniform at the point of injection, but the uniformity following direct reconstitution of filter-dried vaccines has not been reported. We present here a study of vaccine mixing and release following dissolution of filter-dried model protein and toxoid antigens within a single syringe, filter and needle unit. Release was better for filters made from glass than cellulose. Without additional mixing, uniformity was poor and only 41% of input protein was released from protein filter-dried onto glass fiber. In contrast, adding a simple glass bead and mixing by inversion, 100% release antigen solution was achieved, with uniform concentration at exit from the needle throughout a simulated injection. Adsorption onto alum adjuvant had no detectable effect on vaccine dissolution and mixing. The uniformity and yield of low doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid was also improved by mixing, albeit with a lower yield of 60–68%. We conclude that uniformity and mixing should be studied to ensure safety and efficacy of directly reconstituted filter-dried vaccine formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aadsorption 3aalum 3aambient temperature 3aantigens 3acellulose 3afilters 3aglass 3aglass fibers 3aimmunization 3amixing 3amodels 3atetanus 3athermal stability 3avaccines 0aFormulation 0aFilter dried 0aThermostabilised 0aMixing 0aAdjuvant1 aEdwards, Alexander D.0 tVaccine.g2018 Aug. 09, v. 36, no. 33 p.5058-5064dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008500169300001500254520141600269592002801685650001801713650001401731650001301745650001901758650001701777650001601794653001801810653001501828653001201843653002101855653001601876653002001892653001701912653001901929653002301948653002501971700005701996700002102053773012502074856008302199852000902282655001202291IND60693957220221119104543.0201023e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069395722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlunt, Martin J.10aEvaluation of methods using topology and integral geometry to assess wettability  ap. 99-108.  aThe development of high-resolution in situ imaging has allowed contact angles to be measured directly inside porous materials. We evaluate the use of concepts in integral geometry to determine contact angle. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that it is possible to determine an average contact angle from measurements of the Gaussian curvature of the fluid/fluid meniscus using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.We show that it is not possible to unambiguously determine an average contact angle from the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We instead present an approximate relationship: 2πn(1-cosθ)=4π-∫κG12dS12, where n is the number of closed loops of the three-phase contact line where phases 1 and 2 contact the surface, θ is the average contact angle, while κG12 is the Gaussian curvature of the fluid meniscus which is integrated over its surface S12. We then use the results of pore-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations to assess the accuracy of this approach to determine a representative contact angle for two-phase flow in porous media.We show that in simple cases with a flat solid surface, the approximate expression works well. When applied to simulations on pore space images, the equation provides a robust estimate of contact angle, accurate to within 3°, when averaged over many fluid clusters, although individual values can have significant errors because of the approximations used in the calculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3aequations 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3aporous media 3awettability 0aContact angle 0aPore-scale 0aImaging 0aInterfacial area 0aWettability 0aMultiphase flow 0aPorous media 0aTwo-phase flow 0aGaussian curvature 0aGauss-Bonnet theorem1 aAkai, Takashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2800-90341 aBijeljic, Branko0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 576 p.99-108dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245010700158300001400265500001900279520082000298592002801118650001601146650001401162650001301176650000901189650002001198650001601218650001801234653001501252653000901267653001101276653002001287700001401307700001801321700001501339773015601354856007801510852000901588655001201597IND60716771120221117161319.0201107e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677112DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.DR-13082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, G.10aDesign aspect of temperature controlled piston extrusion system for formation of peda-milk based sweet  ap. 87-94.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA piston extrusion system was designed for formation of peda (milk based sweet).

Recent scholarship emphasises the need to combine strong State oversight for achieving the collective extraction caps with considerable leeway to users to allocate water according to local priorities. This form of “co-management” between the State and users aims to improve the implementation of sustainable extraction limits. This model was adopted in France where agricultural user groups share water resources within a capped allocation pool enforced by the State. This paper evaluates whether the allocation rules developed by user groups improve environmental, economic and social performance. A detailed survey was carried out amongst the 54 agricultural user groups created across France. Results suggest that the reform has led to greater awareness amongst irrigators of their water resources and the slow emergence of collective action. Allocation rules have been developed, reflecting local economic and social priorities, as well as the temporal and spatial dynamics of local surface and groundwater resources. Although challenges remain, the research presented in this paper supports co-management to manage agricultural water extraction, and discusses institutional design features that can facilitate its implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollaborative management 3acollective action 3aempirical research 3agroundwater 3amodels 3asurveys 3awater management 3aFrance 0aWater scarcity 0aDrought 0aCommon property management 0aRegulation1 aRinaudo, Jean-Daniel0 tAgricultural water management.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 239 p.106269-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1062693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245010400159300001400263500001900277520152900296592002801825650002201853650001401875650002301889650001101912650001201923650000901935650002001944650001601964651001001980653002001990653001202010653002102022653001902043653001502062700002302077773015602100856007802256852000902334655001202343IND60716771220221117161335.0201107e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677122DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.DR-13302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Arnab10aUrban brand awareness and preferences for milk products: An empirical Study on Kolkata Metropolitan  ap. 95-99.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe dairy market has been growing progressively over the years and is now bigger than the other food market but their lies a great state wise inequality in India in terms of consumption pattern of dairy products. Though Kolkata's economy is increasing through sectorial shifts from necessary food to high value foods but in terms of per capita expenditure, Kolkata remain relativelybehind. Consumers brand preferencesrepresent afundamentalstep in understanding consumer behaviour. A deeper understanding of such preference can help marketers’ better design marketing program and build a long term relationship with consumers. This warrants an empirical study for such specific rural pockets to help marketers improvise the dynamics of segmentation and marketing mix variables to capitalize their efforts to the fullest in rural markets. The present study was conducted in purposively selected Kolkata Municipality area to explore the rural consumer buying behavior through brand awareness and influence of demographic factors on brand preference. Kolkata Municipality area is divided into 16 borough and each borough consists of several wards. Hence, five boroughs were selected randomly and from each borough two wards were selected randomly. The results indicated that there were no statistical relationships between age, gender, education with dairy products preference. But there was statistical relationship between occupation and gender with the brand preference consumers in the Kolkata metropolitan in West Bengal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer behavior 3aeducation 3aempirical research 3agender 3amarkets 3amilk 3amilk production 3aoccupations 3aIndia 0aBrand awareness 0aBorough 0aBrand preference 0aDairy products 0aDemography1 aMalhotra, Ravinder0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2018 June, v. 37, no. 2 p.95-99dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.DR-13303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245007200159300001600231500001900247520092400266592002801190650001201218650001101230650001901241650000901260650002001269650000701289650002301296650002101319650001101340653001701351653001501368653001001383700001601393773015801409856007801567852000901645655001201654IND60716771320221117161330.0201107e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677132DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.DR-13352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyed, K.A.10aFormulation and evaluation of traditional dairy product: Sheerqurma  ap. 100-104.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this investigation was to utilize drynuts in milk to make a Sheerqurma by standardizing a percent of sugar by treatment T(27.5%), T(10%), T(15%)and T(20%)The Sheerqurma was prepared by standardized processing parameter and subjected to sensory analysis using 9 point Hedonic scale and physicochemical parameter.

Cal. and production cost of 1 litre was calculated as Rs. 98.90 Hence, the process of preparation of Sheerqurma being techno-economically feasible, justifies the suitability for commercial exploitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aenergy 3ahedonic scales 3amilk 3amilk production 3apH 3asensory evaluation 3aspecific gravity 3asugars 0aEnergy value 0aSheerqurma 0aSugar1 aBabar, K.P.0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2018 June, v. 37, no. 2 p.100-104dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.DR-13353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200469 u 4500001001100000005001700011008004100028016002100069024003500090040001800125100001900143242011400162245013400276300001600410520086700426592002801293650001201321650001701333650001801350650002701368650002001395650002501415650002001440650002001460650001301480650001301493650002001506650001101526650002301537650001101560650001601571650002401587650001201611650001301623650000901636650001201645650003601657773009201693856004801785852000901833655001201842IND607197820221116212418.0161205e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND60719782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10298-012-0694-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLecerf, J. -M.10aMetabolic effects of Curcumin (obesity, circulating lipids, insulin resistance, diabetes and atherosclerosis)10aEffets mÃ©taboliques du Curcumin (obÃ©sitÃ©, lipides circulants, insulinorÃ©sistance, diabÃ¨te et athÃ©rosclÃ©rose)  ap. 100-104.  aCurcumin or Curcuma derives from a richcurcuminoids rhizome. Its effects on metabolism and vascular risk are well studied in rodents animal models. In these models Curcumin decreases lipogenesis, adipogenesis, increases lean mass, basal metabolic rate and decreases fat mass; it improves lipid metabolism, decreases LDL-C, trigly cerides and augments HDL-C and paraoxonase; it has an antidiabetic effect and its improves insulino-resistance; it diminishes atherosclerosis lesions in animals. The mechanisms of its actions are explained and are complex but the main mechanism seems to be through the inhibition of NFÎºB activation. Unfortunately there is a lack of human studies, and clinical trials are not available in human. It is perhaps due to a low bioavailability. So its therapeutic use is still empiric although there are potentially promising effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma 3aadipogenesis 3aanimal models 3aaryldialkylphosphatase 3aatherosclerosis 3abasal metabolic rate 3abioavailability 3aclinical trials 3acurcumin 3adiabetes 3aglycemic effect 3ahumans 3ainsulin resistance 3alipids 3alipogenesis 3amechanism of action 3aobesity 3arhizomes 3arisk 3arodents 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B0 tPhytotheÌrapie.g2012 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.100-104dSpringer-Verlagx1624-85977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10298-012-0694-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245015300200300001800353500002000371520144000391592002801831596003901859596004001898650001601938650002201954650001301976650001301989650002602002650002502028650000902053650001502062650002002077650001302097650001502110650001502125650002402140700005502164700002102219700006102240700001702301700002002318773011902338856007502457852000902532655001202541IND60786325220221122140558.0220803e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078632522DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.202002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBansal, Sangeeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4483-127110aLong‐term influence of phosphorus fertilization on organic carbon and nitrogen in soil aggregates under no‐till corn–wheat–soybean rotations  ap. 2519-2534.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe role of P availability on soil C sequestration is poorly understood in no‐tillage production. The objective of this study was to examine the long‐term phosphorus (P) fertilization effect on soil organic C (SOC), N, and C:N ratio in soil aggregates at different depths in no‐till corn (Zea mays L.)‐wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)‐soybean (Glycine max L.) rotations. The experiment was conducted on low to medium P soils at Springfield and Milan, TN during 2013–2015 from 0–15 cm and from 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, and 15–30 cm in 2018 using Latin square design with five replications of five P rates (0, 29, 59, 88, and 117 kg P ha⁻¹) applied annually. Bulk soil and aggregate sizes > 2, 0.25–2, 0.053–0.25, and < 0.053 mm were analyzed for SOC and N. Phosphorus rate of 88 kg ha⁻¹ resulted in high soil testing P and had higher SOC and N than all other treatments on low P soil. However, over‐application of P at 117 kg ha⁻¹ decreased SOC on low P soil. No response of SOC or N to P fertilization was observed on medium P soil. Application of 29 kg P ha⁻¹ increased large macroaggregate (> 2 mm) weight. Concentrations of SOC and N were higher in microaggregates (0.053–0.25 mm) than the other aggregates. In conclusion, SOC and N stocks are increased on low P soils with appropriate P application, which is crucial for simultaneous improvements of soil C sequestration and crop yield.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville  cTennessee Department of Agriculture 3aGlycine max 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acarbon sequestration 3acorn 3acrop yield 3amicroaggregates 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3aphosphorus 3asoil organic carbon1 aYin, Xinhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8945-83141 aSavoy, Hubert J.1 aJagadamma, Sindhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4831-33081 aLee, Jaehoon1 aSykes, Virginia0 tAgronomy journal.g2020 July, v. 112, no. 4 p.2519-2534dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.202003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008800164300001600252520079600268592002801064650000801092650001101100650002201111650001801133650001901151650000901170650001801179700001901197773011901216856008201335852000901417655001201426IND60618864620221117223932.0181030e198103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061886462DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517581051003122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenisek, L.10aProtective Clothing FabricsbPart II.

This question was addressed by perfusing isolated intact rat lung with a buffered physiological saline solution in the absence or presence of the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone (20μM). Compared to control, rotenone depressed whole lung tissue ATP from 5.66±0.46 (SEM) to 2.34±0.15µmol·g⁻¹ dry lung, with concomitant increases in the ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios. Rotenone also increased lung perfusate lactate (from 12.36±1.64 to 38.62±3.14µmol·15min⁻¹ perfusion·g⁻¹ dry lung) and the lactate:pyruvate ratio, but had no detectable impact on lung tissue GSH:GSSG redox status. The amphipathic quinone coenzyme Q₁ (CoQ₁; 50μM) mitigated the impact of rotenone on the adenine nucleotide balance, wherein mitigation was blocked by NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 or mitochondrial complex III inhibitors. In separate studies, rotenone increased the pulmonary vascular endothelial filtration coefficient (Kf) from 0.043±0.010 to 0.156±0.037ml·min⁻¹·cm H₂O⁻¹·g⁻¹ dry lung, and CoQ₁ protected against the effect of rotenone on Kf. A second complex I inhibitor, piericidin A, qualitatively reproduced the impact of rotenone on Kf and the lactate:pyruvate ratio. Taken together, the observations imply that pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity depends on mitochondrial bioenergetics as reflected in lung tissue ATP levels and that compensatory activation of whole lung glycolysis cannot protect against pulmonary endothelial hyperpermeability in response to mitochondrial blockade. The study further suggests that low-molecular-weight amphipathic quinones may have therapeutic utility in protecting lung barrier function in mitochondrial insufficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3afiltration 3aglycolysis 3apermeability 3aquinones 3arats 3arotenone 3asodium chloride1 aYan, Ke1 aHoffmann, Raymond G.1 aAudi, Said H.1 aZhang, Xiao1 aLindemer, Brian J.1 aTownsley, Mary I.1 aMerker, Marilyn P.0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2013 Dec., v. 65 p.1455-1463dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04149naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245021000170520192300380592002802303650002102331650001102352650002502363650001002388650002002398650001302418650001602431650002902447650000902476650002702485650001002512650001202522650001402534650002102548650001002569650002002579650000902599650001602608650002902624650001502653650002102668653000802689653000802697653000702705653000802712653000802720653000802728653000702736653000802743653000702751653000902758653001102767653000702778653000802785653000802793653000702801653000802808653000802816653000902824653000802833653000902841653000802850653000802858653001902866653000802885653001002893653000702903653001102910653000902921653002202930653002502952653002302977700001403000700001403014700001103028700001603039773011803055856008903173852000903262655001203271IND60719790220221117203027.0220606e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071979022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.1147802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, X.Q.14aThe effect of substitution of mixed grass hay with Urtica cannabina hay and/or Leymus chinensis hay on blood biochemical profile, carcass traits, and intramuscular fatty acid composition in finishing lambs  aIn this study, the effects of substitution of mixed grass hay with Urtica cannabina hay and/or Leymus chinensis hay on blood metabolites, carcass traits, and intramuscular fatty acid composition of finishing lambs were assessed. Thirty-two male Ujumuqin × small-tailed Han lambs were randomly allocated into four dietary treatment groups (n = 8): (1) 500 g/kg mixed grass hay + 500 g/kg concentrate (control, G50); (2) 500 g/kg Leymus chinensis hay + 500 g/kg concentrate (L50); (3) 500 g/kg flowering U. cannabina hay + 500 g/kg concentrate (U50); and (4) 250 g/kg L. chinensis hay + 250 g/kg flowering U. cannabina hay + 500 g/kg concentrate (L25-U25). Diets were provided in a pellet form and animals were individually fed during the 57-day experimental period. All lambs were slaughtered after the feeding trial. Compared to the control diet, the U50 and L25-U25 diets increased (P = 0.001) glucose concentration and decreased total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in lamb’s blood (P = 0.022 and 0.015, respectively). The U50 and L25-U25 groups had greater (P = 0.001) total antioxidant capacity and lower (P = 0.019) malondialdehyde value; and the U50 group had greater (P = 0.003) catalase activity, compared to the control group. Carcass traits were unaffected by dietary treatment, but meat of the U50 and L25-U25 lambs contained lower levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (P = 0.031 and 0.048, respectively), and greater (P < 0.001) level of polyunsaturated fatty acids than the meat of control lambs. In particular, the highest (P = 0.021) c9,t11-conjugated linoleic acid was in meat from lambs fed the U50 diet versus L50 and control diets. Use of 250 g/kg U. cannabina plus 250 g/kg L. chinensis or 500 g/kg U. cannabina as a basic feedstuff was more effective at improving blood biochemical profiles and increasing the health-promoting fatty acids of meat of fattening lambs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeymus chinensis 3aUrtica 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood 3ablood chemistry 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3afeeds 3aglucose 3agrass hay 3ahealth promotion 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3ameat 3ametabolites 3anutritional intervention 3atechnology 3atriacylglycerols 0aALT 0aAST 0aBH 0aCAT 0aCLA 0aDHA 0aDM 0aEPA 0aFA 0aFAME 0aGSH-Px 0aLA 0aLDH 0aLDL 0aLT 0aLNA 0aMDA 0aMUFA 0aNDF 0aPUFA 0aSEM 0aSFA 0aPUFA:SFA (P:S) 0aSOD 0aT-AOC 0aTC 0aNettle 0aLamb 0aBlood metabolites 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aMuscle fatty acids1 aJiang, C.1 aJin, Y.M.1 aLi, P.1 aZhong, J.F.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2021 Feb., v. 272 p.114780-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.1147803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245010900178300001600287520102600303592002801329650001101357650003501368650001801403650001101421650001501432650001501447650002001462650001901482651001101501653001801512653002801530653002401558653001801582653002401600700002101624700001701645700002601662700003601688773010601724856008801830852000901918655001201927IND60626423920221117192710.0190318e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062642392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaarr, Marthe Larsen12aA novel GIS-based tool for predicting coastal litter accumulation and optimising coastal cleanup actions  ap. 117-126.  aEffective site selection is a key component of maximising debris removal during coastal cleanup actions. We tested a GIS-based predictive model to identify marine litter hotspots in Lofoten, Norway based on shoreline gradient and shape. Litter density was recorded at 27 randomly selected locations with 5 transects sampled in each. Shoreline gradient was a limiting factor to litter accumulation when >35%. The curvature of the coastline correlated differently with litter density at different spatial scales. The greatest litter concentrations were in small coves located on larger headlands. A parsimonious model scoring sites on a scale of 1–5 based on shoreline slope and shape had the highest validation success. Sites unlikely to have high litter concentrations were successfully identified and could be avoided. The accuracy of hotspot identifications was more variable, and presumably more parameters influencing litter deposition, such as shoreline aspect relative to prevailing winds, should be incorporated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3ageographic information systems 3amarine debris 3amodels 3aprediction 3ashorelines 3awater pollution 3awind direction 3aNorway 0aMarine litter 0aCoastal cleanup actions 0aPredictive modeling 0aPlanning tool 0aBeach geomorphology1 aWesterveld, Levi1 aFabres, Joan1 aIversen, Kriss Rokkan1 aBusch, Kjersti Eline Tønnessen0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Feb., v. 139 p.117-126dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245007700176300001600253520080700269592002801076650001801104650001201122650001901134650001601153650000901169650001101178700002501189700002301214700002901237700002401266700003001290773010001320856004801420852000901468655001201477IND50066674620221119175235.0130525e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006667462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-013-1618-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLassen, Louise Berkhoudt10aSeptin9 is involved in T-cell development and CD8⁺ T-cell homeostasis   ap. 695-705.  aSEPTIN9 (SEPT9) is a filament-forming protein involved in numerous cellular processes. We have used a conditional knock out allele of Sept9 to specifically delete Sept9 in T-cells. As shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, loss of Sept9 at an early thymocyte stage in the thymus results in increased numbers of double-negative cells indicating that SEPT9 is involved in the transition from the double-negative stage during T-cell development. Accordingly, the relative numbers of mature T-cells in the periphery are decreased in mice with a T-cell-specific deletion of Sept9. Proliferation of Sept9-deleted CD8⁺ T-cells from the spleen is decreased upon stimulation in culture. The altered T-cell homeostasis caused by the loss of Sept9 results in an increase of CD8⁺ central memory T-cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aalleles 3aflow cytometry 3ahomeostasis 3amice 3aspleen1 aFüchtbauer, Annette1 aSchmitz, Alexander1 aSørensen, Annette Balle1 aPedersen, Finn Skou1 aFüchtbauer, Ernst-Martin0 tCell and tissue research.g2013 June, v. 352, no. 3 p.695-705dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-013-1618-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245010800170300001600278500001900294520094900313592002801262650001901290650002901309650001501338650002501353650001001378650002601388650002701414650002101441650001701462650001201479650002001491650001601511650001901527650001101546650002101557650001901578651001001597653001601607653002401623653001701647653002401664700002501688700002001713700001701733773015801750856007801908852000901986655001201995IND60716772020221123005720.0201107e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677202DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.DR-11972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Swarnali10aQuality ascertain of different mustard oil samples obtained from the local market of West Bengal, India  ap. 138-143.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMustard oil extracted from seasonal crops, Brassica nigra, Brassica junea and Brassica hirta, has enormous edible and non-edibleusesin India.

A total of 1080 heifers were included in the study. There was insertion of the intravaginal P4-device plus administration of 2 mg of estradiol benzoate IM. On D7, 12.5 mg of dinoprost tromethamine IM was administered and on D9, the P4 insert was removed and 0.5 mg of estradiol cypionate IM was administered. Heifers were categorized according to Reproductive Tract Status (RTS; 1−5) and were assigned to one of three treatments: 200 IU (n = 387), 300 IU (n = 357), or 400 IU (n = 336) of eCG. Estrous occurrence was evaluated at TAI 48 h later (D11). A subset of heifers (n = 213) had the largest follicle (LF) evaluated on D9 and on D11, and the formation of a new CL evaluated on D18.There was no effect of eCG treatment on LF on D11 (P = 0.79), occurrence of estrus (P = 0.92), and pregnancy at 30 days after AI (P/AI; 52.2%, 49.8%, and 51.5% for 200 IU, 300 IU, and 400 IU, respectively; P = 0.46). Regardless of the treatment, there was a greater P/AI when heifers had a functional CL, at initiation of the estrous synchronization treatment regimen. It, therefore, is efficacious to reduce the dose of eCG to 300 or 200 IU in purebred taurine and crossbred beef heifers without negative effects on ovarian, estrous or pregnancy responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acrossbreds 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3aestradiol 3aestrus 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3apurebreds 3ataurine 0aHeifers 0aeCG 0aReproduction 0aBovine 0aTimed artificial insemination1 aMissio, Daniele1 ados Santos Brum, Daniela1 aCarloto, Giovane W.1 aMartini, Ana Paula1 aPessoa, Gilson Antônio1 aNeto, Normélio Alves1 aClaro Jr, Izaias1 aSá Filho, Manoel F.1 aLeivas, Fabio Gallas0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2020 July, v. 218 p.106474-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2020.1064743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010500170300001600275520082500291592002801116650002301144650001601167650001901183650001501202650001101217700002201228700002001250700002101270773008801291856004801379852000901427655001201436IND4520858520221119175430.0151109e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452085852DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617120501652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVereshchagina, O.

To achieve good electrochemical performance, in this work, we report a mixed-ligand approach to prepare modified Ni-MOF by using trimesic acid (BTC) as the modulator to partially replace the terephthalic acid (PTA) ligands. The introduction of BTC can induce the formation of nanosheets with inserted albizia flower-like spheres, where the nanowires on the albizia flower-like spheres can provide rich redox reaction sites and the “spacer” spheres between the layers can hinder the aggregation of the 2D nanosheets to provide fast transport pathways. Moreover, adsorption simulation shows that the adsorption energy of OH⁻ on the mixed organic ligands is increased after introducing the BTC ligands, which may improve the reversible redox reaction kinetics in the electrode materials. The as-obtained albizia flower-like spheres@nanosheets structured Ni-MOF with the optimized amount of BTC exhibits a high capacitance of 920 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹, good rate capability of 61% at 20 A g⁻¹, and an excellent cycling stability in 6 M KOH electrolyte. This work may provide helpful guidance for controlling the structure and surface property of MOFs to improve the electrochemical performance for supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbizia 3aadsorption 3acapacitance 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aligands 3ananosheets 3ananowires 3apotassium hydroxide 3areaction kinetics 3aredox reactions 0aNi-MOFs 0aSupercapacitors 0aMixed ligand approach 0aAlbizia flower-like spheres@nanosheets 0aShape-control1 aZhu, Ning,1 aYang, Shixuan1 aFan, Qiuyu1 aLei, Da1 aLiu, Anmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4760-34291 aChen, Xi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 575 p.347-355dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010800161300001600269500001900285520103500304592002801339650001701367650001601384650001701400650001801417650003601435650002401471650001901495650001501514650001101529650002101540650001101561650001201572650002001584650002101604650002001625650001601645650001701661650001601678653002101694653002201715700001701737700001601754773015801770856007801928852000902006655001202015IND60716772220221123005812.0201107e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677222DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.DR-12752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Reema10aAssessment of nutritional and phytochemical composition of composite flour rich in functional compounds  ap. 149-153.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFunctional food is a modified food that claims to improve health or well-being by providing benefits.

A critical review of beach cleaning methods and impacts  ap. 390-401.  aCleaning is a fundamental concern of beach managers in many destinations as well as an important requirement in beach quality awards. However, it has been largely neglected in the literature. This paper provides an overview of empirical studies on beach cleaning and analyzes cleaning-related requirements of 11 beach awards that generate controversy in the literature. This study comments on key aspects of beach cleaning, resolves various misconceptions, and provides new perspectives by integrating related topics drawn from a wide range of literature. The arguments based on both the ecological and tourism managerial perspectives are presented, indicating the gaps and proposing research solutions. The paper calls for empirical studies with regard to the efficiency of different cleaning approaches on beaches with varying levels of use intensity and for methodological designs that separate the impacts of mechanical grooming from those of trampling, dune destruction, shore armoring, artificial lighting, among others.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3acleaning 3aempirical research 3ahonors and awards 3alighting 3atourism 3atrampling damage 3awater pollution 0aMarine litter 0aPollution 0aMechanical cleaning 0aBeach certification scheme 0aEco-label 0aWrack1 aBotero, Camilo M.1 aYanes, Andrea0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Feb., v. 139 p.390-401dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008200165300001600247520140200263592002801665650001101693650001101704650001301715650001801728650001101746650002201757650001101779650001301790650002101803650001301824650001101837650001301848650001101861650001201872650001401884653002401898653001301922653001301935653002301948653001301971700001701984700002802001773012602029856008302155852000902238655001202247IND60693958120221119104749.0200628e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069395812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yu-Han10aSynthesis of low surface energy thin film of polyepichlorohydrin-triazole-ols  ap. 452-463.  aThe dispersive and polar components of surface energy are influenced by the effective molecular size and the intra-molecular configurations of the polar groups, respectively. The surface energy was hypothesized that the surface energy of a polyepichlorohydrin (PECH)-triazole polymer can be reduced by adding an end hydroxyl group (a polar group) which can interact with the nitrogen on the triazole group to reduce the net dipole of the molecule and to reduce the increase in dispersive surface energy by the addition of alkyl chain (dispersive group).The chlorine atom on PECH rubber was firstly substituted by an azide group, which was then converted to triazole groups linked with alkyl-ol that contained 1–4 carbon atoms. The polymers thus-produced were then spin-coated onto a silicon wafer to form a thin film characterized by static contact angles (30 s contact) and dynamic contact angles for drops of water and diiodomethane.The newly synthesized materials have sufficient thin film-formation capacity. Dual interactions that involve interactions between alkyl-ol hydroxyl group and amine nitrogen and the interaction between ether oxygen and imine nitrogen cause the dispersive surface energy to decrease as the alkyl chain length increases. Consequently, a very low polar surface energy of 0.14 mJ/m² was obtained for PECH-triazole-propyl-ol, a material without any halogen atoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazides 3acarbon 3achlorine 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3aimines 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3arubber 3asilicon 3atriazoles 0aPolyepichlorohydrin 0aTriazole 0aHydroxyl 0aLow surface energy 0aPolarity1 aChen, Guohua1 aLee, D.

A snapshot of the physiological state of an organism can be provided by metabolic fingerprints. However, to inform chemical risk assessment, multivariate metabolic fingerprints need to be converted to readable end points suitable for effect estimation and comparison. The concentration- and time-dependent responsiveness of metabolic fingerprints to the PS-II inhibitor isoproturon was investigated by use of a Myriophyllum spicatum bioassay. Hydrophilic and lipophilic leaf extracts were analyzed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and preprocessed with XCMS. Metabolic changes were aggregated in the quantitative metabolic effect level index (MELI), allowing effect estimation from Hill-based concentration–response models. Hereby, the most sensitive response on the concentration scale was revealed by the hydrophilic MELI, followed by photosynthetic efficiency and, 1 order of magnitude higher, by the lipophilic MELI and shoot length change. In the hydrophilic MELI, 50% change compares to 30% inhibition of photosynthetic efficiency and 10% inhibition of dry weight change, indicating effect development on different response levels. In conclusion, aggregated metabolic fingerprints provide quantitative estimates and span a broad response spectrum, potentially valuable for establishing adverse outcome pathways of chemicals in environmental risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3abioassays 3achemical risk assessment 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental assessment 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrophilicity 3aisoproturon 3aleaf extracts 3amodels 3aphotosystem II 3aphysiological response 3aphysiological state 3aprediction1 aSchreiber, René1 aOtto, Matthias1 aHeilmeier, Hermann1 aAltenburger, R.,1 aSchmitt-Jansen, Mechthild0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 July 07, v. 49, no. 13 p.8096-8104dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b013863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245012200132300001500254506002800269520141600297592002801713506003701741650001701778650001501795650001801810650001601828650002601844650001101870650002401881650001201905650001701917650001301934650002001947653002001967653002701987653002402014653001502038700002002053700002002073700001402093773012802107852000902235655001202244IND60739869420221207072406.0210420e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073986942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 ayazdekhasti, M.14aThe Effect of Different Saline Irrigation Regimes on the Yield of Grain Sorghum and Yield Simulation using SWAP Model  ap. 95-106.  aResource is Open Access  aDue to the dry climate and limitation of fresh water resources, using fresh and salt water is a solution for crop production under salinity conditions. This study was conducted at Isfahan University of Technology as a randomized complete block design with three replications and five irrigation management treatments in 2014. The treatments included irrigation with saline water (with the salinity of 5 dS/m, based on the relative yield of 75%), irrigation with fresh water (municipal water), alternate irrigation (irrigation with saline water and the next irrigation with fresh water), conjunctive irrigation (half of irrigation with saline water and the other one with fresh water) and irrigation with fresh water to reach the raceme stage, and irrigation with saline water. The maximum wet yield, dry yield and grain yield were related to the fresh water treatment with 4.14, 2.45 and 0.588 kg/m2 and the minimum values were obtained for water their water treated with 1.34, 0.765 and 0.0957 kg/m2 respectively. The conjunctive treatment had the highest yield after fresh water treatment. The various statistical indices showed that this model could be used for sorghum in Isfahan. The determination coefficient for yield was 0.65.The priority of model for yield simulation was salt water at the last stage, alternate irrigation, saline water, conjunctive irrigation and fresh water treatments, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adry climates 3afreshwater 3agrain sorghum 3agrain yield 3airrigation management 3amodels 3apublic water supply 3aracemes 3asaline water 3asalinity 3awater treatment 0asalinity stress 0aconjunctive irrigation 0agrain sorghum yield 0aswap model1 aShayannejad, M.1 aEshghizadeh, H.1 aFeizi, M.0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2018 Nov., v. 22, no. 3 p.95-106dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009300170506010400263506007600367520214700443592002802590506003702618650001202655650002002667650001502687650002202702650000902724650002002733650001402753650003002767650001902797650001702816650001602833651001202849651001602861651002902877651001902906653001902925653002302944653002302967700002202990700002403012700002403036700002003060700001803080773009903098856008203197852000903279655001203288IND60766139220221207084538.0220606s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076613922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crm.2022.1004032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan den Hurk, Bart10aLiving with sea-level rise in North-West Europe: Science-policy challenges across scales  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSea-level rise (SLR) confronts coastal societies and stakeholders with increasing hazards and coastal risks with large uncertainties associated to these changes. Adaptation to SLR requires societal and policy decision-making to consider these changing risks, which are in turn defined by socio-economic development objectives and the local societal context. Here, we review some of the key challenges facing governments, stakeholders and scientists in adapting to SLR, and key aspects of successful adaptation, by exploring different approaches to SLR and coastal adaptation planning in three western European countries, the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Several common challenges of SLR adaptation emerge across the different settings, including the inherent uncertainty regarding future conditions, the significant social and socio-economic consequences, the consideration and distribution of (residual) risk over communities, and the long legacy of present-day decisions that affect future risk and management options supporting future generations. These challenges are addressed differently in the three countries, e.g. in the governance level at which adaptation is initiated, although common elements also emerge. One common emerging element is adaptive pathways planning, which entails dynamic decision-making that breaks uncertain decisions into manageable elements or steps over time, while keeping options for the future. Another common element is the development of effective local science-policy interfaces, as engagement of local decision-makers and citizens is essential to manage conflicting interests. Lastly, we find that social and communication sciences have great potential to support effective science-policy interfaces, e.g. though identifying societal tipping points. Yet, in decisions on SLR adaptation, insights from these fields are rarely used to date. We conclude that supporting science-policy interactions for adaptation decision-making at relevant (inter)national to local scales through tailored multi-disciplinary scientific assessments is an important way forward for SLR adaptation in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3adecision making 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3arisk 3arisk management 3asea level 3asocioeconomic development 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 3aNorthern European region 3aUnited Kingdom 0aSea Level Rise 0aCoastal management 0aClimate adaptation1 aBisaro, Alexander1 aHaasnoot, Marjolijn1 aNicholls, Robert J.1 aRehdanz, Katrin1 aStuparu, Dana0 tClimate risk management.g2022, v. 35 p.100403-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2022.1004033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013000173520197300303592002802276650001902304650003302323650002102356650001302377650001802390650001202408650001702420653001702437653003302454653001902487653003002506700001702536700001602553700002102569773011302590856008602703852000902789655001202798IND60745231320221119090558.0210911e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074523132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1282902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiacomini, Davide10aLocal Governments’ environmental disclosure via social networks: Organizational legitimacy and stakeholders’ interactions  aIn recent years, the use of social media has considerably increased interaction between the public sector and citizens.

This article explores whether and how local governments use the social platform Facebook with organizational legitimacy purposes and to interact with citizens on environmental sustainability. The paper contributes to understanding of how a social media platform could be regarded as a tool for disclosure of environmental information by local governments and the related organizational challenges.Starting from the list of all Italian municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, we analyse text data scraped from each local government's Facebook page over a six-year period (2012–2017). The study is twofold: firstly, it measures the municipalities' disclosure of environmental issues via Facebook, considering also some independent variables such as political orientation and geographical area; secondly, it evaluates citizens' reactions with local governments' environmental posts looking also at the organizational processes connected to the evolution of sustainability disclosure.Findings indicate an increasing general use of Facebook by local governments as a tool for sustainability disclosure despite a decrease in other sustainability reporting practices. During the same period, citizens' reaction with environmental posts grew faster than interest in general posts. Municipalities communicated more on environmental issues they perceived as relevant, although they did not align themselves with citizens' views. In fact, there seems to be a decoupling of interests. This study contributes to the literature on social platforms’ use by municipalities in the environmental disclosure system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental sustainability 3alocal government 3apolitics 3apublic sector 3asociety 3astakeholders 0aSocial media 0aEnvironmental accountability 0aSustainability 0aOrganizational legitimacy1 aRocca, Laura1 aZola, Paola1 aMazzoleni, Mario0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 317 p.128290-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1282903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245010700178300001400285506002800299520137600327592002801703506003701731650001601768650001201784650001401796650001101810650002601821651001001847653001801857653002501875653001201900653001801912653001801930700001701948700002101965700001801986773012602004856008802130852000902218655001202227IND60739869720221207072414.0180530e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073986972DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2007.41.1.8592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUbalde, Josep Miquel10aInfluence of edapho-climatic factors on grape quality in Conca de Baberà vineyards (Catalonia, Spain)  ap. 33-41.  aResource is Open Access  aAims: Soil and climate of 3vineyards located in Catalonia (Spain) have been characterized in order todetermine their influence on grape quality (yield and berry composition). Methods and results: All 3 plots are very close, so only interannual climatic data of the nearest meteorological station have been considered. Besides determining chemical and physical properties of soils, the soil water availability has been characterised using capacitance sensors for the period from 2003 to 2005. Both yield and berry composition data were available from Miguel Torres Winery. Climatic data and water availability explained 70% of vintage variability and soil data explained 28% of vintage variability. The edapho-climatic factors had generally a high power of estimation of yield and quality of grapes (R2 > 0.75). Climate appeared to be the most influencing factor, followed by water availability, in particular for models referring to must data. Generally, soil data had influence on yield and some must data. Conclusion: The edapho-climatic data explain most of the vintage variability and have a high power of estimation on grape quality. Significance and impact of study:This study remarks the importance of a global approach which takes inot account at least climate and soil water availability to understand the functioning of vines and evolution of berry composition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acapacitance 3aclimate 3aevolution 3agrapes 3aplant available water 3aSpain 0avineyard soil 0aMediteranean climate 0aterroir 0asoil moisture 0agrape quality1 aSort, Xavier1 aPoch, Rosa Maria1 aPorta, Miquel0 tOENO One.g2007 Mar., v. 41, no. 1 p.33-41dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2007.41.1.8593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009300167500001900260520202100279592002802300650002202328650001402350650001202364650002102376650002602397650001102423650001502434650001802449650001402467650002002481650001302501650000902514650001202523650001502535650001002550650002202560650001602582650002102598650001702619651001002636653001502646653001602661653001502677653002102692653002202713700001902735700001902754700001702773700001702790773011602807856008402923852000903007655001203016IND60719791020221117203228.0210506e20210228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071979102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1066542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Hong-Lian10aResponse of different organic mulch treatments on yield and quality of Camellia oleifera  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUneven seasonal rainfall results in insufficient water supply and low yelds of Camellia oleifera growing in mountainous and hilly areas without irrigation conditions. To assess the effectiveness of mulching on the yield and quality of three cultivars of C. oleifera (‘Hengdongdatao’, ‘Huashuo’ and ‘Xianglin 210’) and its influence of preserving soil moisture, a field experiment was conducted in 2016 in Changning, Hunan. Mulching materials of ecological pad (T1), straw (T2), straw and ecological pad (T3), gravel (T4), sawdust (T5) and camellia shell (T6) were tested and compared with un-mulched (CK). The mulch material with the strongest cooling effect in high-temperature weather was T2. The possible reason is that the surface roughness of the mulching material is good for reflecting light. T3 was the most effective at maintaining soil moisture. The reason is that straw and ecological pad increased the thickness of the cover layer and their small pore size, thus the evaporation rate decreased. It can appropriately stable the temperature in high-temperature weather and can better maintain the soil moisture to provide adequate water for growth. T1showed soil moisture by 14.93%, 14.98%, 14.89% for three cultivars, respectively. All treatments increased yield compared to CK. T1 showed the highest yield and was higher than CK by 58%, 61% and 124% for Hengdongdatao, Huashuo, and Xianglin 210, respectively. Mulching with T1 (40.23% and 39.63%) resulted in the highest oil content ratio in ‘Hengdongdatao’ and ‘Huashuo’ and mulching with T4 (36.93%) resulted in highest oil content ratio in ‘Xianglin 210’. Treatment of the ‘Xianglin 210’cultivar with T1 was re-tested in 2017. In all months analyzed, related indicators measured were significantly different compared with CK. This research suggests that mulching organic material to C. oleifera hilly area is an effective measure to solve seasonal drought and increase yield when there are no irrigation conditions present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia oleifera 3acultivars 3adrought 3aevaporation rate 3afield experimentation 3agravel 3airrigation 3alipid content 3amountains 3aorganic mulches 3aporosity 3arain 3asawdust 3asoil water 3astraw 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3awater management 3awater supply 3aChina 0aFatty acid 0aOil content 0aSeed yield 0aSeasonal drought 0aMulching material1 aChen, Zhi-Gang1 aJia, Ting-Ting1 aSu, Qian-Wei1 aSu, Shu-Chai0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Feb. 28, v. 245 p.106654-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1066543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245009700158300002000255520121000275592002801485650001901513650001901532650003101551650001701582650001901599650001601618650001901634650001901653653002901672653002501701653002101726653001901747653003201766700001801798700001601816700001201832700001401844700001901858700001801877700001501895700001701910773012601927856008002053852000902133655001202142IND60566209820221121171954.0170405e20170405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056620982DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b017212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jie10aOxidative Polyoxometalates Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Visible-Light CO2 Reduction  ap. 11689-11695.  aDeveloping a photocatalysis system for converting CO₂ to valuable fuels or chemicals is a promising strategy to address global warming and fossil fuel consumption. Exploring photocatalysts with high-performance and low-cost has been two ultimate goals toward photoreduction of CO₂. Herein, noble-metal-free polyoxometalates (Co4) with oxidative ability was first introduced into g-C₃N₄ resulted in inexpensive hybrid materials (Co4@g-C₃N₄) with staggered band alignment. The staggered composited materials show a higher activity of CO₂ reduction than bare g-C₃N₄. An optimized Co4@g-C₃N₄ hybrid sample exhibited a high yield (107 μmol g–¹ h–¹) under visible-light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm), meanwhile maintaining high selectivity for CO production (94%). After 10 h of irradiation, the production of CO reached 896 μmol g–¹. Mechanistic studies revealed the introduction of Co4 not only facilitate the charge transfer of g-C₃N₄ but greatly increased the surface catalytic oxidative ability. This work creatively combined g-C₃N₄ with oxidative polyoxometalates which provide novel insights into the design of low-cost photocatalytic materials for CO₂ reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nitride 3aenergy use and consumption 3afossil fuels 3aglobal warming 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 0agraphitic carbon nitride 0acomposited materials 0apolyoxometalates 0aphotocatalysis 0areduction of carbon dioxide1 aChen, Weichao1 aSun, Chunyi1 aHan, Lu1 aQin, Chao1 aChen, Mengmeng1 aWang, Xinlong1 aWang, Enbo1 aSu, Zhongmin0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 9, no. 13 p.11689-11695dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b017213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009400161300001600255500001900271520090200290592002801192650003001220650001601250650001301266650001701279650002501296650001201321650001501333650001201348650002001360650002101380650001501401650000701416650001101423650001401434650002301448650002301471650001101494650002001505650000901525653001601534653002301550653001601573653002201589700001701611700002301628773015901651856007801810852000901888655001201897IND60716773120221122233818.0201107e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677312DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.DR-13602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPushpa, B.P.10aFormulation of hypotonic electrolyte re-hydration whey drinks from paneer and cheese whey  ap. 197-201.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present study, formulation of electrolyte drink from paneer and cheese whey was done by enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose to simple sugars and adjusting the salt levels to meet the World Health Organization requirements (245 mOsm/L) for Oral Rehydration Salt.

Field studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of mulch surface color on spectral composition of canopy light and the effect of these changes on pod yield of ‘Colossus’ and ‘Mississippi Silver’ cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.]. Cowpea was grown on a Norfolk loamy sand (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Typic Kandiudult) and mulched with red, white, and black surface-colored mulches for four site-years. The far-red (FR) to red (R) photo ratios of reflected light were expressed relative to the FR/R ratio in incoming sunlight, which was assigned a value of 1.00 at the time of measurement. The FR/R ratios of light reflected from the various colored surfaces were stable relative to sunlight during the study periods; light reflected from black and white mulch surfaces had mean FR/R ratios of 1.05 ± 0.05. Red mulches reflected light with mean FR/R ratios of 1.25 ± 0.05. White, red, and black surfaces reflected = 35, 12, and 3% of the incoming photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), respectively. Mean daily soil temperatures at 20 mm varied <1 °C among treatments. The cultivar and the color ✕ cultivar treatment effects were not significant. Cowpea grown over red, white, and black mulches had 4-site-yr means of 6.74, 6.32, and 6.02 Mg ha⁻¹, respectively; the red treatment mean was significantly higher (P = 0.08). It was concluded that the FR/R ratio in light reflected from mulch surfaces can influence yield of cowpea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3acolor 3amulching 3areflectance 3afar-red light 3ared light 3acanopy 3acrop yield 3apods 3aplastic film1 aMatheny, T.

In this report we estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza A(H3N2) and other circulating viruses, and describe further characteristics of the 2015–2016 influenza season in Beijing.We estimated VE of the 2015–2016 trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) against laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection using the test-negative study design. The effect of prior vaccination on current VE was also examined.Of 11,000 eligible patients included in the study, 2969 (27.0%) were influenza positive. Vaccination coverage was 4.2% in both cases and controls. Adjusted VE against all influenza was 8% (95% CI: −16% to 27%): 18% (95% CI: −38% to 52%) for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 54% (95% CI: 16% to 74%) for influenza A(H3N2), and −8% (95% CI: −40% to 18%) for influenza B/Victoria. The overall VE for receipt of 2015–2016 vaccination only, 2014–2015 vaccination only, and vaccinations in both seasons was −15% (95% CI: −63% to 19%), −25% (95% CI: −78% to 13%), and 18% (95% CI: −11% to 40%), respectively.Overall the 2015–2016 TIV was protective against influenza infection in Beijing, with higher VE against the A(H3N2) viruses compared to A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aexperimental design 3ainactivated vaccines 3ainfluenza 3apatients 3avaccination 3aviruses 3aChina 0aInfluenza 0aVaccine effectiveness 0aTest-negative design 0aChina1 aPan, Yang1 aHackert, Volker1 aHoek, Wim van der,1 aMeijer, Adam1 aKrafft, Thomas1 aYang, Peng1 aWang, Quanyi0 tVaccine.g2018 Aug. 09, v. 36, no. 33 p.4993-5001dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245014900163300002000312520108200332592002801414650000801442650001001450650001701460650001901477650001901496650001101515650001301526650001801539650001701557653001701574653001801591653002601609653004001635653002601675700001801701700001601719700001401735700001501749700001801764773012601782856008001908852000901988655001201997IND60566209920221121172039.0170405e20170405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056620992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b018502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Ai-Xiang10aGemini-Type Tetraphenylethylene Amphiphiles Containing [12]aneN3 and Long Hydrocarbon Chains as Nonviral Gene Vectors and Gene Delivery Monitors  ap. 11546-11556.  aFour gemini amphiphiles decorated with triazole–[12]aneN₃ as the hydrophilic moiety and various long hydrocarbons as hydrophobic moieties, 1–4, were designed to form micelles possessing the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property for gene delivery and tracing. All four amphiphiles give ultralow critical micelle concentrations, are pH-/photostable and biocompatible, and completely retard the migration of plasmid DNAs at low concentrations. The DNA-binding abilities of the micelles were fully assessed. The coaggregated nanoparticles of 1–4 with DNAs could convert back into AIE micelles. In vitro transfections indicated that lipids 1 and 2 and their originated liposomes bearing decent delivering abilities have great potentials as nonviral vectors. Finally, on the basis of the transfection and the transitions between condensates and micelles, lipid 2 was singled out as the first example for real-time tracing of the intracellular deliveries of nonlabeled DNA, which provides spatiotemporal messages about the processes of condensate uptake and DNA release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3agenes 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3atransfection 0aAIE micelles 0agemini lipids 0anonviral gene vectors 0amicelle and nanoparticle transition 0agene delivery tracing1 aTan, Zheng-Li1 aShi, You-Di1 aSong, Lin1 aGong, Bing1 aLu, Zhong-Lin0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 9, no. 13 p.11546-11556dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b018503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245011100181300001600292520179600308592002802104650001002132650001202142650001302154650002102167650000902188650001102197650002302208650001802231650001002249650001602259650001902275650001902294650002102313650002402334650001202358653002102370653001802391653001602409653002902425653000702454700002902461700003102490700003002521700003802551700003502589700003002624700002702654700005902681773010502740856008502845852000902930655001202939IND60636396320221121035022.0200717e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063639632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Calviño, David10aUsing pine bark and mussel shell amendments to reclaim microbial functions in a Cu polluted acid mine soil  ap. 102-111.  aAn extremely acid mine soil polluted with Cu was amended with pine bark, crushed mussel shell or a 1:1 mixture of these two by-products. The performance of the soil microbial community was measured as the bacterial and fungal community growth, which were monitored during 2 years following the amendments. Pine bark caused significant increases of microbial growth rates, but with distinct differences between fungal and bacterial groups. Bacterial growth increased transiently at intermediate rates of pine bark applications, but returned to control rates within 2 years of application. In contrast, pine bark applications consistently increased fungal growth with effects that were maintained throughout the study period. The addition of only crushed mussel shell to the mine soil caused very delayed positive effects on the bacterial growth and almost no significant effects on the fungal growth. However, the combination of pine bark with crushed mussel shells 1:1 mixtures caused positive growth responses of both bacteria and fungi that remained persistent throughout the 2 years of study. Fungal and bacterial growth were both suppressed in the mine soil by the lack of organic matter. In addition, bacterial growth was also secondarily suppressed by acidity, and hence, when organic matter (pine bark) additions were combined with pH increases (crushed mussel shell additions), bacterial growth was additionally stimulated. In conclusion, the proposed mixture of by-products (pine bark and crushed mussel shell) is suggested as a promising reclamation strategy for acid mine soils. These results also suggest that in soils like that studied here the organic matter limitation is a more important factor than the soil pH and Cu availability for fungal and bacterial performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aacidity 3abacteria 3abacterial growth 3abark 3acopper 3afungal communities 3afungal growth 3afungi 3amined soils 3aorganic matter 3apolluted soils 3ashell (molluscs) 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil pH 0aBacterial growth 0aFungal growth 0aBy-products 0aDissolved organic matter 0apH1 aCutillas-Barreiro, Laura1 aNóvoa-Muñoz, Juan Carlos1 aDíaz-Raviña, Montserrat1 aFernández-Sanjurjo, María José1 aÁlvarez-Rodríguez, Esperanza1 aNúñez Delgado, Avelino,1 aArias-Estévez, Manuel1 aRousk, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3062-41910 tApplied soil ecology.g2018 June, v. 127 p.102-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002300163245013200186300001600318520163500334592002801969650002501997650002402022650002002046650001702066650001302083650002402096650002402120650001302144650001102157650001102168650001502179650002402194650002402218650001702242650001502259650002102274650002402295650003002319650002502349650002802374650003102402650002102433650002302454653001402477653002002491653001302511653002502524653002102549653002502570700001602595700001802611700001902629773013802648852000902786856008002795655001202875IND4440363920221121191757.0181123e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444036392DNAL7 a213391312pmid7 a10.1177/10820132093532212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrihuel-Iranzo, B.10aTemperature and Ultra Low Oxygen Effects and Involvement of Ethylene in Chilling Injury of ‘Rojo Brillante’ Persimmon Fruit  ap. 159-167.  aThe effects of storage temperature, inhibition of ethylene action by treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and ultra low oxygen (ULO) atmosphere on chilling injury (CI), fruit firmness and ethylene production in the astringent ‘Rojo Brillante’ persimmon fruit were investigated. CI symptoms were manifested as a very dramatic loss of firmness after fruit transfer from cold storage to shelf-life conditions (18 °C). During cold storage, fruit softening appeared more rapidly in fruit stored at the intermediate temperature of 10 °C than at 1°C or 14.5 °C. Ethylene production increased with storage time at the chilling temperature (1 °C) but a sharp increase took place upon fruit transfer from 1 °C to ambient temperature. This ethylene increase was accompanied by a loss of fruit firmness associated with chilling damage development. A pre-treatment with the competitive inhibitor of ethylene action 1-MCP, at 1 μL/L, reduced firmness loss and mitigated CI damage but considerably increased ethylene production in fruit transferred to shelf-life conditions after a prolonged cold storage period. Collectively, these results suggest a role of ethylene in the reduction of flesh firmness and consequently in the induction of CI in persimmon fruit. Moreover, ethylene exerts a negative feedback regulation of cold-induced ethylene biosynthesis. Storage of ‘Rojo Brillante’ persimmon fruit under ULO (1.3—1.8% O₂, v/v) atmosphere did not affect the incidence of CI but reduced fruit astringency, suggesting that ULO may be an alternative postharvest storage system for ‘Rojo Brillante’ persimmon fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aambient temperature 3achilling injury 3acold storage 3aethylene 3aethylene inhibitors 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afruits 3aoxygen 3apersimmons 3apostharvest systems 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 2aAtmosphere 2aCold Temperature 2aCold-Shock Response 2aCyclopropanesxmetabolism 2aDiospyrosxchemistry 2aEthylenesxbiosynthesis 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFruitxchemistry 2aOxygenxmetabolism 0apersimmon 0achilling injury 0aethylene 0a1-methylcyclopropene 0aultra low oxygen 0a‘Rojo Brillante’1 aMiranda, M.1 aZacarías, L.1 aLafuente, M.T.0 tFood science and technology international.g2010 Apr., v. 16, no. 2 p.159-167dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132093532213Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02359naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002000158245005100178300001600229520135500245592002801600650001201628650001101640650002201651650001201673650003301685650001601718650002401734650002501758650003301783650002401816700001601840773009201856856004001948852000901988655001201997IND50072114320221120052614.0140121e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007211432DNAL7 a243508972pmid7 a10.1111/ele.122252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenhamou, Simon10aOf scales and stationarity in animal movements  ap. 261-272.  aWith recent technological advances in tracking devices, movements of numerous animal species can be recorded with a high resolution over large spatial and temporal ranges. This opens promising perspectives for understanding how an animal perceives and reacts to the multi‐scale structure of its environment. Yet, conceptual issues such as confusion between movement scales and searching modes prevent us from properly inferring the movement processes at different scales. Here, I propose to build on stationarity (i.e. stability of statistical parameters) to develop a consistent theoretical framework in which animal movements are modelled as a generic composite multi‐scale multi‐mode random walk model. This framework makes it possible to highlight scales that are relevant to the studied animal, the nature of the behavioural processes that operate at each of these different scales, and the way in which the processes involved at any given scale can interact with those operating at smaller or larger scales. This explicitly scale‐focused approach should help properly analyse actual movements by relating, for each scale and each mode, the values of the main model parameters (speed, short‐ and long‐term persistences, degree of stochasticity) to the animal's needs and skills and its response to its environment at multiple scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3amodels 3aphysical activity 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aEnvironment 2aModels, Theoretical 2aMovementxphysiology 2aSpatial Behaviorxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity1 aNathan, Ran0 tEcology letters.g2014 Mar., v. 17, no. 3 p.261-272dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12225  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007100153245008500224300001600309500001500325520105600340592002801396650001401424650002201438650002001460650001501480650001201495650001901507650002401526650001901550650003701569650001301606650001101619650002301630650001501653650001701668650000901685650000701694650001501701650002101716650001001737653001101747653002101758653001201779653001401791653000901805653001401814653001401828700006801842700003101910700001901941700002301960700003201983700002902015700002002044773010602064856008802170852000902258655001202267IND60626424820221117192136.0190318e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062642482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhizelini, Angela Michelato1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4115-217710aFungal communities in oil contaminated mangrove sediments – Who is in the mud?  ap. 181-188.  a2019-12-06  aMangroves are ecosystems located in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and are vital for coastal protection. Their unique characteristics make them hotspots for carbon cycling and biological diversity. Studies on isolated filamentous fungi and environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence sediments offer new understandings on how to preserve mangroves. Here we report on the filamentous fungi isolated from four mangroves. We correlated fungal community composition with sediment texture, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentration (oil pollution), pH, salinity, organic matter, total and thermotolerant coliforms (sewage pollution). In total we identified 34 genera and 97 species. The most polluted sites had highest species richness whereas the best preserved site showed the lowest species richness. Oil spill and sewage pollution were identified as the drivers of fungal community composition in the most polluted sites. We found very distinct fungal communities with no >5 species shared between any two mangrove sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3acoliform bacteria 3awater pollution 3aoil spills 3atexture 3aheat tolerance 3acommunity structure 3aorganic matter 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asalinity 3asewage 3afungal communities 3asubtropics 3acarbon cycle 3aoils 3apH 3aecosystems 3aspecies richness 3afungi 0aSewage 0aFungal community 0aEcology 0aMangroves 0aPAHs 0amangroves 0aPollution1 aMartins, Kelly Geronazzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0447-44441 aGießelmann, Urs Christian1 aSantoro, Erika1 aPasqualette, Laura1 aMendonça-Hagler, Leda C.S.1 aRosado, Alexandre Soares1 aMacRae, Andrew,0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Feb., v. 139 p.181-188dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008000164300001600244520124200260592002801502650002301530650001801553650001401571650001001585650002601595650001201621650002501633650001401658650001401672650000901686700001701695700002001712700002001732700002101752773013401773856008101907852000901988655001201997IND60548861420221122063503.0160905e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054886142DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-07-11-01832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKour, Anupreet10aMGOS: Development of a Community Annotation Database for Magnaporthe oryzae  ap. 271-278.  aMagnaporthe oryzae causes rice blast disease, which is the most serious disease of cultivated rice worldwide. We previously developed the Magnaporthe grisea–Orzya sativa (MGOS) database as a repository for the M. oryzae and rice genome sequences together with a comprehensive set of functional interaction data generated by a major consortium of U.S. researchers. The MGOS database has now undergone a major redesign to include data from the international blast research community, accessible with a new intuitive, easy-to-use interface. Registered database users can manually annotate gene sequences and features as well as add mutant data and literature on individual gene pages. Over 900 genes have been manually curated based on various biological databases and the scientific literature.

These requirements can be successfully met by a novel extrusion process through nanoporous aluminum oxide templates, which is presented in this study. With this simple method we are able to control the nanofiber diameter by chosing the size of the nanopores and the concentration of the biopolymer feed solution. Nanofiber assembly into different hierarchical fiber arrangements can be achieved with a wide variety of different proteins ranging from the intracellular proteins actin, α-actinin and myosin to the extracellular matrix components collagen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, elastin and laminin. The extrusion of nanofibers can even be applied to the polysaccharides hyaluronan, chitosan and chondroitin sulphate. Moreover, blends of different proteins or proteins and polysaccharides can be extruded into composite nanofibers. With these features our template-assisted extrusion process will lead to new avenues in the development of nanofibrous biomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aaluminum oxide 3abiocompatible materials 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3achondroitin sulfate 3acollagen 3adrug delivery systems 3aelastin 3aextracellular matrix 3aextrusion 3afibrinogen 3afibronectins 3ahyaluronic acid 3alaminin 3amyosin 3ananofibers 3ananopores 3atissue engineering1 aAslankoohiPresent address: Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Zentrum für Material- und Küstenforschung GmbH, Max-Planck-Straße 1, 21502 Geesthacht, Germany., Neda1 aMollenhauer, Christine1 aBoehm, Heike1 aSpatz, Joachim P.1 aBrüggemann, Dorothea0 tIntegrative biology.g2016 Oct. 10, v. 8, no. 10 p.1059-1066dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ib00045b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100005700191245017100248300001800419506007600437520096500513592002801478506003701506650001301543650001901556650001601575650002201591650001801613650002001631650001801651650001301669650002001682650002701702700005501729700001201784700002401796700001401820700001601834700005401850773012901904856008402033852000902117655001202126IND60598659120221207105728.0180702e20180419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059865912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b010512doi7 aPMC64672102pmcid7 a296715802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7242-716410aSite-Specific Profiling of Serum Glycoproteins Using N-Linked Glycan and Glycosite Analysis Revealing Atypical N-Glycosylation Sites on Albumin and α-1B-Glycoprotein  ap. 6292-6299.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMost serum proteins are N-linked glycosylated, and therefore the glycoproteomic profiling of serum is essential for characterization of serum proteins. In this study, we profiled serum N-glycoproteome by our recently developed N-glycoproteomic method using solid-phase extraction of N-linked glycans and glycosite-containing peptides (NGAG) coupled with LC-MS/MS and site-specific glycosylation analysis using GPQuest software. Our data indicated that half of identified N-glycosites were modified by at least two glycans, with a majority of them being sialylated. Specifically, 3/4 of glycosites were modified by biantennary N-glycans and 1/3 of glycosites were modified by triantennary sialylated N-glycans. In addition, two novel atypical glycosites (with N–X–V motif) were identified and validated from albumin and α-1B-glycoprotein. The widespread presence of these two glycosites among individuals was further confirmed by individual serum analyses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalbumins 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3acomputer software 3aglycoproteins 3aglycoproteomics 3aglycosylation 3apeptides 3apolysaccharides 3asolid phase extraction1 aHu, Yingwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4629-09851 aJia, Li1 aEshghi, Shadi Toghi1 aLiu, Yang1 aShah, Punit1 aZhang, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8726-70980 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 19, v. 90, no. 10 p.6292-6299dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b010513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011900166300001600285520126600301592002801567650001401595650002601609650001101635650001501646650001101661650001601672651001601688653001701704653001701721653001401738653002201752653002701774653001301801700001701814773010701831856008501938852000902023655001202032IND60559006520221122191438.0161122e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900652DNAL7 a10.1080/0028825X.2016.12051082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerrie, LR10aAsplenium lepidotum, a new fern species from New Zealand allied to Asplenium oblongifolium and Asplenium obtusatum  ap. 377-391.  aAsplenium lepidotum is described as a new and uncommon fern endemic to the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand. It is related to Asplenium oblongifolium and Asplenium obtusatum , and like them, A. lepidotum has pinnate fronds and is probably tetraploid, the latter character state being inferred for A. lepidotum from its spore size. Asplenium lepidotum is distinguished by abundant scales on the adaxial surface of its pinnae, separating it from both A. oblongifolium and A. obtusatum , as well as Asplenium northlandicum , which is similarly pinnate but octoploid. Furthermore, A. lepidotum has broader scales than A. oblongifolium , and is primarily rupestral at base-rich, inland sites compared with the coastal A. obtusatum and A. northlandicum . Asplenium lepidotum is usually easily distinguished from the octoploid Asplenium lyallii , particularly when the latter is bipinnate or lacking scales on the adaxial surface of its pinnae. From pinnate plants of A. lyallii with abundant scales on the adaxial surface of their pinnae, A. lepidotum can be separated by its smaller spores and less divided terminal pinna. We suggest that A. lepidotum be given a conservation ranking of Naturally Uncommon, with Range Restricted and Data Poor qualifiers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsplenium 3aferns and fern allies 3afronds 3aoctaploidy 3aspores 3atetraploidy 3aNew Zealand 0aAspleniaceae 0aconservation 0alimestone 0aNew Zealand flora 0anorthwest South Island 0ataxonomy1 aBrownsey, PJ0 tNew Zealand journal of botany.g2016 July 2, v. 54, no. 3 p.377-391dTaylor & Francisx1175-86437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0028825X.2016.12051083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011400166300001600280520119300296592002801489650001501517650002301532650002301555650001101578650001601589650002001605650001501625650001601640700001601656700001901672700001601691700001701707700001701724773010101741856008101842852000901923655001201932IND60519522220221121043229.0160503e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051952222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-016-2074-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin-Jian10aSus scrofa matrix attachment region enhances expression of the PiggyBac system transfected into HEK293T cells  ap. 949-958.  aOBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of the Sus scrofa matrix attachment region (SusMAR) on transgene expression in HEK293T cells. RESULTS: Three expression vectors with the MAR at different sites in the PiggyBac (PB) transposon vector backbone were compared: two MARs flanking the β-galactosidase (β-gal) expression cassette, and one at the upstream or downstream site. Bos taurus MAR (BosMAR) and a β-gal expression cassette without MARs were the positive and negative controls, respectively. Compared to the control, β-gal activity of all SusMAR and BosMAR vectors was significantly improved in the presence of PB transposase (PBase). However, only the downstream SusMAR and upstream BosMAR vectors showed increased expression in the absence of PBase. Expression was significantly increased in all vectors with the PBase group compared to those without the PBase group. Gene copy numbers were not increased compared to the negative control. CONCLUSIONS: SusMAR enhanced recombinant gene expression levels and stability in HEK293T cells, was not increase transgene copy number. These results could facilitate the development of vectors for stable production of therapeutic proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3abeta-galactosidase 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acattle 3agene dosage 3agene expression 3atransgenes 3atransposons1 aWang, Jiang1 aWang, Yueying,1 aGuo, Yu-Jie1 aChu, Bei-Bei1 aYang, Guo-Yu0 tBiotechnology letters.g2016 June, v. 38, no. 6 p.949-958dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2074-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005900144245012800203300002000331520117600351592002801527650002301555650002201578650003701600650000901637650002901646650001901675650001301694650001501707650001501722650002501737650001501762650003301777650003701810653002701847653004001874653003001914653003001944653003301974653002102007700006102028700006102089700006502150700005802215700006102273700005902334700006102393773014202454856007802596852000902674655001202683IND60707056920201112000000.0200812e20200710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070705692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c067252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafuente, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2660-372610aIn Situ Synthesis of SERS-Active Au@POM Nanostructures in a Microfluidic Device for Real-Time Detection of Water Pollutants  ap. 36458-36467.  aWe present a simple, versatile, and low-cost approach for the preparation of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-active regions within a microfluidic channel 50 cm in length. The approach involves the UV-light-driven formation of polyoxometalate-decorated gold nanostructures, Au@POM (POM: H₃PW₁₂O₄₀ (PW) and H₃PMo₁₂O₄₀ (PMo)), that self-assemble in situ on the surface of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels without any extra functionalization procedure. The fabricated LoCs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV–vis, Raman, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The SERS activity of the resulting Au@POM-coated lab-on-a-chip (LoC) devices was evaluated in both static and flow conditions using rhodamine R6G. The SERS response of Au@PW-based LoCs was found to be superior to Au@PMo counterparts and outstanding when compared to reported data on metal@POM nanocomposites. We demonstrate the potentialities of both Au@POM-coated LoCs as analytical platforms for real-time detection of the organophosphorous pesticide paraoxon-methyl at 10–⁶ M concentration level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3agold 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3apesticides 3apollutants 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3arhodamines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0alarge SERS-active area 0aspatial uniformity of SERS response 0acharge transfer mechanism 0aPOM-assisted interactions 0aorganophosphorous pesticides 0achip reusability1 aPellejero, Ismael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8448-75431 aClemente, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8787-117X1 aUrbiztondo, Miguel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4931-13581 aMallada, Reyes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4758-93801 aReinoso, Santiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8329-59721 aPina, María P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9897-65271 aGandía, Luis M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3954-46090 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 10, v. 12, no. 32 p.36458-36467dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c067253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245016300159300002000322520129300342592002801635650001101663650001201674650002501686650001101711650003001722650001101752650001801763650000901781650001101790650001501801650001101816650001101827650002301838650001301861650001601874700005101890700001701941700001801958773013801976856008002114852000902194655001202203IND60651562120221120062609.0190711e20190618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065156212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b044572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Xin10aEffect of Doped Metals on Hydrodeoxygenation of Phenol over Pt-Based Bimetallic Alloys: Cₐᵣyₗ–OH Versus CₐₗᵢₚₕₐₜᵢcH–OH Bond Scission  ap. 16873-16882.  aHerein, using density functional theory calculations complemented by microkinetic modeling, we systematically investigated hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol, a model compound for phenolic oxygenates, over two Pt-based bimetallic alloys, namely, M@Pt(111) single-atom surface alloys and M/Pt(111) complete surface alloys, where M = Mo, Fe, Co, and Ni. Our results show that M@Pt(111) is more readily to be formed than M/Pt(111) in the HDO reaction environment. Benzene formation on Mo@Pt(111) is produced almost entirely from partial HDO (PHDO) via CₐₗᵢₚₕₐₜᵢcH–OH bond scission below 700 K, above which, the contribution from direct deoxygenation (DDO) via Cₐᵣyₗ–OH bond scission grows exponentially with increased temperature. A host metal should have moderate hydrogenation (HY) capability for PHDO meanwhile avoids deep HY of the phenyl ring. To achieve an optimal phenolic-HDO activity for hydrocarbon products, a trade-off of oxophilicity of doped M must be carefully considered so that DDO, PHDO, and H₂O formation activity can be promoted simultaneously. For M@Pt(111), the desired oxophilicity of doped M is predicted to be −3.00 to −3.85 eV in terms of OH* binding energy, which in turn can be used as a good descriptor for deoxygenation activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3abenzene 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acobalt 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3ahydrogenation 3airon 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aphenol 3aphysical chemistry 3aplatinum 3atemperature1 aAn, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0760-13571 aWang, Zeming1 aZhou, Jingwen0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 June 18, v. 123, no. 27 p.16873-16882dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b044573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245006100187300001400248520163000262592002801892650001601920650002001936650001001956650001501966650001501981650000901996650001102005650002002016650001302036650001302049650001702062650002002079650001702099650001402116650001102130650001502141700001702156700002002173700001802193700002302211773010602234856008402340990002302424852000902447655001202456IND60097787120221121064521.0141104e20110520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009778712DNAL7 a214197632pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdulla, Aree10aCD40L is not involved in acute experimental pancreatitis  ap. 85-88.  aRecent data suggest that platelets not only control thrombosis and hemostasis but may also regulate inflammatory processes such as acute pancreatitis. However, the specific role of platelet-derived mediators in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis is not known. Herein, we examined the role of CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154) in different models of acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis was induced by repetitive caerulein administration (50μg/kg, i.p.) or infusion of sodium taurocholate (5%–10μl) into the pancreatic duct in wild-type C57BL/6 and CD40L-deficient mice. Neutrophil infiltration, myeloperoxidase (MPO), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) levels, acinar cell necrosis, edema and hemorrhage in the pancreas as well as serum amylase activity and lung levels of MPO were quantified 24h after induction of acute pancreatitis. Caerulein and taurocholate challenge caused a clear-cut pancreatic damage characterized by increased acinar cell necrosis, neutrophil infiltration, focal hemorrhage, edema formation as well as increased levels of serum amylase and MIP-2 in the pancreas and lung MPO and histological damage. Notably, CD40L gene-deficient animals exhibited a similar phenotype as wild-type mice after challenge with caerulein and taurocholate. Similarly, administration of an antibody directed against CD40L had no effect against acute pancreatitis. Our data suggest that CD40L does not play a functional role in experimental acute pancreatitis. Thus, other candidates than CD40L needs to be explored in order to identify platelet-derived mediators in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3achemokine CXCL2 3aedema 3ahemorrhage 3ahemostasis 3amice 3amodels 3amyeloperoxidase 3anecrosis 3apancreas 3apancreatitis 3apathophysiology 3apharmacology 3aphenotype 3asodium 3athrombosis1 aAwla, Darbaz1 aJeppsson, Bengt1 aRegnér, Sara1 aThorlacius, Henrik0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 May 20, v. 659, no. 1 p.85-88dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.03.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012500166300001600291520178400307592002802091650002802119650002302147650002402170650003102194650002902225650002102254650002502275650002402300650001702324650001102341650001802352650001302370650001302383650002002396650001002416650001002426650001102436650003202447650001202479650001102491650002102502650002402523650001402547650001002561650001902571650001802590700002302608700001902631700002602650700002102676700002202697700002002719700002602739700001902765773010302784856008102887852000902968655001202977IND60575264120221120085347.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057526412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-017-0609-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhide, Amey J.10aGenomic and functional characterization of coleopteran insect-specific α-amylase inhibitor gene from Amaranthus species  ap. 319-332.  aThe smallest 32 amino acid α-amylase inhibitor from Amaranthus hypochondriacus (AAI) is reported. The complete gene of pre-protein (AhAI) encoding a 26 amino acid (aa) signal peptide followed by the 43 aa region and the previously identified 32 aa peptide was cloned successfully. Three cysteine residues and one disulfide bond conserved within known α-amylase inhibitors were present in AhAI. Identical genomic and open reading frame was found to be present in close relatives of A. hypochondriacus namely Amaranthus paniculatus, Achyranthes aspera and Celosia argentea. Interestingly, the 3′UTR of AhAI varied in these species. The highest expression of AhAI was observed in A. hypochondriacus inflorescence; however, it was not detected in the seed. We hypothesized that the inhibitor expressed in leaves and inflorescence might be transported to the seeds. Sub-cellular localization studies clearly indicated the involvement of AhAI signal peptide in extracellular secretion. Full length rAhAI showed differential inhibition against α-amylases from human, insects, fungi and bacteria. Particularly, α-amylases from Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera) were not inhibited by AhAI while Tribolium castaneum and Callosobruchus chinensis (Coleoptera) α-amylases were completely inhibited. Molecular docking of AhAI revealed tighter interactions with active site residues of T. castaneum α-amylase compared to C. chinensis α-amylase, which could be the rationale behind the disparity in their IC₅₀. Normal growth, development and adult emergence of C. chinensis were hampered after feeding on rAhAI. Altogether, the ability of AhAI to affect the growth of C. chinensis demonstrated its potential as an efficient bio-control agent, especially against stored grain pests.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3' untranslated regions 3aAchyranthes aspera 3aAmaranthus cruentus 3aAmaranthus hypochondriacus 3aCallosobruchus chinensis 3aCelosia argentea 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aTribolium castaneum 3aactive sites 3aadults 3aalpha-amylase 3abacteria 3acysteine 3adisulfide bonds 3afungi 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsects 3aleaves 3amolecular models 3aopen reading frames 3asecretion 3aseeds 3asignal peptide 3astorage pests1 aChannale, Sonal M.1 aYadav, Yashpal1 aBhattacharjee, Kabita1 aPawar, Pankaj K.1 aMaheshwari, V.

This can benefit the whole organism, but its advantages to genetic parasites have not been explored. Here I model the evolutionary success of a selfish element, such as a transposable element or endosymbiont, which is capable of creating or strengthening a germline-soma distinction in a primitively multicellular host, and find that it will always benefit the element to do so. Genes causing germline sequestration can therefore spread in a population even if germline sequestration is maladaptive for the host organism. Costly selfish elements are expected to survive only in sexual populations, so sexual species may experience an additional push toward germline-soma distinction, and hence toward cell differentiation and multicellularity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEvolutionary transitions 0aIntragenomic conflict 0amulticellularity0 tEvolution.g2008 Aug., v. 62, no. 8 p.2122-2124dBlackwell Science Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2008.00433.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009300162300002000255520159900275592002801874650002801902650001101930650000901941650001301950650002301963650003401986700001602020700001502036700001702051700001502068700001502083700002202098700002402120700005202144773013902196856008102335852000902416655001202425IND60616680020181217000000.0181020e20180918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061668002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b081962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aTechnical Effects of Molecule–Electrode Contacts in Graphene-Based Molecular Junctions  ap. 23200-23207.  aThis study focuses on comparing methods for capturing and measuring the charge transport properties of single molecules in gold–graphene contact gaps. We have attempted to measure the single-molecule conductance of a series of 1,n-alkanedithiols (n = 4, 6, 8) tethered between a gold and a graphene contact with three different methods. The conducting probe atomic force microscopy break junction (CP-AFM BJ), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) break junction (STM BJ), and STM-based I(s) techniques for forming molecular junctions with graphene lower contacts were compared. In each case, the upper contact was gold, with a gold-coated AFM probe in the CP-AFM BJ method and a gold STM tip for both the STM BJ and I(s) techniques. Both the CP-AFM BJ and the STM-based I(s) methods yielded similar values for the conductance decay constant values, with βN = 0.56 and 0.40, respectively. In line with previous observations, these are much smaller than values recorded for the same alkanedithiol series in symmetric gold–molecule–gold junctions, where we find that βN = 1.1. This clearly shows the impact of substituting one of the gold contacts for a graphene one. This observation has been previously rationalized as resulting from the breaking of the junction symmetry, the change in electrode–molecule coupling and energy level alignment. On the other hand, stable molecular junctions could not be formed using the STM BJ technique with graphene contacts, which may be because of transient instability in the gold tip contact after it has been pushed hard onto the graphene surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3aenergy 3agold 3agraphene 3aphysical chemistry 3ascanning tunneling microscopy1 aTao, Shuhui1 aFan, Yinqi1 aZhao, Cezhou1 aZhao, Chun1 aSu, Weitao1 aDappe, Yannick J.1 aNichols, Richard J.1 aYang, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1040-42230 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 18, v. 122, no. 40 p.23200-23207dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b081963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013400155300001800289520158500307592002801892650001601920650001701936650001601953650001101969650001101980650001101991650003302002650000902035700002302044700002602067700002402093700002002117700002302137700002902160700003202189700002302221773010402244856007502348852000902423655001202432IND60577786620180713000000.0170810e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057778662DNAL7 a10.1021/ma20236062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huan10aNanocavitation in Carbon Black Filled Styrene–Butadiene Rubber under Tension Detected by Real Time Small Angle X-ray Scattering  ap. 1529-1543.  aNanocavitation was detected for the first time in carbon black filled styrene–butadiene rubber (CB-SBR) under uniaxial loading by real time small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) using synchrotron X-ray radiation. A three phase model was developed to calculate the void volume fraction from the scattering invariant Q determined from the observed SAXS patterns. The normalized scattering invariant Q/Q₀, where Q₀ is the invariant before deformation, greatly increased above a critical extension ratio λₒₙₛₑₜ which we attribute to the formation of nanovoids. Analysis of the 2D scattering patterns show that voids formed are 20–40 nm in size and elongated along the tensile direction. Cavities formed beyond λₒₙₛₑₜ are smaller as λ increases. Results from the scattering experiments are strongly supported by macroscopic volume change measurements on the samples under similar uniaxial strain. A nearly constant nanocavitation stress σₒₙₛₑₜ (25 MPa) was observed when the filler volume fraction ϕCB was larger than 14%. This value is much higher than that predicted based on the elastic instability of small voids in an unfilled elastomer and shows only a weak dependence on the cross-linking density νC in heavily cross-linked samples. An energy based cavitation criterion stressing the importance of confined domains between particles or clusters of particles was adopted and found to be consistent with the observed results. The nanocavities are thought to alter the local stress state and promote local shear motion of filler particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3aenergy 3amodels 3arubber 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asoot1 aScholz, Arthur K.,1 ade Crevoisier, Jordan1 aVion-Loisel, Fabien1 aBesnard, Gilles1 aHexemer, Alexander1 aBrown, H.

Agmatine is a novel endogenous ligand at α₂-adrenoceptors, imidazoline and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, as well as a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. There is no evidence presented for the relationship between the acute locomotor stimulating effect of ethanol and agmatine. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of agmatine on acute ethanol-induced locomotor hyperactivity in mice. Adult male Swiss–Webster mice (26–36g) were used as subjects. Locomotor activity of the mice was recorded for 30min immediately following intraperitoneal administration of ethanol (0.5, 1 and 2g/kg) or saline (n=8 for each group). Agmatine (5, 10 and 20mg/kg) or saline was administered intraperitoneally to another four individual groups (n=8 for each group) of the mice 20min before the ethanol injection. In these groups, locomotor activity was also recorded immediately following ethanol (0.5g/kg) injection for 30min. Ethanol (0.5g/kg) produced some significant increases in locomotor activity of the mice. Agmatine (5–20mg/kg) significantly blocked the ethanol (0.5g/kg)-induced locomotor hyperactivity. These doses of agmatine did not affect the locomotor activity in naive mice when they were administered alone. Our results suggest that agmatine has an important role in ethanol-induced locomotor hyperactivity in mice. There may be a relationship between the addictive psychostimulant effects of the ethanol and central agmatinergic system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aagmatine 3aethanol 3aintraperitoneal injection 3alocomotion 3amice 3anitric oxide synthase 3apharmacology 3areceptors1 aKayir, Hakan1 aÖztürk, Yusuf,1 aUzbay, Tayfun0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 May 20, v. 659, no. 1 p.26-29dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.03.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245014100181300001800322520225700340592002802597650002402625650002002649650001802669650002002687650002102707650004902728650001002777650001602787650001902803650001202822650001102834650000902845650001502854650000902869650002402878650002302902773011802925856008103043852000903124655001203133IND60515635120221117044502.0160316e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051563512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-015-1195-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexanderova, Olga Nikolaevna12aA new insight into a problem of mediating effects of humic acids on binding and biological effects of organic pollutants in natural soil  ap. 1316-1322.  aPURPOSE: A major focus of this manuscript is to investigate the molecular environment of soil where organic pollutants including an active functional group, such as amine, are bound to humic acids (HA). Close consideration has been taken to binding and biological effects of organic pollutants in natural soil mediated by HA in dependence on the amine base. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation is carried out using a method of spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (SL EPR). Spin labels (SL) 2,5,5-trimethyl-2-(3-aminophenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yloxy (Anilino-SL) and 4-Amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4-Amino-TEMPO), as well as extracellular fungal laccase from Trametes versicolor, are applied to samples of chernozem, its HA and standard HA, such as Elliott Soil HA, Pahokee Peat HA, leonardite. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: It is shown that HA mediate the interaction of amines with soil through the partitioning of them among the different compartments of soil in dependence on the amine base. Both aliphatic and aromatic amines become immediately bound to soil organic matter but via different mechanisms. HA bind only the aromatic amines. Their binding sites are located in the hydrophobic and anaerobic compartments of soil. Moreover, spectroscopic analysis evidenced that a number of binding sites are limited, and aromatic amines attracted to hydrophobic compartments in the soil environment form here the ordered structure. Kinetic analysis of a temporal change in the concentration of bound and non-bound aromatic amines points at a pronounced diamagnetic effect of compartments where aromatic amines become bound. In contrast to amine with a weak base, the aliphatic amines are not influenced by HA and remain in an active soil part. CONCLUSIONS: Manuscript concludes that mediating effects of HA are first realized through their electrochemical property. They define and isolate pollutants with a definitive base that can be described using the Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient. This binding in turn defines a biological effect of organic pollutants including amine with a weak base via the oxygen factor that results in a decrease in the magnitude of aerobic soil biota and disbalance of the soil microorganism community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aaromatic amines 3abinding sites 3aedaphic factors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afungi 3ahumic acids 3ahydrophobicity 3alaccase 3aoxygen 3apeat 3apollutants 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3atemporal variation0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2016 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.1316-1322dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-015-1195-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245009600180300001800276520149700294592002801791653001501819653002601834653002501860653002701885653001401912653001401926700002101940700002101961700001801982700003002000773009202030856009002122852000902212655001202221IND60127243420221119155856.0151110e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012724342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00435.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAllister, Bryant F.10aClinal Distribution of a Chromosomal Rearrangement: A Precursor to Chromosomal Speciation??  ap. 1852-1865.  aGeographically structured genetic variants provide an effective means to assess sources of natural selection and mechanisms of adaptation to local environments. Correlated selection pressures along environmental gradients favor subdivision of genomes through chromosomal rearrangement. This study examines populations of Drosophila americana to evaluate selection pressures affecting chromosomal forms distinguished by a centromeric fusion. Analyses of chromosomal polymorphism throughout the Mississippi River Valley in the central United States reveal the presence of a distinct latitudinal cline for the chromosomal rearrangement. The cline has a width of 623 km centered at 35.97°°N and displays a characteristic sigmoid shape consistent with a balance between selection and dispersal. Extreme low temperature during January, an indicator of winter severity, was identified as the environmental variable that most accurately predicts arrangement frequency. An intriguing relationship identified between the chromosomal cline and operational sex ratio indicates that these alternative arrangements of the X chromosome may influence sex-specific survival. A hypothesis for the cline is presented wherein variation associated with the alternative chromosome forms influences distinct overwintering strategies. The resulting subdivision within the genome embodies a transitory stage of a speciation process in which locally adapted gene complexes provide a foundation for species formation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAdaptation 0achromosomal evolution 0apopulation structure 0aselection——natural 0asex ratio 0avariation1 aSheeley, Sara L.1 aMena, Paulina A.1 aEvans, Amy L.1 aSchlöötterer, Christian0 tEvolution.g2008 Aug., v. 62, no. 8 p.1852-1865dBlackwell Science Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2008.00435.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002800189245007400217300001600291506007600307520096100383592002801344506003701372650002501409650001201434650002501446650001601471650001701487650002301504650001801527650001901545650001601564650002301580700001901603700001901622700001701641700002101658700002201679700002601701700002301727773013001750856008201880852000901962655001201971IND60683873420221207131123.0200213e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068387342DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04094-w2doi7 aPMC70160772pmcid7 a321163722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhendov-Moşanu, Aliona10aEffect of lipophilic sea buckthorn extract on cream cheese properties  ap. 628-637.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the physico-chemical, microbiological, sensory properties and antioxidant activity of the functional cream cheese prepared with lipophilic extracts of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.). The first step of the research consisted of an evaluation of the physico-chemical characteristics and the antioxidant capacity of the sea buckthorn lipophilic extracts. The sea buckthorn extracts had a significant antioxidant capacity (67.04 ± 2.67%), a content of total carotenoids of 8.27 ± 0.01 mg L⁻¹ and a content of total polyphenols of 1842.86 ± 1.41 mg/100 g dry vegetal material. The addition of the sea buckthorn extracts did not negatively affect the fresh cream cheese’s sensory characteristics. The addition of sea buckthorn extracts to the cream cheese resulted in an increase of antiradical activity and dry matter content, a decrease in acidity and higher growth inhibitition of germs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3acarotenoids 3acream cheese 3adry matter content 3alipophilicity 3aplant extracts 3apolyphenols 3asensory properties1 aSturza, Rodica1 aOpriş, Ocsana1 aLung, Ildiko1 aPopescu, Liliana1 aPopovici, Violina1 aSoran, Maria-Loredana1 aPatraş, Antoanela0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 Feb., v. 57, no. 2 p.628-637dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-04094-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010400164500001900268520135600287592002801643650002401671650001101695650003201706651001001738653002801748653001501776653001701791653003501808700005801843700001401901700001501915700001801930700001301948700001401961773010201975856008602077852000902163655001202172IND60695508320221120121829.0200804e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069550832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1064782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Han10aSpatial-temporal patterns and characteristics of ecological function between 2009 and 2015 in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEcological function reflects the ability of the land to provide ecological goods to support high-quality human production and life. The evaluation of the county-level ecological function across the whole nation is crucial for sustainable land management, which has not been implemented effectively in China. In this study, we proposed a unified system for the assessment of ecological function that would be comparable at the county level, and we applied the system to evaluate the ecological function of 2850 counties across China based on multi-source data. We also examined the spatiotemporal changes in ecological function from 2009 to 2015 using standard deviational ellipses and coefficients of variation. The results showed that the number of counties with high levels of ecological function in China decreased by 8.13% from 2009 to 2012 and then increased by 0.6% from 2012 to 2015. The spatial pattern of the degradation of ecological function shifted from the east-west direction to the southwest-northeast direction and became centralized in the Central Plains area of China. The regional imbalance in ecological function followed the order from high to low of the central, western, northeastern, and eastern areas of China. Targeted policies were proposed to control the degradation of the ecological function in the four regions in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological function 3ahumans 3asustainable land management 3aChina 0aSpatial-temporal change 0aAssessment 0aCounty level 0aMain Functional Areas Planning1 aZhang, Wanshun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8644-65371 aWang, Hao1 aPeng, Hong1 aZhang, Ziqian1 aKe, Qian1 aBu, Sifan0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Sept., v. 116 p.106478-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1064783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245005500181300001600236500000900252520053200261592002800793650001700821650001700838650001500855650001800870773014800888856009601036852000901132655001201141IND60668704920221117214539.0191125e196107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066870492DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1961.03615995002500040012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinhart, K.

The Mn²⁺ emissions with different quantum yields in the doped NCs in hexane exhibited nearly size-independent and single-exponential decay lifetimes of 1.8 ms at room temperature. The PL lifetimes in all Mn²⁺ in CsPbCl₃-doped NCs had similar temperature dependence from 80 to 300 K, whereas they were size-dependent at elevated temperatures, reflecting thermal degradation of doped NCs. The degradation mechanisms of Mn²⁺ PL were attributed to the amount of surface defects as nonradiative recombination centers generated in size-unchanged and grown Mn²⁺:CsPbCl₃ NCs. The study provides the detailed understanding of the thermal degradation mechanisms in doped perovskite NCs for optoelectronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aemissions 3ahexane 3amanganese 3ananocrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3athermal degradation1 aYuan, Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8731-216X1 aLi, Ji1 aHua, Jie1 aWang, Yunjun1 aZeng, Ruosheng1 aLi, Haibo1 aZhao, Jialong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9020-14360 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 21, v. 122, no. 40 p.23217-23223dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b082953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005100153245006700204520185100271592002802122650003102150650002102181650002002202650002602222650001302248650001802261650001202279650002402291650002402315650001902339650001202358650002302370650001302393651001802406651001502424653001402439653001702453653002402470653004102494653001902535700002002554700001802574700001202592773011902604856008802723852000902811655001202820IND60680649220221118194354.0220321e20200320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068064922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1361642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2630-017810aVariability of sea ice area in the Bohai Sea from 1958 to 2015  aWith the backdrop of continuous global change, it is beneficial to create consistent long-term records of sea ice area on regional scales for ice disaster prevention and risk mitigation. In this study, a piecewise multiple nonlinear regression model was developed to reconstruct long-term daily sea ice area dataset in the Bohai Sea from 1958 to 2015 by linking the related meteorological data and the satellite-derived ice area. The validation analysis show that related meteorological status corresponding to physical process had stable skill of predictive ability, which was able to account for 81% of the observational variance under consideration of sea ice state, freezing and melting phases. The reconstructed daily sea ice area dataset was further used to study the interannual and seasonal variability of sea ice area. The annual maximum ice area (AMIA) and the annual average ice area (AAIA) in the Bohai Sea exhibited a decreasing trend with fluctuation of −0.33 ± 0.18% yr⁻¹ and −0.51 ± 0.16% yr⁻¹ over the period of 1958–2015, respectively. The most obvious change of the Bohai Sea ice area occurred in time scale of ~30 years. The whole study period could be divided into slight increasing stage (1958–1980), significant decreasing stage (1980–1995), and moderate increasing stage (1995–2015). In most years, the annual changes of sea ice area showed an unimodal variation and the freezing period (~65 days) was longer than the melting phase (~40 days) due to the relatively higher freezing rate. In addition, high correlations between AAIA and Arctic Oscillation (AO) index (r = −0.60, p < .01) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (r = −0.69, p < .01) from 1958 to 2015 suggested AO and NAO are the primary large-scale climate factors driving the sea ice variability in the Bohai Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3adisaster preparedness 3afreezing 3aglobal change 3amelting 3ameteorological data 3aregression analysis 3arisk reduction 3asea ice 3aseasonal variation 3avariance 3aArctic region 3aYellow Sea 0aBohai Sea 0aSea ice area 0aData reconstruction 0aInterannual and seasonal variability 0aClimate change1 aUotila, Petteri1 aHuang, Kaiyue1 aGu, Wei0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 20, v. 709 p.136164-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1361643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001300169245010900182300001400291520170400305592002802009650002502037650002502062650001402087650001602101650001402117650002002131650001602151650001902167650001702186650001402203650001002217650002002227650000902247650001302256650002402269650002102293650002202314650001502336650002502351700001302376700001702389700001202406700001402418700001402432700001702446700001602463700001802479700001702497773010602514856008402620990002302704852000902727655001202736IND60097787820221121223552.0141104e20110520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009778782DNAL7 a214197642pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xi14aThe protective effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on isoniazid plus rifampicin induced liver injury in mice  ap. 53-60.  aAntitubercular drugs have been known to be potentially hepatotoxic and may lead to drug-induced liver injury. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on liver injury caused by co-administration with isoniazid and rifampicin, two famous antitubercular drugs. Liver injury was induced by co-treatment with isoniazid (75mg/kg) and rifampicin (150mg/kg) for one week. Mice were orally administered with UDCA (15, 50 and 150mg/kg) 30min before isoniazid and rifampicin. We show that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly increased in mice treated with isoniazid plus rifampicin. An obvious fatty accumulation, accompanied by mild necrosis and inflammation, was observed in liver of mice treated with rifampicin plus isoniazid. In addition, isoniazid plus rifampicin resulted in hepatic apoptosis, as determined by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and caspase-3 activation. Additional experiment showed that isoniazid plus rifampicin significantly increased the level of hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and caused glutathione (GSH) depletion and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) residues in liver. UDCA pretreatment significantly attenuated isoniazid plus rifampicin induced oxidative stress in liver. Importantly, UDCA pretreatment significantly alleviated isoniazid plus rifampicin induced hepatic apoptosis. Moreover, UDCA-mediated anti-apoptotic effect seemed to be associated with its regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax gene expression in liver. These findings suggest that UDCA might protect against isoniazid and rifampicin induced liver injury through its anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3ahepatotoxicity 3ainflammation 3aisoniazid 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3anecrosis 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3arifampicin 3aursodeoxycholic acid1 aXu, Juan1 aZhang, Cheng1 aYu, Tao1 aWang, Hua1 aZhao, Mei1 aDuan, Zi-Hao1 aZhang, Ying1 aXu, Jian-Ming1 aXu, De-Xiang0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 May 20, v. 659, no. 1 p.53-60dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.03.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01683naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001300141245008800154300001800242500002000260520067400280592002800954596006100982650002701043650002301070650001501093650002301108700002101131773014501152856007501297852000901372655001201381IND60680563420221117223417.0200107e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068056342DNAL7 a10.1093/ajae/aaq0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lin10aImpacts of Free Trade Agreements on Agricultural Trade Creation and Trade Diversion  ap. 1351-1363.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper evaluates agricultural trade creation and diversion effects of the most important free trade agreements (FTAs).

The degree and rate of purging also informs us regarding the genetic mechanisms underlying inbreeding depression. We examine the evolution of mean survival and inbreeding depression in survival following serial inbreeding in a seed-feeding beetle, Stator limbatus, which shows substantial inbreeding depression at all stages of development. We created two replicate serially inbred populations perpetuated by full-sib matings and paired with outbred controls. The genetic load for the probability that an egg produces an adult was purged at ∼∼0.45––0.50 lethal equivalents//generation, a reduction of more than half after only three generations of sib-mating. After serial inbreeding we outcrossed all beetles then measured (1) larval survival of outcrossed beetles and (2) inbreeding depression. Survival of outcrossed beetles evolved to be higher in the serially inbred populations for all periods of development. Inbreeding depression and the genetic load were significantly lower in the serially inbred than control populations. Inbreeding depression affecting larval survival of S. limbatus is largely due to recessive deleterious alleles of large effect that can be rapidly purged from a population by serial sib-mating. However, the effectiveness of purging varied among the periods of egg//larval survival and likely varies among other unstudied fitness components. This study presents novel results showing rapid and extensive purging of the genetic load, specifically a reduction of as much as 72%% in only three generations of sib-mating. However, the high rate of extinction of inbred lines, despite the lines being reared in a benign laboratory environment, indicates that intentional purging of the genetic load of captive endangered species will not be practical due to high rates of subpopulation extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGenetic load 0ainbreeding load 0asib-mating 0aStator limbatus1 aScheibly, Kristy L.1 aReed, David H.0 tEvolution.g2008 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.2236-2249dBlackwell Publishing Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2008.00441.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245018500167300002000352520194300372592002802315650003002343650002002373650001102393650001302404650002802417650001302445650002102458700002402479700002202503700001302525700006502538700006002603700006202663773013802725856008002863852000902943655001202952IND60651562920190814000000.0190711e20190626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065156292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b051492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalawi, Ahmed H.10aDirect and Energy-Transfer-Mediated Charge-Transfer State Formation and Recombination in Triangulene-Spacer-Perylenediimide Multichromophores: Lessons for Photovoltaic Applications  ap. 16602-16613.  aWe study the dynamics of primary photoexcitations in three symmetric donor–spacer–acceptor–spacer–donor multichromophores with increasing oligophenylene spacer length, following selective donor or acceptor excitation. Energy levels of the donor and acceptor moieties are tailored to facilitate splitting of the excited state into a lower-lying charge-transfer (CT) state, mimicking the functionality of a donor–acceptor interface for charge generation, thus resulting in long-lived charge separation. Ultrafast electronic energy transfer (ET) from the donor followed by fast hole (back)transfer from the acceptor populates the molecules’ CT states. However, the CT efficiency is found to be close to unity, independent of the donor or acceptor photoexcitation. The ratio of CT and recombination rates, which reflects the population of CT states, increases with the oligophenylene spacer length for both direct hole transfer and hole transfer following ET, boosting the population of CT states under continuous excitation. We observe the population of high-lying “dark” excited states following ET from the donor to the acceptor. The “dark” states successively undergo CT and form CT states of higher energy, with decreased recombination rates, while maintaining the high charge generation efficiency. Changes in CT reaction rates are rationalized within the Marcus theory, with driving forces and reorganization energies evaluated by density functional theory and polarizable continuum models. The present study demonstrates the importance of energetically higher-lying states, which cannot be directly photoexcited yet are accessible through ET from local excited states. Similar processes are anticipated in other donor–acceptor systems, which allow for both energy and CT processes, such as bulk heterojunctions of the polymer and small-molecule donor/nonfullerene acceptor typically used in photovoltaic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy transfer 3amodels 3amoieties 3aphotochemical reactions 3apolymers 3asolar collectors1 aStappert, Sebastian1 aGorenflot, Julien1 aLi, Chen1 aMüllen, K.q(Klaus),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6630-87861 aAndrienko, Denis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1541-13771 aLaquai, Frédéric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5887-61580 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 June 26, v. 123, no. 27 p.16602-16613dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b051493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245011800159300001800277520177800295592002802073650001202101650001602113650001402129650001102143650002502154650003002179651001702209651001502226700001402241700002002255773010802275856008102383852000902464655001202473IND60575264920221120110929.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057526492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-016-3281-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Xu14aThe climatology and interannual variability of the South Asia high and its relationship with ENSO in CMIP5 models  ap. 3507-3528.  aThe present study examines climatology and interannual variability of South Asian high (SAH) and its connection with the ENSO based on 38 coupled models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Results show that multi-model ensemble (MME) can reasonably capture the climatological spatial pattern of the SAH, although its intensity is slightly underestimated. The CCSM4, CESM1-BGC and CESM1-FASTCHEM can well simulate the climatological location and intensity of the SAH. The interannual variability of the SAH is investigated by calculating ratio of the standard deviation of the ten parameters in models with those in observations. The results indicate that the MME can reasonably capture magnitudes of the interannual variability of the area index, intensity index, and longitude of the SAH center. Quasi-4-year period of the SAH intensity index can be well simulated by CMCC-CESM, CMCC-CMS and GFDL-ESM2G, and quasi-5-year period of north–south movement index can be captured by CanCM4, CESM1-CAM5, CESM1-FASTCHEM, CNRM-CM5-2, GFDL-ESM2G and HadCM3. Furthermore, MME can reasonably reproduce seasonal evolution of intensity and location of the SAH except for its east–west movement. The ENSO-SAH relationship is further evaluated. It is found that about two-thirds of the CMIP5 models can capture the observed ENSO-SAH relationship, although the relationship is distinctly exaggerated by several models. The success of these models is attributed to the reasonable simulation of both the “charge” process over the tropical Indian Ocean induced by the ENSO-related anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical eastern Pacific (TEP) and longitude extension of the western boundary of the ENSO-related anomalous SST over the TEP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aclimatology 3alongitude 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3asurface water temperature 3aIndian Ocean 3aSouth Asia1 aChen, Wen1 aChen, Shangfeng0 tClimate dynamics.g2017 June, v. 48, no. 11-12 p.3507-3528dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3281-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01494naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245005300160300001800213520061300231592002800844650002100872650000700893650001900900650001600919700002100935700002300956700002500979773010401004856007501108852000901183655001201192IND60577787120221119181209.0170810e20120214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057778712DNAL7 a10.1021/ma20238152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaduc, Isabelle10aRAFT Polymerization of Methacrylic Acid in Water  ap. 1241-1247.  aReversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of methacrylic acid was successfully performed in water in the presence of a trithiocarbonate, the 4-cyano-4-thiothiopropylsulfanylpentanoic acid (CTPPA), as a RAFT agent.

Assessments of the risks of future droughts, when at a global or a continental scale, are often based on simulations from General Circulation Models (GCMs). When raw GCM simulations are used, it is assumed that the future deviations from modelled historical climatology represent the future drought. On the other hand, it is known that raw GCM simulations are significantly biased for the variables that affect hydrology and a correction is needed before assessments can be performed. We investigate here whether drought assessments based on raw GCM simulations are biased and the typical extent of this bias. Our assessment is based on the use of monthly precipitation data from 18 CMIP3 GCMs, two popular bias correction alternatives and Australia as the study domain. A number of different precipitation drought attributes have been assessed. These include the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), multi-year rainfall statistics and a drought vulnerability statistic that measures the maximum deviation of a time series from its mean.We find significant differences between droughts assessments using raw GCM simulations and using bias corrected sequences. Large increases in drought frequencies are projected for some parts of Australia. Both bias correction methods moderate these increases. This result is consistent across the three different drought statistics. The bias corrected drought projections also generally have slightly more agreement (smaller range of future changes) across the GCMs compared to the raw projections, which is a promising result for attempting to reduce model structural uncertainty. What this study shows is raw model simulations can lead to incorrect drought assessments even at continental scales and bias corrections should be applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3adrought 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahydrology 3arain 3arisk assessment 3asimulation models 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3aAustralia 0aDrought 0aGeneral circulation model 0aBias correction1 aSharma, Ashish0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 June, v. 525 p.472-485dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245013200168300002000300520150600320592002801826650001201854650002301866650003001889650001001919650001701929650001301946650001101959650002301970650002001993650001302013700001702026700002202043700005802065700006202123773013902185856008102324852000902405655001202414IND60616680620221120075204.0181020e20180914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061668062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b086842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMigues, Angela N.10aOn the Rational Design of Zeolite Clusters for Converging Reaction Barriers: Quantum Study of Aldol Kinetics Confined in HZSM-5  ap. 23230-23241.  aWe have performed density functional theory calculations to investigate the convergence of reaction barriers with respect to zeolite cluster size, for multistep reactions catalyzed in HZSM-5. We constructed cluster models of HZSM-5 using the delta-cluster approach reported previously by us. We then computed barriers for different reaction types to determine the cluster sizes and neighbor-list radii needed to fully treat zeolite confinement effects. In particular, we studied the acid-zeolite-catalyzed aldol reactions of acetone with formaldehyde, furfural, and hydroxymethyl-furfural, in three steps: keto/enol tautomerization of acetone, combination between each aldehyde and the enol, and aldol dehydration. We found that the delta-cluster radius of 4.0 Å consistently converges barriers with respect to cluster size, yielding complete treatments of confinement in HZSM-5 with clusters containing up to 99 atoms. For comparison, periodic density functional theory (DFT) on HZSM-5 includes 288 atoms, requiring 19 times more CPU time in head-to-head comparisons. Our converged acetone–formaldehyde dehydration barrier agrees quantitatively with a comparable barrier obtained with periodic DFT, showing that cluster calculations can converge properties at a fraction of the cost of periodic DFT. Interestingly, we found that the bulkier, furan-containing aldehydes exhibit faster reactivity because of charge delocalization from aromatic rings, which significantly speeds up aldol dehydration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aaromatic compounds 3adensity functional theory 3aenols 3aformaldehyde 3afurfural 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3atautomerization 3azeolites1 aSun, Qinfang1 aVaitheeswaran, S.1 aSherman, Woody1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9079-13761 aAuerbach, Scott M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8598-30820 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 14, v. 122, no. 40 p.23230-23241dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b086843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245009700172300001400269520146900283592002801752650002701780650001801807650001601825650001401841650002201855650001701877650001701894650001301911650001101924650001901935650003801954650001301992650002502005650001202030650001402042653000602056653000902062653000902071653000802080653000702088653000902095653000602104653000702110653000802117653000902125653000702134653000802141653001202149653000902161653000802170653000702178653000802185653000802193653000902201653001002210653001102220653001902231653001402250653001602264653001402280653001202294700002402306700003102330700002302361700002402384700002702408700001602435700005902451773011002510856008402620852000902704655001202713IND60561117620221120193100.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056111762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2016.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Rafael V.10aIncreased sink strength offsets the inhibitory effect of sucrose on sugarcane photosynthesis  ap. 61-69.  aSpraying sucrose inhibits photosynthesis by impairing Rubisco activity and stomatal conductance (gs), whereas increasing sink demand by partially darkening the plant stimulates sugarcane photosynthesis. We hypothesized that the stimulatory effect of darkness can offset the inhibitory effect of exogenous sucrose on photosynthesis. Source-sink relationship was perturbed in two sugarcane cultivars by imposing partial darkness, spraying a sucrose solution (50mM) and their combination. Five days after the onset of the treatments, the maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate (Vcmax) and the initial slope of A-Ci curve (k) were estimated by measuring leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence. Photosynthesis was inhibited by sucrose spraying in both genotypes, through decreases in Vcmax, k, gs and ATP production driven by electron transport (Jatp). Photosynthesis of plants subjected to the combination of partial darkness and sucrose spraying was similar to photosynthesis of reference plants for both genotypes. Significant increases in Vcmax, gs and Jatp and marginal increases in k were noticed when combining partial darkness and sucrose spraying compared with sucrose spraying alone. Our data also revealed that increases in sink strength due to partial darkness offset the inhibition of sugarcane photosynthesis caused by sucrose spraying, enhancing the knowledge on endogenous regulation of sugarcane photosynthesis through the source-sink relationship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acarboxylation 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3agenotype 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aspraying 3astomatal conductance 3asucrose 3asugarcane 0aA 0aA380 0aDark 0aD+S 0ags 0aJatp 0ak 0aNI 0aNSL 0aPEPC 0aRd 0aRef 0aRubisco 0as’ 0aSAI 0aSL 0aSPS 0aSuc 0aSuSy 0aVcmax 0aϕPSII 0aPhotosynthesis 0aSaccharum 0aSource-sink 0aSugarcane 0aSucrose1 aMachado, Eduardo C.1 aMagalhães Filho, José R.1 aLobo, Ana Karla M.1 aMartins, Márcio O.1 aSilveira, Joaquim A.G.1 aYin, Xinyou1 aStruik, Paul C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2196-547X0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2017 Jan., v. 208 p.61-69dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245018500176300001400361520221700375592002802592653000902620653001702629653002102646653001802667653002002685700003302705773010102738856008702839852000902926655001202935IND60594032920221119184502.0180510e20151010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059403292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2015.04.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, Burton H.10aRedox Titrations via Surface Interrogation Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy at an Extended Semiconducting Surface for the Quantification of Photogenerated Adsorbed Intermediates  ap. 74-83.  aWe introduce a methodology based on electrochemical simulations and the identification of the relevant experimental factors that enable the use of micro- and nano- redox titrations via Surface Interrogation Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SI-SECM) on an extended substrate electrode geometry. Specifically, we address the quantification of adsorbed intermediates so that information such as the local surface coverage can be conveniently extracted from SI-SECM transients despite diffusional broadening. Using a time normalization parameter ρ, we studied the time evolution of the SI-SECM signal and its impact on the titrated surface below the SECM tip. We identified the experimental and time conditions on which diffusional broadening dominates the signal. Our simulated results suggest that, while this effect decreases the spatial resolution of the SI-SECM process, it enhances significantly the measured signal. It is also a strong function of the SECM tip size, where quantification enhancements on nano-electrodes may facilitate their practical experimental deployment. A versatile parameter, ρ, not only allowed to understand practical enhancements, but also to guide the fitting of experimental results to theory. SI-SECM was used to quantify photogenerated intermediates of the photoassisted water oxidation reaction on lightly n-doped SrTiO3 using the ferri/ferrocyanide system as redox mediator. Agreement between simulated and experimental transients was excellent, and fitting allowed us to determine the potential-dependent surface coverage of hydroxyl radical intermediate, which ranged from 0.04 to 0.50C/m². The analysis and experimental demonstration introduced here move SI-SECM forward as a quantitative platform to study (photo) electrocatalytic samples without needing to constrain the size of the interrogated electrode. Furthermore, they establish SI-SECM as an analytical tool for mechanism-focused study of adsorbed intermediates and photocatalytic processes that occur on semiconducting and insulating surfaces, where quantification of surface reaction intermediates with view towards the nano-scale remains challenging for other electrochemical and spectroscopic approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSECM 0aintermediate 0asurface coverage 0asemiconductor 0awater splitting1 aRodríguez López, Joaquín,0 tElectrochimica acta.g2015 Oct. 10, v. 179 p.74-83dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2015.04.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007100140245012200211500002000333520156900353592002801922596001201950650002201962650001301984650000901997650001602006650001602022650002402038650001302062650001402075650000902089650001102098650001302109650001102122650001102133651001202144700003002156700002202186773012902208856007502337852000902412655001202421IND60793490220221121233433.0220916s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079349022DNAL7 a10.1002/agg2.202962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazzilli, Sebastián Ramón1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7883-712410aUse of sludge from pulp mills in extensive crops: An assessment at a semi‐commercial scale in central South America  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLand under agriculture has increased during the last 20 yr in the South American Pampas. Agricultural systems use mostly finite imported sources of P, so the use of local recycled P sources is an alternative. In Uruguay, two current events are relevant to this matter: the increase in the crop area of Brassica carinata (biofuels production) and the presence of large pulp mills. The working hypothesis was that pulp mill sludge applied prior to sowing carinata crops will substitute the use of inorganic fertilizers, and that the combination of sludge and inorganic fertilizers will increase grain yield. Two on‐farm experiments were conducted, in which carinata was sown during the 2019 winter season and followed after harvest by soybean sown at one site and maize at another. At each site, six treatment strips (30 m wide × 400 m long) were established in a control‐plot design. The treatments corresponded to two sludge types (biosludge and mixed sludge), combined with a traditional N, P, K, S chemical fertilizer (29 kg P ha–¹), compared with a control treatment (not fertilized). Carinata yields results do not support the proposed hypothesis, because the yields of the sludge treatments were lower than the chemical fertilization treatments. The limiting factor for the crops was associated with N supply, as the nitrogen nutrition index showed low values. Sludge application did not result in changes in summer crop yields and soil chemical properties. Future studies should focus on the sustained use of combined fertilizer sources over time.  aPublisher supplied data  cUPM S.A 3aBrassica carinata 3abiofuels 3acorn 3aenvironment 3agrain yield 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3apulp 3asludge 3asoybeans 3asummer 3awinter 3aUruguay1 aGonzález Barrios, Pablo,1 aErnst, Oswaldo R.0 tAgrosystems, geosciences & environment.g2022, v. 5, no. 3 p.e20296-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27124x2639-66967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agg2.202963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245012200166300001800288500001500306520103400321592002801355650001801383650001101401650002701412650001301439650001701452650001401469650001901483650000901502650001601511653001901527653001501546700002001561700001501581700001601596700002301612700001901635773009701654856008601751852000901837655001201846IND4447395820221122233919.0141110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444739582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.10.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Manhoe10aPerformance of heterogeneous ZrO₂ supported metaloxide catalysts for brown grease esterification and sulfur removal  ap. 2380-2386.  a2019-12-06  aIn order to achieve a viable biodiesel industry, new catalyst technology is needed which can process a variety of less expensive waste oils, such as yellow grease and brown grease. However, for these catalysts to be effective for biodiesel production using these feedstocks, they must be able to tolerate higher concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA), water, and sulfur. We have developed a class of zirconia supported metaloxide catalysts that achieve high FAME yields through esterification of FFAs while simultaneously performing desulfurization and de-metallization functions. In fact, methanolysis, with the zirconia supported catalysts, was more effective for desulfurization than an acid washing process. In addition, using zirconia supported catalysts to convert waste grease, high in sulfur content, resulted in a FAME product that could meet the in-use ASTM diesel fuel sulfur specification (<500ppm). Possible mechanisms of desulfurization and de-metallization by methanolysis were proposed to explain this activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ayellow grease 3asulfur 3afatty acid composition 3aindustry 3amethanolysis 3acatalysts 3aesterification 3aoils 3adiesel fuel 0anew technology 0atechnology1 aDiMaggio, Craig1 aYan, Shuli1 aWang, Huali1 aSalley, Steven.

Zolpidem was used as internal standard. For plasma samples, solid-phase extraction was used and the brain dialysates were collected from freely moving rats using brain microdialysis. Both were followed by HPLC separation and positive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection (ESI–MS–MS). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Symmetry RP-18 column using gradient elution with methanol and water containing 0.5% formic acid and 2 mM ammonium formate. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was used for quantitation. Good linearities were obtained in the range of 0.05–100 and 0.01–50 μg mL⁻¹ for gastrodin and ligustrazine hydrochloride in rat plasma, and 0.05–1,000 ng mL⁻¹ for both in dialysate. The lower limit of quantitation was 0.01 ng mL⁻¹ for gastrodin and 0.05 ng mL⁻¹ for ligustrazine. The method is precise and reliable and can be applied to pharmacokinetic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aformic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3amicrodialysis 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aHu, Xin1 aZheng, Weiming,1 aNie, Ying-Lan1 aBi, Kai-Shun0 tChromatographia.g2008 July, v. 68, no. 1-2 p.105-110dVieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-008-0647-x3Available from publisher's site  a20080704b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03036naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245018500180300001400365520138800379592002801767650002501795650001501820650001001835650001801845650002201863650002401885650002701909650001101936650002001947650000701967650001901974650001201993650001402005650000902019650002202028650001202050650002202062653001102084653002702095653003702122653000902159653002102168653002802189700002002217700001902237700001802256700001702274773011002291856008402401852000902485655001202494IND60561117820221120192858.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056111782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2016.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Hồng Phương,10aRice pectin methylesterase inhibitor28 (OsPMEI28) encodes a functional PMEI and its overexpression results in a dwarf phenotype through increased pectin methylesterification levels  ap. 17-25.  aPectin methylesterases (PMEs, EC 3.1.1.11) belonging to carbohydrate esterase family 8 cleave the ester bond between a galacturonic acid and an methyl group and the resulting change in methylesterification level plays an important role during the growth and development of plants. Optimal pectin methylesterification status in each cell type is determined by the balance between PME activity and post-translational PME inhibition by PME inhibitors (PMEIs). Rice contains 49 PMEIs and none of them are functionally characterized. Genomic sequence analysis led to the identification of rice PMEI28 (OsPMEI28). Recombinant OsPMEI28 exhibited inhibitory activity against commercial PME protein with the highest activities detected at pH 8.5. Overexpression of OsPMEI28 in rice resulted in an increased level of cell wall bound methylester groups and differential changes in the composition of cell wall neutral monosaccharides and lignin content in culm tissues. Consequently, transgenic plants overexpressing OsPMEI28 exhibited dwarf phenotypes and reduced culm diameter. Our data indicate that OsPMEI28 functions as a critical structural modulator by regulating the degree of pectin methylesterification and that an impaired status of pectin methylesterification affects physiochemical properties of the cell wall components and causes abnormal cell extensibility in rice culm tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aculms 3aextensibility 3agalacturonic acid 3agene overexpression 3agrowth and development 3alignin 3amonosaccharides 3apH 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3aphenotype 3arice 3asequence analysis 3atissues 3atransgenic plants 0aPectin 0aPectin methylesterases 0aPectin methylesterase inhibitors 0aRice 0aPlant cell walls 0aCell wall modifications1 aJeong, Ho Young1 aJeon, Seung Ho1 aKim, Donghyuk1 aLee, Chanhui0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2017 Jan., v. 208 p.17-25dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245010400163520142900267592002801696650002301724650001801747650001601765650001101781650002501792650001501817650000901832650001601841650001001857651001101867651001501878700003001893700002101923710005001944773010001994856007902094852000902173655001202182IND60536753920221119015552.0160806s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053675392DNAL7 a10.1155/2015/7354182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMkwezalamba, Idah10aPhenotypic Variation in Fruit Morphology among Provenances of Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst.  aSclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst. is a multipurpose fruit tree which is very useful in providing food security and meeting nutritional and economic needs. This study was conducted to assess eighteen provenances of Sclerocarya birrea planted in Mangochi, Malawi. The trial was assessed for fruit traits at fifteen years of age. There were significant (P < 0.001) variations among the provenances in number of fruits, fruit weight, pulp weight, seed weight, fruit length, and diameter. Magunde provenance from Mozambique had the highest mean number of fruits, 2196 ± 200. Mangochi and Moamba provenances from Malawi and Mozambique were the most outstanding in the other parameters measured attaining the mean fruit weight of 20.89 ± 0.25 g and 25.67 ± 0.67 g, pulp weight of 25.70 ± 0.08 g and 21.55 ± 0.83 g, seed weight of 4.81 ± 0.35 g and 4.12 ± 0.18 g, fruit length of 2.61 ± 0.14 cm and 2.33 ± 0.07 cm, and fruit diameter of 2.33 ± 0.15 cm and 1.97 ± 0.08 cm, respectively. There was no significant (P > 0.05) correlation between number of fruits and the other fruit traits. However, there were significant (P < 0.05) and strong positive relationships between fruit weight and pulp weight (r = 0.987) and fruit length and diameter (r = 0.775). This suggests that fruit weight can be used indirectly for selection of pulp. Further studies should investigate fruit taste quality of products from the fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSclerocarya birrea 3afood security 3afruit trees 3afruits 3aphenotypic variation 3aprovenance 3apulp 3aseed weight 3ataste 3aMalawi 3aMozambique1 aMunthali, Chimuleke R.

The PL (4000 TU g⁻¹) was supplemented to maize-soybean meal based control diet (CD) to provide four concentrations of papain (0, 600, 800 and 1000 TU kg⁻¹ diet) in experiment 1. In experiment 2, the CD (100% protein) and a low-protein basal diet (95% less protein i.e. about 1% of diet and proportionate limiting amino acids concentration) were fed with and without PL (0 and 1000 tyrosine units - TU kg⁻¹ diet) in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Three graded levels of dietary protein (88%, 94% and 100% of the recommended level) with three concentrations of PL (0, 1000 and 2000 TU kg⁻¹) were fed in experiment 3 to find the possibility of reducing dietary protein with higher concentrations of papain in the diet. Each diet was fed ad libitum to 10 replicates of 25 broiler chicks in each replicate (6.5 ×4 feet floor pen) from d 1–35. In experiment 1, supplementation of papain at 1000 TU kg⁻¹ to the CD significantly improved the feed efficiency (FE) compared to the control group (1–35d). In experiment 2, by reducing the dietary protein by 1%, the body weight gain (BWG) and FE reduced (1–35 d). However, supplementation of 1000 TU papain significantly improved the BWG and FE, which were similar to the control. The interaction between dietary protein and PL did not influence the performance variables in experiment 3, except the FE during 1–21 d. At 88% protein, PL supplementation significantly improved the FE and such improvement was not observed at 94% and 100% protein during d 1–21. Supplementation of 2000 TU papain / kg improved FE similar to those fed the CD, which implies the possibility of reducing the dietary protein with papain supplementation. BWG and FE improved significantly with papain at 2000 TU kg⁻¹ diet compared to the CD. An increase in dietary protein progressively reduced the relative weights of abdominal fat and liver. Papain supplementation reduced the ready to cook yield and breast weight. Papain supplementation significantly increased the digestibility of energy and nitrogen compared to the control group. Based on the results, it is concluded that papain supplementation (1000–2000 TU kg⁻¹) in the form of papaya latex could able to reduce the requirement of protein (about 95% of the recommendation) in corn soybean meal based diets without affecting the performance. Increased digestibility of energy and protein with papain might be responsible for the reduced requirement of protein as observed in the current study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3aabdominal fat 3abody weight changes 3abreasts 3abroiler chickens 3acorn 3adietary protein 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3afeeds 3aileum 3alatex 3aliver 3amales 3anitrogen 3apapain 3aready-to-cook foods 3asoybean meal 3atechnology 3atyrosine 0aCD 0aBWG 0aFE 0aCP 0aPL 0aFI 0aTU 0aRTC 0aPapain 0aBroilers 0aWeight gain 0aFeed efficiency 0aDigestibility 0aCarcass variables1 aRaju, J.1 aSrilatha, T.1 aNagalakshmi, D.1 aRaju, M.V.L.N.1 aPaul, S.S.1 aPrakash, B.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2022 Mar., v. 285 p.115226-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.1152263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245007400207300001400281500001900295500001100314520109000325592002801415596002801443596008901471650001801560650001201578650001101590650001801601650001201619650002001631650001001651650001701661650000901678700005601687700006101743700006101804773012601865856007301991852000902064655001202073IND60721996620221121034909.0201229e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072199662DNAL7 a10.1111/aab.126252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorera‐Margarit, Pilar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4316-384910aCould bacterial associations determine the success of weevil species?  ap. 51-61.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aThe weevil superfamily Curculionoidea is the largest insect group and so the largest animal group on earth. This taxon includes species which represent an important threat to many economically important crops and, therefore, pose a risk to agriculture and food security. Insect–bacteria associations have been recognised to provide the insect host with many benefits, such as ensuring the acquisition of essential nutrients or protecting the host from natural enemies. The role of bacteria associations within the weevil superfamily remains nonetheless understudied in comparison with other insect taxa. This review draws together existing knowledge on the influence of bacteria associated with weevils known to be agricultural pest species. The implications of these weevil–bacterial associations in determining pest status and their relevance to targeted pest management interventions are discussed. Specific consideration is given to the role of bacteria in cuticle formation, flight activity, reproduction manipulation and adaptation to different environments and food sources.  aPublisher supplied data  cHarper Adams University  cScottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division 3aCurculionidae 3aanimals 3aflight 3afood security 3ainsects 3apest management 3apests 3areproduction 3arisk1 aPope, Tom W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3678-29431 aMitchell, Carolyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0895-25701 aKarley, Alison J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0252-20860 tAnnals of applied biology.g2021 Jan., v. 178, no. 1 p.51-61dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46323x0003-47467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aab.126253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245006800179300001600247500000900263520071700272592002800989650001801017650001401035650001801049650002201067650001001089650000901099650001201108650001501120700002001135773014801155856009601303852000901399655001201408IND60668701920221117214705.0191125e195701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066870192DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1957.03615995002100010026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, J.

Vegetation data guide the engineer in routing his road to mature timber stands. They show him what problems will be involved in clearing rights-of-way. Much more work must be done in testing laboratories to determine bearing ratios, optimum moisture percentages, swell percentages, and other characteristics for soil series.

R.10aSex Ratio Distorter Reduces Sperm Competitive Ability in an Insect  ap. 1644-1652.  aSelfish genetic elements (SGEs) are ubiquitous in animals and often associated with low male fertility due to reduced sperm number in male carriers. In the fruit fly Drosophila pseudoobscura, the meiotic driving X chromosome ““sex ratio”” kills Y-bearing sperm in carrier males (SR males), resulting in female only broods. We competed SR males against the ejaculates of noncarrying standard males (ST males), and quantified the number of sperm transferred by SR and ST males to females. We show that SR males are very poor sperm competitors, which is partly related to transfer of fewer sperm during mating. However, sperm numbers alone cannot explain the observed paternity reduction, indicating SR males’’ sperm may be of reduced quality, possibly due to damage during the killing of the noncarrying Y-sperm. The reduction in sperm competitive ability due to SR is large enough to potentially stabilize the spread of sex ratio drive through populations. The poor sperm competitive ability of SR males coupled with their low fitness as mates could favor increased remating by females to reduce paternity by SR males. Given the generally poor performance of SGE-carrying males in sperm competition, this may generate strong selective pressure favoring polyandry in many species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDrosophila pseudoobscura 0ameiotic drive 0apolyandry 0aselfish genetic elements 0asperm competition 0asperm number1 aBretman, Amanda J.1 aAvent, Tomos D.1 aSnook, Rhonda R.1 aHurst, Gregory D.

Yields of corn (Zea mays L.) at Logan, Utah in 1975 were decreased by salinity or water stress (caused by low irrigation levels) in direct relation to the decrease in evapotranspiration. The decrease in evapotranspiration was caused by a decrease in soil water depletion, indicating that salinity influenced soil water availability. Corn yields at Vernal, Utah in 1974 were decreased by salinity, but to a considerably lesser extent by low irrigation, probably because of water flow upward into the root zone from a water table. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) yields at Vernal in 1974 were not decreased by salinity or by low irrigation rates, because of water supplied by a water table and used by roots below the zone of salinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aZea mays 3aalfalfa 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation rates 3aplant available water 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asalinity 3awater flow 3awater stress 3awater table 3aUtah1 aSullivan, T.

Beyond AIDS, which represents the most common predisposing condition, several biological drugs have been associated to the development of PML, such as natalizumab, fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate, which have been showed to increase the risk of PML in the multiple sclerosis (MS) population. JCPyV non-coding control region (NCCR) can be found in two different forms: a virulent neurotropic pathogenic form and a latent non-pathogenic form. The neurotropic forms contain a rearranged NCCR and are typically found in the cerebrospinal fluid, brain or blood of PML patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We sequenced and critically examined JCPyV NCCR from isolates detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of four newly diagnosed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy patients: two HIV-positive and two HIV-negative multiple sclerosis patients. More complex NCCR rearrangements were observed in the two HIV-positive patients compared to the HIV-negative multiple sclerosis patients with PML. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of HIV-positive and HIV-negative MS patients with PML, allowed us to evidence the presence of a common pattern of JCPyV NCCR rearrangement, characterized by the deletion of the D-block, which could be one of the initial rearrangements of JCPyV NCCR needed for the development of PML.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman polyomavirus 2 3aanimal viruses 3ablood 3abrain 3acerebrospinal fluid 3adimethyl fumarate 3adrugs 3aimmunosuppression 3aoligodendroglia 3apatients 3arisk factors 3asclerosis 3avirulence1 aZingaropoli, Maria Antonella1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9479-85591 aIannetta, Marco1 aPrezioso, Carla1 aPerri, Valentina1 aPasculli, Patrizia1 aLichtner, Miriam1 ad’Ettorre, Gabriella1 aAltieri, Marta1 aConte, Antonella1 aPietropaolo, Valeria1 aMastroianni, Claudio Maria1 aVullo, Vincenzo0 tVirology journal.g2020 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.23-23dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-1295-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245006800169300002000237520107600257592002801333650001301361650001801374650001201392650001101404650002301415650001501438650001401453650001901467700001801486700001401504700005601518773013801574856008001712852000901792655001201801IND60651559920221120035455.0190711e20190618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065155992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b036972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatashinski, A.

Currently, the local order is unambiguously confirmed and visualized only in two-dimensional (2D) liquids. A 2D liquid may play the role of a toy model for more complex liquids. We use molecular dynamic simulations to study instantaneous and time-averaged particle positions and velocities, quantitative characteristics of the local order, and drag forces in a 2D Lennard-Jones liquid occupying a narrow channel with moving walls. In layers of the liquid adjacent to the walls, long-time-averaged velocity significantly deviates from the predictions of conventional hydrodynamics. In the same layers, the time-averaged local order characteristics and the particle density show significant changes, with the amplitudes of these changes depending on the thermodynamic state of the liquid, the wall roughness, and commensurability with the wall.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ahydrodynamics 3aliquids 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction 3aroughness 3athermodynamics1 aRatner, M.

In this study, to reduce the recombination rate of photoexcited electrons and holes and increase the reaction activity site, BiVO₄–Bi₂O₃ heterostructural flowers were fabricated by one-pot hydrothermal method by adjusting the concentration of hydrogen ions. Moreover, we used sucrose to control the morphology structure of BiVO₄ and form the BiVO₄–Bi₂O₃ heterostructural flowers. The BiVO₄–Bi₂O₃ heterostructural flowers exhibited a higher photodegradation rate of organic pollutant than product synthesized without sucrose, BiVO₄, and Bi₂O₃. The synergistic effect between BiVO₄ and Bi₂O₃ and the recombination frequency of photoexcited electrons and holes as influence factors of improving the photooxidative capability were widely explored. The flower-like morphology provided active sites, and the nanosheets of the flowers decreased the transport distance of the photoexcited carriers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aelectrons 3aflowers 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen ions 3airradiation 3ananosheets 3aoxygen production 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3aphotooxidation 3apollutants 3asucrose 3asynergism1 aWang, Xuewen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6269-80861 aCao, Zuqiang1 aLi, Qiuchan1 aFeng, Gang1 aZhang, Rongbin0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 28, v. 122, no. 41 p.23582-23590dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b074443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006200188245007600250300001100326506007600337520117000413592002801583596011501611596009301726596004301819506003701862650000801899650001901907650001601926650001801942650001001960650001301970650000901983650001401992650001102006650001102017650002102028650001502049650001902064650001302083650002802096700002302124700002002147700002202167700001702189773010102206856008202307852000902389655001202398IND60683870120221207105814.0220805e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068387012DNAL7 a320510162pmid7 aPMC70147842pmcid7 a10.1186/s13059-020-1947-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlendinning, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4789-664410aAssembly of hundreds of novel bacterial genomes from the chicken caecum  ap. 34.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Chickens are a highly important source of protein for a large proportion of the human population. The caecal microbiota plays a crucial role in chicken nutrition through the production of short-chain fatty acids, nitrogen recycling, and amino acid production. In this study, we sequence DNA from caecal content samples taken from 24 chickens belonging to either a fast or a slower growing breed consuming either a vegetable-only diet or a diet containing fish meal. RESULTS: We utilise 1.6 T of Illumina data to construct 469 draft metagenome-assembled bacterial genomes, including 460 novel strains, 283 novel species, and 42 novel genera. We compare our genomes to data from 9 European Union countries and show that these genomes are abundant within European chicken flocks. We also compare the abundance of our genomes, and the carbohydrate active enzymes they produce, between our chicken groups and demonstrate that there are both breed- and diet-specific microbiomes, as well as an overlapping core microbiome. CONCLUSIONS: This data will form the basis for future studies examining the composition and function of the chicken caecal microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/P013759/1, BB/P013732/1, BB/J004235/1, BB/J004243/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/R012504/1, BBS/E/F/000PR10351cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aMR/L015080/1cMedical Research Council0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEuropean Union 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrates 3acecum 3achickens 3adiet 3afish meal 3aflocks 3agenome 3ahuman population 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3ashort chain fatty acids1 aStewart, Robert D.1 aPallen, Mark J.1 aWatson, Kellie A.1 aWatson, Mick0 tGenome biology.g2020 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.34-34dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-1947-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011500170300001600285520155400301592002801855650001901883650003301902650001401935650002301949650002301972650002201995650001602017650002002033650001502053651001002068653003302078653001502111653001802126700001702144700001702161773010402178856008602282852000902368655001202377IND60539777220221120050634.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053977722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.03.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weiguang10aHow large are uncertainties in future projection of reference evapotranspiration through different approaches?  ap. 696-700.  aAs the indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand over a hypothetical reference surface, reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is an important input to hydrological models. Future projections of ET0 are of great importance in assessing the potential impacts of climate change on the hydrologic regime as well as water resources systems. Different estimating formulations and different input data reliabilities existing in practice determine there may be potential uncertainty in projection of future ET0 change. Here we investigated the difference of future ET0 response to climate change based on three approaches, i.e., more physically based Penman–Montieth equation with relatively uncertain downscaled data quality, more empirical temperature-based Hargreaves equation with more reliable downscaled input data, and statistical downscaling method with directly selecting ET0 as predictands. The Hanjiang River Basin, a headwater source of famous South to North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) in China was chosen as example to illustrate this issue. Although similar increase processes of ET0 in the Hanjiang River Basin were suggested by three methods, the magnitude of ET0 increase differs substantially, indicating that uncertainty still exist despite of approximate performance of these methods in simulating general trends. Whilst increasing aridity index and decreasing water surplus over the period of 2011–2099 would inevitably cause negative impacts on the implementation of the SNWDP and effective adapting measures are thus expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aequations 3aevaporative demand 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3auncertainty 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aReference evapotranspiration 0aProjection 0aUncertainties1 aXing, Wanqiu1 aShao, Quanxi0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 May, v. 524 p.696-700dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245012200176300001800298520147800316592002801794653000901822653002601831653002001857653002201877653002301899653002301922700002101945700003301966700004101999700002102040773009202061856009002153852000902243655001202252IND60127239720221119154021.0151110e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012723972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00394.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGleiser, Gabriela10aDisassortative Mating, Sexual Specialization, and the Evolution of Gender Dimorphism in Heterodichogamous Acer Opalus  ap. 1676-1688.  aIn sexually polymorphic species, the morphs are maintained by frequency-dependent selection through disassortative mating. In heterodichogamous populations in which disassortative mating occurs between the protandrous and protogynous morphs, a decrease in female fitness in one morph is hypothesized to drive sexual specialization in the other morph, resulting in dimorphic populations. We test these ideas in a population of the heterodichogamous species, Acer opalus. We assessed both prospective gender of individuals in terms of their allocations and actual parentage using microsatellites; we found that most matings in A. opalus occur disassortatively. We demonstrate that the protogynous morph is maintained by frequency-dependent selection, but that maintenance of males versus protandrous individuals depends on their relative siring success, which changes yearly. Seeds produced later in the reproductive season were smaller than those produced earlier; this should compromise reproduction through ovules in protandrous individuals, rendering them male biased in gender. Time-dependent gender and paternity analyses indicate that the sexual morphs are specialized in their earlier sexual functions, mediated by the seasonal decrease in seed size. Our results confirm that mating patterns are context-dependent and change seasonally, suggesting that sexual specialization can be driven by seasonal effects on fitness gained through one of the two sexual functions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAcer 0agender specialization 0aheterodichogamy 0aintermorph mating 0apaternity analysis 0asexual inconstancy1 aVerdúú, Miguel1 aSegarra-Moragues, Joséé G.1 aGonzáález-Martíínez, Santiago C.1 aPannell, John R.0 tEvolution.g2008 July, v. 62, no. 7 p.1676-1688dBlackwell Science Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2008.00394.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245010900163300001800272500002000290520060800310592002800918596003600946650000900982650001900991650001201010650001001022650001101032650000901043650001301052650002501065650001301090650001001103773014501113856007501258852000901333655001201342IND60680560620221117223556.0200107e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068056062DNAL7 a10.1093/ajae/aaq0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, Joseph C.10aAverage Crop Revenue Election: A Revenue‐Based Alternative to Price‐Based Commodity Payment Programs  ap. 1214-1228.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article develops a stochastic model of the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program, which offers revenue‐based commodity payments under the 2008 Farm Act. Our analysis shows that adding ACRE revenue payments to gross revenue reduces downside revenue risk for corn, wheat, and soybean farmers in 2009 on average by 16%, 21%, and 23%, respectively. Results indicate that farms with higher expected yields and lower variance of yields tend to benefit the most from ACRE. Integrating federal crop insurance with ACRE lowers insurance premiums from 10% to 40%, depending on the crop and location.  aPublisher supplied data  cEconomic Research Service (ERS) 3acorn 3acrop insurance 3afarmers 3afarms 3aincome 3arisk 3asoybeans 3astochastic processes 3avariance 3awheat0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2010 July, v. 92, no. 4 p.1214-1228dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aaq0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01427naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245010600181300001600287500000900303520041300312592002800725650001700753650001200770650001500782650001200797650001800809650001300827650001900840773014900859856009601008852000901104655001201113IND60668702320221117214647.0191125e196909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066870232DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1969.03615995003300050016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakayama, F.

We demonstrate by surface-enhanced Raman scattering measurements that CTAB, which is used as a shape-directing agent in the particle synthesis, is completely removed from solution and particle surface. Thus, the protein-coated nanorods are suitable for bioapplications, where cationic surfactants must be avoided. At the same time, the colloidal stability of the system is significantly increased, as evidenced by spectroscopic investigation of the particle longitudinal surface plasmon resonance, which is sensitive to aggregation. Particles are stable at very high concentrations (cAᵤ 20 mg/mL) in biological media such as phosphate buffer saline or Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium and over a large pH range (2–12). Particles can even be freeze-dried (lyophilized) and redispersed. The protocol was applied to gold nanoparticles with a large range of aspect ratios and sizes with main absorption frequencies covering the visible and the near-IR spectral range from 600 to 1100 nm. Thus, these colloidally stable and surfactant-free protein-coated nanoparticles are of great interest for various plasmonic and biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3abovine serum albumin 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3afreeze drying 3agold 3aligands 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3apH 3aphosphates 3aspectral analysis 3astandard operating procedures 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aligand exchange 0aprotein coating 0acolloidal stability 0aCTAB replacement 0abiocompatible 0alyophilized1 aKuttner, Christian1 aMännel, Max1 aFery, Andreas1 aChanana, Munish0 tACS applied materials .g2015 Mar. 18, v. 7, no. 10 p.5984-5991dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b003353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245008900161300001800250500002000268520066700288592002800955596003900983650002701022650003001049650001901079650002401098650001201122650001901134650001101153650002401164650001801188650001501206650001801221650001601239700002501255700002801280700002101308773014501329856007501474852000901549655001201558IND60680560720221117223741.0200107e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068056072DNAL7 a10.1093/ajae/aaq0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRitten, John P.10aOptimal Rangeland Stocking Decisions Under Stochastic and Climate‐Impacted Weather  ap. 1242-1255.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) model is developed to analyze optimal stocking rates in the face of weather uncertainty and potential climate change projections. The model extends previous work modeling grazing as a predator‐prey relationship. Attention is given to profit maximizing decisions when growing season precipitation is unknown. Comparisons are made across results from a model that utilizes constant growing season precipitation in all years.

The investigation of virulence determinants of EV71 is rudimentary. Therefore, it is important to understand the relationship between EV71 virulence and genomic information. In this study, a series of analyses about full-length genomic sequence were performed on six EV71 strains isolated from HFMD patients with either severe or mild clinical symptoms. A one-day-old BALB/c mouse model was used to study the infection characteristics. Results showed all six strains were of the subgenogroup C4a. Viral full-length genomic sequence analysis showed that a total of 40 nucleotide differences between strains of highly and low virulence were revealed. Among all mutations, three nucleotide mutations were found in the untranslated region. A mutation, nt115, at internal ribozyme entry site (IRES) caused RNA secondary structural change. The other 37 mutations were all located in the open reading frame resulting in 8 amino acid mutations. Importantly, we discovered that a mutation of amino acid (Asn1617 → Asp1617) in the 3C proteinase (3Cᵖʳᵒ) of highly and low pathogenic strains could lead to conformational change at the active center, suggesting that this site may be a virulence determinant of EV71.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus A 3aRNA 3aamino acids 3aanimal models 3agenomics 3ahand, foot and mouth disease 3amice 3amutation 3anervous system diseases 3aopen reading frames 3apatients 3aproteinases 3asequence analysis 3avirulence 3avirulent strains1 aYue, Yingying1 aSong, Nannan1 aLi, Bingqing1 aMeng, Hong1 aYang, Guiwen1 aLi, Zhihui1 aAn, Liguo1 aQin, Lizeng0 tVirus genes.g2016 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.161-171dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-015-1271-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001800188245007600206300001100282506007600293520066600369592002801035596005801063596005801121596005901179596003801238596003701276506003701313650001501350650001101365650001901376650001101395700001801406700001801424700002301442700001801465700002001483700002001503700001901523700001901542700002001561773010101581856008201682852000901764655001201773IND60683870320221207083528.0220805e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068387032DNAL7 a320510002pmid7 aPMC70174862pmcid7 a10.1186/s13059-020-1941-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHickey, Glenn10aGenotyping structural variants in pangenome graphs using the vg toolkit  ap. 35.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStructural variants (SVs) remain challenging to represent and study relative to point mutations despite their demonstrated importance.

We benchmark vg against state-of-the-art SV genotypers using three sequence-resolved SV catalogs generated by recent long-read sequencing studies.

The concept of bias error is developed and the effect of various factors on magnitude of the bias error studied. The factors included in an empirical study are spacing and number of fertilizer levels and selection of the postulated model. The choice of a postulated model, a factor not under the control of the experimenter during the planning stages of an experiment, shows the largest influence on bias error. The selection of the postulated model is discussed and suggestions for the control of bias and variance error in response surface experimentation are given.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3afertilizer rates 3aplanning 3asoil analysis 3avariance1 aLaird, R.

This analysis may also help to understand natural changes in species distribution and/or abundance, and differences in species ability to colonize contrasting light environments or respond to environmental changes. Unfortunately, the challenge that optical determinations on highly dispersive samples represent has strongly limited the progression of this analysis on multicellular tissues, limiting our knowledge of the role that optical properties of photosynthetic tissues may play in the optimization of photosynthesis and growth of benthonic primary producers. The aim of this study is to stimulate the use of optical tools in marine eco-physiology, offering a succinct description of the more convenient tools and also solutions to resolve the more common technical difficulties that arise while performing optical determinations on highly dispersive samples. Our study focuses on two-dimensional (2D-) parameters: absorptance, transmittance, and reflectance, and illustrates with correct and incorrect examples, specific problems and their respective solutions. We also offer a general view of the broad variation in light absorption shown by photosynthetic structures of marine primary producers, and its low association with pigment content. The ecological and evolutionary functional implications of this variability deserve to be investigated across different taxa, populations, and marine environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiogeography 3aecophysiology 3aenergy 3aphotosynthesis 3areflectance 3asolar energy 3atissues 3atransmittance 3atrophic relationships1 aLegaria-Moreno, Lyz1 aPérez-Castro, Miguel Ángel1 aKrämer, Wiebke E.1 aScheufen, Tim1 aIglesias-Prieto, Roberto1 aEnriquez, Susana,0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2017 June, v. 132, no. 3 p.311-324dSpringer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-017-0395-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245012500170300001800295520123700313592002801550650002901578650001301607650001201620650001301632650001801645650001601663650001501679650002601694650001101720650001801731650001301749650001401762653001901776653002501795653002701820653001301847653002701860653002901887653002401916700001701940700001301957700002101970700002201991700002402013700002902037773012702066856007802193852000902271655001202280IND60528236320170818000000.0160716e20150318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052823632DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b004022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodoy-Gallardo, Maria10aAntibacterial Coatings on Titanium Surfaces: A Comparison Study Between in Vitro Single-Species and Multispecies Biofilm  ap. 5992-6001.  aDental plaque is a biofilm that causes dental caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Most of the studies in antibacterial coatings have been conducted by in vitro single-species biofilm formation, but oral biofilm involves more than 700 different bacterial species that are able to interact. Therefore, new studies are focused on in vitro multispecies biofilm models that mimic in vivo biofilms. The aim of the present work was to study different antibacterial coatings onto titanium surfaces and evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial properties of the surfaces on two different bacterial species and an oral biofilm. The lactate dehydrogenase assay determined that treated samples did not affect fibroblast viability. In addition, the viability of microorganisms on modified samples was evaluated by a LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit. Although a decrease in viable bacteria onto treated samples was obtained, the results showed differences in effectiveness when single-biofilm and oral plaque were tested. It confirms, as we expected, the distinct sensitivities that bacterial strains have. Thus, this multispecies biofilms model holds a great potential to assess antibacterial properties onto samples for dental purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acoatings 3adental caries 3afibroblasts 3agingivitis 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amodels 3aperiodontitis 3atitanium 3aviability 0asingle biofilm 0amultispecies biofilm 0aantibacterial coatings 0atitanium 0ahLf1-11 immobilization 0asilver electrodeposition 0aTESPSA silanization1 aWang, Zhejun1 aShen, Ya1 aManero, José M.1 aGil, Francisco J.1 aRodríguez, Daniel,1 aHaapasalo, M.q(Markus),0 tACS applied materials .g2015 Mar. 18, v. 7, no. 10 p.5992-6001dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b004023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245010400208300001100312506007600323520191400399592002802313596004702341506003702388650002802425650002402453650002002477650001202497650001402509650001502523650002002538650002202558650002802580650001302608650004302621650001802664650000902682650002002691650001402711650001102725650001802736650002202754650001902776700002302795700002302818700002602841700002002867700002202887773011102909856008203020852000903102655001203111IND60683870720221207105825.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068387072DNAL7 a320510042pmid7 aPMC70175222pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-020-3941-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlzaylaee, Hind10aEnvironmental DNA-based xenomonitoring for determining Schistosoma presence in tropical freshwaters  ap. 63.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that infects over 200 million people worldwide. Control measures can benefit from improved surveillance methods in freshwaters, with environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys having the potential to offer effective and rapid detection of schistosomes. However, sampling eDNA directly from natural water bodies can lead to inaccurate estimation of infection risk if schistosome eDNA is rare in the environment. Here we report a xenomonitoring method that allows schistosome infections of host snail species to be determined from eDNA in water used to house those snails. METHODS: Host snail species were collected and placed in containers of water and allowed to shed cercariae, and then water samples were filtered and tested using qPCR assays specific to the African species Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium. We evaluated this “eDNA-based xenomonitoring” approach by experimentally comparing the results to those obtained from direct qPCR screening of tissue sourced from the snails in the experiment. RESULTS: We found that our method accurately diagnosed the presence of S. mansoni-infected snails in all tests, and S. haematobium-infected snails in 92% of tests. Moreover, we found that the abundance of Schistosoma eDNA in experiments was directly dependent on the number and biomass of infected snails. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a strong indication that this surveillance method combining the utility of eDNA-based monitoring with the reliability of traditional xenomonitoring approaches could be used to accurately assay the presence of Schistosoma species in natural habitats. This approach may be well-suited for epidemiological studies and monitoring in endemic areas, where it can assist schistosomiasis control by indicating infection risk from freshwaters and guiding necessary interventions to eliminate the disease.  aPublisher supplied data  aAA130107cRoyal Society - Leverhulme Trust0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSchistosoma haematobium 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aanimal diseases 3abiomass 3acercariae 3acontainers 3acontrol methods 3aenvironmental DNA 3aepidemiological studies 3ahabitats 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3arisk 3aschistosomiasis 3ascreening 3asnails 3asurface water 3atropical diseases 3axenomonitoring1 aCollins, Rupert A.1 aShechonge, Asilatu1 aNgatunga, Benjamin P.1 aMorgan, Eric R.1 aGenner, Martin J.0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.63-63dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-3941-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001500161245008500176300001600261500000900277520120300286592002801489650001501517650001201532650002001544650001201564650001401576650000901590650001901599650001101618650002001629650001501649650001101664700001201675700001401687773014701701856009601848852000901944655001201953IND60668289620221119181258.0191125e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066828962DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300030012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirsch, D.10aPrediction of Cadmium Complexation in Solution and Adsorption to Montmorillonite  ap. 716-721.  aepub  aEffects of inorganic complexation in solution, ionic strength, and clay concentration on Cd adsorption to montmorillonite were investigated. Increased ionic strength decreases Cd adsorption. The presence of a complexing anion such as Cl⁻ inhibits Cd adsorption. When the complexing anion was HCO⁻₃, disappearance of Cd from equilibrium solution was enhanced compared to the case where the anion was ClO⁻₄, which does not form complexes with Cd. The explanation of the latter phenomenon is still incomplete, the two possibilities being either strong binding to the clay of the complex CdHCO⁺₃, or precipitation of otavite (CdCO₃). Raising clay concentration enhances Cd adsorption. A model that predicts cation binding and cation exchange in clay suspensions and calculates the surface potential, the concentrations of the species bound to the clay surface, in the double layer and in the equilibrium solution, was coupled with a subroutine to calculate complexation reactions in solution. Agreement between observed and calculated values of adsorbed Cd was fairly good. The binding coefficients that best fit the data are 1, 10, and 30 for Na⁺, Cd²⁺, and CdCl⁺, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3acation exchange 3acations 3achlorides 3aclay 3aionic strength 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3aprediction 3asodium1 aNir, S.1 aBanin, A.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1989 May, v. 53, no. 3 p.716-721dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300030012x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012600162300001400288520144200302592002801744650002001772650001601792650001401808650001701822650001901839650001401858650001301872650001801885650000901903650002001912650002301932650001401955650001801969650001201987650001301999650001502012650001802027653000802045653000802053653000702061653000902068653000802077653000802085653000902093653000802102653001102110653000902121653000802130653000702138653000802145653000702153653000902160653001002169653001102179653002702190653001402217653001602231653001802247653001502265653002402280700001202304700001302316700001402329700001702343700001802360773009902378856008102477852000902558655001202567IND60554176220221122121351.0161024e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055417622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2015.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Feiyue12aA three-dimensional dynamic coculture system enabling facile cell separation for chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells  ap. 68-76.  aCoculture has emerged as a strategy to improve chondrogenesisof mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cartilage regeneration. In the present study, a new system integrating cell encapsulation, dynamic stimulation and coculture with articular chondrocytes (ACs), termed as three-dimensional (3D) dynamic coculture, was developed for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. In addition, a novel mechanism was exploited to enable facile separation of cocultured cells. Rabbit bone-marrow derived MSCs (rMSCs) and rabbit ACs (rACs) were encapsualted in alginate gel beads, respectively. In rACs-laden beads, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were incorporated. Dynamic coculture was performed in a spinner flask. Fe3O4 nanoparticles had no negative effects on growth of rACs, although a slight inhibition on production of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) by rACs was noticed. An alginate concentration of above 1.8w/v% was favorable for dynamic culture of rMSCs and rACs. Coculturing rMSCs with rACs in chondrogenic medium in this system demonstrated an improved chondrogenesis than monocultured rMSCs according to GAG quantification, histological staining, and gene expression analysis of collagen I, II and X. However, supplementation of 2% FBS did not show posive effects on chondrogenesis of cocultured rMSCs. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that such a separable 3D dynamic coculture system holds great potential in cartilage tissue regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abone marrow 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3achondrogenesis 3acoculture 3acollagen 3aencapsulation 3agels 3agene expression 3aglycosaminoglycans 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3arabbits 3astaining 3astem cells 3atissue repair 0aACs 0aCAM 0a3D 0aDMEM 0aECM 0aFBS 0aFITC 0aGAG 0aα-MEM 0aMSCs 0aMTT 0aOD 0aPBS 0aPI 0arACs 0arMSCs 0aTGF-β 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aCoculture 0aBioreactors 0aMicrocarriers 0aBiomedical 0aTissue cell culture1 aXu, Lei1 aWang, Qi1 aZhou, Yan1 aYe, Zhaoyang1 aTan, Wen-Song0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 103 p.68-76dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2015.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245013600163300002000299520177800319592002802097650001502125650001402140650002302154650003002177650001702207650001102224650001302235650001302248650001802261650001402279650002402293650001902317650001902336700002102355700002102376700005202397700002002449700001302469700005502482773013902537856008102676852000902757655001202766IND60616678220221122225002.0181020e20180914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061667822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b075132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jiajia10aStructure and Activity Transition from Oxidized to Metallic Tungsten for Catalytic Hydrogenation: A Density Functional Theory Study  ap. 23053-23061.  aOxide-based hydrogenation catalysts have attracted intensive interest, but the relationships between their composition, structure, and reaction mechanism are still ambiguous. Here, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculation on ethylene hydrogenation over WO₃, WO₂.₇₂, WO₂, and W catalysts to explore how the structure and catalytic activity change with the composition and explain why neither WO₃ nor metallic W is a good hydrogenation catalyst but WO₃–ₓ is. Calculations on the geometric and electronic structures show a transition from semiconductor to metal-like with more W–W metal bonds appearing from the corresponding oxidized to metallic tungsten. Correspondingly, the H₂ dissociation mechanism changes from heterotypic on the semiconductor WO₃ and WO₂.₇₂ to homotypic on the metal-like WO₂ and metallic W, and the adsorption strength of the dissociation product (2H) enhances from oxidized to metallic W. Calculations on the stepwise hydrogenation indicate that H₂ dissociation is the rate-limiting step (RLS) for WO₃ and WO₂.₇₂, whereas the following hydrogenation step (C₂H₅ + H → C₂H₆) is the RLS for WO₂ and W. By linear fitting the binding energies of H₂, 2H, H + C₂H₅, and C₂H₆ adsorptions, a perfect correlation between (H + C₂H₅) and (2H) adsorptions is observed; thus, the catalytic activity and mechanism can be evaluated using 2H adsorption behavior as the descriptor. On the basis of the calculation results, we predict that the best ethylene hydrogenation activity will show at 2 < x < 2.72 for WOₓ. This work suggests that controlling the composition between the stoichiometric oxide and the metal may be an effective way to develop an active hydrogenation catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3aethane 3aethylene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3aoxidation 3areaction mechanisms 3asemiconductors 3atungsten oxide1 aZhang, Yong-Chao1 aHuang, Zhen-Feng1 aPan, Lun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3083-46931 aZhang, Xiangwen1 aWang, Li1 aZou, Ji-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9126-12510 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 14, v. 122, no. 40 p.23053-23061dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b075133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245009900181500001400280520166600294592002801960650001001988650000801998650001902006650001002025650001602035650001402051650001402065650002302079650001502102650001002117650001102127650001402138650001102152650000902163650001502172650001802187650001402205650001702219650001802236650004302254650001202297650001202309650001702321653006002338653002102398653002402419653003202443653002702475700003502502700003502537700002802572700003002600700002902630700003302659700003102692700002502723700003302748773010702781856008502888852000902973655001202982IND60695505620221120203210.0200719e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069550562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2020.1021342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoura, Micaele Quintana de10aQuantification of Toxocara canis DNA by qPCR in mice inoculated with different infective doses  aNAL-light  aThe nematode Toxocara canis is of public health importance and is the main causative agent of toxocariasis in humans. This disease is difficult to diagnose due to several factors, including the possibility of cross-reactions with other nematodes in the ELISA. To overcome this problem, molecular tests have been recommended as an alternative to identify the parasite. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique was used in this study to identify and quantify the parasite load of T. canis in the mouse brain. To this end, 24 mice were divided into six groups, five of which were challenged with different infective doses of T. canis larvae (L3) (1000, 500, 250, 100 and 50 larvae), while the sixth group, uninfected, acted as negative control. Forty-five days after infection, the animals were euthanized to collect the brain, from which two portions of 20 mg of tissue were taken for DNA extraction, while the rest of the brain tissue was digested to quantify the number of larvae by microscopy. The number of DNA copies was calculated from the standard DNA quantification curve, showing values of E = 93.4%, R2 = 0.9655 and Y = −3.415. A strong positive correlation (R = 0, 81; p < .001) was found between the number of copies and the recovery of larvae from brain. However, the parasite's DNA was also identified even in animals from whose brain no larvae were recovered after tissue digestion. The results of this study therefore confirm that the qPCR technique can be a valuable tool for the detection and quantification of T. canis DNA in murine hosts, even in animals whose with tissues contain very few parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis 3aDNA 3aToxocara canis 3abrain 3acorrelation 3adetection 3adigestion 3aetiological agents 3aextraction 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ainfection 3alarvae 3amice 3amicroscopy 3aparasite load 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apublic health 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atesting 3atissues 3atoxocariasis 0aQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 0aTissue digestion 0aMolecular diagnosis 0aParasite load, toxocariasis 0aVisceral larva migrans1 aTerto, Wesley Douglas da Silva1 aAvila, Luciana Farias da Costa1 aCampos, Vinicius Farias1 aDomingues, William Borges1 aPinheiro, Natália Berne1 aCapella, Gabriela de Almeida1 aStrothmann, Adriane Leites1 aScaini, Carlos James1 aBerne, Maria Elisabeth Aires0 tParasitology international.g2020 Oct., v. 78 p.102134-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2020.1021343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002300161245006400184300001600248500000900264520091300273592002801186650001501214650001301229650001701242650001301259650002101272650000701293650000901300650002401309651001601333651001301349700002601362700002201388773014701410856009601557852000901653655001201662IND60668289720221119181224.0191125e198305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066828972DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1983.03615995004700030022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, Theodore M.10aNitrate Formation in Acid Forest Soils from the Adirondacks  ap. 506-508.  aepub  aNitrate formation in three forest soils from the Adirondacks region of New York was studied in the laboratory. The organic and surface mineral layers of the soils had pH values ranging from 3.6 to 4.1. Nitrate was formed when the soils were treated with artificial rain at pH 3.5, 4.1, or 5.6. Compared to simulated rain at pH 5.6, simulated rain at pH 3.5 enhanced nitrate formation in one soil and inhibited it in two other soils. The rate of nitrate accumulation was about 10 times higher in the organic horizon than in the mineral horizon, and nitrate formation was not enhanced by ammonium additions. Nitrate formation in soil suspensions was dependent on the amount of soil in the suspension, and none was formed if little soil was present. Ammonium did not enhance nitrate production in the suspensions. It is suggested that nitrate formation in these acid soils is not limited by the ammonium supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aammonium 3aforest soils 3anitrates 3aorganic horizons 3apH 3arain 3arainfall simulation 3aAdirondacks 3aNew York1 aKreitinger, Joseph P.1 aAlexander, Martin0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1983 May, v. 47, no. 3 p.506-508dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1983.03615995004700030022x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245004500203300001600248506007600264520105900340592002801399506003701427650001601464650001701480650001701497650002001514650001101534650001701545650003901562650002901601650001901630700002201649700002001671700002101691700001801712700002501730700002601755773010401781856008101885852000901966655001201975IND60575262520221207133447.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057526252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-017-0387-62doi7 aPMC54438822pmcid7 a284250252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanik, Ewa10aLight-induced formation of dimeric LHCII  ap. 265-276.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt emerges from numerous experiments that LHCII, the major photosynthetic antenna complex of plants, can appear not only in the trimeric or monomeric states but also as a dimer. We address the problem whether the dimeric form of the complex is just a simple intermediate element of the trimer–monomer transformation or if it can also be a physiologically relevant molecular organization form? Dimers of LHCII were analyzed with application of native electrophoresis, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The results reveal the appearance of two types of LHCII dimers: one formed by the dissociation of one monomer from the trimeric structure and the other formed by association of monomers into a distinctively different molecular organizational form, characterized by a high rate of chlorophyll excitation quenching. The hypothetical structure of such an energy quencher is proposed. The high light-induced LHCII dimerization is discussed as a potential element of the photoprotective response in plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achlorophyll 3adimerization 3adissociation 3aelectrophoresis 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alight harvesting complex 3aphotosynthesis1 aBednarska, Joanna1 aSowinski, Karol1 aLuchowski, Rafal1 aZubik, Monika1 aGrudzinski, Wojciech1 aGruszecki, Wieslaw I.0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2017 June, v. 132, no. 3 p.265-276dSpringer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-017-0387-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245007800177300001800255520105600273592002801329653001401357653002001371653002101391653001301412653002101425773009201446856009001538852000901628655001201637IND60127240520221119181246.0151110e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012724052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00403.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCothran, Rickey D.10aDirect and Indirect Fitness Consequences of Female Choice in a Crustacean  ap. 1666-1675.  aUnderstanding the evolution and maintenance of female mate choice requires information on both the benefits (the sum of direct and indirect benefits) and costs of selective mating. In this study, I assessed the fitness consequences of female mate choice in a freshwater crustacean. In Hyalella amphipods, males attempt to form precopulatory pairs with females. Large males, bearing large posterior gnathopods, tend to be over-represented in precopulatory pairs. I show that females receive both direct (reduced risk of predation while paired) and indirect (sexy sons) benefits from mating with these males. Furthermore, the behavioral mechanisms used to filter male phenotypes carry no detectable energetic cost for females. Thus, females that choose males with successful phenotypes are expected to have higher Darwinian fitness than females that mate at random. This study shows that direct and indirect selection act together to favor large male size, which explains the sexual size dimorphism and size-based mating biases observed in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAmphipods 0adirect benefits 0agenetic benefits 0aHyalella 0asexual selection0 tEvolution.g2008 July, v. 62, no. 7 p.1666-1675dBlackwell Science Incx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1558-5646.2008.00403.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01525naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245011700201300001800318520031400336592002800650650002300678650001300701650001300714650001700727650001600744650001900760700001700779700001600796700001300812700001800825700001500843700001500858700001200873700001300885700001300898773013300911856007401044852000901118655001201127IND60656258820221118114306.0190812e20190808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065625882DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc03814k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWangThese authors contributed equally to this work., Hui10aIn situ photoacoustic imaging of cysteine to reveal the mechanism of limited GSH synthesis in pulmonary fibrosis  ap. 9685-9688.  aWe developed a photoacoustic and fluorescent dual-mode imaging probe, CCYS, for the detection of cysteine with high selectivity and sensitivity in a living system for the first time.

In this study, dsRNA and virus-like particles (approximately 30 nm in diameter) were discovered in Eimeria tenella sporulated oocysts. The complete genome of this novel dsRNA virus was sequenced using a three-step strategy. The sequencing results showed that the complete genome sequence was 6006 bp containing two open reading frames (ORFs) (2367 bp for ORF1 and 3216 bp for ORF2) with a five-nucleotide overlap (UGA/UG). The predicted ORF1 and ORF2 encoded a putative capsid protein of 788 amino acids (84.922 kDa) and a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein of 1071 amino acids (118.190 kDa). BLASTp analysis showed that the amino acid sequences for the E. tenella virus shared similarity with the E. brunetti RNA virus, with 29% homology in capsid proteins and 36% in RDRP proteins. The two untranslated regions were 349 bp (5′ UTR) and 78 bp (3′ UTR). The complete genome sequence of the E. tenella virus resembled characteristics of the Totiviridae family, indicating that this virus was a novel member of Totiviridae. Surprisingly, phylogenetic analysis showed that the E. tenella virus, E. brunetti RNA virus 1, and Mycoviruses were clustered into the genus Victorivirus and separated from the reported protozoa viruses, strongly suggesting a novel Eimeriaviruses subgenus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for the complete genome sequence of the E. tenella virus. Using the nomenclature generally adopted for viruses, this new isolate was named E. tenella RNA virus 1. This study provides a foundation basis for further research on the biological characteristics of Eimeriaviruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria tenella 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aVictorivirus 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3acoat proteins 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenome 3amycoviruses 3aoocysts 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3avirus-like particles1 aZhang, Xichen1 aGong, Pengtao1 aLi, Mingying1 aDing, He1 aXin, Caiyan1 aZhao, Na1 aLi, Jianhua0 tVirus genes.g2016 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.244-252dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1295-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245009700208300001600305500001100321506007600332520129700408592002801705506003701733650001901770650001101789650001301800650002301813650001501836650001801851650001901869650001701888650002201905650001401927650001401941650001901955650001001974650001301984650001101997650001102008650002002019650001502039650002602054700002502080773013002105856008202235852000902317655001202326IND60683871520221207105917.0200213e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068387152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04053-52doi7 aPMC70161432pmcid7 a321163492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Ashita10aContamination of vegetables with heavy metals across the globe: hampering food security goal  ap. 391-403.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFood Security is a multifaceted aspect covering nutrition, availability, sufficiency, accessibility and safety. Millennium Development Goals as framed by United Nations focused to attain food security for all. The biggest hindrance in attaining food security was less productivity due to lack of enough resources. In order to increase the availability and produce sufficient food, malpractices like growing food on contaminated land or using untreated wastewater for irrigation came into play. Such practices have led to the transfer of heavy metals, pathogens and other harmful toxins to food crops. Various studies across the world have documented high concentration of heavy metals in vegetable crops. Root tubers and succulent stems are hyperaccumulators of heavy metals and thus tend to pose health hazard to the consuming population. In many instances the content of toxic metals in vegetables is much beyond permissible limits. Hazard quotient assessment in various studies has shown that consumption of these vegetables can be toxic to both adults and children. So, the question arises are we really attaining the global food security? There is a need to find a solution to produce sufficient, safe and nutritious food for the civilization so as to meet the goal of “zero hunger”.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUnited Nations 3aadults 3achildren 3afood contamination 3afood crops 3afood security 3ahealth hazards 3aheavy metals 3ahyperaccumulators 3anutrition 3apathogens 3apolluted soils 3astems 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3atubers 3avegetable crops 3avegetables 3awastewater irrigation1 aNagpal, Avinash Kaur0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 Feb., v. 57, no. 2 p.391-403dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-04053-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009300172300001600265520129300281592002801574650001101602650001301613650001501626650002401641650001601665650001501681651001301696653003701709653003201746653002401778653001801802700002001820700002001840773010501860856008601965852000902051655001202060IND60539778120221122042123.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053977812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.03.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaseem, Muhammad10aEnsemble hydrological prediction of streamflow percentile at ungauged basins in Pakistan  ap. 130-137.  aStreamflow records with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage at the site of interest are usually scarce in Pakistan. As an alternative, various regional methods have been frequently adopted to derive hydrological information, which in essence attempt to transfer hydrological information from gauged to ungauged catchments. In this study, a new concept of ensemble hydrological prediction (EHP) was introduced which is an improved regional method for hydrological prediction at ungauged sites. It was mainly based on the performance weights (triple-connection weights (TCW)) derived from Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and hydrological variable (here percentiles) calculated from three traditional regional transfer methods (RTMs) with suitable modification (i.e., three-step drainage area ratio (DAR) method, inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, and three-step regional regression analysis (RRA)). The overall results indicated that the proposed EHP method was robust for estimating hydrological percentiles at ungauged sites as compared to traditional individual RTMs. The comparative study based on NSE, percent bias (PBIAS) and the relative error (RE) as performance criteria resulted that the EHP is a constructive alternative for hydrological prediction of ungauged basins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adrainage 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aPakistan 0aEnsemble hydrological prediction 0aNash–Sutcliffe efficiency 0aPerformance weights 0aUngauged site1 aAjmal, Muhammad1 aKim, Tae-woong,0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 June, v. 525 p.130-137dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.03.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245009900159300002000258520082600278592002801104650001301132650001101145650000901156650001801165650002301183650002201206650002001228650001601248700001901264700001501283700001701298700001601315700001501331700001801346700001501364700001801379700005801397773013901455856008101594852000901675655001201684IND60616678520221123002211.0181020e20180913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061667852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b076502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Kuan10aGrain Boundary Plays a Key Role in Carbon Diffusion in Carbon Irons Revealed by a ReaxFF Study  ap. 23191-23199.  aCarbon diffusion is a critical process to the manufacture of many industry products, such as iron carbides, stainless steels, and carbon materials. Here we investigate carbon diffusion induced by tensile, screw dislocation, edge dislocation, and polycrystal boundary through reactive molecular dynamics simulations with ReaxFF potentials. The temperature enhances the dynamics and therefore the carbon diffusion. The pre-existing defects promote the carbon diffusion with a linear relationship between carbon diffusion barrier and strain as well as line defect concentrations. Furthermore, we also observed a linear relationship between the carbon diffusion barrier and the volume fractions of the polycrystalline boundary, indicating that the grain boundary mechanism is prominent in carbon diffusion in the carbon iron.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbides 3acarbon 3airon 3amanufacturing 3amolecular dynamics 3asimulation models 3astainless steel 3atemperature1 aHuo, Chun-Fang1 aHe, Yurong1 aYin, Junqing1 aLiu, Jinjia1 aPeng, Qing1 aGuo, Wen-Ping1 aYang, Yong1 aLi, Yong-Wang1 aWen, Xiao-Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5626-85810 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 13, v. 122, no. 40 p.23191-23199dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b076503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012200168300001500290520145300305592002801758650002601786650001801812650001201830650001601842650001901858650001601877650001801893650002001911650001801931650001501949650001101964650001101975650001501986653003002001653002902031653002002060653001502080653001702095653001102112700001702123700001802140700001702158773010002175856008102275852000902356655001202365IND60554176620221122041344.0161024e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055417662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2015.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjo, Ebenezer O.10aDesign and parallelisation of a miniature photobioreactor platform for microalgal culture evaluation and optimisation  ap. 93-102.  aMiniature photobioreactors (mPBr) represent a potential platform technology for the high-throughput, phototrophic cultivation of microalgae. This work describes the development and characterisation of a novel orbitally shaken twin-well mPBr, and its scale-out to a 24-well microplate format, suitable for optimisation of microalgae culture conditions. Fluid hydrodynamics, oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa) and light intensity distribution in the mPBr were first investigated as a function of orbital shaking frequency. High speed video analysis of the shaken wells indicated rapid fluid flow and good mixing while measured kLa values varied between 20 and 80h−1. Light intensity variation across the scaled-out platform was in the range ±20μmolm−2s−1. The use of the mPBr platform was demonstrated for optimisation of conditions for the batch cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana. Using a modified tris-base phosphate (TBP) medium, the highest biomass concentration and productivity achieved were 9.2gL−1 and 2.5±0.2gL−1d−1 respectively at 5% CO2 with a light intensity of 380μmolm−2s−1. In general, cell growth rate and yield increased with increasing shaking frequency (up to 300rpm) while culture conditions had limited impact on pigment production. Overall, these results demonstrate the application of the mPBr for rapid optimisation of phototrophic culture conditions and establishment of high cell density cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella sorokiniana 3aalgae culture 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon dioxide 3acell growth 3ahydrodynamics 3alight intensity 3amass transfer 3amicroalgae 3amixing 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 0aMiniature photobioreactor 0aFatty acid methyl esters 0aOxygen transfer 0aMicroalgae 0aOptimisation 0aMixing1 aAuta, Hadiza1 aBaganz, Frank1 aLye, Gary J.0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 103 p.93-102dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2015.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009800165300001600263520140500279592002801684650002101712650003201733650002101765650002401786650001301810650001101823650002201834650001401856650001501870650003001885650003001915650002101945700001301966700001301979700001601992700001302008700001502021700001902036700001502055773008202070856008102152852000902233655001202242IND60515633120221117044249.0160316e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051563312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-016-1289-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xuchen10aGenetic instability of Japanese encephalitis virus cDNA clones propagated in Escherichia coli  ap. 195-203.  aThe genetic instability of Flavivirus cDNA clones in transformed bacteria is a common phenomenon. Herein, a cDNA fragment of the nucleotide (nt) 1–2913 of the genome of a flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), was used to investigate factors that caused the instability of cDNA clones. Several cDNA fragments with different 5′- or 3′-termini of the 2913-nt cDNA were obtained by PCR amplification or restriction enzyme digestion and cloned into a pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector. All the cDNA fragments were stably propagated at 25 °C. However, the 5′-untranslated region and half of the 3′-E gene could cause the instability of the 2913-nt cDNA at 37 °C. The 5′-terminus sequences of the 2913-nt fragment were subjected to testing of the prokaryotic promoter activity by luciferase assay and Western blot. The sequences of 54–120 nt of the JEV genome exhibited high prokaryotic promoter activity at 37 °C, and the activity declined markedly at 25 °C. These findings revealed that the high prokaryotic promoter activity of the 54–120 nt sequences of the JEV genome together with expression of JEV structural genes determined the instability of a JEV cDNA clone. Growth at room temperature may reduce the prokaryotic promoter activity of 5′-sequences of the JEV genome and could represent an effective way to improve the stability of flavivirus cDNA clones in host bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aJapanese encephalitis virus 3aWestern blotting 3aambient temperature 3abacteria 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3adigestion 3aluciferase 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3astructural genes1 aTong, Wu1 aLiu, Fei1 aLiang, Chao1 aGao, Fei1 aLi, Guoxin1 aTong, Guangzhi1 aZheng, Hao0 tVirus genes.g2016 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.195-203dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1289-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245010400166300001400270500000900284520187800293592002802171650001302199650001202212650002102224650001202245650001402257650001602271650001202287650001102299650001302310650001202323650000902335650001902344650001502363650003402378650001402412650001102426650001402437700001902451700001902470700001702489773013502506856007902641852000902720655001202729IND60668290020221119181131.0191228e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066829002DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2005.02322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Chang Yoon10aCarboxylic Content of Humic Acid Determined by Modeling, Calcium Acetate, and Precipitation Methods  ap. 86-94.  aepub  aThe key to understanding proton equilibria and cation binding on the surface of humic acid is the quantification of the total carboxylic acid contents. Such quantification via titration alone is highly ambiguous and not straightforward due to the complexity and interference of noncarboxylic acids (phenolic acid, thiols, etc.). To gain a greater understanding of such analysis, potentiometric titration data was incorporated into modeling approaches, and they were compared with two other methods: conventional Ca(OAc)₂ exchange and the precipitation titration method. Each of these three methods was used to analyze six different humic samples. The humic samples were collected from various sources, such as upland, paddy fields, sediments, and peat. The carboxylic acid contents ranged from 263 to 487 cmolc kg⁻¹ Furthermore, the carboxylic acid content in the humic acid from the Namwon series showed significantly higher values. This was attributed to the relatively higher percentage of organic C in the mother material. Two modeling approaches using titration data were performed. The first was a simple electrostatic model with limited functional group heterogeneity (Model A). The second was our implemented version of Model V with four carboxylic acid group sites and four phenolic hydroxyl group sites. The relative difference in total carboxylic acid contents between the Ca(OAc)₂ method and Model A prediction ranged from 0.21 to 7.43%, and that between the Ca(OAc)₂ method and Model V prediction was 1.90 to 35.71%. The predicted carboxylic acid content from Model A was more comparable to the results of the Ca(OAc)₂ method and the cetyltrimethylammonium method than the Model V prediction. The modeling approaches with the simple ligand model showed a better prediction of the total carboxylic acid content from the potentiometric titration data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acalcium 3acarboxylic acids 3acations 3ahighlands 3ahumic acids 3aligands 3amodels 3amoieties 3apaddies 3apeat 3aphenolic acids 3aprediction 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asediments 3athiols 3atitration1 aPark, Chan Won1 aKim, Jeong-Gyu1 aLim, Soo Kil0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2007 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.86-94dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2005.02323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011500166500001900281520174500300592002802045650001702073650002302090650001502113650001602128650001602144650002002160650001102180650001302191650001402204650002102218650001502239650001202254650001802266650001202284650001002296650002102306650001602327650001002343653001002353700001702363700001902380700001302399700001502412700001702427700001302444700001602457773012002473856008502593852000902678655001202687IND60695506120221120193429.0201024e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069550612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1587362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiale10aLipidomics reveals how the endoparasitoid wasp Pteromalus puparum manipulates host energy stores for its young  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEndoparasitoid wasps inject venom along with their eggs to adjust the physiological and nutritional environment inside their hosts to benefit the development of their offspring. In particular, wasp venoms are known to modify host lipid metabolism, lipid storage in the fat body, and release of lipids into the hemolymph, but how venoms accomplish these functions remains unclear. Here, we use an UPLC-MS-based lipidomics approach to analyze the identities and concentrations of lipids in both fat body and hemolymph of host cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) infected by the pupal endoparasitoid Pteromalus puparum. During infection, host fat body levels of highly unsaturated, soluble triacylglycerides (TAGs) increased while less unsaturated, less soluble forms decreased. Furthermore, in infected host hemolymph, overall levels of TAG and phospholipids (the major component of cell membranes) increased, suggesting that fat body cells are destroyed and their contents are dispersed. Altogether, these data suggest that wasp venom induces host fat body TAGs to be transformed into lower melting point (more liquid) forms and released into the host hemolymph following infection, allowing simple absorption and nutritional acquisition by wasp larvae. Finally, cholesteryl esters (CEs, a dietary lipid derived from cholesterol) increased in host hemolymph following infection with no concomitant decrease in host cholesterol, implying that the wasp may provide this necessary food resource to its offspring via its venom. This study provides novel insight into how parasitoid infection alters lipid metabolism in insect hosts, and begins to uncover the wasp venom proteins responsible for host physiological changes and offspring development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPieris rapae 3aPteromalus puparum 3aabsorption 3acholesterol 3adietary fat 3aendoparasitoids 3aenergy 3afat body 3ahemolymph 3alipid metabolism 3alipidomics 3aliquids 3aphospholipids 3aprogeny 3apupae 3atriacylglycerols 3awasp venoms 3awasps 0aLipid1 aJin, Hongxia1 aSchlenke, Todd1 aYang, Yi1 aWang, Fang1 aYao, Hongwei1 aFang, Qi1 aYe, Gongyin0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Sept., v. 1865, no. 9 p.158736-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1587363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245016700165520189900332592002802231650001302259650001502272650001302287650002002300650002202320650002302342650002002365650001802385650001202403650001302415650001402428650001802442650002302460650001502483650001202498651001002510653002602520653002502546653002002571700001702591700001702608700001702625773011902642856008802761852000902849655001202858IND60680647520221118194705.0200210e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068064752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1360482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Lei10aIn situ measurements and meta-analysis reveal that land-use changes combined with low nitrogen application promote methane uptake by temperate grasslands in China  aMethane (CH₄) oxidation in well-aerated grassland soils is an important sink for atmospheric CH₄, which can be largely modified by land-use changes. However, the impacts of land-use changes (i.e., from native grasslands to artificial grasslands (AG) and croplands (CL)) on soil CH₄ uptake in China remain uncertain. Therefore, the 2-year CH₄ flux was measured from 3 land-use types, including heavily grazed steppe (HG, control), AG, and CL, in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Northern China to elucidate this impact. Moreover, a meta-analysis was conducted to elucidate this effect across Chinese grasslands. The results showed that the land-use types could not change the seasonal patterns but significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the strength of soil CH₄ uptake. The mean annual CH₄ uptake followed the decreasing order of 14.7 ± 0.48 (mean ± 1 standard error) (CL), 3.28 ± 0.09 (AG), and 1.24 ± 0.07 kg CH₄–C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (HG) in 2012–2014. This spatial variation pattern was linear and negatively (n = 6, rₐdⱼ.²= 0.73, p < 0.05) associated with the annual mean soil water-filled pore space. Non-growing season CH₄ uptake contributed 22–46% to the annual CH₄ uptake across land-use types. The meta-analysis also confirmed that the land-use changes significantly (p < 0.05) promoted the annual soil CH₄ uptake in temperate grasslands in China. This increased uptake is primarily related to the significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the soil water contents and the increase in the sand contents due to the land-use changes. Furthermore, nitrogen application not exceeding 100 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in these N-limited ecosystems significantly (p < 0.05) promoted soil CH₄ uptake. Collectively, our study demonstrated that land-use changes combined with low N application promoted soil CH₄ uptake in the temperate grasslands of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3aecosystems 3aecotones 3agrassland soils 3agrazing intensity 3aindigenous species 3aland use change 3ameta-analysis 3amethane 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3asand fraction 3aseasonal variation 3asoil water 3asteppes 3aChina 0aAgro-pastoral ecotone 0aArtificial grassland 0aLand-use change1 aYang, Helong1 aPan, Zhanlei1 aRong, Yuping0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 706 p.136048-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1360483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002000170245010500190300001600295520151100311592002801822650001101850650002401861650001201885650001101897650001301908650002201921650001401943650001801957650001301975650001801988650003802006650003402044650003402078650004202112650002202154650002002176650002402196650001302220650001202233650003502245651001502280651001102295700001302306700001702319700001702336700001402353700002202367773010602389856008702495852000902582655001202591IND4466516320221120094735.0141112e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446651632DNAL7 a220333562pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Violeta10aIodide and iodate (¹²⁹I and ¹²⁷I) in surface water of the Baltic Sea, Kattegat and Skagerrak  ap. 296-303.  aDespite the common incorporation of iodine in the biological cycle and occurrence of huge contamination of the radioactive isotope ¹²⁹I in the Baltic Proper, Skagerrak and Kattegat, there is no data on chemical speciation of iodine in these waters. We here present first time data on iodine isotopes ¹²⁹I and ¹²⁷I species as iodide and iodate in surface seawater samples collected from 16 locations in August 2006 and 19 locations in April 2007 in the Baltic Proper, Skagerrak and Kattegat. After extensive separation methods, the isotopes concentrations were determined using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) technique for the ¹²⁹I and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) for ¹²⁷I. High concentrations of both isotopes species were found in the Skagerrak–Kattegat basins, whereas the values in the Baltic Proper are low for both species. The ratios of ¹²⁹I⁻/¹²⁹IO₃ ⁻ and ¹²⁷I⁻/¹²⁷IO₃ ⁻ significantly increase from south to central Baltic Sea, and iodide (both isotopes) appears as the predominant inorganic iodine species along the Baltic Sea. The results show insignificant change in ¹²⁹I and ¹²⁷I speciation and suggest that reduction of iodate and oxidation of iodide in Skagerrak and Kattegat may be a slow process. Additionally, the positive correlation between salinity and iodide and iodate (both isotopes) may reflect effective control of Skagerrak water mass on iodine distribution in surface water of the Baltic Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3achemical speciation 3aiodides 3aiodine 3aisotopes 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aradionuclides 3aseawater 3asurface water 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aIodatesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aIodidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aIodine Isotopesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aOceans and Seas 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSalinity 2aSeasons 2aSeawaterxanalysisxchemistry. 3aBaltic Sea 0aEurope1 aYi, Peng1 aHou, Xiaolin1 aAldahan, Ala1 aRoos, Per1 aPossnert, Göran,0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 412-413 p.296-303dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04453naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004100135040001800176100005900194245010500253506007600358520200900434592002802443506003702471650001502508650001102523650001402534650001202548650002302560650001502583650001202598650001202610650001402622650001302636650001402649650001902663650001002682650002202692650001702714650002002731650003102751650001202782650002402794650002102818650001902839650002302858650004302881650002202924650002002946650001702966650002202983650003003005651001403035651001203049651001103061651001003072651001303082651001203095651001803107651001103125651001203136653001803148653001803166653001203184653002903196653003603225653002703261700002503288700002203313700006403335700002003399773011903419856008803538852000903626655001203635IND60680647620221207143354.0211114e20200325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068064762DNAL7 a319181842pmid7 aPMC70639742pmcid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1360712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Khalid M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5513-033710aHealth effects of arsenic exposure in Latin America: An overview of the past eight years of research  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStudies conducted over the past eight years in Latin America (LA) have continued to produce new knowledge regarding health impacts of arsenic (As) in drinking water. We conducted a systematic review of 92 peer-reviewed English articles published between 2011 and 2018 to expand our understanding on these health effects. Majority of the LA studies on As have been conducted in Chile and Mexico. Additional data have emerged from As-exposed populations in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay. The present review has documented recent data on the biomarkers of As exposure, genetic susceptibility and genotoxicity, and risk assessment to further characterize the health effects and exposed populations. Some recent findings on the associations of As with bladder and lung cancers, reproductive outcomes, and declined cognitive performance have been consistent with what we reported in our previous systematic review article. We have found highly convincing evidence of in utero As exposure as a significant risk factor for several health outcomes, particularly for bladder cancer, even at moderate level. New data have emerged regarding the associations of As with breast and laryngeal cancers as well as type 2 diabetes. We observed early life As exposure to be associated with kidney injury, carotid intima-media thickness, and various pulmonary outcomes in children. Other childhood effects such as low birth weight, low gestational age, anemia, increased apoptosis, and decreased cognitive functions were also reported. Studies identified genetic variants of As methyltransferase that could determine susceptibility to As related health outcomes. Arsenic-induced DNA damage and alteration of gene and protein expression have also been reported. While the scope of research is still vast, the substantial work done on As exposure and its health effects in LA will help direct further large-scale studies for more comprehensive knowledge and plan appropriate mitigation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aanemia 3aapoptosis 3aarsenic 3aat-risk population 3abiomarkers 3abladder 3abreasts 3achildhood 3achildren 3acognition 3adrinking water 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotoxicity 3agestational age 3ahealth effects assessments 3akidneys 3alaryngeal neoplasms 3alow birth weight 3alung neoplasms 3amethyltransferases 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aprotein synthesis 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 3asystematic review 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 3aArgentina 3aBolivia 3aBrazil 3aChile 3aColombia 3aEcuador 3aLatin America 3aMexico 3aUruguay 0aWater arsenic 0aLatin America 0aCancers 0aCardiopulmonary outcomes 0aIn utero and early life effects 0aGenetic susceptibility1 aChakraborty, Rishika1 aBundschuh, Jochen1 aBhattacharya, Prosun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4350-99501 aParvez, Faruque0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 25, v. 710 p.136071-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1360713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010200174300001600276520165000292592002801942650001401970650001501984650001401999650001002013650002402023650001102047650001702058650002502075650001502100651001002115653001702125653002502142653001702167653003202184653001602216653001202232700001802244773010502262856008602367852000902453655001202462IND60539778520221120063257.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053977852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.03.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatha, Dwarikanath12aA digraph permanent approach to evaluation and analysis of integrated watershed management system  ap. 188-196.  aIn the present study a deterministic quantitative model based on graph theory has been developed for the better development and management of watershed. Graph theory is an integrative systems approach to consider and model structural components of watershed management system along with the interrelationships between them concurrently and integratively. The factors responsible for the development of watershed system are identified. The degree of interaction between one subsystem with others are determined. The eigenvalue formulation is used to take care the inconsistencies arises due to inaccurate judgement in the degree of interaction between the subsystems. In this model the visual analysis is done to abstract the information using the directed graph or digraph. Then the matrix model is developed for computer processing. Variable permanent function in the form of multinomial represents the watershed system uniquely and completely by an index value. Different terms of the multinomial represent all possible subsystems of integrated watershed management system and thus different solutions for watershed management, leading to optimum solution. This index value is used to compare the suitability of the watershed with different alternatives available for its development. So the graph theory analysis presents a powerful tool to generate the optimum solutions for the decision maker for benefit of local people living in the watershed as well as the stakeholders. The proposed methodology is also demonstrated by a suitable example and is applied to the ecosystem and environment subsystem of the lake Qionghai watershed in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3aecosystems 3ahydrology 3alakes 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3astakeholders 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aGraph theory 0aWatershed management 0aMatrix model 0aVariable permanent function 0aMultinomial 0aDigraph1 aAgrawal, V.P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 June, v. 525 p.188-196dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.03.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009100167300001600258500000900274520183300283592002802116650002802144650002902172650001602201650002002217650001202237650002502249650001002274650001202284650001102296650001302307650001902320650001402339650001302353650000902366650002102375700001602396700002102412700002302433700003702456773015802493856008202651852000902733655001202742IND60668290420221119181054.0191125e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066829042DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2014.05.01912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOelmann, Yvonne10aManagement Intensity Modifies Plant Diversity Effects on N Yield and Mineral N in Soil  ap. 559-568.  aepub  aThe effect of species loss on productivity were of comparable magnitude to changes in agricultural management. However, not only productivity but also the N cycle is relevant for food production comprising beneficial as well as threatening effects of agricultural management. Our objectives were to test whether grassland management (mowing two or four times a year; 0, 100, or 200 kg N/ha) (i) modifies N yield or soil Nₘᵢₙ concentrations and changes (ii) the effect of plant functional groups (legumes, grasses, non-leguminous small and tall herbs) on N yield or soil Nₘᵢₙ concentrations or (iii) the relationships between plant diversity and N yield or soil Nₘᵢₙ concentrations. We observed highest productivity under moderate management intensity which can be attributed to the growth-stimulating fertilizer effect associated with enough time for regrowth. With increasing management intensity, the positive effect of the presence of legumes on N yield and soil Nₘᵢₙ concentrations disappeared. Plant species richness was positively related to N yield with the most pronounced effect in the highly fertilized and frequently mown treatment. In the control (mown twice a year, non-fertilized), competition for nutrients very likely underlie plant species richness effects. Under higher management intensity, a combination of competition for light and adaption to mowing frequency seemed to be responsible for plant species richness effects. The concurrence of highest N yield in high-diversity mixtures under most intensive management indicates that some plant species must have more than compensated for the N uptake of non-adapted species that did not survive frequent mowing, highlighting the value of plant diversity as an insurance against anthropogenic disturbances including management measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3aanthropogenic activities 3afertilizers 3afood production 3agrasses 3agrassland management 3aherbs 3alegumes 3amowing 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3anutrients 3aregrowth 3asoil 3aspecies richness1 aVogel, Anja1 aWegener, Florian1 aWeigelt, Alexandra1 aScherer-Lorenzen, M.q(Michael),0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2015 Mar., v. 79, no. 2 p.559-568dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2014.05.01913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245011200159500001300271520133800284592002801622650001201650650001201662650001101674650001701685650001201702650001001714650002501724650001801749650001601767650002501783700001301808700002001821700001801841700002301859700001901882700002401901700001601925710006301941710009202004773010002096856007902196852000902275655001202284IND60536750320221119021510.0160806s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053675032DNAL7 a10.1155/2012/4365372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Dengsheng10aAboveground Forest Biomass Estimation with Landsat and LiDAR Data and Uncertainty Analysis of the Estimates  a30972360  aLandsat Thematic mapper (TM) image has long been the dominate data source, and recently LiDAR has offered an important new structural data stream for forest biomass estimations. On the other hand, forest biomass uncertainty analysis research has only recently obtained sufficient attention due to the difficulty in collecting reference data. This paper provides a brief overview of current forest biomass estimation methods using both TM and LiDAR data. A case study is then presented that demonstrates the forest biomass estimation methods and uncertainty analysis. Results indicate that Landsat TM data can provide adequate biomass estimates for secondary succession but are not suitable for mature forest biomass estimates due to data saturation problems. LiDAR can overcome TM’s shortcoming providing better biomass estimation performance but has not been extensively applied in practice due to data availability constraints. The uncertainty analysis indicates that various sources affect the performance of forest biomass/carbon estimation. With that said, the clear dominate sources of uncertainty are the variation of input sample plot data and data saturation problem related to optical sensors. A possible solution to increasing the confidence in forest biomass estimates is to integrate the strengths of multisensor data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aforests 3alidar 3asecondary succession 3athematic maps 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis1 aChen, Qi1 aWang, Guangxing1 aMoran, Emilio1 aBatistella, Mateus1 aZhang, Maozhen1 aVaglio Laurin, Gaia1 aSaah, David2 aGuo jia zi ran ke xue ji jin wei yuan hui (China),eFunder2 aAnthropological Center for Training and Research on Global Environmental ChangeeFunder0 tInternational journal of forestry research.g2012, v. 2012dHindawi Pub.

Structural features of the aₚ × aₚ × 2aₚ perovskite series were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory DFT simulation techniques. The location of La ions was assessed by Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns, and structural sites occupied by Li, Na and Nb ions investigated by MAS-NMR spectroscopy. In Li-rich samples, La and Li ions are preferentially located at z/c = 0 planes, but as the Na content increases, La and Na occupy both z/c = 0 and 0.5 planes. To analyze La and Li possible arrangements, different structural models have been considered in DFT simulations, confirming the cation ordering deduced from XRD patterns and the impediment of Na ions to move through square windows of the perovskite. The structural information deduced has been used to discuss transport properties deduced by Impedance Spectroscopy (IS). In Li rich samples, the La arrangement in alternating planes favors a 2D-dimensional Li conductivity. The incorporation of Na in two crystallographic planes reduces La ordering and increases Li conductivity. La disorder favours the change from 2D to 3D Li conductivity, which could explain the broad maximum detected in the Li conductivity as a function of the Na content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acations 3adensity functional theory 3adielectric spectroscopy 3alithium 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asodium1 aDíez, Virginia1 aSanz, Jesús,1 aKobylianska, Sofia D.1 aV'yunov, Oleg I.1 aBelous, Anatolii G.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 18, v. 5, no. 35 p.27912-27921dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra02505b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015000164300001600314520138700330592002801717650001601745650001701761650001301778650001601791650001501807650001301822650001801835650002001853650001101873650001601884650001101900653001801911653001601929653001201945653001801957653002101975653001901996653001602015700002702031700002002058700002902078773012502107856008202232852000902314655001202323IND60517621420221117175728.0190801e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051762142DNAL7 a10.1017/S096025851500001X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Ziyue10aSeed dormancy is a dynamic state: variable responses to pre- and post-shedding environmental signals in seeds of contrasting Arabidopsis ecotypes  ap. 159-169.  aSeeds have evolved to be highly efficient environmental sensors that respond not only to their prevailing environment, but also their environmental history, to regulate dormancy and the initiation of germination. In the present work we investigate the combined impact of a number of environmental signals (temperature, nitrate, light) during seed development on the mother plant, during post-shedding imbibition and during prolonged post-shedding exposure in both dry and imbibed states, simulating time in the soil seed bank. The differing response to these environments was observed in contrasting winter (Cvi, Ler) and summer (Bur) annual Arabidopsis ecotypes. Results presented show that environmental signals both pre- and post-shedding determine the depth of physiological dormancy and therefore the germination response to the ambient environment. The ecotype differences in seed response to ambient germination conditions are greatly enhanced by seed maturation in different environments. Further variation in response develops following shedding when seeds do not receive the full complement of environmental signals required for germination and enter the soil seed bank in either dry or imbibed states. Species seed dormancy characteristics cannot therefore be easily defined, as seed dormancy is a dynamic state subject to within-species adaptation to local environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aburied seeds 3aecotypes 3agermination 3aimbibition 3anitrates 3aseed dormancy 3aseed maturation 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 0aafterripening 0aArabidopsis 0anitrate 0aseed dormancy 0aseed germination 0asoil seed bank 0atemperature1 aÖlçer-Footitt, Hulya1 aFootitt, Steven1 aFinch-Savage, William E.0 tSeed science research.g2015 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.159-169dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl50007x1475-27357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S096025851500001X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009800171300001600269520081500285592002801100650002201128650001901150650002501169650001501194650001101209650001001220650001901230650001401249650000701263650001301270650001301283650002701296653002801323653002501351653002701376653001301403700001901416700002001435700002001455700002801475773011101503856008701614852000901701655001201710IND60525683820221118124919.0190318e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052568382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaudel, Ekaraj10aEffects of cellular structure and cell wall components on water holding capacity of mushrooms  ap. 106-113.  aIn a sequel of papers we have investigated effects of different physical contributions to the water holding capacity of foods by considering the common white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). In the current paper of our sequel, we consider individual contributions of the cellular phase to water holding. The water holding capacity of hydrated mushroom is studied in relation to cell membrane integrity loss and change of state of structural polymers of the cell wall. We show that the loss in water holding capacity after heat treatment is closely correlated with cell membrane integrity loss. The intrinsic water holding capacity of the cell wall components, mostly chitin and proteins also play a role. The contribution of protein manifests largely via a significant response of WHC towards change in pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3acell membranes 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3achitin 3afoods 3aheat treatment 3amushrooms 3apH 3apolymers 3aproteins 3awater holding capacity 0aCell membrane integrity 0aCell wall components 0aWater holding capacity 0aMushroom1 aBoom, Remko M.1 avan Haaren, Els1 aSiccama, Joanne1 avan der Sman, Ruud G.M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2016 Oct., v. 187 p.106-113dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245020500167520181600372592002802188650001702216650002402233650001302257650002902270650001402299650002302313650001802336650002002354650001202374650001902386650001402405650002202419650001402441650001102455650001402466650001302480650003902493650001302532650002202545650001702567650002502584650001402609653001302623653001702636653002802653653001702681653002402698653002002722653003802742653000802780653000702788653000702795653000802802653000802810700001702818700001502835700002002850700001502870773009602885856008502981852000903066655001203075IND60763966720221120155443.0220719e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076396672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2022.1051322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, H.T.10aStructural characterization of the carbohydrate and protein part of arabinogalactan protein from Basella alba stem and antiadhesive activity of polysaccharides from B. alba against Helicobacter pylori  aIncreasing drug resistance of Helicobacter pylori has highlighted the search for natural compounds with antiadhesive properties, interrupting the adhesion of H. pylori to stomach epithelia. Basella alba, a plant widely used in Asian traditional medicine, was investigated for its antiadhesive activity against H. pylori. B. alba extract FE was prepared by aqueous extraction. Polysaccharides were isolated from FE by ethanol precipitation and arabinogalactan-protein (AGP) was isolated with Yariv reagent. Carbohydrate analyses was performed by standard methods and sequence analysis of the protein part of AGP by LC-MS. In vitro adhesion assay of fluorescent-labelled H. pylori J99 to human AGS cells was performed by flow cytometric analysis. Raw polysaccharides (BA1) were isolated and 9% of BA1 were identified as AGP (53.1% neutral carbohydrates L-arabinose, D-galactose, rhamnose, 5.4% galacturonic acid, 41.5% protein). After deglycosylation of AGP, the protein part (two bands at 15 and 25 kDa in tricine SDS-PAGE) was shown to contain peptides like ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase-large-chain. Histological localization within the stem tissue of B. alba revealed that AGP was mainly located at the procambium ring. Functional assays indicated that neither FE nor BA1 had significant influence on viability of AGS cells or on H. pylori. FE inhibited the bacterial adhesion of H. pylori to AGS cells in a dose dependent manner. Best anti-adhesive effect of ~67% was observed with BA1 at 2 mg/mL. The data obtained from this study characterize in part the mucilage and isolated polysaccharides of B. alba. As the polysaccharides interact with the bacterial adhesion, a potential uses a supplemental antiadhesive entity against the recurrence of H. pylori after eradication therapy may be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBasella alba 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aadhesion 3aarabinogalactan proteins 3aarabinose 3abacterial adhesion 3adose response 3adrug resistance 3aethanol 3aflow cytometry 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3ahistology 3ahumans 3amucilages 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arhamnose 3asequence analysis 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3aviability 0aAdhesion 0aAntiadhesion 0aArabinogalactan protein 0aBasella alba 0aHelicobacter pylori 0aPolysaccharides 0aRibulose bisphosphate carboxylase 0aAGP 0aBA 0aFE 0aOMP 0aRBL1 aHerrmann, F.1 aKönig, S.1 aGoycoolea, F.M.1 aHensel, A.0 tFitoterapia.g2022 Mar., v. 157 p.105132-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34526x0367-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2022.1051323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014000155300001600295500002000311520102700331592002801358596006001386596010201446650002601548650002801574650002901602650001201631650001901643650001001662650002301672650002201695650001701717650003701734650001101771650001701782700001401799700001501813700001501828700005601843773013201899856007402031852000902105655001202114IND60793487320221123024921.0220916e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079348732DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.136682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, M.K.10aPlantaricin LD1 purified from Lactobacillus plantarum LD1 inhibits biofilm formation of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 in tooth model  ap. 623-631.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlantaricin LD1 was purified to homogeneity using activity‐guided chromatography. Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 was found to be sensitive to plantaricin LD1 showing 13 ± 0·21 mm zone of growth inhibition. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found to be 50 µg ml⁻¹ against Ent. faecalis ATCC 29212. The in vitro biofilm formation by Ent. faecalis ATCC 29212 was observed, which was completely inhibited in the presence of bacteriocin. Similarly, biofilm formation was also observed on the teeth surface showing purple colour, whereas treated‐teeth were clean and indicated no biofilm formation. Further, untreated cells of Ent. faecalis ATCC 29212 were found normal and plantaricin LD1‐treated cells were ruptured when seen under light microscope, suggesting killing of target cells. These findings have proven the initial leads for antimicrobial and anti‐biofilm activity of plantaricin LD1 against Ent. faecalis and its possible application for the treatment of endodontic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  a5/9/1117/2013‐NUTcIndian Council of Medical Research  aBT/PR8911/NDB/39/423/2013cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3achromatography 3acolor 3agrowth retardation 3alight microscopes 3amicrobiology 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels 3aplantaricins1 aYadav, P.1 aDhiman, M.1 aTewari, S.1 aTiwari, S.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1477-18450 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2022 Sept., v. 75, no. 3 p.623-631dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.136683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245012300198300002000321506007600341520158300417592002802000506003702028650001302065650001402078650001102092650000902103650001202112650002202124650001302146650001602159650004402175650005802219650001702277650001002294700002202304700001202326700001402338700001702352700001902369773012402388856007402512852000902586655001202595IND60667402420221207131047.0190919e20150324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066740242DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra02509e2doi7 aPMC45275572pmcid7 a262578902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Guan-Hu10aPurification and structural characterization of “simple catechol”, the NGAL-siderocalin siderophore in human urine  ap. 28527-28535.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe identification of ligands that bind the protein Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL, siderocalin, lipocalin-2) have helped to elucidate its function. NGAL-siderocalin binds and sequesters the iron loaded bacterial siderophore enterochelin (Ent), defining the protein as an innate immune effector. Simple metabolic catechols can also form tight complexes with NGAL-siderocalin and ferric iron, suggesting that the protein may act as an iron scavenger even in the absence of Ent. While different catechols have been detected in human urine, they have not been directly purified from a biofluid and demonstrated to ligate iron with NGAL-siderocalin. This paper describes a “natural products” approach to identify small molecules that mediate iron binding to NGAL-siderocalin. A 10 K filtrate of human urine was subjected to multiple steps of column chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC, guided by NGAL-siderocalin–iron binding assays and LC-MS detection. The co-factor forming a ternary structure with iron and NGAL-siderocalin was identified as authentic simple catechol (dihydroxybenze) by ESI-HR-Mass, UV, and NMR spectrometric analysis. Comparison of the binding strengths of different catechols demonstrated that the vicinal-dihydroxyl groups were the key functional groups and that steric compatibilities of the catechol ring have the strongest effect on binding. Although catechol was a known NGAL-siderocalin co-factor, our purification directly confirmed its presence in urine as well as its capacity to serve as an iron trap with NGAL-siderocalin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatechol 3afiltrates 3ahumans 3airon 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3amoieties 3aneutrophils 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asiderophores 3aurine1 aBarasch, Jonathan1 aXu, Jie1 aWang, Wei1 aHu, Feng-Lin1 aDeng, Shi-Xian0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 24, v. 5, no. 36 p.28527-28535dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra02509e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013300171300001400304520118900318592002801507650001401535650001201549650001601561650001501577650002301592650002201615650001201637650002001649650002201669650001501691650002201706650001301728700002101741700001601762700002301778700001801801700002601819700001801845773012101863856008101984852000902065655001202074IND60572317920221118045658.0170717e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057231792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-016-9951-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJovičić, Snežana10aInfluence of landscape structure and land use on Merodon and Cheilosia (Diptera: Syrphidae): contrasting responses of two genera  ap. 53-64.  aRecent advances in landscape ecology have revealed the importance of landscape structure on insect species diversity and composition. We investigated how landscape structure and land use influence species compositions of Cheilosia and Merodon (Diptera: Syrphidae); two phytophagus genera of hoverflies. Our study shows that Shannon’s Diversity Index, Connectance Index, Grazing Intensity, Mean Fractal Dimension Index and Percentage of Agricultural Patches explained 38.6% of the variance in species composition at a 2 km scale, with the total ordination being significant (P = 0.04, Monte Carlo test, 499 permutations). Merodon and Cheilosia species differ in their responses to land-use change and connectivity, with the latter genus being positively correlated with connectivity and negatively correlated with all other variables. We conclude that connectivity is the primary factor affecting Cheilosia, while most Merodon species demonstrated greater resistance to changes in human-modified ecosystems. Our results suggest that different management efforts, focused on land-use intensity (grazing) or connectivity, seem to be appropriate when trying to conserve these taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheilosia 3aMerodon 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3afractal dimensions 3agrazing intensity 3ainsects 3aland use change 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3avariance1 aBurgio, Giovanni1 aDiti, Irene1 aKrašić, Dušanka1 aMarkov, Zlata1 aRadenković, Snežana1 aVujić, Ante,0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2017 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.53-64dSpringer International Publishingx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-016-9951-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002700157245018300184300001600367506002800383520174000411592002802151506003702179650002402216650001902240650002602259650002602285650002502311650001802336650000902354650002102363650002602384650001702410650001502427650001002442653002202452653001102474653001702485700002302502700003202525773016302557856009202720852000902812655001202821IND60784653520221207134155.0210713e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078465352DNAL7 a10.21498/2518-1017.17.2.2021.2365232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aАйоделе, О.П.10aEffects of catnip (Nepeta cataria L.) and Mexican sunflower (Tithonia diversifolia L.) density on growth, yield, and proximate composition of jute mallow (Corchorus olitorius L.)  ap. 155-163.  aResource is Open Access  aPurpose. Jute mallow (Corchorus olitorius L.) is a mucilaginous vegetable and fiber crop cultivated in the tropics, where catnip (Nepeta cataria L.) and Mexican sunflower (Tithonia diversifolia L.) are common weeds. Hence, the study investigated the growth, yield, and nutrient level of jute mallow in weed-free, catnip, and Mexican sunflower environments. Methods. The study involved two screen-house experiments in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with six replications. The treatments were 0 (control), 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weed plants per pot in both experiments. These are 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 weed count per square meter equivalent, based on the surface area of the pots used. Mexican sunflower and catnip plants interacted with jute plants in the first and second experiments, respectively. Growth parameters of jute mallow were recorded weekly from 5 to 8 weeks after sowing (WAS), and harvesting was done at 8 WAS. The proximate composition of jute was evaluated using standard procedures outlined by AOAC. The data collected were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA), and means were separated using Duncan Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at P < 0.05. Results. Catnip and Mexican sunflower negatively impacted the morphological features of jute mallow from 100 plants per square meter upwards. Catnip and Mexican sunflower, at 300 and 100–500 plants per square meter, respectively, reduced the dry weight of jute mallow. The crude protein content of jute mallow was also lessened by Mexican sunflower at some point. Conclusions. The study recommends that the density of catnip and Mexican sunflower plants interacting with jute mallow should be maintained below 100 plants per square meter to prevent yield loss.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCorchorus olitorius 3aNepeta cataria 3aTithonia diversifolia 3aTithonia rotundifolia 3aanalysis of variance 3acrude protein 3ajute 3anutrient content 3aproximate composition 3asurface area 3avegetables 3aweeds 0amexican sunflower 0acatnip 0aweed density1 aАлуко, О.А.1 aАдегбаджу, О.

In this research, dibenzothiophene (DBT) in n-octane solution (as a diesel fuel model) was completely converted into biphenyl by visible light irradiation in the presence of C/TiO₂@MCM-41 (CTM-41) as a photocatalyst under mild conditions. For the first time, the conversion was carried out through oxidation in one phase without using oxidant. For synthesizing CTM-41, tetra-butylorthotitanate was used as a precursor of Ti. Carbon species were identified in CTM-41 by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The self-doped carbon in CTM-41 was attributed to the tetra-butylorthotitanate used as a precursor of Ti. In the synthesis process, there was no carbon precursor addition. The formation of two types of carbon (carbonate species and coke-like structure in lattice of TiO₂) is responsible for the visible photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The specific surface areas of the prepared catalysts determined by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm at 77 K were 922.42 m² g⁻¹ and 767.54 m² g⁻¹. The GC-MS analysis confirmed the conversion of DBT to biphenyl. Based on the experimental results, the hole and hydroxyl radical as reactive species in the proposed mechanism played the key roles in the photocatalytic desulfurization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiphenyl 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3adesulfurization 3adiesel fuel 3afuel cells 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agasoline 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airradiation 3alight 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aoctane 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asulfur 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aEntezari, Mohammad H.1 aGoharshadi, Elaheh K.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 14, v. 5, no. 44 p.34652-34662dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra02513c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01955naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245006500162300001600227520100400243592002801247650002101275650001801296650001201314650001101326650001401337650000901351650001101360651001001371700002301381700001901404700001901423773010601442856004801548852000901596655001201605IND4466780920221121054528.0121003e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446678092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-011-0847-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Hiromi10aVertical Distribution of Carbonyl Sulfide at Mt. Fuji, Japan  ap. 159-167.  aAtmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) mixing ratios measured over 24 h during five summer campaigns (2003–2007) in a forest at the foot of Mt. Fuji, Japan (35°21′ N, 138°43′ E; 1,300 m above sea level, a.s.l.) and at the summit (3,776 m a.s.l.) were compared. COS levels were lower at the foot than at the summit during four out of five summer campaigns. The ratios of COS mixing ratios at the foot of Mt. Fuji to those at the summit ranged from 0.7 to 0.9. These results provide evidence of biological consumption of COS in the East Asian atmospheric boundary layer. We also measured the vertical profile of ambient COS below the forest canopy. These data showed a clear gradient of COS mixing ratio: in the lowermost 1 m of the boundary layer, COS mixing ratios decreased markedly downward. Two of the different kinds of vertical distribution of COS presented here support the role of soil as a sink of atmospheric COS described by previous research using dynamic enclosure experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonyl sulfide 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3amixing 3asea level 3asoil 3asummer 3aJapan1 aIgarashi, Yasuhito1 aDokiya, Yukiko1 aKatayama, Yoko0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2012 Jan., v. 223, no. 1 p.159-167dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-011-0847-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013500170300001600305520168600321592002802007650001702035650001702052650001302069650001602082650001302098650001602111650001502127650002102142650001602163650001502179650001402194651001102208653002602219653001702245653002102262653001802283653002302301653001402324653001802338653002102356700002202377773012502399856008202524852000902606655001202615IND60517621620221117175716.0190801e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051762162DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585150000452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte, Daniela M.10aInteractions between substrate temperature and humidity in signalling cyclical dormancy in seeds of two perennial tropical species  ap. 170-178.  aThe involvement of environmental factors in dormancy cycling is well known in temperate annual species, but it is not known how interaction between soil temperatures and humidity can modulate dormancy in perennial tropical species. In this study the effects were evaluated of substrate temperature and humidity on the modulation of the acquisition and overcoming of secondary dormancy in the buried seeds of two endemic Eriocaulaceae species from the rocky fields (campos rupestres) vegetation in south-eastern Brazil. Fresh seeds of Comanthera bisulcata and Syngonanthus verticillatus were buried and subsequently maintained at temperatures of 15, 20, 25 and 30°C, under three substrate humidity levels (boggy, humid and humid/dry). The seeds were exhumed every 3 months and tested for germination (20°C, 12 h photoperiod) and viability (tetrazolium test). The seeds of both species acquired dormancy after burial in all of the treatments. During the experimental period they demonstrated cycles of acquisition and overcoming of dormancy that were most evident in the treatments involving alterations of the substrate humidity (humid/dry regime) that coincided with the environmental conditions found naturally in the region of origin of the species. The seeds gradually lost dormancy during the dry period and re-acquired it when exposed again to humidity; dormancy would once again be overcome during the subsequent dry period. Burial promoted the acquisition of dormancy in C. bisulcata and S. verticillatus seeds; the lowest temperature tested favoured overcoming dormancy; and varying the humidity regime signalled the acquisition and the overcoming of secondary dormancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSyngonanthus 3aburied seeds 3adormancy 3agermination 3ahumidity 3aphotoperiod 3aprovenance 3asoil temperature 3atetrazolium 3avegetation 3aviability 3aBrazil 0aannual dormancy cycle 0aburied seeds 0acampos rupestres 0aEriocaulaceae 0asecondary dormancy 0aseed bank 0asoil humidity 0asoil temperature1 aGarcia, Queila S.0 tSeed science research.g2015 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.170-178dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl50007x1475-27357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09602585150000453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003100145245013200176300001300308506002800321520141600349592002801765506003701793650001701830650002201847650001201869650001601881650002501897650001301922653001101935653001101946653002201957653001601979653002301995700002402018700002002042700002602062773019502088856008002283852000902363655001202372IND60784653620221207134120.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078465362DNAL7 a10.20886/jwas.v9i1.70432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadjid, Muhammad Iqbal Nur10aLocals’ Claims of Rights and Access to Forest Resources in Three Forest Management Regimes in Gunungkidul Regency, Yogyakarta  ap. 1-12.  aResource is Open Access  aOne of state forest areas managed by three management regimes is Bunder forest area, Gunungkidul, Yogyakarta. Three management regimes are the production forest of KPH Yogyakarta, the conservation forest of Tahura, and the educational forest of KHDTK Wanagama I. The differences of management regimes are thought to affect the actual interaction pattern of villagers with the forest. This research aims to compare the actual rights and access of villagers to Bunder forest area in three management regimes in the hope of finding more effective forest management patterns. This research used a qualitative approach through the case study method of the interaction villagers of Bunder, Banaran, Ngleri, and Gading villages with the surrounding forests. The results show that forest management regimes affects the way villagers can access the forests. The aggregate value of the actual rights received by the villagers to the production forest of KPH Yogyakarta is higher than the educational forest of KHDTK Wanagama I. The lowest is management regimes in conservation forest of Tahura. Based on the access mechanisms that empower villagers, the educational forest regime of KHDTK Wanagama I is higher than the production forest regime of KPH Yogyakarta and the conservation forest regime of Tahura. This research recommends defining rights and access to increase certainty about the benefits of forest resources.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3aforest management 3aforests 3ainformation 3aqualitative analysis 3aresearch 0arights 0aaccess 0aproduction forest 0aforest park 0aeducational forest1 aPermadi, Dwiko Budi1 aWardhana, Wahyu1 aSeptiana, Ratih Madya0 tJurnal Wasian : Wahana Informasi Penelitian Kehutanan (Media for Information in Forestry Research).g2022 June, v. 9, no. 1 p.1-12dBalai Penelitian KehutananwJournal:27850x2502-51987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20886/jwas.v9i1.70433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014100168300001600309520135800325592002801683650002201711650001801733650001901751650000901770650001401779650001301793650001601806650001701822650002401839650001501863650001001878650001401888650001001902653001801912653001801930653002401948653001301972653001601985653002602001653002202027700002502049700002602074700002402100700001902124700002302143773012502166856008202291961001302373852000902386655001202395IND60517621720221117161232.0190801e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051762172DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585150000572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuttle, Keiko M.10aGrain dormancy loss is associated with changes in ABA and GA sensitivity and hormone accumulation in bread wheat, Triticum aestivum (L.)  ap. 179-193.  aKnowledge about the hormonal control of grain dormancy and dormancy loss is essential in wheat, because low grain dormancy at maturity is associated with the problem of pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) when cool and rainy conditions occur before harvest. Low GA (gibberellin A) hormone sensitivity and high ABA (abscisic acid) sensitivity were associated with higher wheat grain dormancy and PHS tolerance. Grains of two PHS-tolerant cultivars were very dormant at maturity, and insensitive to GA stimulation of germination. More PHS-susceptible cultivars were less sensitive to ABA inhibition of germination, and were either more GA sensitive or germinated efficiently without GA at maturity. As grain dormancy was lost through dry afterripening or cold imbibition, grains first gained GA sensitivity and then lost ABA sensitivity. These changes in GA and ABA sensitivity can serve as landmarks defining stages of dormancy loss that cannot be discerned without hormone treatment. These dormancy stages can be used to compare different cultivars, seed lots and studies. Previous work showed that wheat afterripening is associated with decreasing ABA levels in imbibing seeds. Wheat grain dormancy loss through cold imbibition also led to decreased endogenous ABA levels, suggesting that reduced ABA signalling is a general mechanism triggering dormancy loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabscisic acid 3aafter-ripening 3acold 3acultivars 3adormancy 3agermination 3agibberellins 3ahormonal regulation 3aimbibition 3aseeds 3asprouting 3awheat 0aabscisic acid 0aafterripening 0acold stratification 0adormancy 0agibberellin 0apre-harvest sprouting 0aTriticum aestivum1 aMartinez, Shantel A.1 aSchramm, Elizabeth C.1 aTakebayashi, Yumiko1 aSeo, Mitsunori1 aSteber, Camille M.0 tSeed science research.g2015 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.179-193dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl50007x1475-27357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09602585150000573Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245006200199300001600261500002000277520112600297592002801423596003901451650002201490650002101512650002101533650002701554650002601581650002901607650001801636650002101654650001201675650002101687650001101708700001701719700001501736700002001751700006101771700002201832700001401854700002001868700005701888773013201945856007402077852000902151655001202160IND60793487620221123013421.0220916e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079348762DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.136992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl‐Akayleh, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7225-093610aAntimicrobial potential of natural deep eutectic solvents  ap. 607-615.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNatural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) are a new class of green solvents, which can solubilize natural and synthetic chemicals of low water solubility. NADES are mixtures of two or three compounds of hydrogen bond acceptors and hydrogen bond donors. Many NADES’ components are of natural origin and therefore, NADES are presumed to be nontoxic and often exhibit antimicrobial activity. This work aimed to investigate the potential antimicrobial effect of menthol, capric acid and Solutol™, and their associated eutectic system on two Gram‐positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633), two Gram‐negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027) and one fungus (the yeast Candida albicans ATCC 10231). The results obtained showed a stronger antimicrobial effect for the NADES when compared to their individual components and that they exhibit a promising antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and C. albicans and good activity against P. aeruginosa. NADES exhibited no observable antimicrobial activity against spore‐forming B. subtilis.  aPublisher supplied data  a10‐4‐2019cUniversity of Petra 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3adecanoic acid 3ahydrogen bonding 3amenthol 3awater solubility 3ayeasts1 aKhalid, R.M.1 aHawash, D.1 aAl‐Kaissi, E.1 aAl‐Adham, I.S.I1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1639-57401 aAl‐Muhtaseb, N.1 aJaber, N.1 aAl‐Remawi, M.1 aCollier, P.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8529-25480 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2022 Sept., v. 75, no. 3 p.607-615dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.136993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245009100159520102100250592002801271650001801299650002501317650001701342650001201359650001901371650001801390650001701408650002301425650002001448650001201468650002301480650002201503650001301525650002201538650001901560650000901579650001201588650002201600650001601622650001001638651001201648700001601660700002101676773010001697856007901797852000901876655001201885IND60536750920221119021555.0160806s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053675092DNAL7 a10.1155/2012/2954142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNijnik, Maria10aAfforestation for the Provision of Multiple Ecosystem Services: A Ukrainian Case Study  aThis paper presents an economic analysis of the planting of trees on marginal lands in Ukraine for timber production, erosion prevention, and climate mitigation. A methodology combining econometric analysis, simulation modelling, and linear programming to analyse the costs and benefits of such afforestation has been adopted. The research reveals that, at discount rates lower than 2%, establishment of new forests is economically justified in the majority of forestry zones. Incorporating the effects of afforestation on mitigating climate change increases social benefits. However, the results indicate that whilst soil protection benefits to agriculture from afforestation in the Steppe are expected to be high, carbon sequestration and timber production activities in the Steppe are cost inefficient due to low rates of tree growth and relatively high opportunity costs of land. The opportunity costs of land are also high in the Polissja where afforestation is cost inefficient at 2% and higher discount rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adiscount rate 3aeconometrics 3aecosystem services 3aerosion control 3aforests 3alinear programming 3aopportunity costs 3aplanting 3asimulation models 3asocial benefit 3asoil 3asteppes 3atimber production 3atree growth 3atrees 3aUkraine1 aOskam, Arie1 aNijnik, Anatoliy0 tInternational journal of forestry research.g2012, v. 2012dHindawi Pub.

Therefore, in recent decades, a great amount of research has been directed towards the development of lipid enrichment in order to improve larval fish survival and growth. However, in fish, the biochemical and molecular processes related to highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) administration are still poorly understood. In the current study, the false percula clownfish, a short larval phase marine species, was used as an experimental model and the effects of a standard and a HUFAs-enriched diet were tested through a molecular, biochemical, ultrastructural and morphometric approach. Our results support the hypothesis that HUFA administration may improve larval development through the presence of better structured mitochondria, a higher synthesis of energy compounds and coenzymes with a central position in the metabolism, with respect to controls. This higher energy status was confirmed by better growth performance and a shorter larval phase in larvae fed with an enriched diet with respect to the control.

It is found that overall the global water vapor content declined from 2003 to 2012 (slope b = –0.0149, R = 0.893, P = 0.0005). The decreasing trend over the ocean surface (b = –0.0170, R = 0.908, P = 0.0003) is more explicit than that over terrestrial surface (b = –0.0100, R = 0.782, P = 0.0070), more significant over the Northern Hemisphere (b = –0.0175, R = 0.923, P = 0.0001) than that over the Southern Hemisphere (b = –0.0123, R = 0.826, P = 0.0030). In addition, the analytical results indicate that water vapor content are decreasing obviously between latitude of 36°N and 36°S (b = 0.0224, R = 0.892, P = 0.0005), especially between latitude of 0°N and 36°N (b = 0.0263, R = 0.931, P = 0.0001), while the water vapor concentrations are increasing slightly in the Arctic regions (b = 0.0028, R = 0.612, P = 0.0590). The decreasing and spatial variation of water vapor content regulates the effects of carbon dioxide which is the main reason of the trend in global surface temperatures becoming nearly flat since the late 1990s. The spatio-temporal variations of water vapor content also affect the growth and spatial distribution of global vegetation which also regulates the global surface temperature change, and the climate change is mainly caused by the earth’s orbit position in the solar and galaxy system. A big data model based on gravitational-magmatic change with the solar or the galactic system is proposed to be built for analyzing how the earth’s orbit position in the solar and galaxy system affects spatio-temporal variations of global water vapor content, vegetation and temperature at large spatio-temporal scale. This comprehensive examination of water vapor changes promises a holistic understanding of the global climate change and potential underlying mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth atmosphere 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3ahydrology 3aimage analysis 3alatitude 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aspatial variation 3asurface temperature 3atemporal variation 3avegetation 3awater vapor 3aArctic region1 aChen, Jingming1 aLi, Zhaoliang1 aMa, Ying1 aSong, Yang1 aTan, Xuelan1 aYang, Kaixian0 tChinese geographical science.g2017 Feb., v. 27, no. 1 p.1-7dScience Pressx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-017-0841-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245006200176300001400238520110900252592002801361650000901389650001201398650001801410650000901428650002301437650002001460650001201480653001201492653001201504653001601516653001401532653001201546700002301558773010901581856008701690852000901777655001201786IND60525684120221118124936.0190318e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052568412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendenhall, Heather10aProtein content affects caramel processing and properties  ap. 58-68.  aIncreasing protein content is desirable in caramel, although the heating process during cooking sometimes leads to excessive protein aggregation, or “protein grain”. Caramels formulated from 0% to 7% protein were cooked to 10% moisture, using either increased cooking rate or holding time at 88 °C. Protein aggregation was significantly enhanced at higher protein contents, increased cooking rates or shorter holding times at 88 °C. Increasing protein significantly decreased cold flow and produced harder, tougher caramels. Rapid cooking resulted in significantly harder, tougher and shorter caramels, with greater effects at higher protein content, while slower cooking produced softer, stretchier caramels. Protein aggregation may have been responsible for textural differences observed between cooking methods: caramels with smaller aggregates were significantly softer than those that had large aggregates. Extent of protein aggregation had no effect on cold flow. Tensile testing suggested that protein aggregates disrupt the continuous phase of caramels, shortening and toughening texture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acooking 3agrain protein 3aheat 3aprotein aggregates 3aprotein content 3atexture 0aCaramel 0aProtein 0aAggregation 0aCold flow 0aTexture1 aHartel, Richard W.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2016 Oct., v. 186 p.58-68dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245007600168300001400244520251700258592002802775650001302803650002002816650001002836650001802846650000902864650002302873650002202896650002202918650001902940650001002959650001902969650001902988650001503007653002603022653002303048653001803071653001203089700005703101700001503158700001603173773008103189856008603270852000903356655001203365IND60561114920221120183055.0170719e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056111492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hong10aSand transportation and reverse patterns over leeward face of sand dune  ap. 41-47.  aSand saltation has complex interactions with turbulent flow and dune form. Most models of wind-blown sand consider ideal circumstances such as steady wind velocity and a flat surface, and the bulk of data on wind flow and sand transport over an individual dune has focused mostly on the influence of dune shape or inter-dune space on the wind flow, neglecting the effect of morphology on sand saltation, particularly airflow and sand transportation over the leeward slope. Wind flow structures over the leeward slope of sand dunes have a fundamental influence on the organization of sand dunes. In order to understand sand dune dynamics, lee face airflow and sediment transportation should be paid more attention. Previous field observations could not measure turbulent flow structure well because of the limited observation points and the influence of experiment structure on wind field. In addition, the reverse sand particles over leeward face could not be collected by sand trap in field. Numerous field observations could not measure turbulent flow structure because of the limited observation points and the influence of experimental structures on the wind field. In addition, the reverse transport of sand particles over leeward face could not be collected by sand traps in field. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the turbulent flow structure and sand transport pattern over the leeward slope. A numerical model of sand saltation over slope terrain is constructed, which also considers the coupling effects between air flow and sand particles. The large eddy simulation method is used to model turbulent flow. Sand transport is simulated by tracking the trajectory of each sand particle. The results show that terrain significantly alters the turbulent air flow structure and wind-blown sand movement, especially over the leeward slope. Here, mass flux increases initially and then decreases with height in the reversed flow region in the direction of wind flow, and the mass flux decreases with height in the reversed direction. The height of 0.5H is the height of vortex core in the reversed flow region. The vortex core is a critical point in the flow region where few particles are transited. In the reversed region, the reversed mass flux of sand particles is 25% of the mass flux in the flow direction. This research may contribute to scientific understanding of the mechanisms of sand motion and wind flow over leeward of dune and it is likely to be significant in desertification control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3adesertification 3adunes 3amass transfer 3asand 3asediment transport 3asimulation models 3atopographic slope 3atransportation 3atraps 3aturbulent flow 3awind direction 3awind speed 0aLarge eddy simulation 0aDiscrete particles 0aSlope terrain 0aLeeward1 aDun, Hongchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0453-56651 aTong, Ding1 aHuang, Ning0 tGeomorphology.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 283 p.41-47dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013300171300001600304520161700320592002801937650002201965650001601987650002302003650002202026650002402048650002602072650001002098650001202108650002202120650002002142650001702162650001602179650002202195650001202217651001302229651001102242700001802253773012302271856008102394852000902475655001202484IND60572318320221118045607.0170717e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057231832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-017-9959-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Erlane José10aImpacts of oil palm plantations on changes in environmental heterogeneity and Heteroptera (Gerromorpha and Nepomorpha) diversity  ap. 111-119.  aThis study evaluates the effects of oil palm plantations on environmental heterogeneity and diversity (α and β) of aquatic Heteroptera (semi-aquatic and aquatic species) in Amazon streams. We assessed eight streams located in forested areas and 12 in oil palm plantations. As expected, oil palm areas had lower environmental heterogeneity, despite the presence of riparian vegetation. Heteropteran communities differed in forest and oil palm areas, however, only semi-aquatic bugs were affected by environmental variables. Streams in oil palm plantations had lower α-diversity and distinct community structures when compared to forest sites. Oil palm plantation did not affect the β-diversity of semi-aquatic bugs, however, there was increased β-diversity of aquatic bugs in these areas. These results reflect the impacts of environmental heterogeneity generated by plantations next to riparian vegetation, inducing local diversity loss. Effects on β-diversity differed among groups of Heteroptera, mainly due to the differences in the life histories of each group. Semi-aquatic bugs seem to undergo environmental filtering, while aquatic bugs can be structured by limiting similarity. Thus, the management and land conservation strategies adopted to preserve ecosystems within oil palm plantations were insufficient for the protection of aquatic heteropteran communities. In summary, such conservation policies should account for the particularities of different groups of the aquatic ecosystem; especially for aquatic fauna, which are usually overlooked in conservation policies for the Brazilian Amazon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aHeteroptera 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic organisms 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland management 3alife history 3aplantations 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aJuen, Leandro0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2017 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.111-119dSpringer International Publishingx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-017-9959-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245005500166300001600221520127500237592002801512650001601540650001101556650001701567650001401584650001801598650001101616650001601627650001401643650001101657650001101668650001701679650001601696700001701712700001701729700002401746700002301770773011301793856008201906852000901988655001201997IND60083529620221120115932.0141101e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008352962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugustine, S.10aDevelopmental energetics of zebrafish, Danio rerio  ap. 275-283.  aUsing zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a case study, we show that the maturity concept of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory is a useful metric for developmental state. Maturity does not depend on food or temperature contrary to age and to some extent length. We compile the maturity levels for each developmental milestone recorded in staging atlases. The analysis of feeding, growth, reproduction and aging patterns throughout the embryo, juvenile and adult life stages are well-captured by a simple extension of the standard DEB model and reveals that embryo development is slow relative to adults. A threefold acceleration of development occurs during the larval period. Moreover we demonstrate that growth and reproduction depend on food in predictable ways and their simultaneous observation is necessary to estimate parameters. We used data on diverse aspects of the energy budget simultaneously for parameter estimation using the covariation method. The lowest mean food intake level to initiate reproduction was found to be as high as 0.6 times the maximum level. The digestion efficiency for Tetramin™ was around 0.5, growth efficiency was just 0.7 and the value for the allocation fraction to soma (0.44) was close to the one that maximizes ultimate reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3acase studies 3adigestion 3aembryogenesis 3aenergy 3afood intake 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amodels 3areproduction 3atemperature1 aGagnaire, B.1 aFloriani, M.1 aAdam-Guillermin, C.1 aKooijman, S.A.L.M.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2011 July, v. 159, no. 3 p.275-283dElsevier Inc.x1095-64337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04216naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245016200169500001900331520265500350592002803005650002103033650001903054650001603073650001903089650002803108650001303136650001203149650002803161650000703189650001903196650001503215650001703230650002503247650001603272653002903288653001503317653002703332653002603359653002103385653001203406700002603418700002103444700003403465773013003499856008403629852000903713655001203722IND60653863920221121043924.0190801e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065386392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2019.1021952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYildiz, Semanur10aIdentification of equivalent processing conditions for pasteurization of strawberry juice by high pressure, ultrasound, and pulsed electric fields processing  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of high pressure processing (HPP), ultrasound (US) and pulsed electric fields (PEF) for the pasteurization of strawberry juice (SJ). Acid-adapted Escherichia coli was used to inoculate SJ prior to treatment with HPP, US, and PEF. HPP was applied at several pressures (200–400 MPa) up to 2 min while US (120 μm, 24 kHz) was conducted at 25, 40, and 55 °C up to 10 min in continuous pulsing mode. In order to avoid excessive use of SJ, PEF was performed using a model solution (MS) basically composed of citric acid (8 g/L), fructose (35 g/L), glucose (35 g/L), Na2HPO4 (0.2 M) and NaCl (5%) to simulate the SJ electrical conductivity, pH, and total soluble solid (TSS). A face-centered composite design was conducted for PEF processing at different electric field intensities (EFI) (25–35 kV/cm) and treatment times (5–27 μs). Processing conditions were selected that resulted in 5-log CFU/mL inactivation of E. coli. HPP at 300 MPa for 1 min, and US at 55 °C (thermosonication) for 3 min reduced E. coli in SJ by 5.75 ± 0.52 and 5.69 ± 0.61 log CFU/mL, respectively. PEF treatment at 35 kV/cm, 27 μs treatment time, 350 mL/min flow rate, and 2 μs pulse width in monopolar mode resulted in 5.53 ± 0.00 log reduction of E. coli in MS. Likewise, E. coli population in SJ was also reduced by 5.16 ± 0.15 log after applying the same PEF conditions to SJ. No E. coli was detected in SJ subjected to conventional thermal pasteurization at 72 °C for 15 s. All technologies reduced the natural microbiota below 2 log CFU/mL in terms of the total aerobic bacteria and yeast-mold counts. Thus, this study identified the equivalent conditions for the SJ pasteurization by three nonthermal processing technologies.Consumers have an increasing interest towards fresh-like food products with desirable nutritional and sensorial attributes. High pressure, ultrasound and pulsed electric field are three relevant novel nonthermal technologies as alternatives to conventional thermal treatments. This study identified the processing conditions of these three nonthermal technologies for the pasteurization of strawberry juice based on equivalent inactivation of acid-adapted E. coli. From an industrial point of view, the established processing conditions are useful references for the development of novel berry juices. In addition to microbiological safety, this study on equivalent processing allows direct efficacy and quality comparisons of a given juice pasteurized by the three nonthermal technologies under consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacid tolerance 3acitric acid 3aelectric field 3aelectrical conductivity 3afructose 3aglucose 3amicrobiological quality 3apH 3apasteurization 3asonication 3astrawberries 3atotal soluble solids 3aultrasonics 0aHigh pressure processing 0aUltrasound 0aPulsed electric fields 0aEquivalent processing 0aStrawberry juice 0aE. coli1 aPokhrel, Prashant Raj1 aUnluturk, Sevcan1 aBarbosa-Cánovas, Gustavo V.,0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2019 Oct., v. 57 p.102195-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2019.1021953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013300154300001600287500002000303520105400323592002801377650002501405650001201430650001801442650000901460650001601469650001601485650001701501650001101518650001701529650001401546700001601560700002001576700006101596773013201657856007401789852000901863655001201872IND60793487820221123013516.0220916e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079348782DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.137962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabibi, P.10aEffects of free and nano‐encapsulated bovine lactoferrin on the viability and acid production by Streptococcus mutans biofilms  ap. 689-698.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTooth decay is one of the most common diseases that humans face during their lifetime. Streptococcus mutans is one of the most critical factors of early tooth decay. These bacteria may produce biofilms in the mouth, which are more resistant to antimicrobial agents. Streptococcus mutans may also demineralize tooth enamel by producing lactic acid. In this study, the effect of nanoliposomes containing lactoferrin at three different concentrations (1·5, 3 and 6 mg ml⁻¹) on the biofilm formed by S. mutans was investigated. Nanoliposomes were prepared using the thin‐layer hydration method. An active attachment model was used to evaluate biofilm and lactic acid production. The results showed that nano‐encapsulated lactoferrin could reduce CFU of biofilm more effectively than free lactoferrin. Lactoferrin‐containing nanoliposomes also significantly reduced lactic acid production by S. mutans. Therefore, nano‐encapsulated lactoferrin may be used along with other dental caries control methods to increase anti‐caries efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus mutans 3abiofilm 3adental caries 3aface 3alactic acid 3alactoferrin 3amicrobiology 3amodels 3atooth enamel 3aviability1 aYazdi, F.T.1 aMortazavi, S.A.1 aFarajollahi, M.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3916-43900 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2022 Sept., v. 75, no. 3 p.689-698dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.137963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100005400141245008400195500001900279500001300298520139800311592002801709650001701737650001201754650002201766650002101788650001201809650001501821650001501836650001501851651001001866700001601876700001701892700001601909710005701925710006301982773010002045856007902145852000902224655001202233IND60536751220221119021415.0160806s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053675122DNAL7 a10.1155/2013/3963452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jinzhuo1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2081-765412aA Review of Forest Resources and Forest Biodiversity Evaluation System in China  a2012BAC01B03-3  a71271210  aChina is a country rich in diverse forest ecosystems due to the large span of the country, complex topography, and multiple climate regimes. In this paper, the basic information of forest resources in China was briefly introduced and the current state in the measurements of forest biodiversity and the establishment of forest biodiversity index systems in related studies were reviewed. The results showed that a lot of studies on forest biodiversity have been conducted mostly at landscape or stand level in China and the commonly used biodiversity indicators were identified and compared. Several comprehensive forest biodiversity index systems were proposed. However, there are still some problems during the construction of forest biodiversity assessment system. Due to the late establishment of biodiversity monitoring system in China, the availability of data that could be included in a forest biodiversity index system is limited, which hurdles the precise assessment of forest biodiversity. It is suggested to develop long-term monitoring stations and keep data recording consistently. Concerns should also be given to the construction of the framework of the forest biodiversity index system and the determination of the indicators’ weight. The results will provide reference for the establishment of national or regional forest biodiversity evaluation indicator systems in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest resources 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3atopography 3aChina1 aLin, Wenshu1 aPeng, Xuanyi1 aLiu, Weiguo2 aNational Key Technology R&D Program of ChinaeFunder2 aGuo jia zi ran ke xue ji jin wei yuan hui (China),eFunder0 tInternational journal of forestry research.g2013, v. 2013dHindawi Pub.

Our experimental model is a transparent Hele-Shaw cell, 0.5mm of aperture. A saline solution is injected locally representing the point-source pollution. A Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) method provides concentration measurement of the pollution plume. Two propagation patterns have been observed: one and two-finger plumes. If the upper part of the plume is stable over time regardless of the second configuration, the moment when the plume separates into two fingers is highly dependent on both injection flow-rate and contaminant concentration. To further investigate the dispersion process inside the fracture, experimental results are interpreted by the spatial and time moment methods. Resulting dispersivities and plume propagation mean velocity are compared to theoretical values derived from a modified Taylor-Aris dispersion tensor. The longitudinal macro-dispersion obtained suggests an asymptotical behavior of the plume spread regardless of the studied configurations. Experimental local dispersivities derived from time and space moments proved to be close at large times to theoretical values predicted by the density-dependent dispersion tensor (Oltéan et al., 2004). Based on those observations the mechanism behind the separation of the plume into two fingers is believed to be significantly impacted by the pre-asymptotic behavior of the dispersion tensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3adispersions 3afluorescence 3alasers 3amodels 3apollution 3aspace and time 2aFluorescence 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aGravitation 2aKinetics 2aLasers 2aModels, Chemical 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry1 aGolfier, F.1 aOltéan, C.1 aBuès, M.A.0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2012 May 1, v. 132 p.12-27dElsevier B.V.x0169-77227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2012.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008500169520104200254592002801296650001501324650001901339650001901358650000901377650002301386653001601409653000801425653001201433653001501445700001801460700001801478773009401496856008601590852000901676655001201685IND60682345020221120230549.0200228e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068234502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1080642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuedt, Chiara10aQuantification of surface iridescence in meat products by digital image analysis  aIridescence extent is commonly evaluated by sensory analysis but it is a time-consuming and cost-intensive method. A low-cost, rapid and objective alternative is digital image analysis. Here we report the development of an image analysis method for quantification of iridescence in meat products. Two segmentation techniques (global thresholding and k-means clustering algorithm) were tested for their capability to divide images into segments of iridescent and non-iridescent areas. Images segmented using k-means clustering algorithm resulted in slightly higher iridescent areas than images segmented with global thresholding (mean difference of 1.24%) but no significant difference (P > .05) between the iridescent areas calculated by both methods was observed. Almost perfect agreement (κ = 0.800, p = .001) was observed between the image analysis and the visual evaluation. The results from this study showed that digital image analysis is an effective tool for evaluating surface iridescence in meat and meat products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adigital images 3aimage analysis 3ameat 3asensory evaluation 0aIridescence 0aHam 0aQuality 0aMeat color1 aGibis, Monika1 aWeiss, Jochen0 tMeat science.g2020 May, v. 163 p.108064-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1080643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245012400206520101400330592002801344650002901372650003001401650003401431650002001465650002201485650001901507653002101526653002801547653002901575653002201604700001501626700001701641700002001658700001801678700001801696700001901714700005301733700001601786773011201802856008501914852000901999655001202008IND60763967620221120165345.0220531e20220405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076396762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1202882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Haiyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1703-634410aBipolar membrane-assisted reverse electrodialysis for high power density energy conversion via acid-base neutralization  aEnergy conversion from waste acid and base can be realized by reverse electrodialysis with the acid-base neutralization (REDn). However, poor energy conversion performances, such as the low voltage and the low power density (<0.5 W/m²), caused by the high resistance and the low voltage of cell pair of “anion-exchange membrane (AEM) + neutral compartment + cation-exchange membrane (CEM)” in REDn stack, need to be improved as far as possible. In this study, bipolar membranes, which is of a low resistance of 5.05 Ω cm² at 1.0 mol/L acid-base and a voltage of 0.778 V at ΔpH = 14, are utilized to replace the cell pairs of “AEM + neutral compartment + CEM” in REDn stack, to constitute a bipolar membrane reverse electrodialysis (BMRED) stack. Hence, high voltage, high current density and high power density (7.8 W/m²) are achieved in the BMRED process, indicating that BPM can efficiently assist reverse electrodialysis for energy conversion from the acid-base neutralization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion-exchange membranes 3acation-exchange membranes 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodialysis 3aenergy conversion 3aneutralization 0aBipolar membrane 0aReverse electrodialysis 0aAcid-base neutralization 0aEnergy conversion1 aPeng, Kang1 aYan, Junying1 aJiang, Chenxiao1 aWang, Yaoming1 aFeng, Hongyan1 aYang, Zhengjin1 aWu, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8377-58341 aXu, Tongwen0 tJournal of membrane science.g2022 Apr. 05, v. 647 p.120288-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1202883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100001300185245010500198300001500303520196000318592002802278650001602306650002502322650001202347650001302359650002302372650001602395650001702411650001802428650001502446650001802461650002402479650002202503650002002525650001302545650001402558650002002572650001602592650001102608650001102619700001702630700001702647700002302664700002102687700002202708773011102730856008102841990002302922852000902945655001202954IND60093524820221119102052.0141103e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009352482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2013.09.0042doi7 a10.1016/j.ces.2013.09.0042chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meng12aA spray reactor concept for catalytic oxidation of p-xylene to produce high-purity terephthalic acid  ap. 93-102.  aA spray reactor in which the liquid phase containing dissolved p-xylene (pX) and the catalyst is dispersed as fine droplets by a nozzle into a continuous vapor phase containing the oxidant (O₂) is shown to produce high-purity terephthalic acid (TPA) with less than 25ppm 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA) in the solid TPA product. In sharp contrast, the solid TPA product obtained from a conventional stirred reactor similar to the configuration used in the conventional Mid-Century (MC) process contains nearly 1000ppm 4-CBA even though the reactor is operated at similar pressure and temperature (15bar and 200°C) but with the gas phase dispersed into the liquid phase. The dramatic improvement in TPA product quality during spray reactor operation is attributed to two main factors: the alleviation of interphase gas–liquid mass transfer limitations that facilitates more complete oxidation of the pX and the intermediate oxidation products to TPA, and reduced backmixing that enhances the oxidation rates. Theoretical calculations show that the time constants for O₂ diffusion in typical spray droplets (50μm diameter) is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than the kinetic rate constant confirming complete O₂ penetration and saturation of the droplets. Further, the usage of CO₂ as an inert gas and the dominance of acetic acid (>50mol.%) in the vapor phase under reaction conditions create an environment that falls outside of the flammability envelope. Mathematical modeling of the stirred reactor using MC process conditions accurately predicts the steady state temperatures observed in industrial reactors. The model also clearly divulges that the cooling provided by partial evaporation of the acetic acid solvent is vital to maintain stable steady state operation. By eliminating the need for a hydrogenation step, the spray reactor has the potential to not only reduce capital and operating costs but also provide environmental benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3achemical engineering 3acooling 3adroplets 3aecosystem services 3aevaporation 3aflammability 3ahydrogenation 3ainterphase 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3aoperating capital 3aoperating costs 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aproduct quality 3atemperature 3avapors 3axylene1 aNiu, Fenghui1 aZuo, Xiaobin1 aMetelski, Peter D.1 aBusch, Daryle H.1 aSubramaniam, Bala0 tChemical engineering science.g2013 Dec. 18, v. 104 p.93-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:26771x0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2013.09.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245013500169520201100304592002802315650002502343650002602368650001502394650001602409650002502425650001502450650002302465650001202488650000902500650001502509650002002524650002002544650001002564650002902574650001402603650002202617650002302639650001102662653002202673653002502695653001702720653001302737700001802750700001902768700001902787700001702806700001802823700001902841773009902860856009002959852000903049655001203058IND60782599820221120041018.0221004e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078259982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7385992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yan10aEffects of chronic alkalinity stress on immune response in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) infected with Aeromonas hydrophila  aUnder suitable environmental conditions, fish have a functional immune system and are therefore expected to have high disease resistance, growth rate and reproductive activity. To explore the effects of chronic alkalinity stress on the immune response in Nile tilapia, tilapia (291.1 ± 47.2 g) were exposed to 10 mmol/L and 30 mmol/L of sodium bicarbonate alkaline water (AW). At 31 d of alkalinity stress, the fish were infected by Aeromonas hydrophila and the cumulative mortality was calculated within 7 d. The immune-related indexes of peripheral blood cells, enzyme activities (Lys, Alp, C3 and IgM) and gene expression (tlr5, il-1β and γ-ifn) in the liver, spleen and gill of Nile tilapia were assessed at 1 and 31 d of alkalinity stress and 1 and 7 d post-infection. The results showed that: 1) the cumulative mortality of tilapia in 10 mmol/L AW was 26.7%, which was significantly lower than 66.7% in 30 mmol/L AW and 51.11% in freshwater (FW); 2) At 1 d post-infection, the respiratory burst and lymphocyte proliferation rates at 10 mmol/L AW were higher than at 30 mmol/L AW and FW; 3) Alp activity at 10 mmol/L AW was higher than at 30 mmol/L AW in the liver and spleen after infection; 4) At 31 d of alkalinity stress and 7 d post-infection, the tlr5 mRNA expression level in the liver and spleen at 10 mmol/L AW was higher than at 30 mmol/L AW and FW. At 7 d post-infection, the γ-ifn mRNA expression level in the gill of tilapia in 10 mmol/L AW was higher than in 30 mmol/L AW and FW. The il-1β mRNA expression level at 30 mmol/L AW was significantly higher than at 10 mmol/L AW at most time points in the spleen and gill; 5) At 7 d post-infection, the activities or expression level of Lys, Alp, C3, IgM, tlr5 and γ-ifn in the spleen of tilapia in 30 mmol/L AW were lower than in 10 mmol/L AW and FW. The above results showed that long-term feeding of Nile tilapia in 10 mmol/L carbonate AW can promote immune function and reduce mortality from bacterial infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aalkalinity 3aaquaculture 3abacterial infections 3acarbonates 3adisease resistance 3aenzymes 3afish 3afreshwater 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3aliver 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amortality 3arespiratory burst 3asodium bicarbonate 3aspleen 0aAlkalinity stress 0aAeromonas hydrophila 0aNile tilapia 0aImmunity1 aWang, Yanling1 aSong, Lingyuan1 aLi, Shuaishuai1 aChen, Xiaowu1 aTang, Shoujie1 aZhao, Jinliang0 tAquaculture.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 561 p.738599-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7385993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009700170520138100267592002801648650001301676650002301689650000901712650001601721650001801737650001001755650001301765650001701778650001001795650002101805650001701826650002001843650001401863650001001877650001101887650001301898650001001911650000901921650001801930650001501948700002101963700002601984700002502010700003302035700002802068700003002096773012202126856008102248852000902329655001202338IND60702044420221123033313.0200717e20200221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070204442DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100203072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsper Neto, Michel 10aInitial Development of Corn Seedlings after Seed Priming with Nanoscale Synthetic Zinc Oxide  aNanofertilizers are increasingly explored for sustainable micronutrient delivery in agriculture. Pre-treating seeds with nanofertilizers prior to planting (i.e., seed priming) reduces concerns about nanoparticle (NP) fertilizer non-target dispersion; however, priming formulations and concentrations must be carefully selected to avoid germination inhibition and toxicity. Here we investigate changes in corn seed germination and seedling development after seed priming with ZnO NPs, ZnO bulk and ZnCl₂. To evaluate the effects sterile seeds were immersed in priming solutions of 0, 20, 40, 80, 160 mg L⁻¹ Zn for the three Zn sources. Following an 8 h priming the seeds were evaluated for germination and vigor for 5 days on germination paper. Root and shoot lengths were measured as well as fresh and dry biomass. Compared to the control, the ZnO NP and ZnCl₂ seed priming promoted beneficial effects. ZnO NP seed-priming exhibited a concentration dependent profile in improving seedling growth, with greatest benefit around 80 mg L⁻¹, providing 17%, 25% and 12% higher values than control for germination, root length, and dry biomass production, respectively. In contrast, seeds primed with bulk ZnO did not differ from the control. These findings support NP-seed priming as an alternative to delivery of essential micronutrients, such as zinc, to corn seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3abiomass production 3acorn 3afertilizers 3ananoparticles 3apaper 3aplanting 3apretreatment 3aroots 3aseed germination 3aseed priming 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 3atoxicity 3avigor 3azinc 3azinc chloride 3azinc oxide1 aBritt, David W.,1 aLara, Lorena  Moreira1 aCartwright, Anthony 1 ados Santos, Rayssa  Fernanda1 aInoue, Tadeu  Takeyoshi1 aBatista, Marcelo  Augusto0 tAgronomy.g2020 Feb. 21, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100203073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003300155245008900188300001400277520210200291592002802393650002002421650001502441650002302456650001202479650002402491650003602515650001102551650001502562650002302577650002402600650001802624650001002642650001602652650001202668653001702680653002802697653002302725653002302748653002302771700006002794700002102854700001902875700001602894700002002910773012802930856009003058852000903148655001203157IND60525508520221119085646.0190318e20160616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052550852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantillana Farakos, Sofia M.10aModeling the survival kinetics of Salmonella in tree nuts for use in risk assessment  ap. 41-50.  aSalmonella has been shown to survive in tree nuts over long periods of time. This survival capacity and its variability are key elements for risk assessment of Salmonella in tree nuts. The aim of this study was to develop a mathematical model to predict survival of Salmonella in tree nuts at ambient storage temperatures that considers variability and uncertainty separately and can easily be incorporated into a risk assessment model. Data on Salmonella survival on raw almonds, pecans, pistachios and walnuts were collected from the peer reviewed literature. The Weibull model was chosen as the baseline model and various fixed effect and mixed effect models were fit to the data. The best model identified through statistical analysis testing was then used to develop a hierarchical Bayesian model. Salmonella in tree nuts showed slow declines at temperatures ranging from 21°C to 24°C. A high degree of variability in survival was observed across tree nut studies reported in the literature. Statistical analysis results indicated that the best applicable model was a mixed effect model that included a fixed and random variation of δ per tree nut (which is the time it takes for the first log10 reduction) and a fixed variation of ρ per tree nut (parameter which defines the shape of the curve). Higher estimated survival rates (δ) were obtained for Salmonella on pistachios, followed in decreasing order by pecans, almonds and walnuts. The posterior distributions obtained from Bayesian inference were used to estimate the variability in the log10 decrease levels in survival for each tree nut, and the uncertainty of these estimates. These modeled uncertainty and variability distributions of the estimates can be used to obtain a complete exposure assessment of Salmonella in tree nuts when including time–temperature parameters for storage and consumption data. The statistical approach presented in this study may be applied to any studies that aim to develop predictive models to be implemented in a probabilistic exposure assessment or a quantitative microbial risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aSalmonella 3aWeibull statistics 3aalmonds 3aexposure assessment 3amicrobiological risk assessment 3apecans 3apistachios 3astatistical models 3astorage temperature 3asurvival rate 3atrees 3auncertainty 3awalnuts 0aLow moisture 0aPredictive microbiology 0aFixed effect model 0aMixed effect model 0aBayesian inference1 aPouillot, Régis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6107-52121 aAnderson, Nathan1 aJohnson, Rhoma1 aSon, Insook1 aVan Doren, Jane0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2016 June 16, v. 227 p.41-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001400147245014700161300001600308500000900324520153900333592002801872650001701900650002101917650002001938650001601958650001601974650001701990650000902007650003002016650002802046650002602074650000902100650000902109650001302118700001602131700001902147700001402166700001402180700001402194700001702208700001802225700001202243700001502255773013102270852000902401856008402410655001202494IND4462855420221119023734.0190912e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446285542DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2009.09.05442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDufey, I.10aMultienvironment Quantitative Trait Loci Mapping and Consistency across Environments of Resistance Mechanisms to Ferrous Iron Toxicity in Rice  ap. 539-550.  aepub  aLowland rice (L.) is often affected by iron toxicity, which may lead to yield losses. One important constraint in the study of the inheritance of resistance strategies to this stress is the inconsistency of gene expression across different environments. This study aimed to determine the stability of quantitative trait loci (QTL) across several environments. Quantitative trait loci mapping for traits related to resistance mechanisms had been previously performed using 164 recombinant inbred lines derived from ‘Azucena’ and ‘IR64’ screened in hydroponics in a phytotron. In the present study, this population was tested under excessive ferrous iron conditions in three additional environments: in hydroponics in a greenhouse, on washed sand, and in the field. Altogether, 44 putative QTL were identified in the four single QTL analyses for morphological, physiological, and agronomic traits. From these 44 QTL, 20 were found in overlapping regions for the same or related traits in different environments, identifying six genomic regions of great interest for the inheritance of resistance to iron toxicity. Quantitative trait loci stability across environments was also checked by performing a joint QTL analysis, which confirmed the position of nine QTL previously found in the same or adjacent regions by at least one single analysis. Combining both single and joint analyses helps in separating QTL specific to a particular environment from generally expressed ones thus is more suitable for marker-assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aagronomic traits 3agene expression 3agreenhouses 3ahydroponics 3ainbred lines 3airon 3amarker-assisted selection 3aquantitative trait loci 3aresistance mechanisms 3arice 3asand 3atoxicity1 aHiel, M.-P.1 aHakizimana, P.1 aDraye, X.1 aLutts, S.1 aKoné, B.1 aDramé, K.N.1 aKonaté, K.A.1 aSie, M.1 aBertin, P.0 tCrop science.g2012 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.539-550dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2009.09.05443Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02384naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012500171300001800296520080200314592002801116650002001144650002401164650001401188650001201202650001101214650002001225650001101245650001701256650002301273650001501296650001301311650001401324650001801338653002601356653002401382653001601406653003001422653002301452653001801475700001601493700001501509700001701524700001501541700001601556700001601572700001501588700001501603773013001618856008501748852000901833655001201842IND60530926520171220000000.0160723e20160606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053092652DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b001512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaporgno, M.

Over the last decade, the study of the impact of insect meal-based diets on growth performance and voluntary feed intake of several fish species has emerged, but little is known about their influence on anorexigenic potential. This is the first study evaluating short- and mid-term responses of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) fed diets not only with partial, but also with total fishmeal (FM) replacement by defatted Tenebrio molitor larvae meal (dTM). A fishmeal-based diet was used as a control (CTRL) and two other diets were formulated to include 20% and 40% of dTM, replacing 50% and 100% of fishmeal (FM), respectively. The short-term response was evaluated after the first exposure to the experimental diets, whereas the mid-term response was evaluated after 7 days of feeding. In both short- and mid-term trials, food intake was registered. Hepatic and plasmatic metabolites and the expression of hypothalamic and telencephalic neuropeptides involved in food intake were assessed 2 and 24 h post-feeding. No differences occurred in food intake levels, neither in the short- nor mid-term. In the short-term, plasmatic glucose levels increased in fish fed TM100, regardless post-feeding sampling time. In the mid-term, fish fed TM100 had the highest levels of triglycerides in liver and the lowest levels of α-amino-acids in plasma, irrespective of post-feeding sampling time. At central level, dietary treatment did not alter the expression of neuropeptide Y (npy), agouti-related protein 2 (agrp2), pro-opio melanocortin a (pomca) or cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript 2 (cartpt2) in hypothalamus and telencephalon. The obtained results suggest that partial and total FM replacement by dTM does not influence short- and mid-term regulation of food intake in European sea bass. Nonetheless, changes observed in hepatic and plasmatic metabolite levels of fish fed TM100 may indicate alterations of intermediary metabolism in the long-term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aTenebrio molitor 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture feeds 3afish 3afish meal 3afood intake 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3ahypothalamus 3ainsects 3aliver 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aneuropeptide Y 3anutritional intervention 3avoluntary intake 0aAgRP/NPY 0aAppetite 0aAquafeeds 0aInsect meal 0aPOMC/CART1 aValente, Luisa M.P.1 aSoengas, José L.1 aConde-Sieira, Marta0 tAquaculture.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 560 p.738604-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7386043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245003800166300001600204520145100220592002801671650002601699650001201725650001101737650001401748650001801762650000901780650001101789650002001800650001101820650001101831651001501842700002501857700001701882773008901899856004801988852000902036655001202045IND50069742820221121023415.0131017e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006974282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-013-1510-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPower, Mary E.10aFood webs in Mediterranean rivers  ap. 119-136.  aRiver food webs are subject to two regimes of longitudinally varying ecological control: productivity and disturbance. Light-limited productivity increases as channels widen downstream. Time windows for growth, however, shrink as discharge increases, substrate particle size decreases, and the frequency of flood-driven bed mobilization increases downstream. Mediterranean rivers are periodically reset by hydrologic events with somewhat predictable timing. Typically, a rainy winter with high river discharge is followed by summer drought with little or no rainfall and slowly declining river flow. The magnitude and timing of winter floods and severity of subsequent summer drought can vary considerably from year to year, however. Episodic scouring floods or prolonged periods of drought are experienced as disturbances, stressors, or opportunities by river biota. The timing, duration, and intensity of these hydrologic controls affect performances of individuals, distribution and abundances of populations, and outcomes and consequences of species interactions. These interactions in turn determine how river food webs will assemble, develop, and reconfigure after disturbance. We discuss how spatial variation in solar radiation and spatial and temporal variations in disturbance affects river food webs under Mediterranean climate seasonality, focusing primarily on long-term observations in the Eel River of northwestern California, USA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3adrought 3afloods 3afood webs 3aparticle size 3arain 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3awinter 3aCalifornia1 aHolomuzki, Joseph R.1 aLowe, Rex L.0 tHydrobiologia.g2013 Nov., v. 719, no. 1 p.119-136dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1510-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009100167300001600258520127800274592002801552653002201580653001301602653001401615773010401629856008401733852000901817655001201826IND60589720820221121231854.0180224e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058972082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mineng.2017.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuast, Keith10aDirect measurement of oleate adsorption on hematite and its consequences for flotation  ap. 122-132.  aThe direct measurement of adsorbed oleate onto hematite removes the uncertainty of depletion of oleate onto non-hematite surfaces. Direct measurement of oleate onto hematite at pH 4 and as a function of pH at constant oleate addition was made using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Oleate adsorption measurements were conducted on conditioned, concentrate and tailing samples, corrected for their surface areas. Adsorption measurements were complemented by flotation tests. At pH 4, oleate adsorption on conditioned samples reached a complete monolayer by vertical orientation at the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the oleate. The onset of multilayer adsorption by vertical orientation on the concentrate samples was determined at the CMC, and monolayer coverage on the non-floated material was always less than one monolayer under two-point and vertical oleate orientation. Flotation recovery of hematite at pH 4 remained high under equilibrium oleate concentrations above the critical hemi-micelle concentration of oleate. Oleate adsorption on hematite as a function of pH showed maxima at pH 4 and 9, suggesting co-adsorption of molecular and ionic oleate species at pH 4. Hematite flotation with 10⁻⁴ molar oleate addition was high for pH values above 4.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOleate adsorption 0aHematite 0aFlotation0 tMinerals engineering.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 118 p.122-132dElsevier LtdwJournal:26584x0892-68757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mineng.2017.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03713naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245014500165300001800310500001500328520167500343592002802018650001202046650001702058650001102075650001902086650002302105650001502128650003702143650002002180650002102200650003702221650004402258650001702302650001302319650001102332650002102343650001902364650001702383650001402400650002402414650001202438650002202450650001302472650001402485650001402499650002402513650001902537650002902556650001302585653002402598653001402622653001502636653001902651653001802670653002102688700001702709700001602726700001602742700001602758700001702774773013002791856008502921852000903006655001203015IND60530926620221120185203.0160723e20160606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053092662DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b001562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hang10aCarbon Nanotube-Based Solid Sulfonic Acids as Catalysts for Production of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester via Transesterification and Esterification  ap. 3140-3150.  a2019-12-06  aA series of polymer–carbon nanotube composite materials (CNT-P-SO₃H) were prepared by covalent grafting of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with sulfonic acid-functionalized polymers (P-SO₃H) including poly(3-vinyl-1-sulfonic acid imidazolium chloride)-grafted multiwalled CNTs (CNT-PVSAIC), poly(4-vinyl-1-sulfonic acid pyridinium chloride)-grafted multiwalled CNTs (CNT-PVSAPC), and poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid)-grafted multiwalled CNTs (CNT-PSSA). Such a functionalization method provides a facile route to obtain various polyelectrolyte brushes on the surfaces of CNTs in order to improve the dispersibility and modulate the acidity of CNTs to selectively introduce functional groups and densely create active sites over CNTs for potential catalytic applications. Both CNT-PVSAIC and CNT-PVSAPC consist of cationic polyelectrolyte chains functionalized by sulfonic acid groups, whereas CNT-PSSA is composed of anionic polymer brushes grafted by sulfonic acid groups. The physicochemical properties of CNT-P-SO₃H were analyzed by BET, TGA, XRD, FT-IR, XPS, Raman, and HRTEM techniques. The resulting CNT-P-SO₃H materials exhibit excellent catalytic activity as CNT-based solid acids in liquid phase transesterification of triglycerides with methanol and esterification of oleic acid with methanol, which are typical model reactions for biodiesel production. The outstanding catalytic performance of the CNT-P-SO₃H catalysts is attributed to the combination of the mesoporous structure together with a well-extended P-SO₃H coating over the outer surface of the CNTs, providing the formation of a dense but uniform surface distribution of active sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aelectrolytes 3acarbon 3asulfonic acids 3acatalytic activity 3aoleic acid 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3afuel production 3acarbon nanotubes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3acoatings 3amodels 3atriacylglycerols 3adispersibility 3aporous media 3abiodiesel 3acomposite materials 3abrushes 3aX-ray diffraction 3amethanol 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3atransesterification 3aesterification 3afatty acid methyl esters 3apolymers 0aTransesterification 0aBiodiesel 0aSolid acid 0aEsterification 0asulfonic acid 0aCarbon nanotubes1 aChen, Jinzhu1 aChen, Limin1 aXu, Yisheng1 aGuo, Xuhong1 aFang, Dingye0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 June 06, v. 4, no. 6 p.3140-3150dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b001563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009700167300001400264520128000278592002801558650001301586650001201599650001101611650001501622650001701637650001901654650000901673650001401682650001601696650001401712650001801726650001101744700002001755700002001775700002001795700002001815773007601835856008401911852000901995655001202004IND60096441820221119072810.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009644182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBok, Jin Pil10aFast pyrolysis of coffee grounds: Characteristics of product yields and biocrude oil quality  ap. 17-24.  aThe high demand of renewable energy has been growing nowadays due to shortage of fossil fuels and global warming. The studies on fast pyrolysis of biomass were mostly in progress by using woody biomass, to investigate characteristics of biocrude oil and optimum conditions of fast pyrolysis. Currently a variety of biomass have been used for sample material of fast pyrolysis to produce biocrude oil. In particular, coffee grounds are expected to be a valuable energy source because of consumption growth of coffee and higher heating value than woody biomass. In the present experiment, coffee grounds were chosen as feedstock for fast pyrolysis. The objective of this work was to study the characteristics of product yields and biocrude oil quality depending on reaction temperatures ranging from 673 K to 873 K. Also, higher heating value, water content, viscosity, pH, density, ash, and solid residue of the collected biocrude oils were analyzed. From the result, the reaction temperature is the most important variable in fast pyrolysis of coffee grounds, significantly influencing the product yields. The highest yield of biocrude oil (54.85%) was obtained at 823 K. Also, the characteristics of biocrude oil were scrutinized by variations of experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afossil fuels 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awater content 3ayields1 aChoi, Hang Seok1 aChoi, Yeon Seok1 aPark, Hoon Chae1 aKim, Seock Joon0 tEnergy.g2012 Nov., v. 47, no. 1 p.17-24dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04729naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245014300162520320100305592002803506650002003534650001203554650002703566650002603593650001703619650001103636650001203647650001303659650001303672650002103685650003703706650001403743650001503757650002703772650001403799650000903813650001503822650001903837650001903856650001503875651001003890700001603900700002103916700001703937700002803954700001703982773012203999856008104121852000904202655001204211IND60702044720221123022528.0200717e20200222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070204472DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100203102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Meng 10aNitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium Resorption Responses of Alfalfa to Increasing Soil Water and P Availability in a Semi-Arid Environment  aIn semi-arid areas, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is widely grown, but its growth is often restricted due to limited rainfall and soil nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P). Nutrient resorption is an effective strategy for dealing with nutrient shortages. Alleviation of these limited resources using film mulch and P fertilization—which are common practices in semi-arid areas—can affect the internal recycling of such nutrients. Little is known about such effects in alfalfa and the relationship between resorption efficiency and forage yield. We conducted a two-year field experiment in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China using film mulch and P fertilization to investigate the response to long-term increasing soil water and P availability on leaf nitrogen (N), P, and potassium (K) concentrations and nutrient resorption characteristics in alfalfa. In green leaves, mulching significantly increased P concentration by an average of 5.5% but it had no significant effect on N concentration over two years, and it decreased K concentration by 16.1% in 2017. P fertilization significantly increased N concentrations to a greater degree in 2018 (8.1%) than 2017 (1.6%). P fertilization also significantly increased P concentrations by an average of 34.1% over two years. In contrast, P fertilization significantly decreased K concentration in the mulched treatment by an average of 17.3% in 2017 and 21.8% in 2018, but it had no effect in the no-mulch treatment. In senescent leaves, mulching significantly increased N concentration by an average of 3.9% and P concentration by an average of 16.7%, but it had no significant effect on K concentration over two years, while P fertilization significantly decreased N and K concentrations over two years by an average of 7.5%, and 32.8%, respectively. P fertilization significantly increased senesced P concentration by an average of 11.9% in 2017 and 17.5% in 2018; and year × mulching × P fertilization had a significant interaction on senesced leaf P concentration. For resorption efficiency, mulching decreased P resorption efficiency by an average of 3.0%, but it had no impact on N or K resorption efficiency, while P fertilization increased the N, P, and K resorption efficiencies in alfalfa by an average of 6.8%, 6.2%, and 76.4% over two years, respectively. Interactive effects of mulching and P fertilization were found on P and K resorption efficiencies over time. In addition, N and K resorption efficiencies were significantly higher in 2018 than in 2017. The application of P fertilizer without mulching resulted in positive correlations between forage yield and N, P, and K resorption efficiencies, but no correlations were observed under film mulch. That is, mulching changed the relationship between forage yield and N, P, and K resorption efficiencies in alfalfa, suggesting that N, P, and K resorption efficiencies may not be related to high yield. Our results provide new insights into the role of nutrient resorption in alfalfa in response to increasing soil water and P availability and the relationship between resorption efficiency and forage yield, which will help us to improve alfalfa yield in semi-arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3aforage yield 3aleaves 3amulches 3amulching 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient resorption (physiology) 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apotassium 3arain 3aresorption 3asemiarid zones 3asoil nutrients 3asoil water 3aChina1 aKang, Jing 1 aHan, Cheng-Long 1 aGu, Yan-Jie 1 aSiddique, Kadambot  H.M1 aLi, Fengmin,0 tAgronomy.g2020 Feb. 22, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100203103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245007300206300001800279506007600297520120900373592002801582506003701610650001601647650001901663650001001682650001301692650001701705650002001722653003001742653001801772653001801790653002401808653003501832700002001867700002401887773019201911856007902103852000902182655001202191IND60230353020221207071304.0150614e20150324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023035302DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13167811122doi7 aPMC43783992pmcid7 a257552612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossmann, Wolf10aSolar electricity supply isolines of generation capacity and storage  ap. 3663-3668.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recent sharp drop in the cost of photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation accompanied by globally rapidly increasing investment in PV plants calls for new planning and management tools for large-scale distributed solar networks. Of major importance are methods to overcome intermittency of solar electricity, i.e., to provide dispatchable electricity at minimal costs. We find that pairs of electricity generation capacity G and storage S that give dispatchable electricity and are minimal with respect to S for a given G exhibit a smooth relationship of mutual substitutability between G and S . These isolines between G and S support the solving of several tasks, including the optimal sizing of generation capacity and storage, optimal siting of solar parks, optimal connections of solar parks across time zones for minimizing intermittency, and management of storage in situations of far below average insolation to provide dispatchable electricity. G − S isolines allow determining the cost-optimal pair ( G , S ) as a function of the cost ratio of G and S . G − S isolines provide a method for evaluating the effect of geographic spread and time zone coverage on costs of solar electricity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectricity 3aisogenic lines 3aparks 3aplanning 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 0alarge-scale solar network 0aphotovoltaics 0aUS super grid 0asolar intermittency 0adispatchable solar electricity1 aGrossmann, Iris1 aSteininger, Karl W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Mar. 24, v. 112, no. 12 p.3663-3668dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13167811123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03979naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245013400169300001400303520241700317592002802734650002802762650001302790650001202803650001202815650001602827650001802843650000902861650001902870650001302889650002102902650002302923650000902946650001502955650001102970650001602981650002102997653004003018653002803058653004603086700002503132700002203157700001803179700006103197773012803258856009003386852000903476655001203485IND60525508920221119085643.0190318e20160802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052550892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Zhi10aPredicting outgrowth and inactivation of Clostridium perfringens in meat products during low temperature long time heat treatment  ap. 45-57.  aWith low temperature long time (LTLT) cooking it can take hours for meat to reach a final core temperature above 53°C and germination followed by growth of Clostridium perfringens is a concern. Available and new growth data in meats including 154 lag times (tlag), 224 maximum specific growth rates (μmax) and 25 maximum population densities (Nmax) were used to developed a model to predict growth of C. perfringens during the coming-up time of LTLT cooking. New data were generate in 26 challenge tests with chicken (pH6.8) and pork (pH5.6) at two different slowly increasing temperature (SIT) profiles (10°C to 53°C) followed by 53°C in up to 30h in total. Three inoculum types were studied including vegetative cells, non-heated spores and heat activated (75°C, 20min) spores of C. perfringens strain 790-94. Concentrations of vegetative cells in chicken increased 2 to 3logCFU/g during the SIT profiles. Similar results were found for non-heated and heated spores in chicken, whereas in pork C. perfringens 790-94 increased less than 1logCFU/g. At 53°C C. perfringens 790-94 was log-linearly inactivated. Observed and predicted concentrations of C. perfringens, at the time when 53°C (log(N53)) was reached, were used to evaluate the new growth model and three available predictive models previously published for C. perfringens growth during cooling rather than during SIT profiles. Model performance was evaluated by using mean deviation (MD), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the acceptable simulation zone (ASZ) approach with a zone of ±0.5logCFU/g. The new model showed best performance with MD=0.27logCFU/g, MAD=0.66logCFU/g and ASZ=67%. The two growth models that performed best, were used together with a log-linear inactivation model and D53-values from the present study to simulate the behaviour of C. perfringens under the fast and slow SIT profiles investigated in the present study. Observed and predicted concentrations were compared using a new fail-safe acceptable zone (FSAZ) method. FSAZ was defined as the predicted concentration of C. perfringens plus 0.5logCFU/g. If at least 85% of the observed log-counts were below the FSAZ, the model was considered fail-safe. The two models showed similar performance but none of them performed satisfactorily for all conditions. It is recommended to use the models without a lag phase until more precise lag time models become available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3achickens 3acooking 3acooling 3agermination 3agrowth models 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ainoculum 3amodel validation 3apopulation density 3apork 3aprediction 3aspores 3atemperature 3avegetative cells 0aSlowly increasing temperature (SIT) 0aLow temperature cooking 0aFail-safe acceptable zone (FSAZ) approach1 aHansen, Terese Holst1 aHansen, Tina Beck1 aDalgaard, Paw1 aKnøchel, Susanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3777-71230 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2016 Aug. 02, v. 230 p.45-57dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245010800196300001800304500002000322520179700342592002802139596002302167596004502190650001302235650001602248650001302264650001502277650001102292650001202303650001802315650001602333700005702349773012602406856007702532852000902609655001202618IND60788097020221122234148.0220811e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078809702DNAL7 a10.1029/2019WR0250122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, P.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1418-821410aEstimating Recharge From Recirculated Groundwater With Dissolved Gases: An End‐Member Mixing Analysis  ap. 5468-5486.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn many hydrological systems, groundwater is pumped from the aquifer onto the land surface, and a fraction of this water subsequently infiltrates to recharge the groundwater system (recirculated groundwater). Tracers that undergo different degrees of reequilibration with the atmosphere during this recirculation process can enable ambient groundwater and recirculated groundwater to be differentiated. In this paper, the recirculated groundwater has been pumped to dewater open pit mines and discharged into ephemeral creeks. Some of this water subsequently recharged back into the aquifer. Chlorofluorocarbon‐12 (CFC‐12), ¹⁴C, and ³H are used in a four end‐member mixing analysis to differentiate between (1) ambient groundwater, (2) recirculated groundwater, (3) river recharge from natural flows prior to commencement of mining operations (in 2007), and (4) natural river recharge post‐2007. Sampling of the surface water when discharge of mine water was the only source of river flow enabled the extent of reequilibration of both CFC‐12 and ¹⁴C to be accurately determined. Since CFC‐12 reequilibrates more rapidly than ¹⁴C, recirculating groundwater had a CFC‐12 concentration that was close to modern, but a ¹⁴C activity that was higher than the original groundwater, but less than modern recharge. As ³H does not reequilibrate, it enabled easy differentiation between recirculated groundwater and infiltration of natural creek flows. Uncertainty of end‐member compositions is due to changes in the end‐member concentrations over time in the case of natural river flows, uncertainty in the extent of tracer reequilibration for the groundwater recirculation end‐member, and spatial variations in the composition of the ambient groundwater end‐member.  aPublisher supplied data  cRio Tinto Iron Ore  aLP150100395cAustralian Research Council 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3aresearch 3ariver flow 3arivers 3astreams 3asurface water 3auncertainty1 aDogramaci, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2598-04420 tWater resources research.g2019 July, v. 55, no. 7 p.5468-5486dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR0250123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245013600196300001800332500002000350520184400370592002802214650002002242650001202262650002302274650000902297650001902306650001302325650002002338650001502358650001002373650001502383700002002398700005702418700005802475773012602533856007702659852000902736655001202745IND60788097120221122234345.0220811e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078809712DNAL7 a10.1029/2019WR0249912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Daeha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8478-127810aHistorical Drought Assessment Over the Contiguous United States Using the Generalized Complementary Principle of Evapotranspiration  ap. 6244-6267.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs drought involves diverse natural and human‐made processes in hydrologic cycles, it is necessary to track a process‐specific variable for efficient drought risk management. In this study, we employed a state‐of‐the‐art formulation of the generalized complementary relationship (GCR) to estimate terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET). The GCR ET estimates were used to assess historical droughts over the contiguous United States (CONUS) in relation to long‐term natural fluctuations. Results showed that the GCR provided strong performance in reproducing water balance ET estimates and correlations to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, when compared to observation‐driven estimates and land surface models. For 1982‐2011, the GCR yielded better performance than land surface models even with estimated radiation inputs and no wind speed variations. The Standardized Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI) based on the GCR provided a consistent drought assessment with precipitation‐based drought identification and remotely sensed vegetation conditions. The SEDI seems to capture the heat wave‐driven flash drought together with water deficit‐driven droughts. In the CONUS, the La Niña‐like conditions were likely to trigger extensive vegetation droughts with extreme severity. This study found the three long‐term environmental factors that affect the general trend of ET deficits over the CONUS, which are the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the mean air temperature, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Especially, the Atlantic Oscillation seems to be the most significant predictor that could explain the long‐term variation of vegetation droughts over the CONUS. This study highlights that the GCR‐based SEDI could be useful for monitoring and assessment of drought risks at a continental scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3aheat 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3arisk management 3avegetation 3awater 3awind speed1 aLee, Woo‐Seop1 aKim, Seon Tae1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2628-09041 aChun, Jong Ahn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8047-18110 tWater resources research.g2019 July, v. 55, no. 7 p.6244-6267dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR0249913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245011000161520119000271592002801461650003101489650001601520650002001536650001301556650001401569650002301583650001901606650001301625650001301638650002601651650001801677650001901695650002701714650001901741650001401760650001001774700001601784700001901800700001901819700001901838700002101857700001801878700002201896700001301918773012201931856008102053852000902134655001202143IND60702045020221122232958.0200717e20200224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070204502DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100203122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jing 12aA 1Ns Disomic Addition from Psathyrostachys Huashanica Keng Confers Resistance to Powdery Mildew in Wheat  aPowdery mildew is a fungal disease that threatens wheat production throughout the world. Breeding resistant cultivars is an effective way to reduce harm caused by powdery mildew. In this study, 35 wheat-Psathyrostachys huashanica-derived lines were developed by crossing common wheat and P. huashanica Keng (2n = 2x = 14, NsNs) using embryo culture. Resistance to powdery mildew in the derived lines was identified at the seedling and adult stages. Line H5-5-4-2 was selected with immunity to powdery mildew at both growth stages. The chromosome structure of this line was characterized by cytology, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and expressed sequence tag-sequence-tagged site (EST-STS) analysis. The chromosome configuration was 2n = 44 = 22II. Two P. huashanica chromosomes with strong hybridization signals were detected by GISH analysis. Among 83 EST-STS markers that covered all seven homologous groups in wheat, three pairs of STS markers, BE497584, BF202643, and BG262410, located in wheat homologous group 1 amplified clear specific bands related to P. huashanica. The results indicated that resistant line H5-5-4-2 was a wheat-P. huashanica 1Ns disomic addition line.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsathyrostachys huashanica 3achromosomes 3acrop production 3acrossing 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3aembryo culture 3agenomics 3aimmunity 3ain situ hybridization 3amature plants 3aplant breeding 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apowdery mildew 3aseedlings 3awheat1 aLiu, Yuxiu 1 aHou, Chenchen 1 aLi, Jiachuang 1 aWang, Jinglin 1 aZhang, Qiaoying 1 aYang, Qunhui 1 aChen, Shin-horng,1 aWu, Jun 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Feb. 24, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100203123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04576naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005300170300001600223520350900239592002803748650001203776650001803788650001003806650001003816650000903826650002203835650001103857650001503868650002203883650001603905650001403921700002303935700002103958773009403979856008504073990002304158852000904181655001204190IND60093525720221119102226.0141103e20110107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009352572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2010.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChew, David M.10aU–Pb and Th–Pb dating of apatite by LA-ICPMS  ap. 200-216.  aApatite is a common U- and Th-bearing accessory mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks, and a minor but widespread detrital component in clastic sedimentary rocks. U–Pb and Th–Pb dating of apatite has potential application in sedimentary provenance studies, as it likely represents first cycle detritus compared to the polycyclic behavior of zircon. However, low U, Th and radiogenic Pb concentrations, elevated common Pb and the lack of a U–Th–Pb apatite standard remain significant challenges in dating apatite by LA-ICPMS, and consequently in developing the chronometer as a provenance tool. This study has determined U–Pb and Th–Pb ages for seven well known apatite occurrences (Durango, Emerald Lake, Kovdor, Mineville, Mud Tank, Otter Lake and Slyudyanka) by LA-ICPMS. Analytical procedures involved rastering a 10μm spot over a 40×40μm square to a depth of 10μm using a Geolas 193nm ArF excimer laser coupled to a Thermo ElementXR single-collector ICPMS. These raster conditions minimized laser-induced inter-element fractionation, which was corrected for using the back-calculated intercept of the time-resolved signal. A Tl–U–Bi–Np tracer solution was aspirated with the sample into the plasma to correct for instrument mass bias. External standards (Plešovice and 91500 zircon, NIST SRM 610 and 612 silicate glasses and STDP5 phosphate glass) along with Kovdor apatite were analyzed to monitor U–Pb, Th–Pb, U–Th and Pb–Pb ratios Common Pb correction employed the ²⁰⁷Pb method, and also a ²⁰⁸Pb correction method for samples with low Th/U. The ²⁰⁷Pb and ²⁰⁸Pb corrections employed either the initial Pb isotopic composition or the Stacey and Kramers model and propagated conservative uncertainties in the initial Pb isotopic composition. Common Pb correction using the Stacey and Kramers (1975) model employed an initial Pb isotopic composition calculated from either the estimated U–Pb age of the sample or an iterative approach. The age difference between these two methods is typically less than 2%, suggesting that the iterative approach works well for samples where there are no constraints on the initial Pb composition, such as a detrital sample. No ²⁰⁴Pb correction was undertaken because of low ²⁰⁴Pb counts on single collector instruments and ²⁰⁴Pb interference by ²⁰⁴Hg in the argon gas supply. Age calculations employed between 11 and 33 analyses per sample and used a weighted average of the common Pb-corrected ages, a Tera–Wasserburg Concordia intercept age and a Tera–Wasserburg Concordia intercept age anchored through common Pb. The samples in general yield ages consistent (at the 2σ level) with independent estimates of the U–Pb apatite age, which demonstrates the suitability of the analytical protocol employed. Weighted mean age uncertainties are as low as 1–2% for U- and/or Th-rich Palaeozoic–Neoproterozoic samples; the uncertainty on the youngest sample, the Cenozoic (31.44Ma) Durango apatite, ranges from 3.7–7.6% according to the common Pb correction method employed. The accurate and relatively precise common Pb-corrected ages demonstrate the U–Pb and Th–Pb apatite chronometers are suitable as sedimentary provenance tools. The Kovdor carbonatite apatite is recommended as a potential U–Pb and Th–Pb apatite standard as it yields precise and reproducible ²⁰⁷Pb-corrected, ²³²Th–²⁰⁸Pb, and common Pb-anchored Tera–Wasserburg Concordia intercept ages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3afractionation 3aglass 3alakes 3alead 3ametamorphic rocks 3amodels 3aprovenance 3asedimentary rocks 3auncertainty 3azirconium1 aSylvester, Paul J.1 aTubrett, Mike N.0 tChemical geology.g2011 Jan. 7, v. 280, no. 1-2 p.200-216dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2010.11.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245012200166520131300288592002801601650001301629650002101642650001701663650000901680650001401689650001201703650001201715650001201727650002001739650003101759650001001790650001301800650001901813650002601832650002201858650002401880650001101904650001401915650001101929650002001940650001201960650002001972650001701992700001702009700002002026700001702046700002002063700002002083700002002103700001602123700002002139700001802159700001902177700001802196773012202214856008102336852000902417655001202426IND60702045120221122001136.0200717e20200224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070204512DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100203132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Shuangjie 10aTranscriptomic Analysis of Female Panicles Reveals Gene Expression Responses to Drought Stress in Maize (Zea mays L.)  aFemale panicles (FPs) play an important role in the formation of yields in maize. From 40 days after sowing to the tasseling stage for summer maize, FPs are developing and sensitive to drought. However, it remains unclear how FPs respond to drought stress during FP development. In this study, FP differentiation was observed at 20 and 30 days after drought (DAD) and agronomic trait changes of maize ears were determined across three treatments, including well-watered (CK), light drought (LD), and moderate drought (MD) treatments at 20, 25, and 30 DAD. RNA-sequencing was then used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in FPs at 30 DAD. Spikelets and florets were suppressed in LD and MD treatments, suggesting that drought slows FP development and thus decreases yields. Transcriptome analysis indicated that 40, 876, and 887 DEGs were detected in LD/CK, MD/CK, and MD/LD comparisons. KEGG pathway analysis showed that ‘biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites’ and ‘carbohydrate metabolism’ were involved in the LD response, whereas ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’ and ‘plant hormone signal transduction’ played important roles in the MD response. In addition, a series of molecular cues related to development and growth were screened for their drought stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagronomic traits 3abiosynthesis 3acorn 3acorn ears 3adrought 3afemales 3aflorets 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3apanicles 3aplant hormones 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3asowing 3aspikelets 3astarch 3astress response 3asucrose 3atranscriptomics 3awater stress1 aLi, Hongwei 1 aJiang, Yanping 1 aTang, Yulou 1 aZhao, Guoqiang 1 aZhang, Yinglei 1 aYang, Shenjiao 1 aQiu, Husen 1 aWang, Yongchao 1 aGuo, Jiameng 1 aYang, Qinghua 1 aShao, Ruixin 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Feb. 24, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100203133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245009200211300001800303506007600321520160000397592002801997506003702025650001202062650000902074650002202083650001302105650001602118650001902134650002402153653001802177653001002195653001702205653002602222653001602248700002302264700002302287700002502310700002602335700002402361700001602385700001802401700002302419773019202442856007902634852000902713655001202722IND60230353520221207071240.0150614e20150324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023035352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14138641122doi7 aPMC43784322pmcid7 a257755952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodgers-Melnick, Eli10aRecombination in diverse maize is stable, predictable, and associated with genetic load  ap. 3823-3828.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmong the fundamental evolutionary forces, recombination arguably has the largest impact on the practical work of plant breeders. Varying over 1,000-fold across the maize genome, the local meiotic recombination rate limits the resolving power of quantitative trait mapping and the precision of favorable allele introgression. The consequences of low recombination also theoretically extend to the species-wide scale by decreasing the power of selection relative to genetic drift, and thereby hindering the purging of deleterious mutations. In this study, we used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to identify 136,000 recombination breakpoints at high resolution within US and Chinese maize nested association mapping populations. We find that the pattern of cross-overs is highly predictable on the broad scale, following the distribution of gene density and CpG methylation. Several large inversions also suppress recombination in distinct regions of several families. We also identify recombination hotspots ranging in size from 1 kb to 30 kb. We find these hotspots to be historically stable and, compared with similar regions with low recombination, to have strongly differentiated patterns of DNA methylation and GC content. We also provide evidence for the historical action of GC-biased gene conversion in recombination hotspots. Finally, using genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) to identify putative deleterious polymorphisms, we find evidence for reduced genetic load in hotspot regions, a phenomenon that may have considerable practical importance for breeding programs worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3acorn 3agenetic variation 3amutation 3aoutcrossing 3aplant breeders 3aquantitative traits 0arecombination 0amaize 0agenetic load 0adeleterious mutations 0amethylation1 aBradbury, Peter J.1 aElshire, Robert J.1 aGlaubitz, Jeffrey C.1 aAcharya, Charlotte B.1 aMitchell, Sharon E.1 aLi, Chunhui1 aLi, Yongxiang1 aBuckler, Edward S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Mar. 24, v. 112, no. 12 p.3823-3828dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14138641123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013100166520100600297592002801303650001601331650001101347650001701358653001601375653001801391653002101409653002101430653001701451700001501468700001601483700001501499700001701514773010501531856008501636852000901721655001201730IND60782600720221123012554.0220816e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078260072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2022.1028502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Anzhou10aIncoherence of the M2 and K1 internal tides radiated from the Luzon Strait under the influence of looping and leaping Kuroshio  aThe Kuroshio in different paths is considered to have different impacts on the generation, propagation and energetics of internal tides (ITs) originated from the Luzon Strait (LS). However, its influence on the incoherence of ITs remains unknown. Based on a regional model simultaneously simulating ITs and background circulations, this study examines the incoherence of the M₂ and K₁ ITs radiated from the LS under the influence of looping and leaping Kuroshio. The looping Kuroshio causes stronger incoherence of the M₂ and K₁ ITs than the leaping Kuroshio. The reason is that the looping Kuroshio causes a larger variation of eigenspeed, which results in stronger incoherence of ITs than the leaping Kuroshio does. For both the looping and leaping Kuroshio, the low-frequency background currents play a more important role than the stratification in changing the eigenspeed. We believe that the results of this study can deepen our understanding of the incoherent nature of ITs near the LS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilippines 3amodels 3aoceanography 0aIncoherence 0aInternal tide 0aLooping Kuroshio 0aLeaping Kuroshio 0aLuzon Strait1 aGuo, Zheng1 aWang, Shuya1 aGuo, Xinyu1 aSong, Jinbao0 tProgress in oceanography.g2022 Aug., v. 206 p.102850-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2022.1028503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04035naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245016800172520234900340592002802689650001302717650001302730650002002743650001202763650002102775650001502796650001302811650001102824650001102835650001402846650001702860650001502877650000902892650001102901650000902912650001302921650001302934650000902947653003802956653003702994653001903031653002203050653002003072700001603092700005303108700002103161700005303182700001703235700001503252700001203267773009103279856009003370852000903460655001203469IND60791536720221119015246.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079153672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1362002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Zhuling10aLability, bioaccessibility, and ecological and health risks of anthropogenic toxic heavy metals in the arid calcareous soil around a nonferrous metal smelting area  aLability and bioaccessibility of anthropogenic toxic heavy metals in arid calcareous soils are critical to understand their ecological and health risks. This study examined toxic heavy metal speciation in the calcareous soil contaminated by nonferrous metal smelting. Results demonstrated that approximately 70 years’ nonferrous metal smelting and mining in Baiyin led to significant contamination of nearby soil down to about 200 cm depth by cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), with more serious contamination in the downwind areas of smelting or mining. More than half of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in the soil was present in the labile fractions while more than 75% of cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), and vanadium (V) was present in the residual fraction. Carbonate minerals in this calcareous soil play an important role in the labile fractions, with approximate 25% of Cd and Pb and 15% of Cu and Zn bound in carbonates. Bioaccessible Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in the soil were approximately 49.8%, 29.4%, 12.2%, and 33.8% in gastric phase and 13.5%, 15.9%, 4.3%, and 9.1% in intestinal phase of their total concentrations, respectively. Therefore, Cd and Zn were removed from gastric solution to a greater extent than Cu and Pb by neutral intestine environment. However, bioaccessible Co, Cr, Ni, and V in the soil were less than 3% of their total concentrations. Bioaccessibility of these metals but Cu in this calcareous soil was significantly lower than that for the acidic Ultisols and Alfisols in U.S. The concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, and Ni in each chemical and bioaccessible forms were significantly correlated linearly with their total concentrations in the calcareous soil, while only residual concentration was significantly correlated with the total concentration for Co, Cr, and V. These linear slopes showed that relative lability and bioaccessibility increased for Cd, but decreased for Cu, Pb, and Zn with the increase in their total concentrations in the calcareous soil. Direct oral soil ingestion would not pose a non-carcinogenic health risk to local children. However, very high potential ecological risk would be caused by these metals in the soil. These results provide improved insights into the biogeochemical processes of anthropogenic toxic heavy metals in the arid calcareous soils worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aUltisols 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acalcareous soils 3acarbonates 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3ageophagia 3aheavy metals 3aintestines 3alead 3anickel 3arisk 3atoxicity 3avanadium 3azinc 0aSequentially selective extraction 0aPhysiologically based extraction 0aChemical forms 0aEnrichment factor 0aBiogeochemistry1 aLin, Chunye1 aYang, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9712-63331 aCheng, Hongguang1 aGu, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4483-38831 aWang, Beibei1 aWu, linlin1 aMa, Jin0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 307 p.136200-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1362003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245014300178300001600321520165700337592002801994650001502022650000902037650001302046650001802059650001002077650001402087650001902101650001602120650002002136650001502156650001702171650001802188700002002206700002302226700002302249773011702272856009002389990002302479852000902502655001202511IND60094954620221120231603.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009495462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2011.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDitommaso, Savina10aRecovery of Legionella species from water samples using an internal method based on ISO 11731: suggestions for revision and implementation  ap. 200-206.  aThe study aim was to determine retrospectively whether the parallel use of 2 media [buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) and medium of Wadowsky and Yee (MWY)] to isolate Legionella spp. from water samples taken from hospital water supply systems increased the sensitivity of the culture method as compared with methods/protocols in which only seeding on a selective medium is used. We analyzed the results obtained from 931 positive water samples. In 484 of the 931 positive water samples, Legionella spp. was isolated in the presence of other microorganisms; in 83% (400/484), we used MWY to count suspected colonies, which gave a lower number of unreadable plates. In the 447 samples containing only Legionella spp., the highest frequency of positive samples (93%, 418/447) was obtained with BCYE, whereas seeding on MWY yielded 78% (348/447) (P < 0.001). Evaluation of the influence of the media on the Legionella spp. counts obtained by the 2 media showed that BCYE agar produced significantly higher counts than MWY (P < 0.001). The major conclusions that may be drawn from our data are as follows: 1) BCYE gives a high recovery rate of positive samples (93%) and a much greater yield of Legionella spp. than MWY; 2) BCYE was necessary for the detection of non–L. pneumophila spp. which grew poorly on selective media; 3) selective media [MWY or GVPC (glycine, vancomycin, polymyxin B, and cycloheximide)] were necessary for the recovery of Legionella spp. when the non-selective medium (BCYE) was difficult to interpret because of contaminating background flora. The use of different media is recommended for routine water tests in hospitals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella 3aagar 3acharcoal 3acycloheximide 3aflora 3ahospitals 3amicroorganisms 3apolymyxin B 3aselective media 3avancomycin 3awater supply 3ayeast extract1 aGentile, Marino1 aGiacomuzzi, Monica1 aZotti, Carla Maria0 tDiagnostic microbiology & infectious disease.g2011 June, v. 70, no. 2 p.200-206dElsevier Inc.x0732-88937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2011.01.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245008800203300002000291506007600311520162400387592002802011506003702039650001302076650001202089650001202101650001402113653001602127653001802143653002302161653002502184653003302209700001602242700002202258700002202280700001902302700002002321773019402341856007902535852000902614655001202623IND60230353820221207071255.0150614e20150324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023035382DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14145771122doi7 aPMC43784012pmcid7 a257756012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Zongjun10aSponge grade body fossil with cellular resolution dating 60 Myr before the Cambrian  ap.

The fossilized animal ( Eocyathispongia qiania gen. et sp. nov.) is slightly more than 1.2 mm wide and 1.1 mm tall, is composed of hundreds of thousands of cells, and has a gross structure consisting of three adjacent hollow tubes sharing a common base. The main tube is crowned with a large open funnel, and the others end in osculum-like openings to the exterior. The external surface is densely covered with flat tile-like cells closely resembling sponge pinacocytes, and this layer is punctuated with smaller pores. A dense patch of external structures that display the form of a lawn of sponge papillae has also survived. Within the main funnel, an area where features of the inner surface are preserved displays a regular pattern of uniform pits. Many of them are surrounded individually by distinct collars, mounted in a supporting reticulum. The possibility cannot be excluded that these pits are the remains of a field of choanocytes. The character set evinced by this specimen, ranging from general anatomy to cell type, uniquely indicates that this specimen is a fossil of probable poriferan affinity. So far, we have only this single specimen, and although its organized and complex cellular structure precludes any reasonable interpretation that its origin is abiogenic, confirmation that it is indeed a fossilized sponge will clearly require discovery of additional specimens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aancestry 3aanimals 3afossils 3aphylogeny 0aPrecambrian 0asponge fossil 0ametazoan phylogeny 0aDoushantuo Formation 0asynchrotron X-ray tomography1 aZhu, Maoyan1 aDavidson, Eric H.1 aBottjer, David J.1 aZhao, Fangchen1 aTafforeau, Paul0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Mar. 24, v. 112, no. 12 p.E1453-E1460dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14145771123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009700176300001800273520153400291592002801825650001301853650001401866650001401880650001501894650002301909650002201932650001501954650001101969650001401980650002201994650001102016650002102027650004402048650001402092650001502106650001902121650002002140653001102160653002302171653002702194653002302221653002202244653001902266700001302285700001602298700002202314700001902336700001902355773013002374856008502504852000902589655001202598IND60530927220221120181128.0160723e20160606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053092722DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b002452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpringer, Stephen

Oxidation of the β-O-4 lignin model substrate 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)propane-1,3-diol (320.3 m/z) and poplar organosolv lignin resulted in both fragmentation and polymerization processes, likely via phenoxy radical formation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of the reaction products from the β-O-4 model substrate showed oligomers of the substrate with masses of 661.192, 979.355, and 1297.466 m/z that correspond to a dimer, trimer, and tetramer of the β-O-4 model substrate, respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shows the formation of 5–5 diphenyl and 4-O-5 linkages in the β-O-4 model substrate oxidation products. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) detected three peaks, corresponding to the β-O-4 model substrate and its oligomers. Products from the Mn-catalyzed oxidation of poplar organosolv lignin by H₂O₂ were analyzed by GPC, ³¹P NMR, and ¹³C NMR. GPC showed an increase by approximately four in the number-average molecular weight of organosolv lignin upon oxidation. NMR shows that polymerization occurs at positions consistent with phenoxy radical coupling, where the observed changes in guaiacyl subunit chemical shifts are most likely due to the formation of 5–5 biphenyl linkages.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiphenyl 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3adesorption 3agel chromatography 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aionization 3alignin 3amanganese 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3apolymerization 3astable isotopes 0aLignin 0aChemical feedstock 0aPeroxidative oxidation 0aManganese catalyst 0aBreakout products 0aPolymerization1 aHe, Jian1 aChui, Megan1 aLittle, R.

In order to gain insights into the gas–solid fluid dynamics of the new design, a cold experimental setup was established. The fluidization dynamics of the staged FR was investigated based on the pressure pulsation signal analysis using time domain analysis, power spectral density analysis, wavelet analysis, and the Hurst exponent analysis by the R/S method. There are four flow types of funnel-like flow, spout-fluidization, spouting motion, and unsteady spouting motion to be classified, and the transition boundaries of the corresponding flow types were determined. The design provides a way to lower the overall pressure drop of FR and then reduces the fan energy consumption to hold the oxygen carrier particle circulation.  aPublisher supplied data  a51906113cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aBK20190707cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004608 3acold 3aenergy 3afluid mechanics 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3aoxygen 3awavelet1 aYin, Shangyi1 aLu, Ping1 aSong, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6284-40040 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 Apr. 25, v. 36, no. 9 p.4807-4817dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c000153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245013400168520158100302592002801883650003001911650002301941650001701964650001301981650002001994650001202014650002102026650002302047650001002070650002502080650001502105650002002120650002302140650001602163650001102179650000902190650002102199650002602220650002102246650001702267650001702284650001302301650001602314650001002330650001702340650001502357700002102372700002802393700001802421700002002439700002202459700002102481700002502502700001402527700001602541700001802557773012202575856008102697852000902778655001202787IND60702045320221122001214.0200717e20200124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070204532DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy100201682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaveed, Muhammad 10aAlleviation of Salinity Induced Oxidative Stress in Chenopodium quinoa by Fe Biofortification and Biochar—Endophyte Interaction  aIron-biofortification is a sustainable food-based approach to combat iron deficiency by increasing iron content and bioavailability in agronomic crops. Siderophore producing microbes offer a sustainable and low-cost way to increase iron supply in crops. Also, certain substances released from organic amendments act as iron-chelators which increase the solubility as well as the availability of iron to plants. Present study investigated the role of siderophore-producing endophytic bacteria and biochar on iron-fortification of a novel crop quinoa in iron-limited saline conditions. The surface-disinfected seeds of quinoa were inoculated with Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN (CFU = 10⁹) and sown in saline soil (EC 20 dS m⁻¹) amended with biochar (1% w/w). Results revealed that biochar and PsJN particularly when applied together significantly enhanced plant growth, grain yield, and grain nutrient contents of quinoa. Strikingly, iron concentration in quinoa grains was increased up to 71% by the combined application of biochar and PsJN. Moreover, plant physiological parameters were also improved significantly by the integrated application. However, enzymatic/non-enzymatic antioxidants activities were decreased by integrated treatment thus ameliorated salinity stress. Our study suggests that integrated application of siderophore-producing bacteria and biochar could be a promising, sustainable and cost-effective strategy which is easily integratable into the existing farming practices to achieve food fortification with micronutrients in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia phytofirmans 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3abiofortification 3acost effectiveness 3acrops 3adeveloping countries 3aendophytes 3afarming systems 3afood fortification 3agrain yield 3agrains 3airon 3anutrient content 3anutrient deficiencies 3aoxidative stress 3aplant growth 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseeds 3asiderophores 3asolubility1 aRamzan, Natasha 1 aMuṣṭafá, ʻAdnān,1 aSamad, Abdul 1 aNiamat, Bushra 1 aYaseen, Muhammad 1 aAhmad, Zulfiqar 1 aHasanuzzaman, Mirza 1 aSun, Nan 1 aShi, Weiqi 1 aXu, Minggang 0 tAgronomy.g2020 Jan. 24, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy100201683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245008300216300001400299520188800313592002802201650001302229650002402242650002802266650000902294650001602303650001602319650001002335650002202345650002002367650001002387650001402397650002202411651002002433653001902453653001302472653002102485653001502506700002302521773012802544856009002672852000902762655001202771IND60525509320221119085228.0190318e20160616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052550932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamsi, Shokoofeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8606-640012aA revised method of examining fish for infection with zoonotic nematode larvae  ap. 13-16.  aThe infection of fish with zoonotic nematodes, particularly anisakid nematodes is of great interest to many researchers who study food safety, human or animal health or who use them as biological tags for stock assessment studies. Accurate examination of fish for infection with anisakid larvae is crucial in making accurate estimates of their occurrence, abundance and prevalence in their fish hosts. Here we describe a new method of examining fish for infection with these parasites. In 2015, a total of 261 fish were purchased from a fish market in New South Wales, Australia. All fish were first examined by routine visual examination for infection with zoonotic nematode larvae and all data were recorded. Subsequently all internal organs were placed in a container and filled with water and incubated in the room temperature overnight. The prevalence, mean intensity and mean abundance of anisakids were significantly higher (p<0.05) when the revised method of examination, i.e., combining visual examination and overnight incubation in room temperature, was employed (63.98, 8.23 and 5.27, respectively) compared to routine visual examination with or without the aid of a microscope (8.81, 3.78 and 0.33, respectively). The proposed method is effective and has several advantages, such as: not using UV or HCl for fish examination, allowing the examination of a larger number of fish in shorter time; larval specimens collected being suitable for both morphological and DNA sequencing; and being simple and inexpensive. The disadvantages would be the odour of the specimens after overnight incubation as well as not being suitable for use with frozen fish. We suggest that results, conclusions or recommendations made in studies that claim no anisakid/ascaridoid larvae were found in a fish should be approached carefully if it is only based on visual examination of the fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aambient temperature 3aanimal and human health 3afish 3afood safety 3afrozen fish 3ahosts 3ahydrochloric acid 3anematode larvae 3aodors 3aparasites 3asequence analysis 3aNew South Wales 0aSeafood safety 0aZoonoses 0aFish examination 0aAnisakidae1 aSuthar, Jaydipbhai0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2016 June 16, v. 227 p.13-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245016400172300001600336520097700352592002801329650002801357650001201385650002601397650001901423650001601442650001601458650003701474650001101511650000701522650001901529650001601548650001901564653001101583653002001594653001601614653001901630653002401649700001901673700002401692700002301716773013001739856009001869852000901959655001201968IND60525509420221119085221.0190318e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052550942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalai, Safaa10aModelling the effect of temperature, pH, water activity, and organic acids on the germination time of Penicillium camemberti and Penicillium roqueforti conidia  ap. 124-130.  aIn this study, the influence of environmental factors on the germination time of Penicillium camemberti and Penicillium roqueforti conidia was evaluated. To do so, the effects of i/temperature, pH, water activity, and ii/organic acids were determined using models based on i/cardinal values, and ii/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) respectively. Cardinal values for germination of conidia were not observed to be species dependent. Minimum temperatures were estimated to be below the freezing point, with an optimum of 26.9°C, and a maximum of 33.5°C. For both species, minimal and optimal aw values were found to be 0.83 and 0.99, respectively, while for pH these values corresponded to 2.9, and 5.6. MIC values could not be determined for lactic acid because conidia of both species germinated in up to 1M concentrations, the highest concentration tested. At pH5.6, P. camemberti (MIC=0.197M) was more sensitive to propionic acid than P. roqueforti (MIC=0.796M).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium roquefortii 3aconidia 3aenvironmental factors 3afreezing point 3agermination 3alactic acid 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels 3apH 3apropionic acid 3atemperature 3awater activity 0aCheese 0aFungal starters 0aLactic acid 0aPropionic acid 0aPredictive mycology1 aAnzala, Lexane1 aBensoussan, Maurice1 aDantigny, Philippe0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2017 Jan. 02, v. 240 p.124-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245007400177300001600251520104700267592002801314650004701342650002101389650001601410650001401426650001301440650001301453650004301466650001201509700001801521700001901539700002001558700001801578700001701596773011701613856009001730990002301820852000901843655001201852IND60094954820221120231655.0141104e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009495482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2010.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOughton, Matthew10aEvidence of viremia in 2 cases of severe pandemic influenza A H1N1/09  ap. 213-217.  aThe recent pandemic of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infrequently caused severe disease. We describe 2 cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza with rapid progression resulting in respiratory failure and need for prolonged intensive care support. Real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification for influenza A (using a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol) and the 2009 H1N1 influenza (using an in-house protocol) was performed on serial respiratory and serum specimens from both patients collected over 3 weeks. Both patients repeatedly demonstrated 2009 H1N1 influenza in respiratory specimens. Evidence of influenza A viremia was also detected in both cases, although it was confirmed as 2009 H1N1 influenza in only one. The presence of viremia in cases of severe 2009 H1N1 influenza has potential prognostic and therapeutic implications. Detection of viremia may be useful as a predictive marker for severe disease. Antiviral agents with low serum levels may be ineffective if administered to patients with influenza viremia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aantiviral agents 3ablood serum 3ainfluenza 3apandemic 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviremia1 aDascal, Andre1 aLaporta, Denny1 aCharest, Hugues1 aAfilalo, Marc1 aMiller, Mark0 tDiagnostic microbiology & infectious disease.g2011 June, v. 70, no. 2 p.213-217dElsevier Inc.x0732-88937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2010.12.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014900169300001800318520118900336592002801525650002101553650001801574650002201592650001201614650000901626650001501635650001801650650001401668650002301682653002701705653002601732653002401758653001301782700001401795700001701809700001801826700001501844700002001859773013001879856008502009852000902094655001202103IND60530927420221120181058.0160723e20160606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053092742DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b002552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhaoshu10aSustainable Composites from Biodegradable Polyester Modified with Camelina Meal: Synergistic Effects of Multicomponents on Ductility Enhancement  ap. 3228-3234.  aBiodegradable composites were prepared via a melt compression molding process with dehulled camelina meal (DeCM) as the biomass-based filler and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P(3,4)HB) or poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) as the aliphatic polyester matrix. The incorporation of 25 parts DeCM into the composite promoted an impressive increase of 461% in the elongation at break of the P(3,4)HB-based composites. Concurrently, the elongation at break of PBS-based composites containing 20 parts of DeCM increased by 71% over the neat materials. Extraction of components from the DeCM (oil and protein) showed that oil had a critical plasticization effect that enhanced the ductility of the composites. Compared with neat materials, the presence of DeCM filler had no significant effect on the thermal properties of the composites and preserved the original crystalline structure of the polyester component in the composites. Renewable, economical, and biodegradable DeCM is a promising functional biomass-based filler for polyester-based composites, and it is worth noting that the synergistic effects of multicomponents in DeCM played a key role in ductility enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acamelina meal 3acrystal structure 3amelting 3aoils 3apolyesters 3asuccinic acid 3asynergism 3athermal properties 0aSustainable composites 0aMechanical properties 0aRenewable resources 0aCamelina1 aLin, Ning1 aGao, Shanjun1 aLiu, Changhua1 aHuang, Jin1 aChang, Peter R.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 June 06, v. 4, no. 6 p.3228-3234dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b002553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245025600164506011700420506007600537520156300613592002802176506003702204650001602241650002502257650001302282650001602295650001302311650003502324650002302359650002002382650002402402650002002426650001502446650001402461650002002475650001202495650002102507650002502528650002502553650001802578650001602596653003502612653002302647653002302670653002102693653002702714700001602741700001702757700001802774700001602792700001602808700001802824700001602842773010002858856008402958852000903042655001203051IND60736484420221207100028.0220704e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073648442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yuanfa10aReplacing fishmeal with cottonseed protein concentrate in feed for pearl gentian groupers (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀ × E. lanceolatus♂): Effects on growth and expressions of key genes involved in appetite and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study investigated the effects of replacing the fish meal (FM) in a 55 % FM fish feed with cottonseed protein concentrate (CPC) in pearl gentian groupers (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀ × E. lanceolatus♂). Effects on growth and the expression of key genes involved in appetite and hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism Four isoproteic and isolipidic diets were formulated containing 0 %, 6.06 %, 18.18 %, or 30.30 % CPC by replacing 0 % (FM, control), 10 % (CPC10), 30 % (CPC30), and 50 % (CPC50) of the FM in the feed, respectively. Each diet was fed to fish raised in triplicate groups for 56 days. No significant differences in specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, or survival rate were found among dietary treatments. The weight gain in CPC groups was no different than in controls (P < 0.05). Fish fed the CPC50 diet had higher body lipid contents than others (P < 0.05) and the highest activity of hepatic fatty acid synthase, which was significantly higher than in group CPC10 (P < 0.05). The livers of CPC50 fish had significantly higher mRNA expression levels of apolipoprotein B-100, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and PPARγ genes compared to other groups except CPC30 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, up to 50 % of the FM in fish feed can be replaced with CPC without adversely affecting the growth and feed utilization of pearl gentian groupers. However, 50 % replacement increased body lipid contents via modulation of hepatic lipid metabolism-related genes and enzyme activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEpinephelus 3aapolipoprotein B-100 3aappetite 3aaquaculture 3abody fat 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3acottonseed protein 3aenzyme activity 3afatty-acid synthase 3afeed conversion 3afish feeds 3afish meal 3agene expression 3aglucose 3alipid metabolism 3aprotein concentrates 3aspecific growth rate 3asurvival rate 3aweight gain 0aCottonseed protein concentrate 0aGlucose metabolism 0aGrowth performance 0aLipid metabolism 0aPearl gentian groupers1 aGuo, Xinwei1 aTan, Beiping1 aDong, Xiaohui1 aYang, Qihui1 aLiu, Hongyu1 aZhang, Shuang1 aChi, Shuyan0 tAquaculture reports.g2021 July, v. 20 p.100710-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010500173300001400278520205100292592002802343650002202371650001502393650000902408650001802417650001402435650001502449650001602464650001402480650002202494650001102516650002002527650001302547650000902560650001102569650001802580700001902598700002002617773009202637856008502729990002302814852000902837655001202846IND60093526320221119102649.0141103e20110107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009352632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2010.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlessi, Daniel S.10aUncertainties in determining microbial biomass C using the chloroform fumigation–extraction method  ap. 58-64.  aWe tested the accuracy of the chloroform fumigation–extraction method, which is commonly used to determine soil biomass C concentrations. Accurate and precise determination of total microbial biomass is important in order to characterize soil properties and to develop predictive metal transport models for soils. Two natural soils, and individual soil components, including silica sand, montmorillonite, kaolinite, a humic acid, and Bacillus subtilis bacterial cells, were fumigated for 24h. Following the fumigation, C from fumigated and unfumigated samples was extracted using a 0.5M K₂SO₄ solution. The difference between the C content in the fumigated and unfumigated samples ideally represents C due to biomass because the fumigation procedure should lyse cells and release biomass C. We observed increased C release upon fumigation for bacteria-only samples, confirming the ability of fumigation to lyse cells. There was no difference in extracted C concentration between fumigated and unfumigated samples of silica sand and of humic acid, confirming that the fumigation process does not introduce additional organic C to samples of these soil components. However, the fumigated clay samples both showed increased C release relative to the unfumigated controls, indicating that significant concentrations of the fumigant, chloroform, adsorbed onto the clay minerals studied here. Additionally, we found significant chloroform remaining in the extracts from two fumigated natural soils. Attempts to remove the chloroform from the soils or soil components prior to extraction by increasing the evacuation time, or to remove chloroform in the extracts by sparging them vigorously with nitrogen gas, both failed. This research reveals that chloroform gas may adsorb significantly to clays and the clay fraction of natural soils. Thus, the fumigation–extraction method must be corrected to account for the added chloroform C and accurately assess the concentration of biomass C in soils that contain significant concentrations of clays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3achloroform 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3afumigants 3afumigation 3ahumic acids 3akaolinite 3amicrobial biomass 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3anitrogen 3asand 3asilica 3asoil sampling1 aWalsh, Dana M.1 aFein, Jeremy B.0 tChemical geology.g2011 Jan. 7, v. 280, no. 1-2 p.58-64dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2010.10.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245007300207300001800280506007600298520130900374592002801683506003701711650002201748650000801770650001101778650001101789650002001800650001801820650002501838650002101863650002201884650001201906653001801918653001401936653002001950653002601970700002001996700002002016700002002036700002202056700002202078700002002100773019202120856007902312852000902391655001202400IND60230354320221207061941.0150614e20150324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023035432DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14162661122doi7 aPMC43783952pmcid7 a257755472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauger, David M.10aFunctionally conserved architecture of hepatitis C virus RNA genomes  ap. 3692-3697.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHepatitis C virus (HCV) infects over 170 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of liver disease and cancer. The virus has a 9,650-nt, single-stranded, messenger-sense RNA genome that is infectious as an independent entity. The RNA genome has evolved in response to complex selection pressures, including the need to maintain structures that facilitate replication and to avoid clearance by cell-intrinsic immune processes. Here we used high-throughput, single-nucleotide resolution information to generate and functionally test data-driven structural models for three diverse HCV RNA genomes. We identified, de novo, multiple regions of conserved RNA structure, including all previously characterized cis -acting regulatory elements and also multiple novel structures required for optimal viral fitness. Well-defined RNA structures in the central regions of HCV genomes appear to facilitate persistent infection by masking the genome from RNase L and double-stranded RNA-induced innate immune sensors. This work shows how structure-first comparative analysis of entire genomes of a pathogenic RNA virus enables comprehensive and concise identification of regulatory elements and emphasizes the extensive interrelationships among RNA genome structure, viral biology, and innate immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis C virus 3aRNA 3agenome 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3apathogenicity 3aregulatory sequences 3aviral morphology 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aRNA structure 0aevolution 0amotif discovery 0afunctional validation1 aGolden, Michael1 aYamane, Daisuke1 aWilliford, Sara1 aLemon, Stanley M.1 aMartin, Darren P.1 aWeeks, Kevin M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Mar. 24, v. 112, no. 12 p.3692-3697dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14162661123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011000171300001600281520229300297592002802590650001602618650002002634650001002654650002002664650001102684650001302695650001602708650001202724650001502736650000902751650001602760650001102776650002102787653001002808653002502818653001602843653001502859653001402874700002402888700002402912700002302936700002802959700002902987773010703016856008503123852000903208655001203217IND60597321620221120093535.0201202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059732162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzmina, Nina S.10aGene hypermethylation in blood leukocytes in humans long term after radiation exposure – Validation set  ap. 935-942.  aHypermethylation of СpG islands in the promoter regions of several genes with basic protective function in blood leukocytes of individuals exposed to ionizing radiation long time ago (2–46 years), and differential effects of age and radiation exposure on hypermethylation was reported in our previous work. To validate these results, epigenetic modifications were assessed in an independent series of 49 nuclear industry workers from the “Mayak” facility (67–84 years old at sampling) with documented individual accumulated doses from the prolonged external γ-radiation exposure (95.9–409.5 cGy, end of work with radiation:0.3–39 years ago), and in 50 non-exposed persons matched by age. In addition to the genes analyzed before (RASSF1A, p16/INK4A, p14/ARF, GSTP1), four additional loci were analyzed: TP53, ATM, SOD3, ESR1. The frequency of individuals displaying promoter methylation of at least one of the 8 genes (71.4%) was significantly higher in exposed group as compared to the control group (40%), p = .002, OR = 3.75. A significantly elevated frequency of individuals with hypermethylated СpG islands in GSTP1, TP53, SOD3 promoters was revealed among exposed subjects as compared to the control group (p = .012, OR = 8.41; p = .041, OR = 4.02 and p = .009, OR = 3.42, respectively). A similar trend (p = .12, OR = 3.06) was observed for the p16/INK4A gene. As a whole, p16/INK4A and GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation in irradiated subjects from both previously and currently analyzed groups was pronounced. Thus, the direction of the effects was fully confirmed, suggesting the result reproducibility. No statistically significant correlation between promoter methylation and individual radiation dose was found. Further studies are required to create an array of blood epigenetic markers of radiation exposure associating with premature aging and age-related diseases and to accurately evaluate radiation-added effect across the range of doses.The results of studies of epigenetic changes in two independent samples of irradiated subjects indicated the significance of radiation factor in the induction of hypermethylation of CpG islands in gene promoters that is revealed in blood cells years and decades after exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3agamma radiation 3agenes 3agenomic islands 3ahumans 3aindustry 3airradiation 3aislands 3aleukocytes 3aloci 3amethylation 3apeople 3apromoter regions 0aHuman 0aDNA hypermethylation 0aCpG islands 0aLeukocytes 0aRadiation1 aLapteva, Nellya Sh.1 aRusinova, Galina G.1 aAzizova, Tamara V.1 aVyazovskaya, Natalya S.1 aRubanovich, Alexander V.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Mar., v. 234 p.935-942dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001800158245012200176300001400298520106800312592002801380650001301408650001601421650001501437650002001452650002001472650001601492650001101508650001601519650001601535650002501551700001701576700001701593700001901610700001601629700001501645773011101660856009201771990002301863852000901886655001201895IND60114035020221116225012.0141112e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011403502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2011.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansell, J.P.10aLysophosphatidic acid and calcitriol co-operate to promote human osteoblastogenesis: Requirement of albumin-bound LPA  ap. 45-52.  aLysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a pleiotropic signalling lipid is assuming growing significance in osteoblast biology. Although committed osteoblasts from several mammalian species are receptive to LPA far less is known about the potential for LPA to influence osteoblast formation from their mesenchymal progenitors. An essential factor for both bone development and post-natal bone growth and homeostasis is the active metabolite of vitamin D3, calcitriol (D3). Previously we reported how a combination of LPA and D3 synergistically co-operated to enhance the differentiation of immature human osteoblasts. Herein we provide evidence for the formation of human osteoblasts from multiple, primary human bone marrow derived stromal (stem) cells (hBMSCs). Importantly osteoblast development from hBMSCs only occurred when LPA was administered as a complex with albumin, its natural carrier. Collectively our findings support a co-operative role of LPA and D3 in osteoblastogenesis, findings which may aid the development of novel treatment strategies for bone repair.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3abone marrow 3acalcitriol 3acholecalciferol 3adevelopment aid 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3aosteoblasts 3askeletal development1 aNowghani, M.1 aPabbruwe, M.1 aPaterson, I.C.1 aSmith, A.J.1 aBlom, A.W.0 tPROSTAGLANDINS & OTHER LIPID MEDIATORS.g2011 Aug., v. 95, no. 1-4 p.45-52dElsevier Inc.x1098-88237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2011.05.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245013600180300001800316520102200334592002801356650001401384650001601398650001401414650002201428650001301450650001501463650001801478650001601496653002401512653002501536653002101561653002201582653001201604653001801616700002201634700001701656700002001673773013001693856008501823852000901908655001201917IND60530927620221120181006.0160723e20160606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053092762DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b002802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorrente-Murciano, Laura10aBiphasic Epoxidation Reaction in the Absence of SurfactantsIntegration of Reaction and Separation Steps in Microtubular Reactors  ap. 3245-3249.  aThis paper presents a paradigm shift with respect to the current direction of biphasic reactions in surfactant-free emulsions. Herein, the contact area between both phases is simply sustained by the reactor design (i.e., diameter of the tubular reactor) compared to the current trend of using reversible/switchable emulsions where the addition of an external agent (e.g., bistable surfactant, magnetic particles, etc.) is required. In this way, temporally stable phase dispersions using microtubular reactors facilitate the integration of reaction and separation steps in biphasic systems without the need for energy-intensive downstream separation steps. In this study, we demonstrate this innovative tool in the epoxidation reaction of sunflower oil with hydrogen peroxide. Using a combination of mechanistic and kinetic studies, we demonstrate that the poor solubility of the catalytic species in the oil phase may be used advantageously, allowing ready recyclability of catalyst (and oxidant) in consecutive runs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adispersions 3aemulsions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidants 3asolubility 3asunflower oil 3asurfactants 0aProcess integration 0aMultiphase reactions 0aGreen oxidations 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aDroplet 0aMicroreactors1 aBishopp, Simon

The byproduct HTC process liquid often contains a very high total organic carbon (TOC). Various toxic organic compounds (e.g., phenol, furfural, 5-HMF, etc.) can be found in HTC process liquid. As a result, the HTC process liquid often requires further treatment prior to discharge into the environment. In this study, wet air oxidation (WAO) is applied to process liquid produced from HTC of dairy manure and wastewater biosolids. Different oxygen loadings (25 and 50 atm partial pressure) were charged for WAO at 260 °C for 30 min. Furthermore, the oxidation capability of copper oxide (CuO) was evaluated at the same temperature and time. In all cases, the resulting liquid product was clear and has reduced TOC.

However, it is unknown if HCT commonly contributes to the diversification of pathotypes. Using comparative genomics and pathogenicity phenotyping, we explored the role of HCT in the evolution of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae, the cause of Fusarium wilt of strawberry, with isolates from four continents. We observed two distinct syndromes: one included chlorosis (‘yellows‐fragariae’) and the other did not (‘wilt‐fragariae’). All yellows‐fragariae isolates carried a predicted pathogenicity chromosome, ‘chrY‐ᶠʳᵃᵍ’, that was horizontally transferred at least four times. chrY‐ᶠʳᵃᵍ was associated with virulence on specific cultivars and encoded predicted effectors that were highly upregulated during infection. chrY‐ᶠʳᵃᵍ was not present in wilt‐fragariae; isolates causing this syndrome evolved pathogenicity independently. All origins of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae occurred outside of the host’s native range. Our data support the conclusion that HCT is widespread in F. oxysporum, but pathogenicity can also evolve independently. The absence of chrY‐ᶠʳᵃᵍ in wilt‐fragariae suggests that multiple, distinct pathogenicity chromosomes can confer the same host specificity. The wild progenitors of cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) did not co‐evolve with this pathogen, yet we discovered several sources of genetic resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia Strawberry Commission  aRTI2018‐094537‐B‐I00cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades of Spain Project  a2017‐51181‐26833cUSDA NIFA Specialty Crops Research Initiative  cNational Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program 3aFragaria ananassa 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3achlorosis 3achromosome transmission 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic resistance 3agenomics 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3aphenotype 3astrawberries 3avirulence1 aPincot, Dominique D.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6463-12131 aJenner, Bradley N.1 aBorrero, Celia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6624-25181 aAviles, Manuel1 aNam, Myeong‐Hyeon1 aEpstein, Lynn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8697-12271 aKnapp, Steven J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6498-54091 aGordon, Thomas R.0 tnew phytologist.g2021 Apr., v. 230, no. 1 p.327-340dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/72988313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.171413Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245018600165300001800351520144800369592002801817596005901845650002201904650003701926650002201963650001701985650002002002650002102022650002202043650002302065650002002088650002002108650001702128650001102145650002602156650003402182650001202216650001802228650001802246650001002264650000902274650002402283650002802307650001902335650001802354650001602372650001002388700001702398700001902415700001802434700001202452700001602464700002102480700005602501773010702557856008202664852000902746655001202755IND60647738820221119093824.0190620e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064773882DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-18-1387-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chun-Xia10aTreatment With Wheat Root Exudates and Soil Microorganisms From Wheat/Watermelon Companion Cropping Can Induce Watermelon Disease Resistance Against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum  ap. 1693-1702.  aCompanion cropping with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can enhance watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai] wilt disease resistance against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum. However, the mechanism of resistance induction remains unknown. In this study, the effects of microbial community dynamics and the interactions between wheat and watermelon plants, particularly the effect of wheat root exudates on watermelon resistance against F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum, were examined using a plant-soil feedback trial and plant tissue culture approach. The plant-soil feedback trial showed that treating watermelon with soil from wheat/watermelon companion cropping decreased watermelon wilt disease incidence and severity, increased lignin biosynthesis- and defense-related gene expression, and increased β-1,3-glucanase activity in watermelon roots. Furthermore, soil microbes can contribute to increasing disease resistance in watermelon plants. Tissue culture experiments showed that both exogenous addition of wheat root exudates and companion cropping with wheat increased host defense gene expression, lignin and total phenols, and increased β-1,3-glucanase activity in watermelon roots. In conclusion, both root exudates from wheat and the related soil microorganisms in a wheat/watermelon companion cropping system played critical roles in enhancing resistance to watermelon wilt disease induced by F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum.  aPublisher supplied data  a31471917cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiosynthesis 3acompanion crops 3acropping systems 3adisease incidence 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aglycosidases 3alignin 3amicrobial communities 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aphenols 3aplant tissues 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil-plant interactions 3atissue culture 3avascular wilt 3awatermelons 3awheat1 aFu, Xue-Peng1 aZhou, Xin-Gang1 aLiu, Shou-Wei1 aXia, Ye1 aLi, Nai-Hui1 aZhang, Xiao-Xiao1 aWu, Feng-Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0694-31170 tPlant disease.g2019 July, v. 103, no. 7 p.1693-1702dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-08-18-1387-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008900167300001400256520109500270592002801365650001401393650001201407650002101419650002101440650001701461650002901478650001101507650001501518653002401533653002501557653002401582653002201606653002101628700001801649700002101667700002401688700002101712700002001733700001601753700002701769700001801796700002001814773012201834856008201956852000902038655001202047IND60469425320221122154055.0200513e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046942532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-015-0510-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicard, Nicolas10aError in the estimation of emission factors for forest degradation in central Africa  ap. 23-30.  aThe implementation of forest-based projects to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions requires the estimation of emission factors (here the difference in biomass stocks between two forest types). The estimation of these quantities using forest inventory data and allometric models implies different sources of errors that need to be prioritized to improve the precision of estimation. Using data from permanent sample plots in a tropical moist forest in central Africa and considering four allometric models with equal likelihood, the largest source of error in the estimate of the difference of biomass between intact and logged-over forest was that due to the model choice (40 % of the sum of squares). The error due to the model choice did not cancel out in the difference due to an interaction between the model's prediction and the diameter structure of the forest. The variability in biomass between plots was the second largest source of error, but was underestimated because of post-stratification. The error due to the model choice could be reduced by weighting the models' predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3abiomass 3aemissions factor 3aforest inventory 3aforest types 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3aprediction 0aAboveground biomass 0aAfrican moist forest 0aAllometric equation 0aError propagation 0aPrediction error1 aHenry, Matieu1 aFonton, Noël H.1 aKondaoulé, Josiane1 aFayolle, Adeline1 aBirigazzi, Luca1 aSola, Gaël1 aPoultouchidou, Anatoli1 aTrotta, Carlo1 aMaïdou, Hervé0 tJournal of forest research.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 21, no. 1 p.23-30dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-015-0510-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009500165300001400260520136000274592002801634650001601662650001501678650001501693650001101708650002101719650001101740653001901751653002401770653001601794653002601810653003201836653001001868700001801878700001501896700001401911700001901925700005801944700001702002700001602019700001402035773012302049856008202172852000902254655001202263IND60605897520221122085510.0180723e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060589752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2016.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaojun,10aVertically porous nickel thin film supported Mn3O4 for enhanced energy storage performance  ap. 17-25.  aThree-dimensionally porous metal materials are often used as the current collectors and support for the active materials of supercapacitors. However, the applications of vertically porous metal materials in supercapacitors are rarely reported, and the effect of vertically porous metal materials on the energy storage performance of supported metal oxides is not explored. To this end, the Mn3O4-vertically porous nickel (VPN) electrodes are fabricated via a template-free method. The Mn3O4-VPN electrode shows much higher volumetric specific capacitances than that of flat nickel film supported Mn3O4 with the same loading under the same measurement conditions. The volumetric specific capacitance of the vertically porous nickel supported Mn3O4 electrode can reach 533Fcm⁻³ at the scan rate of 2mVs⁻¹. The fabricated flexible all-solid microsupercapacitor based on the interdigital Mn3O4-VPN electrode has a volumetric specific capacitance of 110Fcm⁻³ at the current density of 20μAcm⁻². The capacitance retention rate of this microsupercapacitor reaches 95% after 5000 cycles under the current density of 20μAcm⁻².

However, major research questions, including whether polyploidy is important to long‐term evolution or is just ‘evolutionary noise’, remain unresolved due to difficulties associated with the generation and analysis of data from polyploid lineages. Many of these difficulties have been recently overcome, such that it is now often relatively straightforward to infer the full and often reticulate phylogenetic history of groups with recently formed polyploids. This nascent field of ‘polyploid phylogenetics’ allows researchers to tackle long‐standing questions of polyploid macroevolution, supplies the foundation for mechanistic models of ploidy change, and provides the opportunity to include a more complete and representative sample of plant taxa in our analyses in general.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity Herbarium and Department of Integrative Biology, UC Berkeley.  cUC Berkeley 3aphylogeny 3apolyploidy 3aspecies diversity0 tnew phytologist.g2021 Apr., v. 230, no. 1 p.66-72dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.171053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245009400212300001600306500001100322520141900333592002801752596004301780650001601823650002101839650002001860650001001880650001101890650001401901650001101915773012001926856008202046852000902128655001202137IND60749186320221119141223.0210831e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074918632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00294-021-01180-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaribee, R.

Delineating this molecular circuitry remains essential for understanding how organisms adapt to environmental flux, and it is critical for determining how dysregulation of these mechanisms causes disease. Ccr4-Not is a highly conserved regulatory complex that controls all aspects of the gene expression process. Recent studies in budding yeast have identified novel roles for Ccr4-Not as a key regulator of core nutrient signaling pathways that control cell growth and proliferation, including signaling through the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) pathway. Herein, I will review the current evidence that implicate Ccr4-Not in nutrient signaling regulation, and I will discuss important unanswered questions that should help guide future efforts to delineate Ccr4-Not’s role in linking environmental signaling with the gene regulatory machinery. Ccr4-Not is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes, and increasing evidence indicates it is dysregulated in a variety of diseases. Determining how Ccr4-Not regulates these signaling pathways in model organisms such as yeast will provide a guide for defining how it controls these processes in human cells.  aPublisher supplied data  aR21CA233028cNational Cancer Institute 3acell growth 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3arapamycin 3ayeasts0 tCurrent genetics.g2021 Oct., v. 67, no. 5 p.707-713dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl32278x0172-80837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-021-01180-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245019500212300001100407520180300418592002802221596009502249650002102344650001702365650001902382650002102401650001302422650002602435650002002461650001102481650001502492650000902507650002402516650001002540651002202550651001002572700002202582773011002604856008202714852000902796655001202805IND60590609120221119083937.0190314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059060912DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-018-0702-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Tirado, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5088-043810aPredicting suitability of forest dynamics to future climatic conditions: the likely dominance of Holm oak [Quercus ilex subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.] and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.)  ap. 19.  aKEY MESSAGE: Composite logistic regression models simulating the potential effect of global climate change on forests dynamics in the southern Iberian Peninsula identify Holm oak [ Quercus ilex subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.] and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) as the chief beneficiaries of the anticipated environmental shifts, whereas other oak species and conifers suffer a decline. CONTEXT: The ten most important tree species (five oaks and five conifers) in Southern Spain were selected for the study. The study area, corresponding to the region of Andalusia, is located in an interesting position between Central European and North African climates. The territory also exhibits the most extreme patterns of rainfall in the Iberian Peninsula. AIMS: This study aims to model the potential distribution of the ten species in response to climate change, in several time periods, including the present and two future twenty-first century dates. METHODS: The potential distributions within the different scenarios were simulated using logistic regression techniques based on a set of 19 climate variables from the WorldClim 1.4 project. The scenarios were drawn from the RCP 2.6 and 6.0 in the CCSM4 Global Circulation Model. The resolution of the output maps was 30 arc-seconds. RESULTS: The simulation predicted increased distribution areas for Q. ilex and P. halepensis under the four future scenarios as compared to present. The eight remaining taxa suffered a severe retraction in potential distribution. CONCLUSION: Global climate change is likely to have a significant impact on forest dynamics in southern Spain. Only two species would benefit to the detriment of the others. Logistic Regression is identified as a robust method for carrying out management and conservation programmes.  aPublisher supplied data  aP10-RNM-6013cConsejería de Economía, Innovación, Ciencia y Empleo, Junta de Andalucía 3aPinus halepensis 3aQuercus ilex 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aconifers 3aconservation programs 3aforest dynamics 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3aregression analysis 3atrees 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain1 aHidalgo, Pablo J.0 tAnnals of forest science.g2018 Mar., v. 75, no. 1 p.19-19dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-018-0702-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05715naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005400149245010100203300001300304520378200317592002804099596006504127650001604192650001304208650002104221650002604242650001604268650001604284650001204300650001804312650002704330650001604357650001404373650001604387650001004403650001404413650001604427650001104443650001304454650002104467650001304488650002004501650001804521650001304539650001904552650001304571650001304584650001804597650001804615650002704633650001004660650001604670650001304686650001104699651001004710653002304720700001504743700001304758700001604771700001404787700001704801773010704818856008304925852000905008655001205017IND60647738920221119093829.0190620e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064773892DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-18-1413-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Y.

Its high nutritional value has led to its expanded cultivation in recent years. In January 2016, a powdery mildew disease was found on cultivar PKM1 in a Moringa greenhouse in Jinghong, Yunnan Province (100°46′13.23″N; 22°00′44.87″E). The infection lasted the whole year and peaked in the winter season (average temperature 19°C). Nearly 80% of the greenhouse Moringa plants were infected by this infection that caused severe crop damage. The initial symptom appeared as white thin fungal colonies. As the disease progressed, the abaxial surface of leaves, petioles, and stems were covered by cottony masses of mycelium and conidia. Eventually leaves showed yellowing followed by rapid senescence and defoliation. Hyphae, conidiophores, and conidia of fresh materials were sampled from the leaf surface with a clear adhesive tape. The hyphae were hyaline, septate, branched, 3.3 to 8.2 µm (n = 50; average 5.6 μm) wide. Appressoria were single and multilobed. The conidiophores were straight or occasionally flexuous, 78.6 to 157.7 × 7.5 to 12.0 μm (n = 27; average 112.2 × 9.4 μm), with one to three cylindrical foot cells of 34.0 to 66.9 × 6.3 to 10.8 μm. Conidia were borne solitarily on the top of conidiophores. Conidia were hyaline, ellipsoidal, 38.5 to 55.1 × 15.1 to 24.7 μm (n = 106; average 46.4 × 19.9 μm), without fibrosin bodies, and produced a subterminal germ tube. The sexual morph was not observed. Based on morphological characteristics, the fungus was identified as Oidium neolycopersici (Kiss et al. 2001), which was recently renamed Pseudoidium neolycopersici (Kiss et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2015). To confirm species identification, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene cluster were amplified from the isolate. The primers ITS5 and P3 were used for the first round of amplification. One microliter of the first reaction mixture was then used for the second amplification and sequencing, using the partially nested primer pairs ITS5 and ITS4. The resulting ITS sequence (669 bp) was deposited (MH699867) in GenBank. Similarly, its partial 28S rDNA region was amplified with LSU1/LSU2 primers, sequenced, and deposited in GenBank (MH699868). Nucleotide BLAST analysis showed 99% identity with multiple O. neolycopersici accessions (KC213756, KX776199, AB808656, AB808583, and AB808582) for ITS and 99% with P. neolycopersici (KR069049.1) for 28S. On the basis of morphological and molecular analyses, the isolate was identified as P. neolycopersici. Pathogenicity of the fungus was confirmed by performing Koch’s postulates as follows. Healthy 30-day-old Moringa (clone PKM1) plants were inoculated by gently pressing diseased leaves onto 15 leaves of a healthy potted plant. The experiments were conducted on five plants. Five noninoculated plants of the same age served as controls. Inoculated and control plants were maintained in separate compartments in a greenhouse with average temperature at 26°C and were monitored for symptoms. After 5 to 10 days, five inoculated plants developed powdery mildew symptoms similar to those observed on the naturally infected plants, whereas control plants remained symptomless. The isolate presented on the inoculated plants was morphologically and genetically identical to that originally observed on diseased plants. Until now, Oidium sp. and Erysiphe sp. were reported to occur on M. oleifera in China (Jiang et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2017). To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by P. neolycopersici on M. oleifera in China. Identification and differentiation of these disease agents are essential for their control.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-11-03AcModern Agro-industry Technology Research System 3aDNA primers 3aErysiphe 3aMoringa oleifera 3aOidium neolycopersici 3aamino acids 3aappressoria 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3acontainer-grown plants 3acrop damage 3acultivars 3adefoliation 3afungi 3agerm tube 3agreenhouses 3alipids 3aminerals 3amultigene family 3amycelium 3anutritive value 3apathogenicity 3apetioles 3apowdery mildew 3apressing 3aproteins 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3aspecies identification 3astems 3atemperature 3avitamins 3awinter 3aChina 0apathogen detection1 aCai, Z.

A systematic literature review was undertaken of peer‐reviewed and grey literature published between 2001 and 2013, focusing on the post‐release needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults and pre‐ and post‐release programs. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have high health and social support needs on leaving prison. There is little literature evidence that re‐entry programs commonly consider health needs, support linkages with primary care or Aboriginal Medical Services, or are designed in consideration of the particular needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In the absence of evaluative evidence on re‐entry programs in this group, we have synthesised the best practice recommendations. Re‐entry programs must be culturally competent in design and delivery, holistic, take a long‐term view, involve families and communities, demonstrate interagency coordination and promote linkages between prison and community‐based services. There is an urgent need for accessible pre‐ and post‐release programs which meet the particular needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including their health needs. Programs must be flexible, comprehensive and accessible to those on remand or with short sentences. Stronger linkage with primary care and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health organisations is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acorrectional institutions 3ahealth services 3aindigenous peoples 3arural health 3asocial support1 aLloyd, Jane E.1 aJoshi, Chandni1 aMalera‐Bandjalan, Kathy1 aBaldry, Eileen1 aMcEntyre, Elizabeth1 aSherwood, Juanita1 aReath, Jennifer1 aIndig, Devon1 aHarris, Mark F.0 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2018 Feb., v. 26, no. 1 p.6-13dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000053x1038-52827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.123963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010000163300001800263520227500281592002802556650002402584650002002608650000902628650001602637650002202653700002102675700002002696700002202716700002002738700002302758700001302781700002102794700001902815700001702834700002102851773011202872856007502984852000903059655001203068IND60529102320221119004148.0160717e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052910232DNAL7 a10.1021/ac301567t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShard, Alexander G.10aArgon Cluster Ion Beams for Organic Depth Profiling: Results from a VAMAS Interlaboratory Study  ap. 7865-7873.  aThe depth profiling of organic materials with argon cluster ion sputtering has recently become widely available with several manufacturers of surface analytical instrumentation producing sources suitable for surface analysis. In this work, we assess the performance of argon cluster sources in an interlaboratory study under the auspices of VAMAS (Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards). The results are compared to a previous study that focused on C₆₀q⁺ cluster sources using similar reference materials. Four laboratories participated using time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry for analysis, three of them using argon cluster sputtering sources and one using a C₆₀⁺ cluster source. The samples used for the study were organic multilayer reference materials consisting of a ∼400-nm-thick Irganox 1010 matrix with ∼1 nm marker layers of Irganox 3114 at depths of ∼50, 100, 200, and 300 nm. In accordance with a previous report, argon cluster sputtering is shown to provide effectively constant sputtering yields through these reference materials. The work additionally demonstrates that molecular secondary ions may be used to monitor the depth profile and depth resolutions approaching a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 5 nm can be achieved. The participants employed energies of 2.5 and 5 keV for the argon clusters, and both the sputtering yields and depth resolutions are similar to those extrapolated from C₆₀⁺ cluster sputtering data. In contrast to C₆₀⁺ cluster sputtering, however, a negligible variation in sputtering yield with depth was observed and the repeatability of the sputtering yields obtained by two participants was better than 1%. We observe that, with argon cluster sputtering, the position of the marker layers may change by up to 3 nm, depending on which secondary ion is used to monitor the material in these layers, which is an effect not previously visible with C₆₀⁺ cluster sputtering. We also note that electron irradiation, used for charge compensation, can induce molecular damage to areas of the reference samples well beyond the analyzed region that significantly affects molecular secondary-ion intensities in the initial stages of a depth profile in these materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3ainstrumentation 3aions 3airradiation 3amass spectrometry1 aHavelund, Rasmus1 aSeah, Martin

However, until now very little is known about their role in nutrient assimilation, particularly amino acids, which are important compounds due to their high N content. Here we show that the addition of flavonoid secondary metabolites, derived from clover, to soil changed the bacterial diversity, enhanced the flux of asparagine, and increased the pools of glutamine/glutamate in the soil. This indicates that flavonoids are functionally important qualitative and quantitative components of clover root exudates. Furthermore, the addition of microbial secondary metabolites negatively affected clover uptake of asparagine and plant performance, which demonstrates that microbial competition for nutrients may have multiple physiological targets in the plant. Finally, the detection of intact asparagine in clover roots confirms that amino acid uptake is significant to the plant in agricultural soil. In conclusion, amino-acid flow in the clover rhizosphere can be modified by the effects of clover-derived flavonoids on the bacterial community structure, which affects the flux and pools of amino acids; microbial secondary metabolites, which reduce clover uptake of asparagine; and direct recapture of amino acids by clover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium repens 3aagricultural soils 3aasparagine 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aflavonoids 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3amicrobial competition 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3arhizosphere 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 0aAsparagine 0aStable isotopes 0aFlavonoids 0a2,4-Diacetylphloroglucinol 0aPhenazine 0aBacterial community structure1 aRasmussen, Jim1 aLaursen, Bente B.1 aVidkjær, Nanna Hjort1 aSapkota, Rumakanta1 aNicolaisen, Mogens1 aFomsgaard, Inge S.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 Aug., v. 123 p.54-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245017000171300001500341520160900356592002801965650002201993650001202015650001002027650002602037650001302063650002602076650001002102650001802112650002802130650001102158650000902169650001802178650001602196650001302212650001302225650001302238650002302251653002402274653001602298653001302314653001302327653001602340700002102356700001702377700001602394700001402410773012202424856008902546852000902635655001202644IND60623006520221123025354.0190410e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062300652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, Xinlong12aA novel synthesis of selenium nanoparticles encapsulated PLGA nanospheres with curcumin molecules for the inhibition of amyloid β aggregation in Alzheimer's disease  ap. 98-102.  aThe main factors of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the cerebral accumulation and the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques. The Aβ peptides are highly able to accumulative and produce fibrils that are placed to form these plaques in the AD. The biological action and drug delivery properties of curcumin (Cur) nanoformulation in the Alzheimer's disease therapeutics can be developed by the altering surface of the Poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) polymer and encapsulation of selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs). The morphological structure, size distributions of nanospheres, chemical interactions between the polymer and nanoformulations of synthesized curcumin and Se NPs loaded PLGA nanospheres have been studied by using the techniques of analytical instruments. The microscopic and nano observation results of synthesized Cur loaded nanospheres are exhibited that the mono-dispersed distributions of particles with spherical shaped structure. The present drug delivery system of Cur loaded Se-PLGA nanospheres could be decreases the amyloid-β load in the brains samples of AD mice, and greatly cured the memory deficiency of the model mice. The specific binding of Cur loaded Se-PLGA nanospheres with Aβ plaques were visualized by fluorescence microscopic technique. Se-PLGA targeting delivery system to amyloid plaques might be providing the enhanced therapeutic efficacy in AD lesions, which was studied by using transgenic mice (5XFAD). In conclusion, Cur loaded Se-PLGA nanoformulation has been demonstrated that valued delivery system for the targeted delivery and effective way to treat AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3abrain 3achemical interactions 3acurcumin 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence microscopy 3amemory 3amice 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3apeptides 3apolymers 3aselenium 3atransgenic animals 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aNanospheres 0aCurcumin 0aSelenium 0aAβ plaques1 aZhang, Yongqiang1 aJin, Xinchun1 aLi, Yongang1 aZhang, Li0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2019 Jan., v. 190 p.98-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245013300171300001800304520099700322592002801319650001101347650001901358650002501377650001301402650001201415650001801427650002701445650001301472650002801485650001801513650002701531650001201558651003301570700006101603700002101664700002601685700002001711700001901731700005701750773010701807856008301914852000901997655001202006IND60647739020221119093826.0190705e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064773902DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-08-18-1425-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayorquin, Joey S.10aIdentification, Pathogenicity, and Spore Trapping of Colletotrichum karstii Associated with Twig and Shoot Dieback in California  ap. 1464-1473.  aColletotrichum Corda, 1831 species are well-documented pathogens of citrus that are associated with leaf and fruit anthracnose diseases. However, their role in twig and shoot dieback diseases of citrus has recently become more prominent. Recent surveys of orchards in the Central Valley of California have revealed C. gloeosporioides and a previously undocumented species, C. karstii, to be associated with twig and shoot dieback. Pathogenicity tests using clementine (cv. 4B) indicated that both C. karstii and C. gloeosporioides are capable of producing lesions following inoculation of citrus stems. Pathogenicity tests also revealed C. karstii to be the most aggressive fungal species producing the longest lesions after 15 months. The majority of spores trapped during this study were trapped during or closely following a precipitation event with the majority of spores being trapped from January through May. These findings confirm C. karstii as a new pathogen of citrus in California.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aColletotrichum 3aGlomerella cingulata 3abranches 3adieback 3afungal spores 3anew geographic records 3aorchards 3apathogen identification 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asurveys 3aCentral Valley of California1 aNouri, Mohamed T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4862-01051 aPeacock, Beth B.1 aTrouillas, Florent P.1 aDouhan, Greg W.1 aKallsen, Craig1 aEskalen, Akif1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8829-74130 tPlant disease.g2019 July, v. 103, no. 7 p.1464-1473dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-08-18-1425-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009500168300001100263520118500274592002801459650001201487650001901499650001301518650001201531650005001543650001901593650001101612650002301623650000901646650001601655650001501671651001301686700002501699700001601724700002101740700001801761700002501779700002601804773013101830856008101961852000902042655001202051IND60469425620221122220704.0160304e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046942562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-5026-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaeem, Usman Ali10aInvestigation of temporal change in glacial extent of Chitral watershed using Landsat data  ap. 43.  aGlaciers are also known as solid reservoirs, and in this regard, Pakistan is a blessed country to have enriched glaciers. The change in glacial extent becomes very crucial for rivers whose discharges are associated with glacier melt. Even a little change in the glacial extent may bring a significant change in the resulting river flows. Considering climate change scenarios, many researchers have predicted future flows in such catchments. But in almost all such studies, the reduction in the glaciers is not normally based on any rational. Therefore, research is needed in order to estimate how glaciers are actually behaving under the change of temperature and precipitations to better estimate the future flows. For this purpose, Chitral watershed was considered as the study area. The seasonal change in the snow extent was estimated by using MODIS data for various years that helped to identify the month with minimum glacial extent. With the help of remote sensing, unsupervised classification was performed to estimate the glacier area in Chitral watershed. The results show a definite receding trend with respect to time in the glaciers of the region for the past decade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aclimate change 3aglaciers 3amelting 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3asnow 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aPakistan1 aShamim, Muhammad Ali1 aEjaz, Naeem1 aur Rehman, Habib1 aMustafa, Umer1 aHashmi, Hashim Nisar1 aGhumman, Abdul Razzaq0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2016 Jan., v. 188, no. 1 p.43-43dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-5026-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012300162300001600285520119900301592002801500650001501528650001501543650001101558650001301569650001701582650001901599650000901618650002101627650001301648650001101661650003001672653003201702653001301734653003001747653001501777700001401792700001501806700001101821700001701832700001701849773009201866856008101958852000902039655001202048IND60085828020221120220640.0160901e20130326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008582802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jia10aPreparation and application of triangular silver nanoplates/chitosan composite in surface plasmon resonance biosensing  ap. 114-120.  aThis paper reports the utilization of triangular silver nanoplates (TSNPs) to enhance the sensitivity of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. TSNPs modified with 3-mercaptopropinic acid (MPA) were simply mixed with chitosan and glutaraldehyde to form TSNPs/chitosan composite. The composite was deposited on Au film as immobilization substrate for SPR biosensor. The novel structures of TSNPs are preserved against etching by MPA and chitosan polymer. Moreover, chitosan cross-linked by glutaraldehyde enables antibody to be immobilized on fabricated substrate directly via Schiff alkali reaction. In the optimized conditions, the resulting biosensor based on TSNPs/chitosan composite shows a satisfactory response to bovine IgG in the concentration range of 0.075–40.00μgmL−1. While the biosensor based on chitosan without TSNPs shows a response in the concentration range of 0.6–40μgmL−1 and the biosensor based on Au film shows a response in the concentration range of 2.5–40μgmL−1. The experiment results show that the sensitivity of SPR biosensor based on TSNPs/chitosan composite was significantly enhanced and the immobilization procedure of antibody was simplified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3acattle 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3aglutaraldehyde 3agold 3aimmunoglobulin G 3apolymers 3asilver 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aTriangular silver nanoplate 0aChitosan 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aBovine IgG1 aSun, Ying1 aZhang, Hua1 aXu, Bo1 aZhang, Hanqi1 aSong, Daqian0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2013 Mar. 26, v. 769 p.114-120dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.01.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014900158300001400307500002000321520140000341592002801741650001301769650002201782650002301804650002101827650001901848650001701867650002001884650001201904651001401916700002001930700002301950700001601973700002301989773013402012856007302146852000902219655001202228IND60589092720221117160348.0180202e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058909272DNAL7 a10.1111/ajr.123772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRedshaw, Sarah10aAssessing the impact of vulnerability on perceptions of social cohesion in the context of community resilience to disaster in the Blue Mountains  ap. 14-19.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of network communications, community participation and elements of vulnerability on the perception of social cohesiveness in the Blue Mountains local government area (Blue Mountains LGA). DESIGN: A questionnaire was administered to residents of the Blue Mountains LGA. Econometric analysis of the resulting data was undertaken. SETTING: Blue Mountains LGA, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand one hundred and three residents of the Blue Mountains LGA responded to the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The responses enabled the construction of variables measuring individual perceptions of community cohesiveness, their network communications and community participation. Demographic data and data on the vulnerabilities of individuals were also collected. RESULTS: The data were used in an econometric model which identified that network communications and community participation impacted positively on perceptions of social cohesiveness while vulnerability factors had a negative impact. CONCLUSIONS: Remedial action to build community cohesiveness and network communications can be expected to have a positive impact on social cohesiveness. In developing strategies to build community cohesiveness and network communication, particular care needs to be taken to ensure the inclusion of those members of society who are regarded as the most vulnerable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3acommunity service 3aeconometric models 3alocal government 3aquestionnaires 3arural health 3asocial cohesion 3asociety 3aAustralia1 aIngham, Valerie1 aMcCutcheon, Marion1 aHicks, John1 aBurmeister, Oliver0 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2018 Feb., v. 26, no. 1 p.14-19dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000053x1038-52827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.123773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010300171300001600274520141000290592002801700650001601728650002601744650001601770650001901786650002301805650001301828650002101841650002601862650002101888650001901909650001101928650002201939650004401961650001502005650001302020650001602033650002502049653001402074653001602088653003402104653001602138653001002154653000802164653003102172653002102203653001302224700001902237700001902256700002102275700001902296700002302315773012502338856008202463852000902545655001202554IND60605897820221122085516.0180723e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060589782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2016.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLupi, Francesca R.14aThe effects of intermolecular interactions on the physical properties of organogels in edible oils  ap. 154-164.  aThe microstructure of organogels based on monoglycerides of fatty acids (MAGs) and policosanol and on different edible oils was investigated by using different techniques (calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, rheology, polarized light microscopy) towards a better understanding and control of the oil gelation phenomena. Dynamic moduli were related via a fractal model to microstructural information such as solid content and fractal dimension. Infrared spectroscopy evidenced that network structure in MAGs gel is mainly due to hydrogen bonding, whereas in policosanol system is mainly given by van der Waals interactions. Because of the different relative contribution of molecular interactions, the investigated organogelators exhibit a distinguished macroscopic behavior. MAGs are sensitive to the utilized oil and structuration occurs quickly, even though at a temperature lower than policosanol. Policosanol organogels exhibit a behavior independent of the used oil and a slower gelation rate, as a result of the weaker van der Waals interactions. Nevertheless, at lower concentration a stronger final gel is obtained, probably due to of the large number of interactions arising among the long alkyl chains of the fatty alcohols. Obtained results evidenced that policosanol is very effective in gelation of different oils and seems promising for potential commercial uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3acooking fats and oils 3afatty acids 3afatty alcohols 3afractal dimensions 3agelation 3ahydrogen bonding 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alight microscopy 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3amonoacylglycerols 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganogels 3arheology 3atemperature 3avan der Waals forces 0aOrganogel 0aEdible oils 0aMonoglycerides of fatty acids 0aPolicosanol 0aFT-IR 0aDSC 0aVan der Waals interactions 0aHydrogen bonding 0aRheology1 aGreco, Valeria1 aBaldino, Noemi1 ade Cindio, Bruno1 aFischer, Peter1 aGabriele, Domenico0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 483 p.154-164dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245017200166300001100338520144900349592002801798650002201826650002901848650003501877650002501912650002701937650001201964650001101976650001701987650001102004650000902015650000902024650002102033650001102054650001902065650000902084650001302093650000902106651001302115700002102128700001502149700001902164773013102183856008102314852000902395655001202404IND60469425720221122220613.0160304e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046942572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-5042-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOng, Ghim Hock10aEffects of metal-contaminated soils on the accumulation of heavy metals in gotu kola (Centella asiatica) and the potential health risks: a study in Peninsular Malaysia  ap. 40.  aCentella asiatica is a commonly used medicinal plant in Malaysia. As heavy metal accumulation in medicinal plants which are highly consumed by human is a serious issue, thus the assessment of heavy metals in C. asiatica is important for the safety of consumers. In this study, the heavy metal accumulation in C. asiatica and the potential health risks were investigated. Samples of C. asiatica and surface soils were collected from nine different sites around Peninsular Malaysia. The concentration of six heavy metals namely Cd, Cu, Ni, Fe, Pb and Zn were determined by air-acetylene flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). The degree of anthropogenic influence was assessed by calculating the enrichment factor (EF) and index of geoaccumulation (Igeo). The heavy metal uptake into the plant was estimated through the calculation of translocation factor (TF), bioconcentration factor (BCF) and correlation study. Estimated daily intakes (EDI) and target hazard quotients (THQ) were used to determine the potential health risk of consuming C. asiatica. The results showed that the overall surface soil was polluted by Cd, Cu and Pb, while the uptake of Zn and Ni by the plants was high. The value of EDI and THQ showed that the potential of Pb toxicity in C. asiatica was high as well. As heavy metal accumulation was confirmed in C. asiatica, daily consumption of the plant derived from polluted sites in Malaysia was not recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentella asiatica 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aaverage daily intake 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3airon 3alead 3amedicinal plants 3anickel 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aMalaysia1 aWong, Ling Shing1 aTan, Ai Li1 aYap, Chee Kong0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2016 Jan., v. 188, no. 1 p.40-40dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-5042-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009300176300001600269520155400285592002801839650002701867650001101894650001401905650002201919650002401941650002501965650002301990650000902013650001302022650001802035650001102053650001602064650000902080650001102089650001502100650000802115650002302123650001002146653001802156653001802174653002302192653001702215653001302232653001402245700005802259700002202317700006202339700002102401700001502422700002202437700002702459773011102486856008602597852000902683655001202692IND60601552420221120033824.0190410e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060155242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.06.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuodeikiene, Grazina10aEffects of emotional responses to certain foods on the prediction of consumer acceptance  ap. 361-368.  aThis research was focussed on the development of a methodology for the recognition of consumer preferences based on a combination of emotional, behavioural, and sensory trait information. A model of the impact of customers' sensory experiences on their attitudes towards food products and their behavioural intentions was analysed. Sensory and emotional analyses were used to describe five kinds of bread (wheat, rye, corn, wholemeal, and multigrain) and two types of chocolate (dark and milk). Acceptability and emotional response were rated by a consumer panel (n = 109) drawn from 21 to 24 age segments using the hedonic scores and a FaceReader software which detects six basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, disgusted, scared, surprised) and a neutral state were applied. For the products tested, expressions of happiness, anger, and sadness for each product were relatively high compared to the others, with the neutral state being the main expression. The chocolate products elicited the highest intensity of happiness, reducing the level of the neutral state. A different tendency was obtained during the testing of bakery goods: higher expression of the neutral state and sadness and low expression of happiness. The emotional/sensory experience model and consumer behavioural patterns comprise the method for the differentiation of products, which could be useful in the food industry as well as for the development of new methodologies for the prediction of changes in human emotional response to food related to psychological disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abreads 3achocolate 3acomputer software 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumer preferences 3aconsumers (people) 3acorn 3aemotions 3afood industry 3ahumans 3amethodology 3amilk 3amodels 3aprediction 3arye 3asensory properties 3awheat 0aEmpathic food 0aAcceptability 0aEmotional response 0aFace-reading 0aAttitude 0aBehaviour1 aZadeike, Daiva1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0344-28861 aKlupsaite, Dovile1 aCernauskas, Darius1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7094-01831 aBartkiene, Elena1 aLele, Vita1 aSteibliene, Vesta1 aAdomaitiene, Virginija0 tFood research international.g2018 Oct., v. 112 p.361-368dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.06.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245012600186300001600312520140900328592002801737650001901765650000901784650001201793650001301805650001101818650001301829650001601842650001401858650003001872650001201902650003601914650001101950650002001961650002401981650002102005650002402026650001702050650002402067651001102091651001602102651001602118651001102134651001602145651001602161700001502177700001602192700002002208700001602228700001802244700001402262700002002276773010702296856005102403852000902454655001202463IND50075035020221122182930.0140410e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007503502DNAL7 a229785842pmid7 a10.1080/00071668.2012.7037742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeenstra, F.10aPerformance of commercial laying hen genotypes on free range and organic farms in Switzerland, France and The Netherlands  ap. 282-290.  a1. A total of 257 farmers with free ranging laying hens (organic and conventional) in Switzerland, France and The Netherlands with 273 flocks were interviewed to determine the relationships between the genotype of the hens, management conditions and performance.2. Almost 20 different genotypes (brands) were present on the farms. In France, all birds were brown feathered hens laying brown eggs. In Switzerland and The Netherlands, there were brown, white (white feathered hens laying white eggs) and silver (white feathered hens laying brown eggs) hens. In Switzerland, mixed flocks were also present.3. The overall effect of system (organic vs. conventional free range) on egg production and mortality was significant, with higher mortality and lower egg production among organic hens. In pair wise comparisons within country, the difference was highly significant in The Netherlands, and showed a non-significant tendency in the same direction in Switzerland and France.4. White hens tended to perform better than brown hens. Silver hens appeared to have a higher mortality and lower production per hen housed at 60 weeks of age.5. There were no significant relationships between production, mortality, feather condition and use of outside run or with flock size.6. There was more variation in mortality and egg production among farms with a small flock size than among farms with a large flock size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aegg production 3aeggs 3afarmers 3afeathers 3aflocks 3agenotype 3alaying hens 3amortality 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aOrganic Agriculture 2aOvumxphysiology 2aRegression Analysis 2aReproduction 2aSpecies Specificity 3aFrance 3aNetherlands 3aSwitzerland 0aFrance 0aNetherlands 0aSwitzerland1 aMaurer, V.1 aBestman, M.1 avan Sambeek, F.1 aZeltner, E.1 aReuvekamp, B.1 aGalea, F.1 avan Niekerk, T.0 tBritish poultry science.g2012 June 1, v. 53, no. 3 p.282-290dTaylor & Francis Groupx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2012.703774  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013000155300001400285500002000299520177800319592002802097650002702125650002102152650002802173650002602201650001202227650001402239650001902253650002202272650001302294650002302307651001402330700001802344700001702362700001802379700001802397700002002415700002102435700001902456773013402475856007302609852000902682655001202691IND60589092820221117160423.0180202e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058909282DNAL7 a10.1111/ajr.123752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Tony10aHealth professional students' rural placement satisfaction and rural practice intentions: A national cross‐sectional survey  ap. 26-32.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to profile students undertaking placements at University Departments of Rural Health (UDRHs) and investigate factors affecting students' satisfaction and intention to enter rural practice. DESIGN: Cross‐sectional survey comprising 21 core questions used by all UDRHs. SETTING: Eleven UDRHs across Australia that support students' placements in regional, rural and remote locations. PARTICIPANTS: Medical, nursing and allied health students who participated in UDRH placements between July 2014 and November 2015 and completed the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Key dependent variables were placement satisfaction and rural practice intention. Descriptive variables were age, gender, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) background, location of placement, healthcare discipline, year of study and type and length of placement. RESULTS: A total of 3328 students responded. The sample was predominantly female (79%), the mean age was 26.0 years and 1.8% identified as ATSI. Most placements (69%) were >2 but ≤12 weeks, 80% were in Modified Monash 3, 4 or 5 geographical locations. Public hospitals and community health made up 63% of placements. Students satisfied with their placement had 2.33 higher odds of rural practice intention. Those satisfied with Indigenous cultural training, workplace supervision, access to education resources and accommodation had higher odds of overall satisfaction and post‐placement rural practice intention. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of students were highly satisfied with their placement and the support provided by rural clinicians and the UDRHs. UDRHs are well placed to provide health professional students with highly satisfactory placements that foster rural practice intention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acommunity health 3across-sectional studies 3aeducational resources 3afemales 3ahospitals 3aquestionnaires 3arural health care 3astudents 3aworking conditions 3aAustralia1 aSutton, Keith1 aPit, Sabrina1 aMuyambi, Kuda1 aTerry, Daniel1 aFarthing, Annie1 aCourtney, Claire1 aCross, Merylin0 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2018 Feb., v. 26, no. 1 p.26-32dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000053x1038-52827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.123753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014700164300001400311520098800325592002801313650004401341650002201385650003701407650001501444650002401459650001701483650001901500650001401519650002301533650001501556650001901571650002201590650001801612650001401630650001801644650001401662650003701676653000901713653001901722653002701741653003201768653001901800700001601819700001601835700001801851700001601869700001401885773012301899856008202022852000902104655001202113IND60605897920221122085549.0180723e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060589792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2016.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zonggao10aUltrafine MnO2 nanoparticles decorated on graphene oxide as a highly efficient and recyclable catalyst for aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol  ap. 26-33.  aThe highly active and selective aerobic oxidation of aromatic alcohols over earth-abundant, inexpensive and recyclable catalysts is highly desirable. We fabricated herein MnO2/graphene oxide (GO) composites by a facile in-situ growth approach at room temperature and used them in selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde. TEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS and N2 adsorption/desorption analysis were employed to systematically investigate the morphology, particle size, structure and surface properties of the catalysts. The 96.8% benzyl alcohol conversion and 100% benzaldehyde selectivity over the MnO2/GO (10/100) catalyst with well dispersive ultrafine MnO2 nanoparticles (ca. 3nm) can be obtained within 3h under 383K. Simultaneously, no appreciable loss of activity and selectivity occurred after recycling use up to six times. Due to their significant low cost, excellent catalytic performance, the MnO2/GO composites have huge application prospect in organic synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3abenzaldehyde 3abenzyl alcohol 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3agraphene oxide 3amanganese dioxide 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aparticle size 3arecycling 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aMnO2 0aGraphene oxide 0aHeterogeneous catalyst 0aSelective aerobic oxidation 0aBenzyl alcohol1 aZhao, Yafei1 aLiu, Jindun1 aWang, Jingtao1 aZhang, Bing1 aXiang, Xu0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 483 p.26-33dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008400165300001100249520172500260592002801985596007502013650001802088650001202106650001802118650002602136650001702162650001002179650002802189650002602217650001102243650001402254650001102268650001802279650002402297650001702321650001002338650001402348700002902362700002002391700001902411700002402430700001702454700002102471773011002492856008202602852000902684655001202693IND60590609520221119083533.0190314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059060952DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-018-0708-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMucha, Joanna10aFunctional response of Quercus robur L. to taproot pruning: a 5-year case study  ap. 22.  aKEY MESSAGE: Quercus robur seedling mass was affected more by planting density than by taproot pruning. Root pruning enhanced stem biomass at the expense of roots in later growth stages. Alteration of biomass allocation due to nursery practices may result in greater susceptibility to injury and death of the seedlings under unfavorable environmental conditions. CONTEXT: Plants adjust their growth and modulate the resource allocation in response to applied treatments and environmental conditions. AIMS: The aim was to examine how taproot pruning in seedlings grown at different densities affected long-term growth of Quercus robur. METHODS: Seedlings, sown as acorns at two planting densities, with or without pruned roots were harvested in the second, fourth, and fifth years of growth. The effect of root pruning on biomass allocation was determined by measuring leaf, stem, and root mass fractions; carbohydrate concentrations in the roots; and C/N ratios. Specific leaf area and root length were also determined to assess morphological adaptations to growth conditions. RESULTS: Total seedling mass was affected more by planting density than by taproot pruning. After 4 years of growth, root mass fractions were lower and stem mass fractions were greater in seedlings planted at a higher density. Five-year old root-pruned seedlings also had a lower root mass fraction and higher stem mass fractions than unpruned seedlings. Specific root length was not affected by root pruning or planting density. CONCLUSION: Decrease of relative root biomass with simultaneous increase of stem biomass may be a long-term consequence of taproot pruning of Q. robur, and the effects may manifest years after the seedling stage.  aPublisher supplied data  aproject no. 2011/01/D/NZ9/02871cthe National Science Centre of Poland 3aQuercus robur 3abiomass 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acase studies 3adeath 3adry matter partitioning 3aenvironmental factors 3afruits 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aplant density 3aresource allocation 3aroot pruning 3aroots 3aseedlings1 aJagodziński, Andrzej M.1 aBułaj, Bartosz1 aŁakomy, Piotr1 aTalaśka, Adrian M.1 aOleksyn, J.,1 aZadworny, Marcin0 tAnnals of forest science.g2018 Mar., v. 75, no. 1 p.22-22dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-018-0708-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245016900173300001400342520139300356592002801749650004401777650001801821650002201839650001501861650002401876650002001900650000901920650001701929650001701946650002601963650001001989650001301999650001302012650001802025650001802043650001502061650002202076650001602098650002102114650003702135653001002172653001502182653001802197653001202215653001302227653001702240700001502257700001602272700001602288700001602304700001802320773012102338856008902459852000902548655001202557IND60623006820221120045559.0190410e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062300682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Chunyang10aBiosynthesis of gold nanoparticles, characterization and their loading with zonisamide as a novel drug delivery system for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury  ap. 72-75.  aIn the present work, a facile biosynthetic approach for the synthesis of AuNPs using bark extract of Juglans regia (J. regia) is reported. Ultra-violet visible (UV–vis) absorption spectroscopic studies exhibited and narrow SPR absorption band at 540 nm, represented the isotropy in particle size. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, confirmed the fabrication of spherical and crystalline nanoparticles of average size of about 14 nm. Also, typical characteristic selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern showed the crystalline nature of AuNPs. The prepared AuNPs were loaded with zonisamide which can be used for future spinal cord injury repair applications. The fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis represented the zonisamide loading onto AuNPs. The biological preparation of AuNPs using the bark extract of J. regia is prominent approach because of its eco friendly nature without using any toxic chemicals. The controlled-release of zonisamide-AuNPs was about 43.0 ± 2.2 nm with high stability and solubility under room temperature conditions. Further, the cytotoxicity results showed the comparatively higher toxicity of zonisamide-AuNPs towards CTX TNA2 cells than free zonisamide. Hence, zonisamide-AuNPs may act as very good clinical drug for future therapeutic treatment of spinal cord injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aJuglans regia 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3aanimal injuries 3abark 3abiosynthesis 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aisotropy 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3asolubility 3aspectral analysis 3aspinal cord 3atoxic substances 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aAuNPs 0aZonisamide 0aJuglans regia 0aExtract 0aCataract 0aCytotoxicity1 aMa, Ziping1 aChen, Liqiu1 aLi, Hongjie1 aJiang, Chao1 aZhang, Wenbin0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2019 Jan., v. 190 p.72-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245005100159300001800210520146600228592002801694650002201722650001101744650001601755650000901771650001301780650003601793650001601829650001101845700001901856773011201875856007501987852000902062655001202071IND60529102820221119004333.0160717e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052910282DNAL7 a10.1021/ac301674y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAskenazi, Manor10aImplicit Biology in Peptide Spectral Libraries  ap. 7919-7925.  aMass spectral libraries are collections of mass spectra curated specifically to facilitate the identification of small molecules, metabolites, and short peptides. One of the most comprehensive peptide spectral libraries is curated by NIST and contains upward of half a million annotated spectra dominated by human and model organisms including budding yeast and mouse. While motivated primarily by the technological goal of increasing sensitivity and specificity in spectral identification, we have found that the NIST spectral library constitutes a surprisingly rich source of biological knowledge. In this Article, we show that data-mining of these published libraries while applying strict empirical thresholds yields many characteristics of protein biology. In particular, we demonstrate that the size and increasingly comprehensive nature of these libraries, generated from whole-proteome digests, enables inference from the presence but crucially also from the absence of spectra for individual peptides. We illustrate implicit biological trends that lead to significant absence of spectra accounted for by complex post-translational modifications and overlooked proteolytic sites. We conclude that many subtle biological signatures such as genetic variants, regulated proteolysis, and post-translational modifications are exposed through the systematic mining of spectral collections originally compiled as general-purpose, technology-oriented resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amice 3apeptides 3apost-translational modification 3aproteolysis 3ayeasts1 aLinial, Michal0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Sept. 18, v. 84, no. 18 p.7919-7925dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac301674y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05428naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245009900207300001300306520323400319592002803553650002703581650002203608650002003630650001603650650001603666650001203682650001403694650002003708650001003728650001203738650001103750650001003761650001303771650001603784650001303800650001203813650002603825650001303851650001303864650001803877650003103895650001403926650001303940650001803953650001403971650002203985650001104007650002004018650001604038650002504054650001304079650001204092650001204104650001304116650001004129650001204139650001704151650001704168651001104185653001004196653001604206653002304222700001904245700002004264700001804284700002204302700002104324700002304345700005504368773010704423856008304530852000904613655001204622IND60647739420221119093946.0190620e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064773942DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-09-18-1574-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, J.

In 2015, while conducting a survey in a newly established 90-ha cashew orchard in Barra do Corda, State of Maranhão (05°30′20″S; 45°14′36″W), a shoot and stem rot followed by dieback symptoms were observed in about 30% of plants (CP 76 and BRS 189 clonal cultivars). Isolations from infected tissues revealed a whitish, cottony fungal colony, which later turned gray on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Upon the absence of sporulation under PDA media, mycelial disks from the edge of the colony were transferred to autoclaved fruits of custard apple (Annona squamosa) and incubated at 25°C (Cardoso et al. 2002). Pycnidia were observed after 4 weeks of incubation over the surface of entire fruits. Conidia were hyaline, unicellular, fusiform, and truncated at the base when newly formed, and 33.95 to 53.44 (avg. 47.38) μm in length and 9.13 to 11.47 (avg. 10.59) μm in width (n = 50). No sexual structure was observed. Genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia and the fragments of the genomic regions of the rDNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS), β-tubulin (TUB2), and the translation elongation factor 1-α (EF-1α) were amplified by PCR using primers ITS1/ITS4, βT2a/βT2b, and EF1-688F/EF1-1251R, respectively (Coutinho et al. 2017). The PCR products were sequenced and the sequences obtained were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MF521897 (ITS), MF538773 (βT), and MG209371 (EF1). Multiple alignments of the combined data set of the genomic regions and representative sequences obtained from GenBank were submitted to phylogenetic analysis of maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) and the tree topology tested by the bootstrap method with 1,000 replicates. For the phylogenetic tree, the isolated fungus (BOT456) was grouped in a clade with isolates CMM 1390, CBS 117444, and CMW 13433 of Cophinforma atrovirens with 100% bootstrap support for MP and ML (Dissanayake et al. 2016; Phillips et al. 2013). Morphological and molecular information presented in this study confirmed this species as C. atrovirens. The pathogenicity was evaluated in cashew tree seedlings (clone BRS 189) by injecting a conidial suspension (6.96 × 10⁵ conidia ml⁻¹) into young shoots with insulin syringe. Five inoculated plants and five noninoculated plants (injected with sterile distilled water as control) were kept in a greenhouse at 28°C under natural sunlight and irrigated daily. The onset of symptoms was observed 3 days after inoculation, evolving to complete rot and decaying death of the shoots at 7 days. A fungus with the same morphological characteristics as the original isolate was successfully reisolated from infected tissues, confirming Koch’s postulates. C. atrovirens is a fungus of the Botyosphaeriaceae family, which has been reported in association with dieback and cankers in woody plants (Dissanayake et al. 2016; Phillips et al. 2013). The presence of this pathogen in a cashew-growing region, which is commonly subject to water stress, poses a threat to cashew industry development. This is the first report of C. atrovirens on cashew plants in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardium occidentale 3aAnnona reticulata 3aAnnona squamosa 3aDNA primers 3aautoclaving 3aconidia 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adeath 3adieback 3afruits 3afungi 3agenomics 3agreenhouses 3aindustry 3ainsulin 3airrigation scheduling 3amycelium 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3apycnidia 3aribosomal DNA 3aseedlings 3asequence analysis 3ashoots 3asolar radiation 3asporulation 3astatistical analysis 3astem rot 3asurveys 3atissues 3atopology 3atrees 3atubulin 3awater stress 3awoody plants 3aBrazil 0afruit 0atree fruits 0apathogen detection1 aFonseca, W.

Unlike the covalent marks found at promoters, which are thought to be instructive for transcriptional activation, these modifications occur in gene bodies as a result of transcription, which has made elucidation of their functions challenging. Here we review recent insights into the regulation and roles of two such modifications: monoubiquitylation of histone H2B at lysine 120 (H2Bub1) and methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me). Both H2Bub1 and H3K36me are enriched in the coding regions of transcribed genes, with highly overlapping distributions, but they were thought to work largely independently. We highlight our recent demonstration that, as was previously shown for H3K36me, H2Bub1 signals to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex Rpd3S/Clr6-CII, and that Rpd3S/Clr6-CII and H2Bub1 function in the same pathway to repress aberrant antisense transcription initiating within gene coding regions. Moreover, both of these histone modification pathways are influenced by protein phosphorylation catalyzed by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that regulate RNAPII elongation, chiefly Cdk9. Therefore, H2Bub1 and H3K36me are more tightly linked than previously thought, sharing both upstream regulatory inputs and downstream effectors. Moreover, these newfound connections suggest extensive, bidirectional signaling between RNAPII elongation complexes and chromatin-modifying enzymes, which helps to determine transcriptional outputs and should be a focus for future investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOP-130362cCanadian Institutes of Health Research  aRGPIN 03661-15cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  aR35GM127289cNational Institutes of Health 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistone code 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahistones 3alysine 3amethylation 3aprotein phosphorylation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aPagé, Vivane1 aFisher, Robert P.1 aTanny, Jason C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3495-61500 tCurrent genetics.g2021 Oct., v. 67, no. 5 p.695-705dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl32278x0172-80837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-021-01196-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008100174300001600255520126500271592002801536650002701564650001001591650002601601650000901627650001101636650001501647650001801662650001601680700002601696700002001722773009201742856008501834852000901919655001201928IND60084129820221119031530.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008412982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2010.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutowsky, Lee F.G.10aAngling to estimate the density of large round goby (Neogobius melanostomus)  ap. 228-231.  aWe introduce an angling technique for estimating the density of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Sampling is conducted from a boat that is securely anchored in a randomly selected site. By taking advantage of the aggressive nature, small size, and limited home range of the round goby, two anglers are generally able to deplete the local aggregation of gobies in a 20min period. Density is estimated using a depletion curve and reliable estimates were produced in 76% (52/68) of field trials where round gobies were present. Relative abundance was estimable for 100% of trials. An experimental procedure indicated that refuge status (gravel or rock), density, or temperature had no effect on round goby capture efficiency using this technique (p>0.05 in all cases). Angling is a relatively inexpensive and simple technique that is useful in providing a relative measure of the density of gobies larger than 50mm TL, and is especially useful in situations where round gobies can evade capture or detection by other methods.

This protocol does not involve the use of phenol, lyophilization, or ultracentrifugation. In addition, this protocol overcomes problems of both RNA degradation and low yield attributed to oxidation by polyphenolic compounds and coprecipitation with polysaccharides, both abundant components in apple fruit and flower tissues. Isolated RNA is of high quality and is undegraded as assessed by spectrophotometric readings and electrophoresis in denaturing agarose gels. RNA quality is further assessed following its use in reverse transcription and cDNA library construction, and it can be used for a number of downstream analyses, including Northern blot hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). With this modified protocol, 25–900 μg of total RNA is routinely obtained from 1 g of fresh material. This method is of low cost and easy to perform.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolyphenols 3aapples 3aRNA 3aultracentrifugation 3agels 3agenes 3ashoots 3aphenol 3areverse transcription 3aoxidation 3abuds 3acomplementary DNA 3acDNA libraries 3aNorthern blotting 3afruits 3afreeze drying 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aflowers 3aagarose 3acoprecipitation 3aelectrophoresis 0atranscription (genetics)1 aHernandez, Álvaro,1 aKorban, Schuyler S.0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2004 Dec., v. 22, no. 4 p.437-438dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027726873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245013800169500001900307520172000326592002802046650002202074650001602096650002402112650001702136650002202153650001602175650001602191650001602207650001502223650003102238650001802269650001602287650001802303650001302321700001402334773012502348856007402473852000902547655001202556IND60703260920221117184047.0200720e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070326092DNAL7 a10.3390/md180502592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThangaraj, Satheeswaran 14aThe Biotechnological Potential of the Marine Diatom <i>Skeletonema dohrnii</i> to the Elevated Temperature and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub>  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMarine diatoms are promising candidates for biotechnological applications, since they contain high-value compounds, naturally. To facilitate the production of these compounds, stress conditions are often preferable; however, challenges remain with respect to maximizing a metabolic potential for the large-scale cultivation. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome of diatom <i>Skeletonema dohrnii</i> under the actual (21 &deg;C, 400 ppm) and elevated (25 &deg;C, 1000 ppm) temperature and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> condition. Results indicated that cells grown at higher temperature and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> showed increasing growth rate, pigment composition, and biochemical productivity as did the expression of chlorophyll, carotenoid and bioactive compound related genes or transcripts. Furthermore, performing de novo transcriptome, we identified 32,884 transcript clusters and found 10,974 of them were differentially expressed between these two conditions. Analyzing the functions of differentially expressed transcripts, we found many of them involved in core metabolic and biosynthesis pathways, including chlorophyll metabolism, carotenoid, phenylpropanoid, phenylalanine and tyrosine, and flavonoid biosynthesis was upregulated. Moreover, we here demonstrated that utilizing a unique bio-fixation ability, <i>S. dohrnii</i> is capable of suppressing central carbon metabolism to promote lipid productivity, fatty acid contents and other bioactive compounds under high temperature and <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> treatment. Our study suggests that this <i>S. dohrnii</i> species could be a potential candidate for wide-scale biotechnological applications under elevated temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aSkeletonema 3abioactive compounds 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon metabolism 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3afatty acids 3aflavonoids 3agene expression regulation 3aphenylalanine 3atemperature 3atranscriptome 3atyrosine1 aSun, Jun 0 tMarine drugs.g2020 May 15, v. 18, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180502593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024003400112040001800146100002000164245010100184300001800285500000900303520117700312592002801489650002501517650001701542650002801559650002701587650003001614650002301644650001401667650002701681650001501708650001801723650001001741651001501751700002301766700002201789773012401811852000901935856011101944856008102055961001302136655001202149IND4364284920221121050151.0191228e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436428492DNAL7 a10113/84122hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.17632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonos, Stacy A.10aPlant Responses and Characteristics Associated with Dollar Spot Resistance in Creeping Bentgrass  ap. 1763-1769.  aepub  aDollar spot, incited by Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F.T. Bennett, is one of the most important diseases affecting creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) golf greens, fairways, and tees. Genetic resistance to dollar spot is a promising control strategy. A study was initiated to: (i) evaluate dollar spot resistance of 265 collections of creeping bentgrass in two locations; (ii) determine bentgrass clone stability of dollar spot resistance; and (iii) evaluate 10 resistant and susceptible clones for disease, turf, and leaf traits. The field experiments were arranged in randomized complete blocks with six and five clonally propagated replicates in each of two locations evaluated across 2 yr in North Brunswick, NJ. Five isolates of S. homoeocarpa were used to inoculate the field experiments. New Jersey fairway collections had the highest percentage of stable dollar spot resistant clones compared with Illinois fairway and New Jersey and New York golf green collections in this particular study. Resistant clones maintained a significantly higher turf density and percentage green turf cover and smaller dollar spot diameter sizes compared with susceptible clones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3aturf grasses 3aSclerotinia homoeocarpa 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease resistance 3acultivars 3ageographical variation 3aprovenance 3aplant density 3acolor 3aNew Jersey1 aCasler, Michael D.1 aMeyer, William A.0 tCrop science.g2004 Sept., v. 44, no. 5 p.1763-1769dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/84123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.17633Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01721naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245006600168300001600234520083700250592002801087650001901115650001301134650001601147650001201163650001801175650001601193700001701209773012701226856005701353852000901410655001201419IND6015159020221122213207.0190605e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND601515902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1988.tb02486.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodek, I.10aMultiple role of temperature during insect diapause: a review  ap. 153-165.  aThe review emphasizes that there are multiple pathways to diapause completion. The programmed course of events is modified by environmental cues. Often chilling is not a prerequisite for the completion of hibernation diapause (examples tabulated). Diapause completion progresses well at intermediate or high temperatures, sometimes it is even stimulated by high or increasing temperature. Low temperatures are important, as they (1) conserve metabolic reserves, (2) prevent resumption of post‐diapause morphogenesis and thus synchronize the life‐cycle, (3) represent contrast to the later increase in temperature. Diapause consists of phases with different prerequisites. There is a principal difference between diapause development and photoperiodic activation as indicated by the subsequent physiological condition of insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold treatment 3adiapause 3ahibernation 3ainsects 3amorphogenesis 3atemperature1 aHodková, M.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1988 Nov., v. 49, no. 1‐2 p.153-165dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1988.tb02486.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011000159300001800269500002000287520131100307592002801618650001401646650002401660650001301684650001001697650001701707650002001724650002201744650000901766650001501775650001201790650001401802650001401816650001301830650001601843700001901859700002201878700002001900700002501920700002601945773012201971856007302093852000902166655001202175IND60589093320221117172530.0180202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058909332DNAL7 a10.1111/are.135672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvendsen, Eirik10aEffect of ultrasonic cavitation on small and large organisms for water disinfection during fish transport  ap. 1166-1175.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMotivated by the need for additional tools to disinfect discharge water from well boats, and to prevent distribution of salmon lice, the effect of ultrasonic cavitation on the planktonic stages of the salmon louse, nauplii and copepodids, as well as marine heterotrophic bacteria, and the marine green microalgae Tetraselmis suecica, has been investigated. Survival and morphology were registered after different exposure times. Efficacy of the ultrasonic cavitation treatments varied with exposure time. A reduction in survival was registered even for the shortest exposure time (5 seconds) for both naupliar and copepodid stages of the salmon louse (36.7 ± 11.5 and 67.20 ± 7.2% survival respectively). Survival reached zero after exposure times of 20 and 60 seconds for the nauplii and copepodid stages, respectively. A reduction in 70% was observed for bacteria at all exposure times (5 to 300 s), while a reduction of 95% was observed after 300 s for algal cells. The logged energy transfer to the samples was on average 17.5 J/s. In conclusion, cavitation treatment is destructive for the planktonic stages of salmon lice, and may contribute to reduce discharge of pathogens and parasites from well boats when adapted for this purpose and combined with existing water disinfection methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaligidae 3aTetraselmis suecica 3abacteria 3aboats 3adisinfection 3aenergy transfer 3aexposure duration 3afish 3amicroalgae 3anauplii 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aplankton 3aultrasonics1 aDahle, Stine W1 aHagemann, Andreas1 aBirkevold, Jens1 aDelacroix, Stephanie1 aAndersen, Aage Bjørn0 tAquaculture research.g2018 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.1166-1175dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.135673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245021900171300001600390520175100406592002802157650002202185650002002207650002102227650001702248650001602265650001402281650002302295650003102318650000902349650001102358650002602369650002102395650001702416650001002433650001702443650001302460650001602473650001102489650002002500650002502520650001702545650001802562700002002580700001702600773009902617856008502716852000902801655001202810IND4465869020221123020408.0141112e20110826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446586902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2011.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlidag, Huseyin10aRole of 24-epibrassinolide in mitigating the adverse effects of salt stress on stomatal conductance, membrane permeability, and leaf water content, ionic composition in salt stressed strawberry (Fragaria×ananassa)  ap. 133-140.  aIn order to study the effect of brassinosteroids on the amelioration of the inhibitory effect of salinity on strawberry plants, a short-term experiment was conducted in greenhouse to test different concentrations of 24-epibrassinolide (24-EBL) (0.0, 0.5, and 1μM) by foliar application on some agro-physiological properties, such as shoot dry weight, and root dry weight, stomatal conductance (SC), leaf relative water content (LRWC), leaf chlorophyll reading values (LCRV) and membrane permeability (MP) of strawberry ‘Fern’ and ‘A6’ cultivars irrigated with salt water (35mM NaCl). 24-EBL solutions were applied twice during late afternoon hours with 7d intervals using a hand-held sprayer. Plant shoot dry weight, root dry weight, SC, LRWC and LCRV were reduced by 29–33%, 45–15%, 71–55%, 11–13%, and 12–13% for ‘A6’ and ‘Fern’ cultivars at 35mM (without 24-EBL applied), respectively, as compared to the nonsaline treatment, but MP increased 40% and 12%. An exogenous supply of 24-EBL was found to be successful in alleviating of the inhibitory effects of salt stress on plant growth parameters and nutrient contents. 24-EBL (1μM) application under saline condition significantly increased shoot and root dry matter, SC, LRWC and LCRV of plants, and alleviation effects of 1μM 24-EBL application was 20%, 15%, 122%, 5.8%, and 10.9% for ‘A6’ and 47%, 8.0%, 83%, 33.3% and 6.0% for ‘Fern’ cultivars, respectively. Macro-micro element content of plant leaf and root increased with increase 24-EBL except for Na under salinity stress. These results support the view that supplementary 24-EBL application can overcome the effects of salinity stress on plant growth and growth parameter under saline conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3aadverse effects 3aagronomic traits 3abrassinolide 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3afoliar application 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aions 3aleaves 3amembrane permeability 3anutrient content 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3astomatal conductance 3astrawberries 3awater content1 aYildirim, Ertan1 aTuran, Metin0 tScientia horticulturae.g2011 Aug. 26, v. 130, no. 1 p.133-140dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2011.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014900168300001600317520198300333592002802316650001202344650001402356650001502370650001202385650001302397650001302410650002402423650001702447650001202464650001302476650001302489650001802502650001302520650001402533650002302547651001002570653003002580653002602610653003202636700001902668700001802687700001702705700001802722700001702740700002002757700001802777700002002795700001802815773010902833856008602942852000903028655001203037IND60597170920221120201346.0200106e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059717092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsobe, Kazuo10aHighly abundant acidophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaea causes high rates of nitrification and nitrate leaching in nitrogen-saturated forest soils  ap. 220-227.  aIn southern China, high levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) are being deposited in forests. Soil acidification and high rates of soil nitrification and subsequent NO₃⁻ leaching have been observed in the N-saturated forests. We previously did not detect NH₃-oxidizing bacteria in non-N-saturated or N-saturated forest soils. However, NH₃-oxidizing archaea were present in both soils, more in the saturated ones. The purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of autotrophic NH₃-oxidizing archaea and heterotrophic nitrifiers in soil N transformations in N-saturated and non-N-saturated forests in southern China. We investigated the contribution of heterotrophic nitrifiers in the soils by determining the gross nitrification rates with and without an inhibitor of autotrophic nitrification, acetylene (C₂H₂). We also reevaluated nitrification by NH₃-oxidizing archaea by correlating the C₂H₂-inhibited gross nitrification rates with the abundance of the amoA transcripts of NH₃-oxidizing archaea. We further measured the gross NH₄⁺ production rates and analyzed the community composition of the NH₃-oxidizing archaea. The results suggest that NH₃-oxidizing archaea, rather than heterotrophic nitrifiers and NH₃-oxidizing bacteria, are responsible for the nitrification in the N-saturated forest soils. NH₃-oxidizing archaea in the soils could be acidophilic, having low amoA diversity, indicating their strong adaptation to the highly acidified soils. The gross NH₄⁺ production rate did not differ between N-saturated and non-N-saturated forests; however, the gross nitrification rate was higher in N-saturated forests. Consequently, the high abundance and NH₃ oxidation activity of NH₃-oxidizing archaea caused the high rates of nitrification and subsequent leaching of NO₃⁻ in the N-saturated forest. This study suggests that acidophilic NH₃-oxidizing archaea have a great impact on soil N cycling in N-saturated forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aacetylene 3aacid soils 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abacteria 3acommunity structure 3aforest soils 3aforests 3aleaching 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3asoil acidification 3aChina 0aNitrogen-saturated forest 0aNH3-Oxidizing archaea 0aHeterotrophic nitrification1 aIkutani, Junko1 aFang, Yunting1 aYoh, Muneoki1 aMo, Jiangming1 aSuwa, Yuichi1 aYoshida, Makoto1 aSenoo, Keishi1 aOtsuka, Shigeto1 aKoba, Keisuke0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 July, v. 122 p.220-227dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003500132024001100167040001800178100002100196245007200217300001600289506017300305520125600478650000901734650001801743650001701761650001101778650001901789650001701808650002501825650002001850650003401870650002501904650000901929650001801938700003301956700002001989773010702009856011202116856008102228956010702309961000902416852000902425655001202434IND50089042120221214223802.0140702s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008904212DNAL7 a3003462aris7 a10113/590602hdl7 a10.1007/s12155-014-9428-62doi8 ans4898  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArcher, David W.10aCrop residue harvest economics: An Iowa and North Dakota case study  ap. 568-575.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aRigorous economic analyses are crucial for the successful launch of lignocellulosic bioenergy facilities in 2014 and beyond. Our objectives are to (1) introduce readers to a query tool developed to use data downloaded from the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) REAPnet for constructing enterprise budgets and (2) demonstrate the use of the query tool with REAPnet data from two field research sites (Ames, IA, and Mandan, ND) for evaluating short-term economic performance of various biofuel feedstock production strategies. Our results for both sites showed that short-term (<3 years) impacts on grain profitability were lower at lower average annual crop residue removal rates. However, it will be important to monitor longer term changes to see if grain profitability declines over time and if biomass harvest degrades soil resources. Analyses for Iowa showed short-term breakeven field-edge biomass prices of $26–$42Mg−1 among the most efficient strategies, while results for North Dakota showed breakeven prices of $54–$73 Mg−1. We suggest that development of the data query tool is important because it helps illustrate several different soil and crop management strategies that could be used to provide sustainable feedstock supplies. 3asoil 3acrop residues 3acase studies 3aprices 3asoil resources 3aNorth Dakota 3abusiness enterprises 3acrop management 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aeconomic performance 3aIowa 3aprofitability1 aKarlen, D.

We selected type A gelatin because of its biodegradable and non-toxic nature as the polymer of choice for fabricating the nanoparticles by a modified two step desolvation technique. The produced nanoparticles were positively charged (+24±0.12mV) with a narrow particle size of 175±1.11nm as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The in-vitro drug release from the nanoformulations exhibited a burst effect in the first hour followed by a controlled release of the drug for the subsequent 12h. The Korsmeyer-Peppas model showed better linearity and the formulations displayed non-Fickian drug release pattern. The optimized formulation was assessed for its utility as an anti-bacterial agent and its effectiveness was tested on the corneal eye surface of rabbits. The in-vivo tolerance tests revealed that the drug loaded nano-formulations was non-irritant to the ocular tissues indicating its safety. The in-vivo anti-bacterial activity of the nanosuspension was more effective against S. aureus than the commercially market product, MoxiGram®. Microbiological efficacy assessed against B. subtilus using cup-plate method suggested that our fabricated nanosuspension possess better anti-microbial activity as compared to the commercial agent, MoxiGram® revealing promising potentials for the currently developed gelatin based nanoformualtions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abiodegradability 3acornea 3adrugs 3agelatin 3alight scattering 3amodels 3amoxifloxacin 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3arabbits 0aMoxifloxacin 0aGelatin 0aOcular tissues 0aIn-vivo tolerance 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aBacillus subtilus1 aPrajapati, Sunil Kumar1 aVerma, Amita1 aGupta, Rishikesh1 aIyer, Arun K.1 aKesharwani, Prashant0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 483 p.132-138dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245018200162300001800344520150200362592002801864596005401892650002401946650001301970650001401983650001401997650001802011650001402029650002302043650001302066650002602079650001102105650001502116650002602131650002702157650001902184650001902203650001602222650002002238653001302258653001502271653002602286653001802312700001502330700001802345700001602363700001202379700001402391773010702405856008202512852000902594655001202603IND60647739820221119093914.0190620e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064773982DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-09-18-1606-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Lifei10aOil Adjuvants Enhance the Efficacy of Pyraclostrobin in Managing Cucumber Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera xanthii) by Modifying the Affinity of Fungicide Droplets on Diseased Leaves  ap. 1657-1664.  aAdding adjuvants improved the affinity of fungicide droplets to cucumber leaves infected with powdery mildew (Podosphaera xanthii) and subsequent efficacy of fungicide treatments in reducing the disease. The affinity of oil adjuvants was quantified by adhesional tension and “work of adhesion”. Oil adjuvant-fungicide mixtures were applied to plants in field experiments to evaluate their effectiveness in disease prevention. Both the adhesional tension and work of adhesion of the adjuvants at selected concentrations increased on powdery-mildew-infected cucumber leaves more than on healthy cucumber leaves. The adjuvant GY-Tmax (GYT) displayed the best surface activity or “surfactivity” in enhancing the affinity and adherence of droplets to powdery-mildew-infected cucumber leaves, while epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), methyl oleate, and biodiesel exhibited much lower effects in terms of the surface tension, contact angle, adhesional tension, and work of adhesion. Field experiments determined that the combination of GYT at 1,000 mg liter⁻¹ and pyraclostrobin (150 g a.i. ha⁻¹) was most effective (91.52%) in controlling cucumber powdery mildew. Pyraclostrobin with ESO was also highly effective (ranging from 77.54 to 89.65%). The addition of oil adjuvants, especially GYT and ESO, to fungicide applications can be an effective strategy to enhance the efficacy of pesticides in controlling plant diseases by modifying the affinity of fungicide droplets to symptomatic leaves.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0200307cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aPodosphaera xanthii 3aadhesion 3aadjuvants 3abiodiesel 3acontact angle 3acucumbers 3adisease prevention 3adroplets 3afield experimentation 3aleaves 3aoleic acid 3apesticide application 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apowdery mildew 3apyraclostrobin 3asoybean oil 3asurface tension 0aaffinity 0aefficiency 0ahydrophobic interface 0aoil adjuvants1 aLi, Xiaoxu1 aGao, Yangyang1 aLi, Beixing1 aMu, Wei1 aLiu, Feng0 tPlant disease.g2019 July, v. 103, no. 7 p.1657-1664dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-09-18-1606-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012600168300001400294520108400308592002801392650001301420650001801433650001801451650001501469650001601484650001401500650002401514650001801538651001301556700002701569700001801596773009001614856008501704852000901789655001201798IND60084130220221120154425.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008413022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeiga, Pedro10aShort-term hooking mortality of three marine fish species (Sparidae) caught by recreational angling in the south Portugal  ap. 58-64.  aShort-term hooking mortality was evaluated for three sparid species [Diplodus vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire), Sparus aurata L. and Spondyliosoma cantharus (L.)] in the Algarve, south Portugal. Fishes were caught from the shore during October 2009 at a fish farm reservoir (Ria Formosa), using three different hook sizes. The relationships between hooking mortality and seven independent variables were analyzed using logistic regression models. In all, 384 fishes representing the three target species were caught during the angling sessions. The most caught species was S. cantharus (n=181; 100% undersized), followed by S. aurata (n=137; 89% undersized) and D. vulgaris (n=66; 97% undersized). Mortalities ranged between 0% for D. vulgaris and 12% for S. aurata (S. cantharus, 3%). For S. aurata, anatomical hooking location was the main predictor of mortality, with 63% of the fishes that died being deeply hooked. Our results support the current mandatory practices of releasing undersized fish for the studied species, given the low post-release mortality rates observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplodus 3aSparus aurata 3aSpondyliosoma 3afish farms 3amarine fish 3amortality 3aregression analysis 3asport fishing 3aPortugal1 aGonçalves, Jorge M.S.1 aErzini, Karim0 tFisheries research.g2011 Feb., v. 108, no. 1 p.58-64dElsevier B.V.x0165-78367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2010.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245020000165300001600365520198400381592002802365650001802393650002302411650002102434650001302455650001702468650001802485650002602503650001502529650000902544650002702553650001602580650001102596650001102607650000902618650001302627650001102640650001402651700001402665700001902679700001702698700001902715700001402734700002202748773009102770856008402861852000902945655001202954IND4480374120221120165047.0141112e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448037412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2012.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHÃ¶jer, A.10aEffect of legumeâgrass silages and Î±-tocopherol supplementation on fatty acid composition and Î±-tocopherol, Î²-carotene and retinol concentrations in organically produced bovine milk  ap. 268-281.  aTwo feeding experiments were performed to study the effects of silage botanical composition, regrowth interval and Î±-tocopherol supplementation on the fatty acid (FA) composition and Î±-tocopherol, Î²-carotene and retinol concentrations of milk. In Exp. 1, 24 Swedish Red dairy cows were fed two- or three-cut red cloverâgrass silages (R2 and R3, respectively) or two-cut birdsfoot trefoilâgrass silage (B2). In Exp. 2, 16 Norwegian Red dairy cows were fed short-term ley silage with red clover (S3) or long-term ley silage with white clover (L3) in combination with the supplementation of RRR-Î±-tocopheryl acetate (1600mg/day). The FA proportions in the milk and the recoveries of C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 were higher on the red clover diets R2 and S3 than on B2 and L3, respectively, and the n-6/n-3 FA ratio was also higher on the red clover diets. Shorter regrowth interval increased both the concentrations of FA in silage and the proportions of unsaturated FA in milk. Intakes of Î±-tocopherol, Î²-carotene and lutein were higher on B2 than on R2 due to higher silage intake on B2. However, the highest intake was seen on diet R3 due to the higher concentrations in the silage mixture. In Exp. 2, intakes of Î±-tocopherol, Î²-carotene and lutein were higher on L3. However, not all of these differences affected the milk, since the only significant differences related to silage diet in the two experiments were a higher milk Î±-tocopherol concentration on L3 than on S3 and a slightly lower Î²-carotene concentration on B2 than on R2. Supplementation with Î±-tocopherol increased milk Î±-tocopherol concentrations from 0.77 to 1.05 and from 1.07 to 1.24mg/kg milk for S3 and L3, respectively, but did not affect milk FA composition. A higher concentration of antioxidants in the feed could be beneficial as a larger proportion of the animal's vitamin requirements would be met by the forage and the need for supplementation might decrease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorwegian Red 3aTrifolium pratense 3aTrifolium repens 3aacetates 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3abotanical composition 3adairy cows 3adiet 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3aforage 3alutein 3amilk 3aregrowth 3asilage 3avitamin A1 aAdler, S.1 aMartinsson, K.1 aJensen, S.K.1 aSteinshamn, H.1 aThuen, E.1 aGustavsson, A.-M.0 tLivestock science.g2012 Oct., v. 148, no. 3 p.268-281dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2012.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245013400210300001200344520086500356592002801221650002701249650002001276650002101296650001301317650001301330650001801343650000901361650001401370650001101384650002001395653001201415653001801427653001301445653000901458653002001467700002501487700002101512700001901533700002101552700002301573700001901596700002301615700001801638700001501656700002601671700001901697700002301716700002101739700002301760773010501783856008601888852000901974655001201983IND60597171020221120211108.0190617e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059717102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovák, Martin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3450-122010aRelationship between nitrogen isotope ratios of NO3−and N2O in vertical porewater profiles through a polluted rain-fed peat bog  ap. 7-9.  aWe report a combination of δ15N-NO3- and δ15N-N2O values along vertical porewater profiles through a Sphagnum-dominated, high-elevation peat bog. Our objective was to distinguish between N2O production from NO3−via denitrification and N2O consumption via reduction to N2. Nitrate-N in runoff was isotopically heavier than NO3−-N in atmospheric deposition, indicating export of organically-cycled N. Constant N2O concentrations in porewater profiles contrasted with a shift toward higher δ15N-N2O values upward. In the 60-30 cm depth interval, a significant negative correlation between δ15N-NO3- and δ15N-N2O values was observed. Higher δ15N values of residual NO3− in the deepest peat layer reflected higher rates of NO3− reduction. Isotopically heavier N2O-N at shallower depths corresponded to residual N2O following partial reduction to N2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3adenitrification 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3apeat 3apeatlands 3arunoff 3astable isotopes 0aNitrate 0aNitrous oxide 0aIsotopes 0aPeat 0aDenitrification1 aSuarez, Silvia Parra1 aGebauer, Gerhard1 aThoma, Michael1 aBuzek, Frantisek1 aCejkova, Bohuslava1 aJackova, Ivana1 aStepanova, Marketa1 aPrechova, Eva1 aCurik, Jan1 aVeselovsky, Frantisek1 aValkova, Ivana1 aBláha, Vladimír,1 aFottova, Daniela1 aKomárek, Arnošt,0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 Aug., v. 123 p.7-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015200173300001100325520111400336592002801450650001501478650002301493650003301516650001301549650001301562650001401575650001901589650001401608650001101622650002301633650001501656650001701671650001401688650001501702651001201717700002401729700002001753700001601773700001701789773011201806856008101918852000901999655001202008IND60469426720221122154010.0160112e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046942672DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4820-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelali, Mohamed Amine10aNutrient exchange and oxygen demand at the sediment–water interface during dry and wet seasons off the Medjerda River Delta (Tunis Gulf, Tunisia)  ap. 25.  aIn situ benthic flux of oxygen, alkalinity, and nutrients was assessed at the water–sediment interface using benthic chambers at three stations in the Medjerda River Delta (Tunisia) at 10, 20 and 40 m depth during March and August 2012. Simultaneously, three sediment cores were taken at the same locations to determine the diffusive flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN = NO₂ ⁻, NO₃ ⁻, NH₄ ⁺) and PO₄ ³⁻ with a Technicon Autoanalyzer III to estimate diagenetic mechanisms occurring below the sediment–water interface. Oxygen consumption at the interface is about 1.7–10 mmol/m²/day essentially controlled by organic matter degradation and oxidation of reduced elements. Nitrate concentration is relatively high in the sediment (above 140 μM for NO₃ ⁻), and its production did not always conform to the general scheme of early diagenesis. NH₄ ⁺ and PO₄ ³⁻ were released at a rate of 96.5 and 1.27 μmol/m²/day, respectively, consistent with those measured in benthic chambers, but amounting to <30 % of benthic fluxes for NH₄ ⁺ and <5 % for PO₄ ³⁻.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aammonium compounds 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aphosphates 3ariver deltas 3asediments 3awet season 3aTunisia1 aZaaboub, Noureddine1 aOueslati, Walid1 aAdded, Ayed1 aAleya, Lotfi0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.25-25dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4820-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245016900167300001600336500001500352520173200367592002802099650001302127650001402140650002002154650002202174650001102196650001902207650001102226651001802237653001502255700002102270700002202291700001802313700001702331700001902348700001902367773012902386856004802515852000902563655001202572IND4471209120221120165009.0120426e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447120912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-011-9340-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouglas, Ellen M.10aCoastal flooding, climate change and environmental justice: identifying obstacles and incentives for adaptation in two metropolitan Boston Massachusetts communities  ap. 537-562.  a2019-12-06  aWe explored the possible future impacts of increased coastal flooding due to sea level rise and the potential adaptation responses of two urban, environmental justice communities in the metropolitan Boston area of Massachusetts. East Boston is predominantly a residential area with some industrial and commercial activities, particularly along the coastal fringe. Everett, a city to the north of Boston, has a diversified industrial and commercial base. While these two communities have similar socioeconomic characteristics, they differ substantially in the extent to which residents would be impacted by increased coastal flooding. In East Boston, a large portion of residents would be flooded, while in Everett, it is the commercial/industrial districts that are primarily vulnerable. Through a series of workshops with residents in each community, we found that the target populations do not have an adaptation perspective or knowledge of any resources that could assist them in this challenge. Furthermore, they do not feel included in the planning processes within their communities. However, a common incentive for both communities was an intense commitment to their communities and an eagerness to learn more and become actively engaged in decisions regarding climate change adaptation. The lessons that can be applied to other studies include 1) images are powerful tools in communicating concepts, 2) understanding existing cultural knowledge and values in adaptation planning is essential to the planning process and 3) engaging local residents at the beginning of the process can create important educational opportunities and develop trust and consensus that is necessary for moving from concept to implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanning 3asea level 3acultural values 3aresidential areas 3afloods 3aclimate change 3acities 3aMassachusetts 0aadaptation1 aKirshen, Paul H.1 aPaolisso, Michael1 aWatson, Chris1 aWiggin, Jack1 aEnrici, Ashley1 aRuth, Matthias0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2012 June, v. 17, no. 5 p.537-562dSpringer-Verlagx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-011-9340-8  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245009000155300001600245520087200261592002801133650001301161650001501174650002101189650001301210650001701223650001601240650001001256650001501266700002001281773013101301856003801432852000901470655001201479IND50065033320221123024714.0130414e200004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006503332DNAL7 a10.2307/32367982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgan, Todd P.10aSimilarity between seed banks and above‐ground vegetation along a salinity gradient  ap. 189-194.  aZonation of above‐ground vegetation often occurs in salt marshes along salinity and moisture gradients. The above‐ground vegetation and seed bank in four physiognomically different vegetation zones in a salt marsh were compared to determine their level of similarity using percent similarity as a distance measure. 10‐m transects were established along a salinity gradient through four different vegetation zones; a Salicornia zone, a Salicornia‐Atriplex zone, an Atriplex zone and an Atriplex‐Hordeum zone. A UPGMA cluster analysis demonstrated that the above‐ground vegetation was not usually highly correlated with the seed bank composition of zonal communities. Since seeds of these annual salt marsh species occurred in all zones, the levels of salt stress may be the main factor determining which species were found in the above‐ground vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtriplex 3aSalicornia 3acluster analysis 3asalinity 3asalt marshes 3asalt stress 3aseeds 3avegetation1 aUngar, Irwin A.0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2000 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.189-194dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3236798  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245011100186300001600297520104400313592002801357650002101385650001101406650001001417650001601427650001401443650001401457650001201471650003301483650001301516650004701529650007301576650002401649650001101673650004201684650005001726650002701776650001401803651001001817651001001827700001701837700001801854700001601872773010701888856005101995852000902046655001202055IND50075035920221122122624.0140410e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007503592DNAL7 a231305812pmid7 a10.1080/00071668.2012.7119042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCircella, E.10aVirulence-associated genes in avian pathogenic Escherichia coli from laying hens in Apulia, southern Italy  ap. 465-470.  a1. Escherichia coli isolated from lesions (Avian Pathogenic E. coli - APEC) of layer hens affected by colibacillosis and from intestinal contents of clinically-healthy birds (Avian Faecal E. coli - AFEC) were serotyped. All the isolates were investigated for the presence of virulence genes to determine which genes were more closely related to those from lesions.2. A number of different serogroups were detected, O78 being predominant among the isolates from colibacillosis.3. E. coli isolated from lesions were not linked to a specific pathotype (set of common virulence genes).4. The presence of the virulence genes, with the exception of astA, was associated more generally with APEC strains.5. Statistically, genes such as cva/cvi, tsh, iss, irp2 and iucD were more related to isolates from colibacillosis.6. It is suggested that the detection of these genes in a rapid and inexpensive test for field practitioners could provide useful information about the potential virulence of E. coli isolated in commercial layer flocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aflocks 3agenes 3alaying hens 3aserotypes 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aChickens 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aSerotypingxveterinary 2aVirulence 3aItaly 0aItaly1 aPennelli, D.1 aTagliabue, S.1 aCamarda, A.0 tBritish poultry science.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 53, no. 4 p.465-470dTaylor & Francis Groupx1466-17997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071668.2012.711904  aDNAL 7aarticle04235naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245012800200300001600328500001900344500002000363520146500383592002801848596006301876596008501939596008502024596004502109596005502154650001202209650001502221650002002236650001302256650002602269650001502295650001902310650003702329651001302366700002102379700006202400700006402462700002302526700005602549700006302605700002302668700006502691700006002756700002202816700002102838700006402859700006102923700006202984700006003046700007403106700005703180700003003237700006003267700006003327773011603387856007303503852000903576655001203585IND60729884720221120112319.0210303e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072988472DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.171542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLugli, Laynara F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8404-484110aRapid responses of root traits and productivity to phosphorus and cation additions in a tropical lowland forest in Amazonia  ap. 116-128.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil nutrient availability can strongly affect root traits. In tropical forests, phosphorus (P) is often considered the main limiting nutrient for plants. However, support for the P paradigm is limited, and N and cations might also control tropical forests functioning. We used a large‐scale experiment to determine how the factorial addition of nitrogen (N), P and cations affected root productivity and traits related to nutrient acquisition strategies (morphological traits, phosphatase activity, arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation and nutrient contents) in a primary rainforest growing on low‐fertility soils in Central Amazonia after 1 yr of fertilisation. Multiple root traits and productivity were affected. Phosphorus additions increased annual root productivity and root diameter, but decreased root phosphatase activity. Cation additions increased root productivity at certain times of year, also increasing root diameter and mycorrhizal colonisation. P and cation additions increased their element concentrations in root tissues. No responses were detected with N addition. Here we showed that rock‐derived nutrients determined root functioning in low‐fertility Amazonian soils, demonstrating not only the hypothesised importance of P, but also highlighting the role of cations. The changes in fine root traits and productivity indicated that even slow‐growing tropical rainforests can respond rapidly to changes in resource availability.  aPublisher supplied data  aERC‐SyG‐2013‐610028cH2020 European Research Council  a206826/2014‐1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a458020/2013‐3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aDP170104091cAustralian Research Council  aNE/L007223/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3acations 3afine roots 3alowland forests 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3asoil nutrients 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aAmazonia1 aRosa, Jessica S.1 aAndersen, Kelly M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1460-99041 aDi Ponzio, Raffaello1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7527-35941 aAlmeida, Renata V.1 aPires, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8094-18791 aCordeiro, Amanda L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7226-01331 aCunha, Hellen F.V.1 aMartins, Nathielly P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2501-747X1 aAssis, Rafael L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8468-64141 aMoraes, Anna C.M.1 aSouza, Sheila T.1 aAragão, Luiz E.O.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4134-67081 aCamargo, Jose.

Seven semipurifed diets were formulated to contain 0.07 (the basal), 2.27, 5.32, 8.10, 12.06, 15.24 and 19.48 g available phosphorus/kg diet. The results showed that specific growth rate, body length and feed efficiency significantly increased in the fish fed diets containing 0.07 to 15.24 g available P/kg diet (p < .05). Ash and P content increased in fish fed diets containing 0.07–12.06 P g/kg (p < .05) and then levelled off, while moisture, crude protein and lipid had no significant difference (p > .05). The protein retention efficiency increased in the fish fed with diets 0.07–5.32 g/kg P (p < .05) and then reached a plateau. The P content in faeces was higher in fish fed diets containing 15.24 and 19.48 g available P/kg. Total P concentration in tank water increased in fish fed 0.07–12.06 g available P per kg diet (p < .05). The plasma P was higher in the fish fed with 15.24 g available P/kg diet (p < .05), triglycerides was lower in the fish fed diet containing 15.24 and 19.48 g available P/kg (p < .05), no significant differences were observed in plasma Ca, plasma glucose and calcitonin (p > .05). Based on SGR, whole body P content and FE, dietary available P requirement for juvenile gibel carp were 13.37, 13.97 g/kg and 15.06 respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius gibelio 3ablood glucose 3abody composition 3abody length 3acalcitonin 3acalcium 3acrude protein 3afeces 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3aspecific growth rate 3atriacylglycerols1 aZhu, Xiaoming1 aYang, Yunxia1 aHan, Dong1 aJin, Junyan1 aXie, Shouqi0 tAquaculture research.g2018 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.1284-1292dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.135823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245018500179300001800364520107600382592002801458650001301486650002101499650001601520650001601536650002501552650001501577650001701592650001801609650001201627650001501639650001201654650002001666650000901686650002001695650003301715700003601748700002501784773011201809856008101921852000902002655001202011IND60573600720221119171854.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057360072DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-016-2188-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira Moraes, Anelize10aEvaluation of the Fermentation Potential of Pulp Mill Residue to Produce D(−)-Lactic Acid by Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation Using Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens  ap. 1574-1585.  aLactic acid is widely used in chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries, besides it is the building block to produce polylactic acid, which is a sustainable alternative biopolymer to synthetic plastic due to its biodegradability. Aiming at producing an optically pure isomer, the present work evaluated the potential of pulp mill residue as feedstock to produce D(−)-lactic acid by a strain of the bacterium Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens using separate hydrolysis and fermentation process. Enzymatic hydrolysis, optimized through response surface methodology for 1 g:4 mL solid/liquid ratio and 24.8 FPU/gcₑₗₗᵤₗₒₛₑ enzyme loading, resulted in 140 g L⁻¹ total reducing sugar and 110 g L⁻¹ glucose after 48 h, leading to 61 % of efficiency. In instrumented bioreactor, 57 g L⁻¹ of D(−)-lactic acid was achieved in 20 h of fermentation, while only 0.5 g L⁻¹ of L(+)-lactic acid was generated. Furthermore, product yield of 0.97 g/g and volumetric productivity of 2.8 g L⁻¹ h⁻¹ were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3abioreactors 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3afood industry 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3aisomers 3apolylactic acid 3apulp 3areducing sugars 3aresponse surface methodology1 aRamirez, Ninoska Isabel Bojorge1 aPereira, Nei, JrcJr0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2016 Dec., v. 180, no. 8 p.1574-1585dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-016-2188-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147242010400167245010700271300001400378520118600392592002801578650001501606650001601621650001201637650001101649650001101660650001101671650001701682650001701699650001101716650000901727650001101736650001401747650002201761650001501783650001101798650001301809650000901822650000901831650001201840650000901852651002101861700001701882700002401899700001701923773011601940856008102056852000902137655001202146IND60630478620221120233103.0190209e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063047862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10341-018-0398-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalkisim, Ozgun10aBeurteilung des Schwermetallgehaltes bei Maulbeeren (Frucht, Blatt, Boden) aus der Region Gumushane10aAssessment of Heavy Metal Contents of Mulberry Samples (Fruit, Leaf, Soil) Grown in Gumushane Province  ap. 85-96.  aThe present study aims to identify the heavy metal contents of white mulberry (Morus alba L.) and black mulberry (Morus nigra L.) that are grown in the city center of Gumushane province and its neighboring counties. Heavy metal analyzes were performed in the fruits, leaves and soils of the plants. The control samples, on the other hand, were collected from the mulberry trees located 3 km away from the highway where the vehicle traffic and industrial activities are at their lowest. Sample collection was performed twice a year, namely during the ripening period and fully ripening period of the fruits.The analyses of the heavy metals were performed by using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrophotometry (ICP-MS). The obtained results were compared with the acceptable limits of heavy metal for humans as established by the World Health Organization (WHO), Turkish Food Codex (TFC) and the literature and an opinion was submitted as to whether they present any risk in terms of human health. When the available data is evaluated, the mulberries grown in Gumushane province, were found to have presented a health risk in terms of Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mn and Co metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorus alba 3aMorus nigra 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3afruits 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alead 3aleaves 3amanganese 3amass spectrometry 3amulberries 3anickel 3aripening 3arisk 3asoil 3atraffic 3azinc 3aTurkey (country)1 aOzdes, Duygu1 aBaltaci, Cemalettin1 aDuran, Celal0 tErwerbsobstbau.g2019 Mar., v. 61, no. 1 p.85-96dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl29949x0014-03097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10341-018-0398-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014800172300001400320520136900334592002801703650002001731650002201751650002101773650001601794650001901810650001801829650001901847650001901866650001501885650001301900650001301913650001701926650001601943650003701959650001901996650003702015653002702052653003102079653002502110700002502135700001802160700002602178700001802204700002402222773012302246856008202369852000902451655001202460IND60605898920221117180353.0180723e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060589892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2016.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarakāra, Arpitā,10aEnhanced photocatalytic performance of morphologically tuned Bi2S3 NPs in the degradation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation  ap. 49-59.  aHere in, morphologically tuned Bi2S3 NPs were successfully synthesized from a single-source precursor complex [Bi(ACDA)3] [HACDA=2-aminocyclopentene-1-dithiocarboxylic acid] by decomposing in various solvents using a simple solvothermal method. The as-obtained products were characterized by XRD, TEM, UV−vis spectroscopy and BET surface area measurements. Structural analyses revealed that the as-prepared Bi2S3 NPs can be tuned to different morphologies by varying various solvents and surfactants. The interplay of factors that influenced the size and morphology of the nanomaterials has been studied. Moreover, mastery over the morphology of nanoparticles enables control of their properties and enhancement of their usefulness for a given application. These materials emerged as a highly active visible light-driven photocatalyst towards degradation of methylene blue dye and the efficiencies are dependent on size and surface area of the NPs. In addition, photocatalytic degradation of highly toxic dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was studied using synthesized Bi2S3 NPs as catalyst and the rate of degradation has been found to be much better compared to that exhibited by commercial WO3. We believe that this new synthesis approach can be extended to the synthesis of other metal sulfide nanostructures and open new opportunities for device applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarboxylic acids 3airradiation 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3asolvents 3asulfides 3asurface area 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atungsten oxide 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aDifferent morphologies 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0aCatalytic efficiency1 aGhosh, Abhisek Brata1 aSaha, Namrata1 aSrivastava, Divesh N.1 aPaul, Parimal1 aAdhikary, Bibhutosh0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 483 p.49-59dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2016.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010400169300001100273520161000284592002801894650003001922650002301952650002901975650001202004650001102016650001702027650001202044650001202056650001402068650001302082650001102095650001102106650001502117650000902132650000902141650001402150650001402164650001102178650001302189650000702202650001402209650001602223650001102239650001302250650001102263650002002274650001402294650001302308650002102321650001402342650001302356650001802369650002202387650001502409650000902424650001402433651001002447700001902457700002502476700002502501700001502526700002202541700002202563773011202585856008102697852000902778655001202787IND60469427020221120023920.0160112e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046942702DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4811-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaudyal, Rukumesh10aMajor ions and trace elements of two selected rivers near Everest region, southern Himalayas, Nepal  ap. 46.  aDuring pre-monsoon of 2013, water samples were collected from 30 sites of two major rivers, viz. Dudh Koshi and Indrawati to assess the river water quality on the southern side of the Nepalese Himalayas. The physical parameters such as pH, EC, turbidity and water temperature were measured in the field and major ions (Na⁺, NH₄ ⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Cl⁻, SO₄ ²⁻, and NO₃ ⁻) and element concentrations (Li, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, Pb, U, Y, Zr, Nb and Cd) in the water samples were analyzed in the laboratory. The result indicated river waters were neutral to mostly alkaline with pH ranging from 6.57 to 8.81 and EC ranging from 10.5 to 321 μS/cm. The lower values of turbidity were recorded in the pristine tributaries of Dudh Koshi, whereas the main rivers had the higher values with a range of 0.51–515 NTU. Bicarbonate (HCO₃ ⁻) showed a significant correlation with Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, suggesting carbonate weathering as the dominant geochemical process in the region. Furthermore, the Gibbs plot also suggested the dominance of rock weathering. Very low concentration of trace elements was found in most of the samples which were within the WHO guidelines. In addition, the concentrations of toxic elements such as As and Pb were below the detectable limits in most of the samples. Furthermore, the analysis of PCA suggests that most of the elements originated from natural weathering; however, there were some evidences of anthropogenic effect on water quality which may not be critical issue at present but can be of concern in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aammonium compounds 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3abarium 3abicarbonates 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achlorides 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aguidelines 3aions 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anickel 3anitrates 3apH 3apotassium 3ariver water 3arivers 3arubidium 3asodium 3asoil weathering 3astrontium 3asulfates 3atoxic substances 3aturbidity 3avanadium 3awater quality 3awater temperature 3aweathering 3azinc 3azirconium 3aNepal1 aKang, Shichang1 aSharma, Chhatra Mani1 aTripathee, Lekhendra1 aHuang, Jie1 aRupakheti, Dipesh1 aSillanpää, Mika0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.46-46dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4811-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245017500164300001800339520106800357592002801425596004301453650002301496650002001519650002601539650002301565650001001588650002501598650002601623650002601649650001501675650001301690650001601703700002001719700001801739700002101757700002001778700001801798773014601816856008301962852000902045655001202054IND60655634520221118001853.0190823e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065563452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-019-02149-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, So Hee10aLipid and unsaturated fatty acid productions from three microalgae using nitrate and light-emitting diodes with complementary LED wavelength in a two-phase culture system  ap. 1517-1526.  aIn this study, Pavlova lutheri, Chlorella vulgaris, and Porphyridium cruentum were cultured using modified F/2 media in a 1 L flask culture.

TMDs are not widely studied as thin film photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, even though they have demonstrated an excellent performance in photonics and optoelectronics (as photodetectors and field-effect transistors), which is related to their specific intrinsic structural, mechanical, optical and electronic properties. In this review, we focus on WSe₂, one of the most promising compounds among TMDs. The emergence, development and performance of WSe₂, especially, in the form of 2D layers and thin film photoelectrodes, the role of passivation, co-catalysts and plasmonic structures for the solar hydrogen evolution reaction are discussed and compared to those of other TMDs and other photoelectrode materials. Practical efficiency limits for PEC hydrogen evolution for TMDs with respect to theoretical limits are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of TMDs are assessed based on intrinsic and extrinsic reasons. Strategies that could advance the performance of TMDs for PEC hydrogen generation are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrogen production 3aphotoelectrodes 3aphotonics1 aEllmer, Klaus0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 May 3, v. 10, no. 17 p.9327-9347dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta01108e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04914naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094024004300140024005000183040001800233100001400251245009900265300001400364506007600378506003100454520248200485592002802967596008302995506003703078650002503115650002003140650001803160650001003178650003003188650001703218650001703235650001803252650002103270650002303291650001103314650002103325650001703346650002203363650002003385650001803405650002203423650001103445650001703456650001503473650001003488650001803498650001203516650001603528650001703544650001303561650002203574650001403596650001103610650001903621650000903640653002603649653001803675653002303693653002003716653001903736653002403755653001303779700002403792700002503816773012603841856009003967856004504057961000904102852000904111655001204120IND60525506620221215143354.0190318e20160502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052550662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.02.0132chorus7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.02.0132doi7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.02.0132chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Aixia10aImpact of mulches and growing season on indicator bacteria survival during lettuce cultivation  ap. 28-39.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIn fresh produce production, the use of mulches as ground cover to retain moisture and control weeds is a common agricultural practice, but the influence that various mulches have on enteric pathogen survival and dispersal is unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of different mulching methods on the survival of soil and epiphytic fecal indicator bacteria on organically grown lettuce during different growing seasons. Organically managed lettuce, cultivated with various ground covers — polyethylene plastic, corn-based biodegradable plastic, paper and straw mulch — and bare ground as a no-mulch control, was overhead inoculated with manure-contaminated water containing known levels of generic Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. Leaves and soil samples were collected at intervals over a two week period on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14, and quantitatively assessed for E. coli, fecal coliforms and Enterococcus spp. Data were analyzed using mixed models with repeated measures and an exponential decline with asymptote survival model. Indicator bacterial concentrations in the lettuce phyllosphere decreased over time under all treatments, with more rapid E. coli declines in the fall than in the spring (p<0.01). Persistence of E. coli in spring was correlated with higher maximum and minimum temperatures in this season, and more regular rainfall. The survival model gave very good fits for the progression of E. coli concentrations in the phyllosphere over time (R2=0.88±0.12). In the spring season, decline rates of E. coli counts were faster (2013 p=0.18; 2014 p<0.005) for the bare ground-cultivated lettuce compared to mulches. In fall 2014, the E. coli decline rate on paper mulch-grown lettuce was higher (p<0.005). Bacteria fluctuated more, and persisted longer, in soil compared to lettuce phyllosphere, and mulch type was a factor for fecal coliform levels (p<0.05), with higher counts retrieved under plastic mulches in all trials, and higher enterococci levels under straw in fall 2014 (p<0.05). This study demonstrates that mulches used in lettuce production may impact the fate of enteric bacteria in soil or on lettuce, most likely in relation to soil moisture retention, and other weather-related factors, such as temperature and rainfall. The data suggest that the time between exposure to a source of enteric bacteria and harvesting of the crop is season dependent, which has implications for determining best harvest times.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplastic film mulches 3aenteropathogens 3afresh produce 3apaper 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aweed control 3apolyethylene 3astraw mulches 3abiodegradability 3aorganic production 3aleaves 3aEscherichia coli 3aharvest date 3acoliform bacteria 3acrop production 3asoil bacteria 3aindicator species 3amodels 3aEnterococcus 3asoil water 3astraw 3asoil sampling 3alettuce 3atemperature 3aphyllosphere 3amulching 3apathogen survival 3aepiphytes 3aspring 3agrowing season 3arain 0aBacterial decay rates 0aPlastic mulch 0aCropping practices 0aBoxLucas1 model 0aProduce safety 0aOverhead irrigation 0aplastics1 aBuchanan, Robert L.1 aMicallef, Shirley A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2016 May 2, v. 224 p.28-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.02.0133Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5255066  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245013700173520186700310592002802177650002302205650001502228650002702243650002502270650001002295650001602305650001702321650001802338650001702356650001902373650000702392653002502399653002802424653001902452653001702471700001902488700001902507700001702526700001602543773009102559856009002650852000902740655001202749IND60791534220221119015726.0220906e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079153422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1361712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Hongyan10aFormation characteristics of disinfection byproducts from four different algal organic matter during chlorination and chloramination  aAlgal organic matter (AOM) has become an important precursor of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in multiple drinking water sources. In this study, the formation of DBPs during chlorination and chloramination of AOMs from four algal species (Microcystis aeruginosa, Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus obliquus, and Cyclotella sp.) under different conditions (disinfectant doses 4.0–8.0 mg/L as Cl₂, pH 6.0–8.0, and bromide 0–1.0 mg/L) were simultaneously investigated. Some common and specific characteristics of DBP formation have also been identified. The yields of total DBPs from the four AOMs were 3.28 × 10²–6.00 × 10² and 1.97 × 10²–3.70 × 10² nmol/mg C during chlorination and chloramination, respectively. The proportions of haloacetic acids (HAAs) in total DBPs were approximately ≥50%. Increasing disinfectant doses or pH only enhanced the yields of trihalomethanes (THMs) during chlorination but enhanced the yields of THMs, HAAs and dihaloacetonitriles (DHANs) during chloramination. Increasing bromide concentrations enhanced THM yields but decreased HAA yields during chlorination and chloramination, in addition to the shift from chlorinated DBPs to brominated DBPs. The DHAN yields of the four AOMs slightly decreased with bromide levels during chlorination, whereas different AOMs showed different trends with bromide levels during chloramination. During chlorination, C. vulgaris and S. obliquus AOMs generated higher THM and DHAN yields (at 4.0–5.0 mg/L as Cl₂) than the other AOMs. During chloramination, M. aeruginosa AOM generated higher THM and HAA yields than the other AOMs (at 0.1 mg/L bromide). Cyclotella sp. AOM had the highest THM-bromine substitution factors during chlorination and the highest DHAN-bromine substitution factors during both chlorination and chloramination (at 0.1 mg/L bromide).  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aCyclotella 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aScenedesmus obliquus 3aalgae 3abromination 3achlorination 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3aorganic matter 3apH 0aAlgal organic matter 0aDisinfection byproducts 0aChloramination 0aChlorination1 aCheng, Shengzi1 aZhang, Liangyu1 aLuo, Wenjing1 aZhou, Yanan0 tChemosphere.g2022 Dec., v. 308 p.136171-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1361713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245010600209300001800315506007600333520147400409592002801883506003701911650002101948650002101969650001501990650001902005650002402024650001502048653002302063653001502086653001802101700002602119700002202145700002402167700002202191700002102213700002102234700002002255700001802275700002002293700002002313700001802333700002702351700002602378773019202404856007902596852000902675655001202684IND60230350320221207124149.0150614e20150317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023035032DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15007621122doi7 aPMC43720042pmcid7 a257399592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMemmi, Elisa Maria10ap63 sustains self-renewal of mammary cancer stem cells through regulation of Sonic Hedgehog signaling  ap. 3499-3504.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe predominant p63 isoform, ΔNp63, is a master regulator of normal epithelial stem cell (SC) maintenance. However, in vivo evidence of the regulation of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties by p63 is still limited. Here, we exploit the transgenic MMTV-ErbB2 (v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) mouse model of carcinogenesis to dissect the role of p63 in the regulation of mammary CSC self-renewal and breast tumorigenesis. ErbB2 tumor cells enriched for SC-like properties display increased levels of ΔNp63 expression compared with normal mammary progenitors. Down-regulation of p63 in ErbB2 mammospheres markedly restricts self-renewal and expansion of CSCs, and this action is fully independent of p53. Furthermore, transplantation of ErbB2 progenitors expressing shRNAs against p63 into the mammary fat pads of syngeneic mice delays tumor growth in vivo. p63 knockdown in ErbB2 progenitors diminishes the expression of genes encoding components of the Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, a driver of mammary SC self-renewal. Remarkably, p63 regulates the expression of Sonic Hedgehog ( Shh ), GLI family zinc finger 2 ( Gli2 ), and Patched1 ( Ptch1 ) genes by directly binding to their gene regulatory regions, and eventually contributes to pathway activation. Collectively, these studies highlight the importance of p63 in maintaining the self-renewal potential of mammary CSCs via a positive modulation of the Hh signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast neoplasms 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3amammary glands 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 0amammary stem cells 0ap53 family 0abreast cancer1 aSanarico, Anna Giulia1 aGiacobbe, Arianna1 aPeschiaroli, Angelo1 aFrezza, Valentina1 aCicalese, Angelo1 aPisati, Federica1 aTosoni, Daniela1 aZhou, Huiqing1 aTonon, Giovanni1 aAntonov, Alexey1 aMelino, Gerry1 aPelicci, Pier Giuseppe1 aBernassola, Francesca0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Mar. 17, v. 112, no. 11 p.3499-3504dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15007621123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04443naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245022400173300001400397520288000411592002803291650002303319650001803342650001503360650001603375650001703391650003403408650002103442650001303463650001103476650001803487650002503505650001203530650001503542650001703557651001003574700001703584700001603601700001403617700002003631700002203651700001803673700002203691773011403713856009003827990002303917852000903940655001203949IND60094951620221120124722.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009495162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2010.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Li-Rong10aEvaluation of a colloidal gold immunochromatography assay in the detection of Treponema pallidum specific IgM antibody in syphilis serofast reaction patients: a serologic marker for the relapse and infection of syphilis  ap. 10-16.  aSyphilis remains as a worldwide public health problem; hence, it is necessary to develop a new diagnostic approach that is easier and faster than conventional tests. A new testing method to detect Treponema pallidum IgM (TP-IgM), named colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA), is presented in place of fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-Abs). TP-IgM was detected using GICA developed on syphilis-specific recombinant proteins TPN17 and TPN47. The FTA-Abs IgM test was set as the gold standard. A GICA TP-IgM test was performed to detect syphilis in 1208 patients who received recommended therapy for syphilis for more than 1 year at the Xiamen Center of Clinical Laboratory in China from June 2005 to May 2009. One hundred blood donors were set up as control. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio were 98.21%, 99.04%, 93.75%, 99.73%, 102.3, and 0.018, respectively. Detection on 500 interference specimens indicated that the biological false-positive rate of the GICA test was extremely low and was free from other biological and chemical factors. The patients were divided into the following experimental groups based on the results of toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) and treponemal pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA): (1) the syphilis serofast reaction (SSR) group consisted of 411 cases with (+) TRUST and (+) TPPA, which exhibited no clinical manifestations of syphilis after 1 year of recommended syphilis treatment; (2) the serum cure group, which was further subdivided into group A, a group that consisted of 251 cases with (−) TRUST and (+) TPPA, and (3) group B, a group that consisted of 546 cases with (−) TRUST and (−) TPPA; and (4) the blood donor control group, which consisted of 100 healthy persons with (−) ELISA-TP and (−) TPPA. We used the FTA-Abs method and the GICA method to detect TP-IgM; the positive rate of TP-IgM in 411 SSR patients was 34.55% and 36.01%, respectively. However, in serum cure group A, the positive rate of TP-IgM was 10.36% and 11.16%, respectively. The χ² test revealed that there is a significant difference in the positive rate between these 2 groups (P < 0.01). The TP-IgM positive rate in the same group, as detected by the GICA method and the FTA-Abs method, had no significant difference in statistics. However, as detected by the GICA method and the FTA-Abs method, all the samples in serum cure group B and the control group were negative for TP-IgM. The TP-IgM–positive result demonstrated that active T. pallidum remained in the bodies of SSR patients. In summary, the characteristics of GICA TP-IgM correspond to that of FTA-Abs TP-IgM; this can be used as a serologic marker for the relapse and infection of syphilis in place of the conventional FTA-Abs IgM test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTreponema pallidum 3aagglutination 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3afluorescence 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aimmunoglobulin M 3apatients 3apeople 3apublic health 3arecombinant proteins 3arelapse 3astatistics 3atherapeutics 3aChina1 aTong, Man-Li1 aFu, Zuo-Gen1 aDan, Bing1 aZheng, Wei-Hong1 aZhang, Chang-Gong1 aYang, Tian-Ci1 aZhang, Zhong-Ying0 tDiagnostic microbiology & infectious disease.g2011 May, v. 70, no. 1 p.10-16dElsevier Inc.x0732-88937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2010.11.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01900naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010000163300001600263520097100279592002801250650002501278650001401303650001101317650001801328650001501346700002701361773009701388856008101485990002301566852000901589655001201598IND60093523120221119102314.0141103e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009352312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2013.08.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, L.M.10aEffect of particle size and sphericity on the pickup velocity in horizontal pneumatic conveying  ap. 780-789.  aThis paper presents a theoretical and experimental analysis of the influence of particle size and sphericity on the pickup velocity in horizontal pneumatic conveying. An analytical model was developed to predict the pickup velocity based on force and moment balances taking particle size and sphericity into account. In this work it was demonstrated analytically that the pickup velocity of a particle increases when particle sphericity decreases. An experimental apparatus was developed in order to verify the influence of the diameter particle and pipeline on pickup velocity, and to validate the proposed analytical model. The obtained equations to the pickup velocity prediction cover a particle diameter range of 20–4000μm, densities range 1000–5000kg/m³ and pipeline diameter ranging from 25 to 150mm in the prediction of the minimum gas velocity required to pickup particles. These results agree with the experimental data available from the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3aequations 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aprediction1 aMesquita, A.L Amarante0 tChemical engineering science.g2013 Dec. 18, v. 104 p.780-789dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2013.08.0553Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245006900198300001800267500002000285520180300305592002802108596007802136596004702214596004702261596004702308650002102355650001902376650001802395650001302413650002902426650002202455650001202477650002002489650001902509650001002528700005002538700005502588700005702643700005802700773012502758856007702883852000902960655001202969IND60788095020221120083716.0220811e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078809502DNAL7 a10.1029/2018WR0234212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoche, K.

Turbulent mixing is known to control hyporheic exchange fluxes and the distribution of vertical mixing rates in the streambed, but it is unclear how turbulent mixing ultimately influences mass transport at the reach scale. We used a particle‐tracking model to simulate local‐ and reach‐scale solute transport for a stream with coarse‐grained sediments. Simulations were first used to determine profiles of vertical mixing rates that best described solute concentration profiles measured within a coarse granular bed in flume experiments. These vertical mixing profiles were then used to simulate a pulse solute injection to show the effects of turbulent hyporheic exchange on reach‐scale solute transport. Experimentally measured concentrations were best described by simulations with a nonmonotonic mixing profile, with highest mixing at the sediment–water interface and exponential decay into the bed. Reach‐scale simulations show that this enhanced interfacial mixing couples in‐stream and hyporheic solute transport. Coupling produces an interval of exponential decay in breakthrough curves and delays the onset of power law tailing. High streamwise velocities in the hyporheic zone reduce mass recovery in the water column and cause breakthrough curves to exhibit steeper power law slopes than predictions from mobile‐immobile modeling theory. These results demonstrate that transport models must consider the spatial variability of streamwise velocity and vertical mixing for both the stream and the hyporheic zone, and new analytical theory is needed to describe reach‐scale transport when high streamwise velocities are present in the hyporheic zone.  aPublisher supplied data  aW911NF‐15‐1‐0569cDepartment of the Army, U.S. Army Research Office  aEAR‐1351625cNational Science Foundation  aEAR‐1344280cNational Science Foundation  aEAR‐1215898cNational Science Foundation 3ahydraulic flumes 3ahyporheic zone 3amass transfer 3aresearch 3asediment-water interface 3asimulation models 3asolutes 3astream channels 3aturbulent flow 3awater1 aLi, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2551-87251 aBolster, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3960-40901 aWagner, G.

Today, silver and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used in a wide range of healthcare, food industry, domiciliary applications, and are commonly found in hard surface materials and textiles. Such an extensive use raises questions about its safety, environmental toxicity and the risks associated with microbial resistance and cross-resistance. If the mechanisms of antimicrobial action of ionic silver (Ag⁺) have been studied, there is little understanding of AgNPs interactions with microorganisms. There have been excellent reviews on the bacterial resistance mechanisms to silver, but there is a paucity of information on resistance to AgNPs. Silver toxicity and accumulation in the environment has been studied and there is a better understanding of silver concentration and species in different environmental compartments. However, owing to the increased applications of silver and AgNPs, questions remain about the presence and consequences of AgNPs in the environment. This review provides an historical perspective of silver usage, an overview of applications, and combined information of microbial resistance and toxicity. Owing the evidence provided in this review, a call for a better understanding and control of silver usage, and for tighter regulations of silver and AgNPs usage is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3across resistance 3aecotoxicology 3afabrics 3afood industry 3ahealth services 3amicroorganisms 3ananosilver 3aresistance mechanisms 3arisk 3asilver 3atoxicity 0aIonic silver 0aresistance 0aactivity1 aHartemann, Philippe0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 39, no. 4 p.373-383dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/1040841X.2012.7133233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01673naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009200174300001600266520039000282592002800672650002700700650002300727650002300750650001500773650001900788653002400807653002200831653002400853653002700877653001800904700002100922700002400943700002300967700002400990700002801014700002201042700001801064773007901082856008101161852000901242655001201251IND60529216420221119081507.0170713e20160128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052921642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Nripendra Nath10aSynthesis of brominated novel N-heterocycles: new scaffolds for antimicrobial discovery  ap. 539-546.  aIn this article, a number of novel brominated heterocycles based on aminobromopyrrolone, bromopyridazinone and hydrazinyl furanone scaffolds were synthesized from the reactions of brominated furanones with bi-nucleophiles, such as substituted or unsubstituted hydrazines.

A systematic understanding of the circadian regulation of melatonin biosynthesis-related genes has not been achieved in rice. In this study, key genes for all of the enzymes in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway that showed a peak of expression at night were identified by microarray data analysis and confirmed by qRT–PCR analysis. We further examined the expression patterns of the four genes under drought, salt, and cold stresses. The results showed that abiotic stresses, such as drought, salt, and cold, affected the expression patterns of melatonin biosynthetic genes. In addition, the circadian expression patterns of tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), tryptamine 5-hydroxylase (T5H), and serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT) genes in wild-type (WT) plants was damaged by the drought treatment under light and dark conditions. Conversely, N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) retained the circadian rhythm. The expression of ASMT was down-regulated by the rice gigantea (OsGI) mutation, suggesting the involvement of the melatonin biosynthetic pathway in the OsGI-mediated circadian regulation pathway. Taken together, our results provide clues to explain the relationship between circadian rhythms and abiotic stresses in the process of melatonin biosynthesis in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylserotonin O-methyltransferase 3aacetyltransferases 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acircadian rhythm 3acold stress 3adata analysis 3adrought 3agenes 3alight 3amelatonin 3amicroarray technology 3amutation 3arice 3aserotonin 3atryptamine 3atryptophan1 aKim, Yu-jin,1 aLim, You-Jin 1 aDuan, Shucheng 1 aEom, Seok-Hyun 1 aJung, Ki-Hong 0 tPlants.g2021 Jan. 09, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100101293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01328naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245006300191300001800254520019300272592002800465650001400493650002000507650001400527650002200541650001100563650003200574650001100606650003200617650001100649650000900660650003300669650003400702773009300736856008100829990002300910852000900933655001200942IND60093843620221118031541.0141104e20110607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009384362DNAL7 a216409042pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEpstein, Russell A.10aCognitive Neuroscience: Scene Layout from Vision and Touch  ap.

The theoretical question then arises of whether it is possible to predict when a natural resource governance system will follow such an incremental path of institutional change. Our investigation of the prior appropriation water rights system as administered in the state of Wyoming reveals that mental models, based on factors such as strong personal connections with administrators, plus strong confidence in the system, tend to favor incremental change. We note that choosing incremental change is not without risk. While systems that undertake wholesale and rapid change risk a good deal – exposing themselves to a potential shower of unanticipated consequences – systems that follow the path of incremental change also take risks. Incremental change may mean successful accommodation of new needs that demand attention, or it may be “too little too late,” ultimately allowing the pent-up pressure of unmet needs to push the system over a threshold into collapse.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3amodels 3anatural resource management 3arisk 3awater rights 3aWyoming 0aPath dependency 0aIncremental institutional change 0aPrior appropriation 0aWater rights system 0aWestern US1 aMacKinnon, Anne0 tEcological economics.g2014 Jan., v. 97 p.110-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04362naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003600132024001100168040001800179100002500197245012100222300001600343506017300359520212000532592002802652650002602680650002102706650001202727650001102739650001402750650002702764650001002791650001802801650002302819650004302842650000902885650001502894650001802909650001902927650001402946650001402960650002002974650001302994650001403007650001103021650001503032650001503047650001403062650001403076650001003090650001703100650001703117650001103134650000903145651001203154700001803166700002303184700002003207773013403227856011203361856008303473956008603556961001303642852000903655655001203664IND50089409920221214225304.0190614e20130314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008940992DNAL7 a2905942aris7 a10113/587532hdl7 a10.3390/agriculture30101572doi8 ans4437  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, John Bradley10aFatty Acid, Flavonol, and Mineral Composition Variability among Seven Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.)

Verdc.] seeds containing high concentrations of fatty acids, flavonols and minerals should provide government, public and private organizations with a nutritious and healthy food for use by malnourished and food deprived people worldwide. Seeds from seven horse gram accessions, geographically adapted to Griffin, GA, USA were analyzed for fatty acid, flavonol, and mineral concentrations using gas chromatography, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, respectively. Significant year effects occurred for stearic, oleic, linoleic, arachidic, gadoleic, and lignoceric acids. Oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acid ranged from 8.9%–16.8%, 40.3%–45.6%, and 11.6%–14.3%, respectively, as percent of total fatty acids measured (total oil ranged from 2.32% to 2.87%). Seed concentrations of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol ranged from 0–36 μg/g DW, 0–27 μg/g DW, and 240–316 μg/g DW, respectively and the only year effect was observed for kaempferol among the horse gram accessions. Year effects were found for Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, and S. Mean concentrations of macrominerals (Ca, K, Mg, P, and S) and microminerals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) ranged from 1.3–14 mg/g DW, and 1.0–95.0 μg/g DW, respectively. Several correlations were observed among several fatty acids, flavonols, and minerals. The mono-unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid correlated significantly with linoleic acid (r = −0.64), arachidic acid (r = −0.61), Ca (r = 0.50) and Zn (r = 0.51, all at P < 0.01). The flavonol, myricetin correlated significantly with quercetin (r = 0.92, P < 0.0001), while quercetin correlated with Ca (r = 0.82, P < 0.0001) and kaempferol correlated with Mg (r = 0.61, P < 0.01). Several mineral correlations were found including Fe with K (r = 0.66) and Mg (r = 0.56, both at P < 0.01). These seven horse gram accessions can be used in breeding programs to facilitate the production of superior cultivars with favorable fatty acid profiles, flavonol content, and mineral compositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrotyloma uniflorum 3aarachidonic acid 3acalcium 3acopper 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3afoods 3agadoleic acid 3agas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airon 3akaempferol 3alinoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3aminerals 3amyricetin 3anickel 3aoleic acid 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aquercetin 3aseeds 3aspectroscopy 3astearic acid 3asulfur 3azinc 3aGeorgia1 aWang, Mingli,1 aGrusak, Michael A.1 aTonnis, Brandon0 tAgriculture.g2013 Mar. 14, v. 3, no. 1 p.157-169dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/587533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture30101573Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/290594.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016800167300001600335520144700351592002801798650003001826650001201856650002101868650001301889650002001902650001901922650002501941650004501966651001002011651001002021700002102031700002802052700002402080700002202104773010802126856008102234852000902315655001202324IND60572664020221119041711.0170717e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057266402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-016-9725-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdolwa, Ivan S.12aA comparative analysis of agricultural knowledge and innovation systems in Kenya and Ghana: sustainable agricultural intensification in the rural–urban interface  ap. 453-472.  aAgriculture remains the backbone of most African economies, yet land degradation severely hampers agricultural productivity. Over the last decades, scientists and development practitioners have advocated integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) practices to improve soil fertility. However, their adoption rates are low, partly because many farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are not fully aware of the principles of this system innovation. This has been attributed to a wide communication gap between farmers and other agricultural actors in agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS). We add to the literature by applying innovation system approaches to ISFM awareness processes. This study aims to assess if AKIS are effectively disseminating ISFM knowledge by comparing results from two sites in Kenya and Ghana, which differ in the uptake of ISFM. Social network measures and statistical methods were employed using data from key formal actors and farmers. Our results suggest that the presence of weak knowledge ties is important for the awareness of ISFM at both research sites. However, in Kenya AKIS are more effective as there is a network of knowledge ties crucial for not only dissemination but also learning of complex innovations. This is largely lacking in Ghana where integration of formal and informal agricultural knowledge systems may be enhanced by fostering the function of informal and formal innovation brokers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3afarmers 3aland degradation 3alearning 3asocial networks 3asoil fertility 3astatistical analysis 3asustainable agricultural intensification 3aGhana 3aKenya1 aSchwarze, Stefan1 aBellwood-Howard, Imogen1 aSchareika, Nikolaus1 aBuerkert, Andreas0 tAgriculture and human values.g2017 June, v. 34, no. 2 p.453-472dSpringer Netherlandsx0889-048X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-016-9725-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245007800200520172400278592002802002650001502030650001702045650001802062650001002080650001102090650001102101650003002112650000902142650001202151650003402163650001302197650002502210653001202235653003002247653000902277653000802286653000802294700002102302700001902323700001502342700002002357700001302377700001402390700001702404700001502421700002002436773012102456856008202577852000902659655001202668IND60737724520221117175443.0220205e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073772452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2021.1113232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2163-033010aSrc family kinases involved in the differentiation of human preadipocytes  aObesity is characterized by the excess accumulation of white adipose tissue (WAT). Src family kinases (SFKs) are non-receptor tyrosine kinases consisting of eight members (SRC, FYN, YES1, HCK, LCK, LYN, FGR and BLK) that have been studied extensively in mammalian cells. Although individual members in murine cells provide some clues that are associated with the regulation of adipogenesis, the specific role of this family in adipocyte differentiation has rarely been assessed, especially in human adipocytes.Herein, we first explored the expression profiles of SFKs during human preadipocyte differentiation. Then, we used the pyrazolo-pyrimidinyl-amine compound PP1, a potent SFK inhibitor, to evaluate the function of SFKs during adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, we adopted a loss-of-function strategy with siRNAs to determine the role of FGR in adipocyte differentiation.Here, we found that SRC, FYN, YES1, LYN and FGR were expressed in human preadipocytes and induced after the initiation of differentiation. Furthermore, the SFK inhibitor PP1 suppressed adipocyte differentiation. We also found that PP1 significantly suppressed the SFK activity in preadipocytes and decreased the expression of adipogenic genes in early and late differentiation. Given that FGR exhibited the most expression enhancement in mature adipocytes, we focused on FGR and found that its knockdown reduced lipid accumulation and adipogenic gene expression.Collectively, these findings suggest that SFKs, especially FGR, are involved in the differentiation of human preadipocytes. Our results lay a foundation for further understanding the role of SFKs in adipocyte differentiation and provide new clues for anti-obesity therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aendocrinology 3agenes 3ahumans 3alipids 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amice 3aobesity 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3atyrosine 3awhite adipose tissue 0aObesity 0aAdipocyte differentiation 0aSFKs 0aPP1 0aFGR1 aZhang, Xiaojiao,1 aShan, Chunjian1 aXia, Jiaai1 aZhang, Zhenxing1 aShi, Hui1 aLeng, Kai1 aWu, Yangyang1 aJi, Chenbo1 aZhong, Tianying0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 533 p.111323-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2021.1113233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01680naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245008300164300001600247520057000263592002800833650001400861650002400875650001600899650001900915700002200934700002100956700002100977700002500998700002201023700001701045700006001062773011501122856008401237852000901321655001201330IND60769016220221121234610.0220301e20220210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076901622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.1c008052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sonya10aNatural and Synthetic Suppressor Mutations Defy Stability–Activity Tradeoffs  ap. 398-407.  aThermodynamic stability represents one important constraint on protein evolution, but the molecular basis for how mutations that change stability impact fitness remains unclear.

Various smart contrast agents have been developed for the visualization of biological phenomena. These contrast agents have molecular switches that increase or reduce MRI signal intensity in response to the target biological reaction. Therefore, novel approaches to the design of molecular switches for versatile in vivo studies using MRI are eagerly anticipated. Here, we report one such approach for the development of molecular switches based on morphological changes of pH-responsive polymers. We designed and synthesized three types of contrast agents based on a linear homopolymer or spherical copolymers with two different cross-linking degrees. The relaxivity measurements showed that these agents have molecular switches that respond to pH changes, and fluorescence studies indicated that these switches are based on the alteration of the molecular tumbling caused by pH-responsive morphological changes. As a result, the spherical polymers possess promising characteristics for the development of switchable MRI contrast agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological properties and phenomena 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3afluorescence 3ain vivo studies 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3apH 2aContrast Mediaxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aCoordination Complexesxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aGadoliniumxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMagnetic Resonance Imaging 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence1 aMizukami, Shin1 aKikuchi, Kazuya0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 20, no. 2 p.769-774dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.12.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011500165300001600280520111500296592002801411650000801439650002101447650002601468650002901494650001801523650001501541650002101556650003101577650001701608650002001625653002801645653001601673653000901689653002701698653002201725700001201747700001901759700001801778700001801796700001901814700001201833700001501845700001801860700001501878773012501893856008302018852000902101655001202110IND60713008520221120233502.0211227e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071300852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Baohong10aInsight into the effect of particle size distribution differences on the antibacterial activity of carbon dots  ap. 505-519.  aCarbon dots (CDs) have a profound effect on elimination of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, but the lack of an exact mechanism to interact with bacterial cells limits their development. Herein, we separated the CDs derived from chlorhexidine gluconate into three groups with uniformly small-scale, middle-scale, and large-scale particle sizes by using different molecular weight cut-off membranes. These positively charged particles exhibit significant antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus; they can cause an increase in bacterial cell permeability, synergistic destabilization, and broken integrity of the plasma membrane. Impressively, we found that antibacterial activity increases as the size of the CDs decreases. This phenomenon may stem from the differences in cellular uptake and distribution of CDs in the plasma membrane or restriction between the polar functional group and DNA molecule. Our study of the size effect as a target may improve the understanding of killing microorganisms by antibacterial CD drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3achlorhexidine 3agluconates 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size distribution 3apermeability 3aplasma membrane 0aChlorhexidine gluconate 0aCarbon dots 0aSize 0aAntibacterial activity 0aPhotoluminescence1 aWu, Fan1 aZhang, Qicheng1 aChu, Xiaohong1 aWang, Zhixuan1 aHuang, Xinrong1 aLi, Jie1 aYao, Cheng1 aZhou, Ninglin1 aShen, Jian0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 584 p.505-519dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012500168500001900293520112400312592002801436650001201464650001901476650001401495650001301509650001301522650001901535650001901554650001601573650002501589650000901614650001501623653002201638653002601660653002601686653001801712653002101730700001401751700001901765700001601784700001701800700005901817773010901876856008601985852000902071655001202080IND60740445120221119084647.0210619e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074044512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin-Yu10aVan der Waals enhanced interfacial interaction in cellulose/zinc oxide nanocomposite coupled by graphitic carbon nitride  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn-depth understanding of interfacial property is the key to guiding the synthesis of biomass composites with desired performance. However, the exploration is of great challenge due to limitations of experimental techniques in locating hydrogen, requiring large/good crystals and detecting a weak interaction like van der Waals (vdW). Herein, we experimentally and computationally investigated the composite cellulose/zinc oxide/g-C₃N₄. Hydrothermal synthesis afforded cellulose/ZnO, and then fabricated the ternary composite by adding g-C₃N₄ under ultrasonic condition. Three components are found to co-exist in the composite, and the ZnO nanoparticle is attaching to cellulose and coupling with g-C₃N₄. These experimental findings were corroborated by relativistic DFT calculations. The interfacial coupling is elaborated as contributions of dative bonds, hydrogen bonds and vdW interaction. The vdW is increased by a factor of 4.23 in the ZnO/g-C₃N₄ interface. This improves electron-hole separation and offers prospective application of the composite in photocatalysis, antibacteria and gas sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon nitride 3acellulose 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ananocomposites 3aphotocatalysis 3aultrasonics 3avan der Waals forces 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aBiomass cellulose 0ag-C3N4-based material 0aInterfacial structure 0avan der Waals 0aDFT calculations1 aWang, Yan1 aZhao, Nian-Dan1 aZheng, Ming1 aGuo, Yuan-Ru1 aPan, Qing-Jiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2763-69760 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 268 p.118235-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245006400214520148300278592002801761650001101789650002001800650002001820650001901840650001001859650001501869650001601884650001201900651001401912653001501926653001501941653002801956653001801984653001902002653001402021700002202035773009902057856008602156852000902242655001202251IND60737724720221117175426.0210727e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073772472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerleberg, Donna J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3521-493312aA century of change in Minnesota’s lake plant communities  aAquatic plant communities are good indicators of lake conditions, and persistent changes to those communities are indicative of environmental change. Our study used historical and recent lake plant surveys to detect changes in Minnesota’s lake plant communities over the last century. We did not find taxa richness estimates useful for change detection and suggest that recent richness values were higher than historical due to increased search effort rather than real change. The primary signal of change was the failure to relocate taxa in lakes where they were historically common. In 55 % of the lakes, surveyors did not relocate at least one taxon that was reported in an historic survey. We found that emergent plant taxa were most likely to have been lost; for lakes where emergents were reported historically, 45% had at least one emergent taxon that was not redetected compared to 30% of lakes where at least one floating-leaf taxon was not redetected and 42% of lakes where at least one submerged taxon was not redetected. Lakes in the southwestern and central ecoregions of the state were most likely to have gross and persistent aquatic plant losses. Eutrophication was the most likely reason for losses, with substantial declines in the probability of presence of many taxa with greater increases in lake phosphorus concentrations. We identified limitations with these datasets and recommend survey method changes to improve future collection of lake plant lists.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotany 3adata collection 3aemergent plants 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3aphosphorus 3aprobability 3asurveys 3aMinnesota 0aMacrophyte 0aLake plant 0aHistorical plant survey 0aTaxa richness 0aEutrophication 0aMinnesota1 aRadomski, Paul J.0 tAquatic botany.g2021 July, v. 173 p.103401-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245014100174520187400315592002802189650002302217650005302240650001302293650001602306650001802322650004102340650001902381650001702400650001602417650002402433650000902457653003302466653001702499653001702516653002602533653004002559700001602599700001602615700001902631700001202650700001802662773009102680856009002771852000902861655001202870IND60746553420221121062152.0211114e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074655342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1317912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xiaobing10aUrinary acrolein metabolites, systemic inflammation, and blood lipids: Results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  aExposure to acrolein was reported to be related with adverse health effects. However, the associations between acrolein exposure and blood lipids remain largely unknown. We assessed the associations of urinary acrolein metabolites with blood lipids using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and further investigated the existence of mediation by systemic inflammation in the associations. Urinary acrolein metabolites, N-acetyl-S-(carboxyethyl)-l-cysteine (CEMA) and N-acetyl-S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-l-cysteine (3-HPMA), blood lipids, and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in the NHANES. The associations of urinary acrolein metabolites with blood lipids and dyslipidemia and hs-CRP were estimated by multiple linear and logistic regression models. Mediation analysis was conducted to evaluate the mediating effects of hs-CRP on the associations between urinary acrolein metabolites and blood lipids. We found urinary CEMA+3-HPMA (∑acrolein) was significantly associated with higher levels of serum triglycerides (TG), hs-CRP, and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Each 1-unit increment in ln-transformed level of ∑acrolein was associated with a 0.06 mmol/L increment in TG and 0.02 mmol/L decrement in HDL-C (all P <0.05). A positive dose-response relationship was observed between urinary ∑acrolein and dyslipidemia risk. In addition, hs-CRP significantly mediated the associations of urinary ∑acrolein with serum TG and HDL-C, with mediated proportions of 22.12% and 41.41%, respectively. In conclusion, acrolein exposure is associated with the levels of serum TG, HDL-C, and hs-CRP. Hs-CRP may mediate acrolein-associated alterations of blood lipids. Our results indicated that decreased exposure to acrolein may reduce systemic inflammation and dyslipidemia risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aacrolein 3ablood serum 3adose response 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ametabolites 3aregression analysis 3arisk 0aUrinary acrolein metabolites 0aBlood lipids 0aDyslipidemia 0aSystemic inflammation 0aHigh sensitivity C-reactive protein1 aLiang, Ruyi1 aTu, Taoran,1 aWang, Dongming1 aXu, Tao1 aChen, Weihong0 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 286 p.131791-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1317913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04164naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245014300160300001600303506002800319506005900347520209800406592002802504596005202532596008302584506003702667650001102704650001302715650001002728650001902738650001602757650001302773650001502786650002202801650001602823650001102839650001002850650002202860650001402882650000902896650002002905650002002925650001802945650001802963650002202981650001803003650001103021650001003032650001103042651001403053653001203067653001703079653001703096700001903113700001703132700002303149700001303172700001503185700001603200773015203216856007903368903002203447852000903469655001203478IND60619077020221207115036.0210105e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061907702DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-145822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeins, B.J.10aEffects of winter housing systems on production, economics, body weight, body condition score, and bedding cultures for organic dairy cows  ap. 706-714.  aResource is Open Access  aAmerican Dairy Science Association License Information  aCertified-organic dairy cows (n = 268) were used to evaluate the effect of 2 winter (December to April) housing systems on milk production, somatic cell score (SCS), body weight, body condition score (BCS), and economics across 3 winter seasons (2013, 2014, and 2015). Bedding cultures from the housing systems were also evaluated. Cows were randomly assigned to 2 treatments (2 replicates per group): (1) outdoor (straw pack, n = 140) or (2) indoor (3-sided compost bedded pack barn, n = 128). Cows calved during 2 seasons (spring or fall) at the University of Minnesota West Central Research and Outreach Center, Morris, Minnesota, organic dairy. Milk, fat, and protein production and SCS were recorded from monthly milk recording. Body weight and BCS were recorded biweekly as cows exited the milking parlor. Bedding cultures from the housing systems were collected biweekly. Costs for key inputs and the price received for milk production were recorded for the study period and averaged for use in the profitability analysis. Energy-corrected milk and SCS were not different for the outdoor (15.1 kg/d, 2.64) and indoor (15.7 kg/d, 2.57) housing systems, respectively. In addition, cows in the outdoor and indoor housing systems were not different for body weight (528 vs. 534 kg) and BCS (3.22 vs. 3.23), respectively. Daily dry matter intake was 19.1 kg/d for the outdoor cows and 19.6 kg/d for indoor cows. The total bacteria count from bedding samples tended to be lower in the outdoor (13.0 log₁₀ cfu/mL) compared with the indoor (14.9 log₁₀ cfu/mL) system. Milk revenue and feed cost were not different for the 2 housing systems. Labor and bedding costs were lower and net return was higher for the outdoor housing system. The outdoor straw pack system had a $1.42/cow per day net return advantage over the indoor compost bedded pack barn. In summary, lactating cows housed outdoors on straw-bedded packs did not differ for production or SCS, or for body weight, BCS, or dry matter intake, but had greater profitability than cows housed in an indoor compost bedded pack barn.  aPublisher supplied data  cCeres Trustdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011329  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautumn 3abacteria 3abarns 3abody condition 3abody weight 3acomposts 3adairy cows 3adry matter intake 3afeed prices 3aincome 3alabor 3alactating females 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk production 3amilking parlors 3aorganic foods 3aprofitability 3aprotein synthesis 3asomatic cells 3aspring 3astraw 3awinter 3aMinnesota 0aorganic 0aoutwintering 0acompost barn1 aSjostrom, L.S.1 aEndres, M.I.1 aCarillo, M.

However, there are concerns that these AgNMs can be released during/after use and enter wastewater streams, potentially impacting aquatic systems or accumulating in wastewater biosolids. Biosolids, which are a residual of wastewater treatment processes, have been found to contain AgNMs and are frequently used as agricultural fertilizer. Since the function of soil microbial communities is imperative to nutrient cycling and agricultural productivity, it is important to characterize and assess the effects that silver nanomaterials could have in agricultural soils. In this study agricultural soil was amended with pristine engineered (PVP-coated or uncoated AgNMs), aged silver (sulphidized or released from textiles) nanomaterials, and ionic silver to determine the fate and toxicity over the course of three months. Exposures were carried out at various environmentally relevant concentrations (1 and 10 mg Ag/kg soil) representing between 30 to over 800 years of equivalent biosolid loadings. Over thirteen different methodologies and measures were used throughout this study to assess for potential effects of the silver nanomaterials on soil, including microbial community composition, average well colour development (AWCD) and enzymatic activity. Overall, the AgNM exposures did not exhibit significant toxic effects to the soil microbial communities in terms of density, activity, function and diversity. However, the positive ionic silver treatment (100 mg Ag/kg soil) resulted in suppression to microbial activity while also resulting in significantly higher populations of Frankia alni (nitrogen-fixer) and Arenimonas malthae (phytopathogen) as compared to the negative control (p < 0.05, Tukey HSD) which warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankia alni 3aagricultural productivity 3aagricultural soils 3abiosolids 3acolor 3acommunity structure 3aenvironment 3aenzyme activity 3afertilizers 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3ananosilver 3aplant pathogens 3asilver 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aNanoparticles 0aToxicity 0aMicrobial community 0aAgricultural soil 0aFrankia alni1 aGagnon, Vincent1 aButton, Mark1 aFarooq, Anbareen J.1 aPatch, David J.1 aWallace, Sarah J.1 aKoch, Iris1 aO'Carroll, Denis M.1 aWeber, Kela P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.151248-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245016700174520172100341592002802062650003002090650001602120650001402136650001402150650001502164650001102179650001002190650002402200650001602224650001702240650001502257650001202272650001602284650002202300650001502322653001602337653001602353653003602369653002502405653002102430700002602451700002302477700002002500700001802520700002302538700002002561700002002581700001702601773009102618856009002709852000902799655001202808IND60746553520221121082316.0211114e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074655352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1317932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumas, Thibaut13aAn integrated metabolomics and proteogenomics approach reveals molecular alterations following carbamazepine exposure in the male mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis  aCarbamazepine is one of the most abundant pharmaceutical active compounds detected in aquatic systems. Based on laboratory exposures, carbamazepine has been proven to adversely affect aquatic organisms. However, the underlying molecular events remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms potentially associated with toxicological effects of carbamazepine on the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed for 3 days at realistic concentrations encountered in coastal environments (80 ng/L and 8 μg/L). An integrated metabolomics and proteogenomics approach, including data fusion strategy, was applied to gain more insight in molecular events and cellular processes triggered by carbamazepine exposure. Consistent metabolic and protein signatures revealed a metabolic rewiring and cellular stress at both concentrations (e.g. intensification of protein synthesis, transport and catabolism processes, disruption of lipid and amino acid metabolisms). These highlighted molecular signatures point to the induction of autophagy, closely related with carbamazepine mechanism of action, as well as a destabilization of the lysosomal membranes and an enzymatic overactivity of the peroxisomes. Induction of programmed cell death was highlighted by the modulation of apoptotic cognate proteins. The proposed integrative omics data analysis was shown to be highly relevant to identify the modulations of the two molecular levels, i.e. metabolites and proteins. Multi-omics approach is able to explain the resulting complex biological system, and document stronger toxicological pieces of evidence on pharmaceutical active compounds at environmental concentrations in sentinel organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aamino acids 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acatabolism 3alipids 3amales 3amechanism of action 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amultiomics 3amussels 3aperoxisomes 3aprotein synthesis 3atoxicology 0aMulti-omics 0aData fusion 0aPharmaceutical active compounds 0aMediterranean mussel 0aMarine organisms1 aCourant, Frédérique1 aAlmunia, Christine1 aBoccard, Julien1 aRosain, David1 aDuporté, Geoffroy1 aArmengaud, Jean1 aFenet, Hélène1 aGomez, Elena0 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 286 p.131793-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1317933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245007700199300001800276520152700294592002801821650001701849650002101866650001501887650001701902650001101919650001601930650001201946650001401958650001501972653002401987653001402011653002002025653002502045653001702070653003102087700005402118700005402172700005702226700005602283700005502339700001802394773013902412856008002551852000902631655001202640IND60769016520221120141453.0220301e20220207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076901652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.1c039362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yumeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0390-285410aLooping Mercury Cycle in Global Environmental–Economic System Modeling  ap. 2861-2879.  aThe Minamata Convention on Mercury calls for Hg control actions to protect the environment and human beings from the adverse impacts of Hg pollution. It aims at the entire life cycle of Hg. Existing studies on the Hg cycle in the global environmental–economic system have characterized the emission-to-impact pathway of Hg pollution. That is, Hg emissions/releases from the economic system can have adverse impacts on human health and ecosystems. However, current modeling of the Hg cycle is not fully looped. It ignores the feedback of Hg-related environmental impacts (including human health impacts and ecosystem impacts) to the economic system. This would impede the development of more comprehensive Hg control actions. By synthesizing recent information on Hg cycle modeling, this critical review found that Hg-related environmental impacts would have feedbacks to the economic system via the labor force and biodiversity loss. However, the interactions between Hg-related activities in the environmental and economic systems are not completely clear. The cascading effects of Hg-related environmental impacts to the economic system throughout global supply chains have not been revealed. Here, we emphasize the knowledge gaps and propose possible approaches for looping the Hg cycle in global environmental–economic system modeling. This progress is crucial for formulating more dynamic and flexible Hg control measures. It provides new perspectives for the implementation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aeconomic systems 3aecosystems 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alabor force 3amercury 3apollution 3atechnology 0aMinamata Convention 0aecosystem 0aeconomic system 0abiogeochemical cycle 0asupply chain 0ageneral equilibrium theory1 aChen, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9574-73071 aLiang, Sai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6306-58001 aZhou, Haifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7911-35661 aLiu, Yu-Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1112-42551 aZhong, Huan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5100-94651 aYang, Zhifeng0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 Feb. 07, v. 56, no. 5 p.2861-2879dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c039363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012600180500001900306520105100325592002801376650001901404650001401423650001101437650002001448650002201468650001601490653001901506653001801525653001901543700002701562700003601589700002801625700003201653773010801685856008601793852000901879655001201888IND60740445420221119084546.0210812e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074044542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarangoni Júnior, Luís10aEffect of low concentrations of SiO2 nanoparticles on the physical and chemical properties of sodium alginate-based films  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work investigated the effect of adding low concentrations of nano-SiO₂ (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5%) in the properties of films based on sodium alginate, to identify lower thresholds in the proportion of the reinforcing agent. It was found that, even in the smallest proportion, thermal stability of the nanocomposites improved significantly (with degradation onset increased by almost 15% compared with the control film). The surface morphology showed pronounced roughness at nano-SiO₂ concentrations greater than 1.0%, indicating agglomeration of part of the nanomaterial. Mechanical properties were reduced for the samples with concentrations equal to 1.0 and 1.5%, however, without significant differences between them. Conversely, water vapor and light barrier properties have not undergone significant changes in any formulation. Therefore, the use of 0.5% nano-SiO₂ in alginate films would be an easy and economically interesting way to improve thermal stability, without significantly reducing mechanical properties of the pure material.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananocomposites 3aroughness 3asodium 3asodium alginate 3athermal stability 3awater vapor 0aBio-based film 0aNanocomposite 0aFood packaging1 ada Silva, Renan Garcia1 aAnjos, Carlos Alberto Rodrigues1 aVieira, Roniérik Pioli1 aAlves, Rosa Maria Vercelino0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 269 p.118286-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245015200209300001800361520110400379592002801483650002101511650002101532650001501553650001301568650001901581650001301600650001301613650001101626650000901637650001601646653002201662653002501684653003801709653002401747653000701771653000701778653000801785653000601793653000701799653000601806653001001812653001101822653000701833700002001840773009201860856008501952852000902037655001202046IND60779683920221118120257.0220628e20220830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077968392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2022.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshii, Takafumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8176-369910aEstimation of the spatial distribution of carbon edge sites in a carbon structure using H2 desorption kinetics in temperature programmed desorption  ap. 1054-1062.  aThis study aims to elucidate the role of hydrogen desorption profiles obtained through temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analysis of carbon materials for revealing their carbon edge sites. Accordingly, the H₂ desorption profiles of several carbon materials, such as activated carbon, carbon black, reduced graphene oxide (rGO), phenol resin carbon, graphite, high-temperature treated carbon, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), were investigated. The kinetic analysis of the profiles revealed that H₂ desorption is a second-order reaction initiated by the association of edge hydrogen. Furthermore, the relationship between the total number of edge hydrogens in a sample and the peak temperature of H₂ desorption represents the spatial distribution of edge hydrogens in the carbon structure. Additionally, most of the activated carbons, carbon blacks, and rGOs exhibited a uniform distribution of edge hydrogen throughout their carbon structures. In contrast, the edge hydrogen in graphite, high-temperature treated carbon, and CNTs were heterogeneously distributed throughout their structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3adesorption 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen 3akinetics 3aphenol 3asoot 3atemperature 0aCarbon edge sites 0aSpatial distribution 0aTemperature programmed desorption 0aDesorption kinetics 0aν 0aβ 0aαH 0an 0aEd 0aR 0aAH(T) 0aDH2(T) 0aTP1 aOzaki, Jun-ichi0 tCarbon.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 196 p.1054-1062dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245011100183300001600294520104600310592002801356650000801384650002201392650001201414650003001426650002601456650001401482650001401496650001501510650001001525650001701535650001101552650003201563650004401595650007201639650002801711650006601739650006801805650006501873650002601938650002101964650003201985650002202017650001602039650003702055650005002092650001102142650003002153650005902183700002002242700002202262700001302284700002002297700001802317700002802335700002402363700001702387773010702404856008102511990002302592852000902615655001202624IND60090684620221120202240.0141102e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009068462DNAL7 a222097332pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamal, Ahmed10aDesign and synthesis of benzo[c,d]indolone-pyrrolobenzodiazepine conjugates as potential anticancer agents  ap. 789-800.  aA series of benzo[c,d]indol-2(1H)one-PBD conjugates (11a–l) have been designed and synthesized as potential anticancer agents. These compounds were prepared by linking the C8-position of DC-81 with a benzo[c,d]indol-2(1H)one moiety through different alkane spacers in good yields and confirmed by ¹H NMR, mass and HRMS data. The DNA binding ability of these conjugates was evaluated by thermal denaturation studies and interestingly, compound 11l showed enhanced DNA binding ability. These compounds were also evaluated for their anticancer activity in selected human cancer cell lines of lung, skin, colon and prostate by using MTT assay method. These new conjugates showed promising anticancer activity with IC₅₀ values ranging from 1.05 to 36.49μM. Moreover, cell cycle arrest in SubG1 phase was observed upon treatment of A549 cells with 1 and 2μM (IC₅₀) concentrations of compound 11l and it induced apoptosis. This is confirmed by Annexin V-FITC, Hoechst staining, caspase-3 activity as well as DNA fragmentation analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aalkanes 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle 3acolon 3adenaturation 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBenzodiazepinesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBenzodiazepinonesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBenzothiazolesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDNAxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aDrug Design 2aDrug Screening Assays, Antitumor 2aG1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpointsxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aNucleic Acid Denaturation 2aPyrrolesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology.1 aRamakrishna, G.1 aLakshma Nayak, V.1 aRaju, P.1 aSubba Rao, A.V.1 aViswanath, A.1 aVishnuvardhan, M.V.P.S.1 aRamakrishna, Sistla1 aSrinivas, G.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 20, no. 2 p.789-800dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013100168500001400299520154200313592002801855650001501883650001001898650003001908650001601938650001901954650001501973650001601988650001202004650001602016650001402032650002202046650001502068650001902083650001102102650002902113650001902142650000702161650002602168650001402194650001502208650001702223650002102240650001202261650001402273650001602287650001002303651001202313653001802325653002902343653001902372653001702391700005802408700006002466700002002526700002002546700002402566700001902590700001802609700006202627700001902689700006102708773012602769856008302895852000902978655001202987IND60696239820221118031247.0210121e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069623982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2020.1070062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiera, Cristina10aTillage intensity and herbicide application influence surface-active springtail (Collembola) communities in Romanian vineyards  aNAL-light  aVineyards are important perennial, often intensively managed agroecosystems. In most vineyards, ground vegetation is controlled by tillage and/or the application of broadband herbicides with scarcely known effects on the soil fauna. We studied a total of 16 commercial vineyards in the Târnave wine region, a typical viticultural region in Transylvania, Central Romania. As a model organism for surface-dwelling arthropods we examined the response of springtail (Collembola) species richness and activity density to vineyard tillage practices, fertilization, and herbicide application. A total of 24 species in 10 families were found in the studied vineyards. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) identified three distinct springtail communities linked to tillage and fertilization practice. Springtail species richness was positively associated with high tillage intensity (frequency: once or twice a year). Springtail activity density in inter-rows was positively correlated with inter-row tillage and herbicide application under grapevines. For the first time we could show that springtail species assemblages in vineyards were characterized by high niche overlap regarding soil quality (organic matter, pH, CaCO₃, P and K), indicating similar resource utilization. We conclude that the positive influence of vineyard management and disturbance on surface-dwelling springtail communities is possibly due to the exclusion of potential competitors and predators, the stimulation of microorganisms and/or an increased nutrient input.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollembola 3aVitis 3aadministrative management 3aagriculture 3aagroecosystems 3aarthropods 3acorrelation 3adensity 3aenvironment 3afrequency 3aground vegetation 3aherbicides 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3amultidimensional scaling 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apesticide application 3apredators 3asoil fauna 3asoil quality 3aspecies richness 3atillage 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3awines 3aRomania 0aFertilization 0aPerennial agroecosystems 0aSoil mesofauna 0aWeed control1 aUlrich, Werner1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8715-66191 aPopescu, Daniela1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5238-36971 aBuchholz, Jacob1 aQuerner, Pascal1 aBunea, Claudiu-Ioan1 aStrauss, Peter1 aBauer, Thomas1 aKratschmer, Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6538-694X1 aWinter, Silvia1 aZaller, Johann G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7744-73780 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 300 p.107006-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.1070063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04300naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245014800157300001600305520258100321592002802902650001902930650001102949650001902960650001602979650001402995650003503009650002903044650001503073650002403088650002003112650001803132650001703150650000903167650001703176650001203193650001403205650001603219650002903235653001803264653002203282653002003304653002903324653002003353700001403373700001403387700001603401700001503417700001703432700001503449700001803464773015203482856007903634852000903713655001203722IND60619077320221118015139.0210105e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061907732DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-146852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Y.10aAcylcarnitine profiles in serum and muscle of dairy cows receiving conjugated linoleic acids or a control fat supplement during early lactation  ap. 754-767.  aAcylcarnitines (ACC) are formed when fatty acid (FA)-coenzyme A enters the mitochondria for β-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle through the carnitine shuttle. Concentrations of ACC may vary depending on the metabolic conditions, but can accumulate when rates of β-oxidation exceed those of tricarboxylic acid. This study aimed to characterize muscle and blood serum acylcarnitine profiles, to determine the mRNA abundance of muscle carnitine acyltransferases, and to test whether dietary supplementation (from d 1 in milk) with conjugated linoleic acids (CLA; 100 g/d; each 12% of trans-10,cis-12 and cis-9,trans-11 CLA; n = 11) altered these compared with control fat-supplemented cows (CTR; n = 10). Blood samples and biopsies from the semitendinosus musclewere collected on d −21, 1, 21, and 70 relative to parturition. Serum and muscle ACC profiles were quantified using a targeted metabolomics approach. The CLA supplement did not affect the variables examined. The serum concentration of free carnitine decreased with the onset of lactation. The concentrations of acetylcarnitine, hydroxybutyrylcarnitine, and the sum of short-chain ACC in serum were greater from d −21 to 21 than thereafter. The serum concentrations of long-chain ACC tetradecenoylcarnitine (C14:1) and octadecenoylcarnitine (C18:1) concentrations were greater on d 1 and 21 compared with d −21. Muscle carnitine remained unchanged, whereas short- and medium-chain ACC, including propenoylcarnitine (C3:1), hydroxybutyrylcarnitine, hydroxyhexanoylcarnitine, hexenoylcarnitine (C6:1), and pimelylcarnitine were increased on d 21 compared with d −21 and decreased thereafter. In muscle, the concentrations of long-chain ACC (from C14 to C18) were elevated on d 1. The mRNA abundance of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, muscle isoform (CPT1B) increased 2.8-fold from d −21 to 1, followed by a decline to nearly prepartum values by d 70, whereas that of CPT2 did not change over time. The majority of serum and muscle short- and long-chain ACC were positively correlated with the FA concentrations in serum, whereas serum carnitine and C5 were negatively correlated with FA. Time-related changes in the serum and muscle ACC profiles were demonstrated that were not affected by the CLA supplement at the dosage used in the present study. The elevated concentrations of long-chain ACC species in muscle and of serum acetylcarnitine around parturition point to incomplete FA oxidation were likely due to insufficient metabolic adaptation in response to the load of FA around parturition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta oxidation 3abiopsy 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acarnitine 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adairy cows 3adietary supplements 3aearly lactation 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolomics 3amilk 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3aoxidation 3aparturition 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aacylcarnitine 0acarnitine shuttle 0askeletal muscle 0aconjugated linoleic acid 0aearly lactation1 aSadri, H.1 aPrehn, C.1 aAdamski, J.1 aRehage, J.1 aDänicke, S.1 aSaremi, B.1 aSauerwein, H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.754-767dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-146853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008800167300001600255520157300271592002801844650000801872650003501880650001201915650001401927650001601941650001101957650001801968650001401986650000902000650003002009650002702039650002002066650002502086650002002111650001802131700002002149700001902169700001902188700002202207700002202229700002002251773013502271856008102406852000902487655001202496IND60523838520221120175634.0161030e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052383852DNAL7 a10.1007/s12892-016-0096-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmallah, Lamiae10aValidation of simple sequence repeats associated with quality traits in durum wheat  ap. 137-150.  aOver recent years, quality has become an important commercial issue for durum wheat breeders. Modern breeding methods are most efficient for producing and supplying the best quality raw materials to the pasta industry. Here we assessed the effectiveness of molecular marker-assisted selection of quality traits in durum wheat. To this end, DNA and quality trait markers were jointly used to analyze quality-related traits in a durum wheat collection. A total of 132 durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) Mediterranean landraces, international lines, and Moroccan cultivars were analyzed for seven important qualityrelated traits including thousand-kernel weight (TKW), test weight (TW), gluten strength, yellow pigment (YP), and grain protein content (GPC). Additionally, 18 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers previously reported to be associated with different quality traits were analyzed. Of these, 14 (78%) were polymorphic and four were monomorphic. There were between two and seven alleles per locus, with an average of four alleles per locus. The average phenotypic variation value (R²) ranged from 2.81 to 20.43%. Association analysis identified nine markers significantly associated with TKW, TW, and YP, followed by eight markers associated with GPC, six markers associated with yellow index b, four markers associated with brightness L, and three markers associated with SDS-sedimentation volume. This study highlights the efficiency of SSR technology, which holds promise for a wide range of applications in marker-assisted wheat breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aalleles 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3agluten 3agrain protein 3alandraces 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anoodle industry 3aphenotypic variation 3aprotein content 3araw materials1 aTaghouti, Mouna1 aRhrib, Keltoum1 aGaboun, Fatima1 aArahou, Moustapha1 aHassikou, Rachida1 aDiria, Ghizlane0 tJournal of crop science and biotechnology.g2016 June, v. 19, no. 2 p.137-150dThe Korean Society of Crop Sciencex1975-94797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12892-016-0096-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005200153245017200205300001600377520170900393592002802102650001102130650001302141650001602154650001202170650001402182650000902196650001302205650001102218650001202229650001502241650003402256650001302290650002402303650001002327650001802337650000902355650001302364650001002377653001402387653000902401653001002410653001702420653001602437700001402453700001602467700001802483700001502501700001902516700001402535700005802549773011902607856008802726852000902814655001202823IND60598013220221116181248.0201125e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059801322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Bei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6380-012310aBehavior of N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid (N-EtFOSAA) in biosolids amended soil-plant microcosms of seven plant species: Accumulation and degradation  ap. 366-373.  aPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) precursors have been found extensively in sewage sludge and biosolids-amended soils. The degradation of these precursors are regarded as a significant source of PFOS in the environment. In this study, the accumulation of N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid (N-EtFOSAA) in the plants of seven species, namely alfalfa, lettuce, maize, mung bean, radish, ryegrass, and soybean from biosolids-amended soil, and the degradation kinetics of N-EtFOSAA in soil-plant microcosms were evaluated over 60 days. N-EtFOSAA was found in the roots of all plant species, while was not in stems and leaves. The root concentration factors of N-EtFOSAA ranged 0.52–1.37 (pmol/gᵣₒₒₜ)/(pmol/gₛₒᵢₗ). Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to elucidate the accumulation of N-EtFOSAA in the roots of plants. The results showed that the root protein and lipid contents explain 85.0% of the variation in root N-EtFOSAA levels (P < 0.05). Four degradation products, including N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (N-EtFOSA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetate (FOSAA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and PFOS were found in soils and plant roots, stems and leaves, indicating the degradation of N-EtFOSAA in soil-plant system. Degradation kinetics fitted a first-order kinetic model well. Degradation rate constants of N-EtFOSAA in the microcosms with plants ranged 0.063–0.165 d⁻¹, which was 1.40–3.6 times higher than those without plants. Degradation rate constant of maize was relatively higher than those of other plant species. The results is the first to reveal N-EtFOSAA accumulation in plants and degradation in soil-plant microcosms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium 3aacetates 3aacetic acid 3aalfalfa 3abiosolids 3acorn 3akinetics 3aleaves 3alettuce 3amung beans 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aradishes 3aregression analysis 3aroots 3asewage sludge 3asoil 3asoybeans 3astems 0aN-EtFOSAA 0aSoil 0aPlant 0aAccumulation 0aDegradation1 aPan, Ying1 aShi, Xiaoli1 aZhang, Hongna1 aHu, Xiaoyu1 aHuang, Honglin1 aLv, Jitao1 aZhang, Shuzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7058-70950 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 642 p.366-373dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010400166500001900270520116500289592002801454650001501482650001501497650002001512650001401532650001401546650001701560650001001577650001301587650001501600650002201615650001701637653002701654653002801681653001401709653002301723700001701746700001801763700001701781700001601798700001701814773010801831856008601939852000902025655001202034IND60740445720221119084525.0210812e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074044572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Liqin10aNew insights into the anti- hepatoma mechanism of triple-helix β- glucan by metabolomics profiling  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNatural polysaccharide as the third abundant biomacromolecule has attracted considerable attentions due to their superior anti-tumor activities. However, the anti-tumor mechanism of polysaccharides has not been completely understood. Herein, the anti-tumor effects of black fungus polysaccharide (BFP), a typical β-glucan was comprehensively investigated, and the anti-tumor mechanism was obtained from metabolomics profiling. The in vitro results demonstrate that BFP inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatoma carcinoma cells (HCC) through inducing the cell apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle at S phase without direct cytotoxicity. The hepatoma-bearing nude mice experiments further demonstrate that BFP could significantly inhibit the growth without system toxicity in vivo. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics unveils that BFP significantly disturbed the multiple metabolic pathways, leading to the inhibition of tumor cells proliferation by promoting DNA damage, attenuating DNA damage repair, and inhibiting DNA synthesis. This study provides new insights for pharmacological research and clinical practice of polysaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3aapoptosis 3acarcinoma 3acytotoxicity 3afungi 3ahepatoma 3ainterphase 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 0aMetabolomics profiling 0aAnti-hepatoma mechanism 0aβ-Glucan 0aMetabolic pathways1 aZhou, Shujun1 aWang, Yanfeng1 aXu, Xiaojuan1 aZhang, Lina1 aCai, Zongwei0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 269 p.118289-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005200153245011100205300001600316520150700332592002801839650001601867650001701883650002001900650001101920650001201931650001701943650002901960650002301989650001002012651001002022653001802032653001902050653001002069653001902079653001802098700001402116773011902130856008802249852000902337655001202346IND60598013320221116180725.0201125e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059801332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7045-230710aIncrement of ambient exposure to fine particles and the reduced human fertility rate in China, 2000–2010  ap. 497-504.  aEpidemiological and toxicological studies suggest that exposure to ambient fine particles (PM₂.₅) can reduce human reproductive capacity. We previously reported, based on spatial epidemiology, that higher levels of PM₂.₅ exposure were associated with a lower fertility rate (FR) in China. However, that study was limited by a lack of temporal variation. Using first-difference regression, we linked temporal changes in FR and PM₂.₅ with adjustment for ecological covariates across 2806 counties in China during 2000–2010. Next, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the variation in the PM₂.₅–FR association according to (1) geographic region, (2) indicators of the level of development, and (3) PM₂.₅ concentrations. Also, we quantified the reduction in the FR attributable to ambient PM₂.₅ in China for the first time. The FR decreased by 3.3% (1.2%, 5.3%) for each 10 μg/m³ increment in PM₂.₅. The association varied significantly among the geographic regions, but not with the level of development. Nonlinearity analysis suggested a linear exposure–response function with an effect threshold of ~8 μg/m³. We also found that comparing to the 2000 scenario, increment of PM₂.₅ in 2010 might result in a reduction of 2.50 (2.44, 2.60) infants per 1000 women aged 15–44 years per year in China. Our results confirm the statistical association between ambient particles and FR and suggest that poor air quality may contribute to childlessness in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aepidemiology 3ahuman fertility 3ahumans 3ainfants 3aparticulates 3areproductive performance 3atemporal variation 3awomen 3aChina 0aAir pollution 0aFine particles 0aPM2.5 0aFertility rate 0aChildlessness1 aZhu, Tong0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 642 p.497-504dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04330naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245013400156300001600290520237700306592002802683650001702711650002702728650001702755650002102772650001702793650001802810650002602828650001102854650002402865650000902889650001802898650000902916650001802925650001402943650001502957650001702972650001502989650001003004650002403014650001203038650001103050650002803061650000703089650001803096650002103114650001103135650001003146653001303156653002703169653003003196653001303226700001603239700001803255700001603273700002003289700001903309700001203328700001803340700001603358700001803374773015203392856007903544852000903623655001203632IND60619077520221118015236.0210105e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061907752DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-148072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, X.10aEffects of lipopolysaccharide dosing on bacterial community composition and fermentation in a dual-flow continuous culture system  ap. 334-350.  aThe objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) dosing on bacterial fermentation and bacterial community composition (BCC), to set up a subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) nutritional model in vitro, and to determine the best sampling time for LPS dosing in a dual-flow continuous culture system. Diets were randomly assigned to 6 fermentors in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square with three 11-d experimental periods that consisted of 7 d for diet adaptation and 4 d for sample collection. Treatments were control diet (CON), wheat and barley diet (WBD) to induce SARA, and control diet + LPS (LPSD). Fermenters were fed 72 g of dry matter/d. The forage:concentrate ratio of CON was 65:35. The WBD diet was achieved by replacing 40% of dry matter of the CON diet with 50% ground wheat and 50% ground barley. The LPS concentration in LPSD was 200,000 endotoxin units, which was similar to that observed in cows with SARA. The SARA inducing and LPS dosing started at d 8. The BCC was determined by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The LPSD and CON maintained pH above 6 for the entire experimental period, and the WBD kept pH between 5.2 and 5.6 for 4 h/d, successfully inducing SARA. Digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and crude protein in LPSD were not different from WBD but tended to be lower than CON. Lipopolysaccharide dosing had no effect on pool of VFA concentrations and profiles but decreased bacterial N; the pattern changes of VFA and LPS in LPSD started to increase and be similar to WBD 6 h after LPS dosing. Pool of LPS concentration was around 11-fold higher in WBD and 4-fold higher in LPSD than CON. In the solid fraction, the BCC of LPSD was different from WBD and tended to be different from CON. In the liquid fraction, the BCC was different among treatments. The LPS dosing increased the relative abundance of Succinimonas, Anaeroplasma, Succinivibrio, Succiniclasticum, and Ruminobacter, which are main gram-negative bacteria related to starch digestion. Our results suggest that LPS dosing does not affect pH alone. However, LPS could drive the development of SARA by affecting bacteria and bacterial fermentation. For future studies, samples are suggested to be taken 6 h after LPS dosing in a dual-flow continuous culture system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaeroplasma 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aRuminobacter 3aSucciniclasticum 3aSuccinimonas 3aSuccinivibrio 3abacterial communities 3abarley 3acommunity structure 3acows 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aendotoxins 3afermentation 3afermenters 3agenes 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliquids 3amodels 3aneutral detergent fiber 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3aruminal acidosis 3astarch 3awheat 0ain vitro 0agram-negative bacteria 0astarch digesting bacteria 0a16S rRNA1 aPaula, E.M.1 aLelis, A.L.J.1 aSilva, L.G.1 aBrandao, V.L.N.1 aMonteiro, H.F.1 aFan, P.1 aPoulson, S.R.1 aJeong, K.C.1 aFaciola, A.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.334-350dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-148073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007900155300002000234520090200254592002801156650002301184650001601207650002101223650002101244650002101265650001801286650001501304650001001319650003401329650002201363650002101385650001401406650002101420650003001441650001901471650001701490700002101507700001601528700001701544700001401561700002101575700001401596700001501610773012301625856007401748852000901822655001201831IND60667537720221121031509.0190919e20150519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066753772DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05484b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurcio, M.10aOn demand delivery of ionic drugs from electro-responsive CNT hybrid films  ap. 44902-44911.  aElectro-responsive hybrid hydrogel films were prepared by UV-induced polymerization of Acrylamide and N,N′-ethylene bisacrylamide to be applied for the on/off delivery of therapeutics.

Herein, we report an eco-friendly strategy to construct lightweight and porous sodium alginate/carboxymethyl cellulose/chitosan polysaccharide-based composite aerogels (SCC-B) by freeze-drying and post-cross-linking technology. The ester cross-linking of polysaccharide component achieved strong web-like entangled structure when using 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid and sodium hypophosphite as eco-friendly co-additives, meanwhile significantly improved flame retardancy of SCC-B due to phosphorylation. The thermal kinetic behavior of SCC-B was investigated by Flynn-Wall-Ozawa and Kissinger models. Results indicated that peak heat release rate and total heat release of SCC-B decreased from 30 W/g to 20 W/g and 15 kJ/g to 10 kJ/g, respectively. Furthermore, the second-degree burn time of SCC-B reached up to 87.1 s under heat exposure of 11.3 kW/m². These characteristics combine to suggest hopeful prospects for use of SCC-B in the fields of fire-protection clothing as a renewable flame-retardant material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3acryogels 3aflammability 3afreeze drying 3aheat 3ainsulating materials 3aphosphorylation 3asodium 3asodium alginate 0aBio-based aerogel 0aCross-linking 0aFlame retardancy 0aThermal insulation 0aFlexibility1 aWang, Yushu1 aYu, Zhicai1 aLiu, Jinru1 aZhao, Yuhang1 aKe, Yushi0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 269 p.118291-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003100137245016400168300001600332520135000348592002801698650001501726650001401741650001301755650002301768650002501791650001501816650001101831650001501842650001801857650001401875650001401889650002501903650001401928653002001942653001701962653001401979653001401993653002902007653002402036653001902060700003102079700002202110700002402132773011702156856007102273852000902344655001202353IND60741732620221119064544.0210618s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074173262DNAL7 a10.1071/BT210112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Aline Mystica S.10aReproductive success, herbivory and ex situ conservation of Neoregelia ibitipocensis (Bromeliaceae): an endemic and endangered species from the Atlantic Forest  ap. 237-246.  aHerbivory in plant reproductive tissues can severely reduce the fitness of the species, especially for those threatened with extinction. We investigated aspects of the reproductive ecology of Neoregelia ibitipocensis (Leme) Leme, an endangered species restricted to a few cloud forests sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Data on breeding systems, fertility, and viability of its populations are provided, as well as alternatives for development of strategies for ex situ conservation. Hand pollination experiments revealed that N. ibitipocensis is partially self-incompatible. Fruit and seeds were affected by intense herbivory caused by Tipulidae (Diptera) larvae. The predation reached 100% of the analysed infructescences during the first year of the study. We observed the production of parthenocarpic fruit both through controlled pollination experiments and under natural conditions. The potential for self-pollination and autogamy probably compensate for the reduced ability of the species to attract pollinators due to its small floral display. In the same way, parthenocarpy seems to represent a strategy to enhance the fitness of N. ibitipocensis, mitigating the effects of the predation. We developed an efficient protocol of in vitro multiplication, which represents a viable alternative for ex situ conservation of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeoregelia 3aTipulidae 3aautogamy 3aendangered species 3aex situ conservation 3aextinction 3afruits 3aherbivores 3aparthenocarpy 3apredation 3aprotocols 3areproductive success 3aviability 0aAtlantic Forest 0aBromeliaceae 0abromeliad 0aherbivory 0aNeoregelia ibitipocensis 0anidularioid complex 0atissue culture1 aPeixoto, Paulo Henrique P.1 aBarbosa, Bruno C.1 aFaria, Ana Paula G.0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2021, v. 69, no. 4 p.237-246dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl44712x0067-19247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT210113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006400167520121300231592002801444650002001472650002001492650002301512650001101535650001101546650003301557650001201590653002101602653002401623653001901647653002501666653001701691700001901708700005701727773012101784856008301905852000901988655001201997IND60696240320221120211314.0200621e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069624032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2020.1070052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoqing10aJoint analysis of semicontinuous data with latent variables  aA two-part latent variable model is proposed to analyze semicontinuous data in the presence of latent variables. The proposed model comprises two major components. The first component is a structural equation model (SEM), which characterizes latent variables using corresponding multiple attributes and examines the interrelationships among them. The second component is a two-part model to assess a semicontinuous response of interest. The semicontinuous variable is characterized by a mixture of zero values and continuously distributed positive values. The two-part model manages this semicontinuous variable by splitting it into two random variables; one is a binary indicator to determine whether the response is zero, another is a continuous variable to determine the actual level of the positive response. A full Bayesian approach coupled with spike-and-slab lasso prior is developed for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by a simulation study and applied to the analysis of the Chinese General Social Survey dataset.

Although a wealth of literature exists on wetland functions, the seasonal behaviour of the papyrus mat and function in water storage has received less attention. The objective of this study was to assess the response of the papyrus root mat to changing water levels in a tropical wetland system in Eastern Uganda. We delineated seven transects through a section of a wetland system and mapped wetland bathymetry along these transects. We used three transects to measure spatial and temporal changes in mat thickness and free water column, and to monitor variations in total depth during two seasons. The free water column increased across all transects in the wet season. However, changes in the mat thickness varied spatially and were influenced by the rate of increase of the free water column as well as wetland bathymetry. The proportion of mat compression was higher at the shallow end of the wetland (83%) compared to the deep end (67%). There was a significant negative correlation between changes in free water column and papyrus mat thickness (r = −0.85, p = 000). Therefore, the mat compresses in response to increase in free water column, which increases the ratio of the free water column to root mat thickness. Hence, the wetland accommodates excess water during rainy seasons. Water depth varied from 1.5 m to 2.1 m during the monitoring period, corresponding to a water storage of 61,597 m³ and 123,355 m³ respectively. This means a 50% change in water volume for the studied wetland section. This water regulatory function mitigates severity of floods downstream, but the stored water is also useful to the surrounding communities for wetland-edge farm irrigation during dry seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyperus 3adry season 3afloods 3amonitoring 3atemporal variation 3awater storage 3awet season 3awetlands 3aUganda 0aPapyrus wetland 0aPapyrus mat 0aWater storage 0aTropical wetland1 aKansiime, Frank1 aFrench, Helen K.1 aBamutaze, Yazidhi0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 642 p.925-936dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007300164300002000237520128100257592002801538650001201566650001601578650000901594650001201603650001801615650001601633650001301649650003201662700002201694773012301716856007401839852000901913655001201922IND60667538220221121021219.0190919e20150522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066753822DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05492c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirtschin, Nikolaus10aDesigning temperature-memory effects in semicrystalline polyurethane  ap. 46307-46315.  aTemperature-memory polymers are able to generate a substantial mechanical response when heated above the temperature, at which a preceding deformation was carried out. Here we show how to design the temperature-memory effect (TME) by thermomechanical treatment. As a model polymer, phase segregated poly(ester urethane) (PEU) containing crystallizable segments of poly(1,4-butylene adipate) (PBA) was used. For programming, strain elongation was applied at temperatures within the PBA melting transition area, before temperature holding, unloading and cooling were carried out. Upon heating under stress-free or constant strain recovery conditions, precisely set temperature-memory onsets could be witnessed. Most importantly, strain fixities and recoverabilities the same as maximum recovery stresses turned out to be controllable by strain rate and temperature holding time after deformation, while transition temperatures remained largely unaffected. The tailoring of thermoresponsiveness was structurally enabled by different PBA crystallinities in the programmed state as verified by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The reported studies intend to design TMEs in semicrystalline polyurethanes according to user-defined needs to make this technology broadly applicable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3adeformation 3aheat 3amelting 3apolyurethanes 3atemperature 3aurethane 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aPretsch, Thorsten0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 22, v. 5, no. 57 p.46307-46315dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05492c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245008100188300001600269520114900285592002801434650001701462650002501479650002701504650002601531650001701557650001401574650002001588650001201608650001601620650001001636650001101646650000901657650002101666650001401687650002401701650002401725650005501749650004601804650004101850650004101891650004701932650004701979650004102026650001302067650003302080650002102113650003202134700002402166700002102190700002102211700002502232773010702257856008102364990002302445852000902468655001202477IND60090685320221120202319.0141102e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009068532DNAL7 a222221592pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.11.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoertz, Amanda J.10aStudies on the biosynthesis of the lipodepsipeptide antibiotic Ramoplanin A2  ap. 859-865.  aRamoplanin, a non-ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotic, is highly effective against several drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), two important opportunistic human pathogens. Recently, the biosynthetic cluster from the ramoplanin producer Actinoplanes ATCC 33076 was sequenced, revealing an unusual architecture of fatty acid and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic genes (NRPSs). The first steps towards understanding how these biosynthetic enzymes cooperatively interact to produce the depsipeptide product are expression and isolation of each enzyme to probe its specificity and function. Here we describe the successful production of soluble enzymes from within the ramoplanin locus and the confirmation of their specific role in biosynthesis. These methods may be broadly applicable to the production of biosynthetic enzymes from other natural product biosynthetic gene clusters, especially those that have been refractory to production in heterologous hosts despite standard expression optimization methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinoplanes 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abiosynthesis 3achemistry 3adrug resistance 3aenzymes 3afatty acids 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aloci 3amultigene family 3apathogens 3apeptide antibiotics 3asystem optimization 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChaperonin 10xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChaperonin 60xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDepsipeptidesxbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aGlycoproteinsxbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aKinetics 2aMicromonosporaceaexgenetics 2aMultigene Family 2aPeptide Synthasesxgenetics1 aHamburger, James B.1 aGooden, David M.1 aBednar, Maria M.1 aMcCafferty, Dewey G.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 20, no. 2 p.859-865dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.11.0623Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014900171520127700320592002801597650001501625650001501640650001401655650001301669650001701682650002201699650001301721650001301734650001401747650001501761650001801776650002001794653002801814653001401842653001401856653001401870653002801884700002201912700002401934700002301958700002201981773011502003856008602118852000902204655001202213IND60737725820221117175421.0220110e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073772582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, Meisam10aTreatment of nano-oil polluted wastewater in an expanded bed adsorption column based on carboxymethyl cellulose-cellulose-nickel composite beads  aIn the present work, spherical carboxymethyl cellulose-cellulose-nickel (CMC-C-Ni) composite beads as novel adsorbent was synthesized to make a stable expanded bed adsorption (EBA) column for the treatment of the oily wastewater collected from the downstream of rapeseed industry. The morphology and structure of the CMC-C-Ni composite beads were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscope. The SEM images revealed that the synthesized composite beads were spherical with porous structure. The pore size of the beads was in the range of 90–200 nm. The physical characteristics of the CMC-C-Ni composite beads including wet density, porosity, and water content were respectively in the ranges of 1.23–1.63 g/cm³, 82.29–90.75%, and 52–76%. The factor of bed expansion in the range of 2–3 was corresponded with Richardson-Zaki equation. The results showed that by increasing the fluid viscosity, the terminal settling velocity (Uₜ) was reduced. The expansion index values were between 2.77 and 3.14 that were close to 4.8 (commonly utilized index in the laminar flow regimes). CMC-C-Ni composite beads were tested when the velocity of fluid was ˂ 700 cm/h, and the Dₐₓₗ was found to be ˂ 1 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s (steady state).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aequations 3aindustry 3alaminar flow 3alight microscopes 3aporosity 3arapeseed 3aviscosity 3awastewater 3awater content 3awater pollution 0aCarboxymethyl cellulose 0aCellulose 0aComposite 0aAdsorbent 0aExpanded bed adsorption1 aMoghimifar, Zahra1 aJavadian, Hamedreza1 aJahanshahi, Mohsen1 aFarsadrooh, Majid0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 417 p.126038-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245007300209520121800282592002801500650002001528650001701548650001501565650002001580650001101600653001901611653002001630653002601650700002701676700005801703773012101761856008301882852000901965655001201974IND60696240620221121233404.0200621e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069624062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2020.1070122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Hoàng,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0682-858410aVariational inference for high dimensional structured factor copulas  aFactor copula models have been recently proposed for describing the joint distribution of a large number of variables in terms of a few common latent factors. A Bayesian procedure is employed in order to make fast inferences for multi-factor and structured factor copulas. To deal with the high dimensional structure, a Variational Inference (VI) algorithm is applied to estimate different specifications of factor copula models. Compared to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, the variational approximation is much faster and could handle a sizeable problem in limited time. Another issue of factor copula models is that the bivariate copula functions connecting the variables are unknown in high dimensions. An automatic procedure is derived to recover the hidden dependence structure. By taking advantage of the posterior modes of the latent variables, the bivariate copula functions are selected by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Simulation studies in different contexts show that the procedure of bivariate copula selection could be very accurate in comparison to the true generated copula model. The proposed procedure is illustrated with two high dimensional real data sets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3amodels 0aFactor copulas 0aModel selection 0aVariational Inference1 aAusín, M.

Nevertheless, the effects of biochar addition on soil condition are poorly understood, especially with respect to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A large proportion of GHG emissions derive from agriculture and, thus, recognition of the effect of biochar addition to soil on GHG emissions from terrestrial ecosystems is an important issue. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of biochar application on soil in aspects of: GHG exchange (CH₄ and CO₂), basic physicochemical soil properties and structure of microbial communities in Haplic Luvisol. Soil was collected from fallow fields enriched with three doses of wood offcuts biochar (10, 20 and 30 Mg ha⁻¹) and incubated at two moisture levels (60 and 100% WHC) with the addition of 1% CH₄. To evaluate the influence of biochar aging in soil, the samples were analysed directly (short-term response) and five years (long-term response) after amendment. Generally, biochar addition increased soil pH, redox potential (Eh), organic carbon (SOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents. Under 60% WHC, direct biochar application to the soil resulted in a clear improvement in the CH₄ uptake rate. In contrast to that (at 100% WHC) methane uptake rates were twofold decreased. The positive effect was reduced due to biochar aging in the soil, but five years after application, at 60% WHC and the highest biochar dose (30 Mg ha⁻¹) still significantly enhanced CH₄ oxidation. From a short-term perspective, biochar application increased CO₂ emissions, but after five years this effect was not observed. Microbial tests confirmed that the improvement in CH₄ oxidation was correlated with methanotroph abundance in the soil. Moreover, an increase of Methylocystis abundance in the soil enriched with biochar along with enhanced CH₄ uptake rates confirm the positive biochar influence on methanotrophic communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuvisols 3aMethylocystis 3abiochar 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironment 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3aoxidation 3aredox potential 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3awood 0aBiochar 0aSoil 0aGreenhouse gases 0aMethanotroph abundance 0aMethylocystis1 aWalkiewicz, Anna1 aPytlak, Anna1 aGrządziel, Jarosław1 aGałązka, Anna1 aBrzezińska, Małgorzata,0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.151259-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006700149245006000216300001400276520149400290592002801784650002301812650001901835650003001854650002001884650001001904650001501914650000901929650001301938650001201951650002301963650002901986650001702015653001602032653001702048653001902065653001502084653002302099700005802122700001602180700002002196700001802216700005802234700002302292700002002315700005502335700002402390700001902414773010202433856008402535852000902619655001202628IND60779685120221118115327.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077968512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2022.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibata, Rōshi,d1896-1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1437-693610aCRISPR/Cas9-based simple transgenesis in Xenopus laevis  ap. 76-83.  aTransgenic techniques have greatly increased our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of target genes through live reporter imaging, as well as the spatiotemporal function of a gene using loss- and gain-of-function constructs. In Xenopus species, two well-established transgenic methods, restriction enzyme-mediated integration and I-SceI meganuclease-mediated transgenesis, have been used to generate transgenic animals. However, donor plasmids are randomly integrated into the Xenopus genome in both methods. Here, we established a new and simple targeted transgenesis technique based on CRISPR/Cas9 in Xenopus laevis. In this method, Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) targeting a putative harbor site (the transforming growth factor beta receptor 2-like (tgfbr2l) locus) and a preset donor plasmid DNA were co-injected into the one-cell stage embryos of X. laevis. Approximately 10% of faithful reporter expression was detected in F0 crispants in a promoter/enhancer-specific manner. Importantly, efficient germline transmission and stable transgene expression were observed in the F1 offspring. The simplicity of this method only required preparation of a donor vector containing the tgfbr2l genome fragment and Cas9 RNP targeting this site, which are common experimental procedures used in Xenopus laboratories. Our improved technique allows the simple generation of transgenic X. laevis, so is expected to become a powerful tool for reporter assay and gene function analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aXenopus laevis 3again-of-function mutation 3agene expression 3agenes 3agerm cells 3aloci 3aplasmids 3aprogeny 3aribonucleoproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenesis 0aCRISPR/Cas9 0aTransgenesis 0aXenopus laevis 0atgfbr2like 0aTarget integration1 aSuzuki, Miyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7284-75051 aHirose, Nao1 aTakayama, Ayuko1 aSanbo, Chiaki1 aInoue, Takeshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3289-44781 aUmesono, Yoshihiko1 aAgata, Kiyokazu1 aUeno, Naoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8375-23171 aSuzuki, Ken-ichi T.1 aMochii, Makoto0 tDevelopmental biology.g2022 Sept., v. 489 p.76-83dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2022.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010400173300001600277520148300293592002801776650002201804650002001826650001301846650001601859650001201875650001101887650001801898650003101916650002301947650001001970700002201980773010002002856008602102852000902188655001202197IND50067551020221120031650.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006755102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlood, Adrian E.13aAn improved model of the seeded batch crystallization of glucose monohydrate from aqueous solutions  ap. 209-217.  aThe current research has produced an accurate model of the non-nucleating seeded batch crystallization of glucose monohydrate which includes complex phenomena including crystal growth rate dispersion and the effect of the mutarotation reaction. The model is able to predict the population density of crystals in the batch as a function of particle size and batch time, n=n(L,t) as well as total glucose concentration in the mother liquor and the fraction of glucose in the α-d-glucopyranose form. A previous model of similar systems was limited by considering only systems with monosize seed crystals, and where growth rate dispersion had a negligible effect on the particle size distribution. Because of the nature of the ‘common history’ crystals that are produced by the growth of glucose monohydrate, the modifications required to the model to account for these additions to the model are remarkably simple. By predicting the full population density the model produces an accurate mass balance for the crystallization process, since the second moment of the crystal size distribution (CSD) may be calculated analytically at every point in the simulation. This enables the competitive kinetics between the rate of crystal mass deposition of α-glucose and the rate of production of α-glucose via the mutarotation reaction to be more accurately accounted for, and hence the significance of the mutarotation reaction on the crystal growth to be more accurately predicted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adispersions 3aglucose 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apopulation density 3aseeds1 aSrisanga, Sukanya0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 Mar., v. 109, no. 2 p.209-217dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245014400173520224100317592002802558650001202586650001902598650001602617650001902633650002102652650002102673650001002694650001202704650002302716650001902739650001302758650002502771653001802796653001402814653002202828653001902850653001902869653001202888700001302900700001502913700001702928700001302945700001902958700001802977700001702995700001303012700001903025773011903044856008803163852000903251655001203260IND60755227320221122132907.0220307e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075522732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chuanqiao10aIncreasing sulfate concentration and sedimentary decaying cyanobacteria co-affect organic carbon mineralization in eutrophic lake sediments  aSulfate (SO₄²⁻) concentrations in eutrophic lakes are continuously increasing; however, the effect of increasing SO₄²⁻ concentrations on organic carbon mineralization, especially the greenhouse gas emissions of sediments, remains unclear. Here, we constructed a series of microcosms with initial SO₄²⁻ concentrations of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 mg/L to study the effects of increased SO₄²⁻ concentrations, coupled with cyanobacterial blooms, on organic carbon mineralization in Lake Taihu. Cyanobacterial blooms promoted sulfate reduction and released a large amount of inorganic carbon. The SO₄²⁻ concentrations in cyanobacteria treatments significantly decreased and eventually reached close to 0. As the initial SO₄²⁻ concentration increased, the sulfate reduction rates significantly increased, with maximum values of 9.39, 9.44, 28.02, 30.89, 39.68, and 54.28 mg/L∙d for 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 mg/L SO₄²⁻, respectively. The total organic carbon content in sediments (51.16–52.70 g/kg) decreased with the initial SO₄²⁻ concentration (R² = 0.97), and the total inorganic carbon content in overlying water (159.97–182.73 mg/L) showed the opposite pattern (R² = 0.91). The initial SO₄²⁻ concentration was positively correlated with carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions (R² = 0.68) and negatively correlated with methane (CH₄) emissions (R² = 0.96). The highest CO₂ concentration and lowest CH₄ concentration in the 180 mg/L SO₄²⁻ treatment were 1688.78 and 1903 μmol/L, respectively. These biogeochemical processes were related to competition for organic carbon sources between sulfate reduction bacteria (SRB) and methane production archaea (MPA) in sediments. The abundance of SRB was positively correlated with the initial SO₄²⁻ concentration and ranged from 6.65 × 10⁷ to 2.98 × 10⁸ copies/g; the abundance of MPA showed the opposite pattern and ranged from 1.99 × 10⁸ to 3.35 × 10⁸copies/g. These findings enhance our understanding of the effect of increasing SO₄²⁻ concentrations on organic carbon mineralization and could enhance the accuracy of assessments of greenhouse gas emissions in eutrophic lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironment 3aeutrophication 3agreenhouse gases 3ainorganic carbon 3alakes 3amethane 3amethane production 3amineralization 3asulfates 3atotal organic carbon 0aCyanobacteria 0aSediments 0aSulfate reduction 0aOrganic carbon 0aCarbon dioxide 0aMethane1 aPeng, Yu1 aDeng, Yang1 aYu, Miaotong1 aChen, Li1 aZhang, Lanqing1 aXu, Xiaoguang1 aZhao, Fenjun1 aYan, Yan1 aWang, Guoxiang0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.151260-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100006400191245009900255300001600354506007600370520205000446592002802496506003702524650001602561650002402577650002902601650001202630650001002642650001002652650001302662650002302675650001202698650001302710650001302723650001102736650001502747650003502762650002202797650001602819650002402835651001302859653002802872653002502900653002402925653001602949653003302965653002102998653004203019653003003061700001503091700002703106773010703133856008503240852000903325655001203334IND60580905220221207060526.0190214e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058090522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.0132doi7 aPMC56874502pmcid7 a292004662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTulloch, Ayesha I.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5866-192310aQuantifying the expected value of uncertain management choices for over-abundant Greylag Geese  ap. 147-155.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn many parts of the world, conservation successes or global anthropogenic changes have led to increasing native species populations that then compete with human resource use. In the Orkney Islands, Scotland, a 60-fold increase in Greylag Goose Anser anser numbers over 24years has led to agricultural damages and culling attempts that have failed to prevent population increase. To address uncertainty about why populations have increased, we combined empirical modelling of possible drivers of Greylag Goose population change with expert-elicited benefits of alternative management actions to identify whether to learn versus act immediately to reduce damages by geese. We built linear mixed-effects models relating annual goose densities on farms to land-use and environmental covariates and estimated AICc model weights to indicate relative support for six hypotheses of change. We elicited from experts the expected likelihood that one of six actions would achieve an objective of halting goose population growth, given each hypothesis for population change. Model weights and expected effects of actions were combined in Value of Information analysis (VoI) to quantify the utility of resolving uncertainty in each hypothesis through adaptive management and monitoring. The action with the highest expected value under existing uncertainty was to increase the extent of low quality habitats, whereas assuming equal hypothesis weights changed the best action to culling. VoI analysis showed that the value of learning to resolve uncertainty in any individual hypothesis for goose population change was low, due to high support for a single hypothesis of change. Our study demonstrates a two-step framework that learns about the most likely drivers of change for an over-abundant species, and uses this knowledge to weight the utility of alternative management actions. Our approach helps inform which strategies might best be implemented to resolve uncertainty when there are competing hypotheses for change and competing management choices.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnser anser 3aadaptive management 3aanthropogenic activities 3aexperts 3afarms 3ageese 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3aland use 3alearning 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anatural resources conservation 3apopulation growth 3auncertainty 3awildlife management 3aScotland 0aHuman-wildlife conflict 0aValue of information 0aAdaptive management 0aUncertainty 0aOver-abundant native species 0aExpected utility 0aExpected value of partial information 0aGreylag Geese Anser anser1 aNicol, Sam1 aBunnefeld, N.q(Nils),0 tBiological conservation.g2017 Oct., v. 214 p.147-155dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006300158300002000221520112800241592002801369650001501397650003001412650001101442650001501453650002301468650001901491773012301510856007401633852000901707655001201716IND60667538520221121031516.0190919e20150519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066753852DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05502d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReshak, A.

We have applied U on the 4f orbital of Nd atoms and 4d orbital of Mo atoms. The calculated electronic band structure indicates that β-RbNd(MoO₄)₂ is a direct band gap semiconductor with a spin up (↑) energy gap which is lower than that of the spin down (↓). This is attributed to the different location of Nd-f in the spin up (↑) than the spin down (↓) case. The total valence charge density distribution in the (1 0 0) and (1 0 1) crystallographic planes for spin up (↑) and spin down (↓) were analyzed. The calculated bond distances show good agreement with the measured ones. The optical properties were investigated to seek deep insight into the electronic structure. It was found that the β-RbNd(MoO₄)₂ crystal exhibits negative uniaxial anisotropy and shows a lossless region and considerable anisotropy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3amolybdenum 3aoptical properties 3asemiconductors0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 19, v. 5, no. 56 p.44960-44968dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05502d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245019200175520165100367592002802018650001902046650004602065650001602111650001202127650002102139650001002160650002202170650001602192650002102208650001502229650001802244650001902262650002402281650000902305650003002314650002902344650001002373651001102383653001502394653001902409653002102428653003002449700001702479700001902496700002002515700001802535700002002553700001802573700001802591700001902609700001802628700002102646700001902667700001702686700001902703773011902722856008802841852000902929655001202938IND60755227420221122132834.0220307e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075522742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Chia-Huang14aThe sex-specific association of prenatal phthalate exposure with low birth weight and small for gestational age: A nationwide survey by the Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study (TMICS)  aThe Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study (TMICS) was launched with the aim to assess the effects of prenatal exposure to phthalic acid esters (PAEs) on infant health. A total of 1102 pregnant women were enrolled in this study from 2012 to 2015. All participants completed a structured questionnaire, and provided urine specimens. The urinary concentrations of PAE metabolites in the third trimester were measured using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Generalized additive model-penalized regression splines and logistic regression models were employed to determine the risk for low birth weight (LBW) or small for gestational age (SGA) among pregnant women exposed to PAEs. After adjustments for other covariates, each incremental unit of ln-transformed mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) for pregnant women increased the odds of SGA in male neonates by 1.44 (95% CI: 0.92–2.23). An inverse association between SGA and maternal MnBP exposure level was observed in female neonates. An increase in one ln-transformed MnBP concentration unit decreased the risk of female SGA to 0.50 (95% CI: 0.24–0.97). In the penalized regression splines, increased risks of LBW/SGA in male neonates were presented while pregnant women exposed to increased MnBP levels. However, an association in the opposite direction was observed between maternal MnBP and LBW or SGA for male and female neonates. This study indicated that high maternal MnBP exposure in the third trimester was associated with LBW or SGA for male infants. Adverse effects on susceptible populations exposed to high levels of PAEs should be of concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenvironment 3afemales 3alow birth weight 3amales 3amaternal exposure 3ametabolites 3anational surveys 3aphthalates 3aphthalic acid 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asmall for gestational age 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 3aTaiwan 0aPhthalates 0aPregnant women 0aLow birth weight 0aSmall for gestational age1 aTsai, Yen-An1 aHuang, Yu-Fang1 aTsai, Ming-Song1 aHou, Jia-Woei1 aLin, Ching-Ling1 aWang, Pei-Wei1 aHuang, Li-Wei1 aChen, Chih-Yao1 aWu, Chia-Fang1 aHsieh, Chia-Jung1 aWu, Ming-Tsang1 aWang, Shuli,1 aChen, Mei-Lien0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 806 p.151261-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1512613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04410naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245017300211300001100384500001100395506007600406520267200482592002803154506003703182650001603219650001103235650001303246650001403259650001203273650001503285650001503300650002603315650001903341650001703360650001503377651001103392700001603403700002103419700002203440700002303462700002803485700002403513700001903537700001703556700001903573700002703592773015903619856008103778852000903859655001203868IND60523839420221207134454.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052383942DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-016-0395-52doi7 aPMC49243222pmcid7 a273500432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerloigne, Maïté10aVariation in population levels of sedentary time in European children and adolescents according to cross-European studies: a systematic literature review within DEDIPAC  ap. 69.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: A high amount of sedentary time has been proposed as a risk factor for various health outcomes in adults. While the evidence is less clear in children and adolescents, monitoring sedentary time is important to understand the prevalence rates and how this behaviour varies over time and by place. This systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of existing cross-European studies on sedentary time in children (0-12y) and adolescents (13-18y), to describe the variation in population levels of sedentary time, and to discuss the impact of assessment methods. METHODS: Six literature databases were searched (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SportDiscus and OpenGrey), followed by backward- and forward tracking and searching authors’ and experts’ literature databases. Included articles were observational studies reporting on levels of sedentary time in the general population of children and/or adolescents in at least two European countries. Population levels were reported separately for children and adolescents. Data were reviewed, extracted and assessed by two researchers, with disagreements being resolved by a third researcher. The review protocol is published under registration number CRD42014013379 in the PROSPERO database. RESULTS: Forty-two eligible articles were identified, most were cross-sectional (n = 38). The number of included European countries per article ranged from 2 to 36. Levels of sedentary time were observed to be higher in East-European countries compared to the rest of Europe. There was a large variation in assessment methods and reported outcome variables. The majority of articles used a child-specific questionnaire (60 %). Other methods included accelerometers, parental questionnaires or interviews and ecological momentary assessment tools. Television time was reported as outcome variable in 57 % of included articles (ranging from a mean value of 1 h to 2.7 h in children and 1.3 h to 4.4 h in adolescents), total sedentary time in 24 % (ranging from a mean value of 192 min to 552 min in children and from 268 min to 506 min in adolescents). CONCLUSION: A substantial number of published studies report on levels of sedentary time in children and adolescents across European countries, but there was a large variation in assessment methods. Questionnaires (child specific) were used most often, but they mostly measured specific screen-based activities and did not assess total sedentary time. There is a need for harmonisation and standardisation of objective and subjective methods to assess sedentary time in children and adolescents to enable comparison across countries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3aadults 3achildren 3adatabases 3aexperts 3ainterviews 3amonitoring 3aobservational studies 3aquestionnaires 3arisk factors 3atelevision 3aEurope1 aLoyen, Anne1 aVan Hecke, Linde1 aLakerveld, Jeroen1 aHendriksen, Ingrid1 aDe Bourdheaudhuij, Ilse1 aDeforche, Benedicte1 aDonnelly, Alan1 aEkelund, Ulf1 aBrug, Johannes1 avan der Ploeg, HiddeP.0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.69-69dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-016-0395-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012400165300001400289520099400303592002801297650001501325650001301340650001101353650001201364650001101376650001601387650001101403650000901414650000901423650001401432650001401446650001501460650001101475650000701486650001301493650001401506650001101520650001401531650001301545650001501558650000901573700002201582700002001604700002801624773010401652856004801756852000901804655001201813IND4515838820221121063208.0151006e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451583882DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348120100422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasargin, N.

Manganese(II) is extracted (95â100%) in the batch mode in the pH range from 4.9 to 6.8. The determination is not interfered by n Ã 105-fold excess (by weight) of K, Na; n Ã 104-fold excess of Ca, Mg; n Ã 103-fold excess of Ba, Sr, Al, Fe(III); n Ã 102-fold excess of Ti(IV), Ni, Co, Zn, Pb, Cu. The accuracy of the procedure has been examined by the standard addition method. The relative standard deviation varies from 9 to 16%. The advantages of the procedure include simplicity, availability of the apparatus, rapidity, and the possibility of its application in field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aaluminum 3abarium 3acalcium 3acobalt 3acolorimetry 3acopper 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3anickel 3apH 3apolymers 3apotassium 3asodium 3astrontium 3atitanium 3awastewater 3azinc1 aOskotskaya, E.

It encompasses about 50 credibly described species that have a characteristic life history with the regular alternation of trophic amoebae and immobile digestive cysts. All known vampyrellid amoebae are naked and filose, but the different species display a broad morphological variety. Vampyrellids also vary greatly in their feeding habits, and range from generalist predators to specialized ‘protoplast feeders’ that exclusively feed on the cell contents of eukaryotic prey. They can be found in freshwater, soil and marine habitats, and appear to be globally distributed. Yet, the phenotypic diversity and ecological roles of the Vampyrellida are still poorly explored. Currently, there are eight well-recognized subclades that comprise four families (Vampyrellidae, Leptophryidae, Placopodidae and Sericomyxidae) as well as some lineages without any phenotypic information. Research on vampyrellids is challenging due to their cryptic occurrence in nature, intricate feeding habits that complicate cultivation, and a convoluted taxonomic history. Here, we review available information about cell structure, diversity, ecology, taxonomy and phylogenetics, and provide an up-to-date introduction to the Vampyrellida that may facilitate future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytomyxea 3aVampyrellida 3acell structures 3afreshwater 3alife history 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aphylogeny 3aprotists 3asoil 3ataxonomy 0aCercozoa 0arhizopod 0aprotoplast feeder 0avampire amoeba1 aSuthaus, Andreas0 tProtist.g2022 Feb., v. 173, no. 1 p.125854-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12496x1434-46107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2021.1258543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015100168300001800319520161200337592002801949650001301977650001401990650001602004650001602020650002102036650000902057650002402066650001302090650000902103650001702112650001102129650001202140650002302152650001802175651001002193700002102203700001502224773014802239856008102387852000902468655001202477IND60572660920221118224923.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057266092DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-016-1211-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVetrimurugan, E.10aSolute transport modelling for assessing the duration of river flow to improve the groundwater quality in an intensively irrigated deltaic region  ap. 1055-1070.  aGroundwater modelling is an important management tool to study the behaviour of aquifer system under various hydrological stresses. Present study was carried out in deltaic regions of the Cauvery river, with an objective of estimating the minimum river flow required to improve the groundwater quality by numerical modelling. Cauvery river delta is the most productive agricultural plains of south India, but the agricultural activities during the last few decades have decreased due to limited flow in the river and increasing concentration of solutes in groundwater in the eastern parts. In order to understand the causes for increasing concentration, a three-layered finite-difference flow model was formulated to simulate the groundwater head and solute transport. The model was used to simulate the groundwater flow and solute transport for 5 years from July 2007 to June 2012. There was a fairly good agreement between the computed and observed groundwater heads. The chloride and nitrate ions were considered for solute transport modelling. Observed and simulated temporal variation in chloride and nitrate concentrations were comparable. The simulated solute concentrations from July 2007 to June 2012 showed an accumulation of solutes in groundwater of coastal part of the study area. The model was used to find the flow to be maintained in the river and rainfall recharge required to flush the ions into the sea. This can be achieved by maintaining minimal flow in the river and through regulation of fertilizer use as well as by creating awareness of sustainable use of groundwater in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3achlorides 3afertilizers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aions 3amathematical models 3anitrates 3arain 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asolutes 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3aIndia1 aSenthilkumar, M.1 aElango, L.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2017 May, v. 14, no. 5 p.1055-1070dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-016-1211-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012700172300001400299520133400313536020401647592002801851596015901879650002402038650002502062650001402087650001102101650002302112650001402135650001302149650000902162650001702171651001802188653001702206653002302223653001602246653002402262653002502286700001802311700002102329700002402350700002402374773012902398856008502527852000902612655001202621IND60595634920221120110532.0180605e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059563492DNAL7 a10.1080/07060661.2017.14069922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParé, Maxime C.10aCanadian goldenrod residues and extracts inhibit the growth of Streptomycesscabiei, the causal agent of potato common scab  ap. 70-75.  aCommon scab is one of the most important diseases affecting potato crops worldwide. Using fresh residues and/or bio-products of Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis) may offer an alternative to harmful conventional fumigants. In this study, we aimed to: (i) conduct a preliminary investigation of the utilization of S. canadensis to reduce common scab severity (Experiment 1), and (ii) determine the allopathic potentials of S. canadensis extracts on Streptomyces scabiei (also known as S. scabies), the most important soil pathogen responsible for causing common scab in North America (Experiment 2). Compared with control plants, preliminary results showed that adding 1.2 kg of fresh S. canadensis residue per m² reduced scab severity by about 45% (Experiment 1). Furthermore, hexane and dichloromethane extracts of S. canadensis, at a concentration of 200 µg·mL⁻¹, inhibited the growth of S. scabiei by about 97% (Experiment 2). These results were comparable with those using tetracycline (2.5 µg·mL⁻¹), a known inhibitor of S. scabiei. Both experiments suggested that S. canadensis may represent a new approach for controlling potato common scab. More studies are required to better understand the mechanisms involved in S. canadensis induced reduction of common scab in order to standardize the approaches.  aThe authors thank the Fonds de développement de l’Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (FUQAC: Fonds de soutien à la recherche sur la qualité des sols agricoles nordiques) for financial support.  aPublisher supplied data  cFonds de développement de l’Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (FUQAC: Fonds de soutien à la recherche sur la qualité des sols agricoles nordiques) 3aSolidago canadensis 3aStreptomyces scabiei 3afumigants 3ahexane 3amethylene chloride 3apathogens 3apotatoes 3asoil 3atetracycline 3aNorth America 0aAllelopathic 0aCanadian goldenrod 0acommon scab 0aSolidago canadensis 0aStreptomyces scabiei1 aLegault, Jean1 aPichette, André1 aTremblay, Catherine1 aAubut, Marie-France0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 40, no. 1 p.70-75dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43214x1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2017.14069923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03754naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011000163300001600273520221100289592002802500650002002528650001002548650001402558650001602572650002402588650001302612650001502625650001702640650001402657650002202671650001702693650002302710650001302733651001002746653001702756653002402773653002602797653002702823653001702850653003702867653003102904700001802935700001802953700001602971700001602987700001803003773011103021856008303132852000903215655001203224IND60760108820221120031016.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076010882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2021.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTai, Deyun10aEcological traits and landscape characteristics predicting bird sensitivity to urbanization in city parks  ap. 110-120.  aHabitat loss and fragmentation caused by urbanization often have negative impacts on wildlife in cities. There are considerable studies investigating the relationship between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. However, so far, very few studies have examined the influence of species traits combined with landscape factors on vulnerability to urbanization in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we investigated how species traits and park characteristics influenced bird sensitivity to urbanization in the highly urbanized city of Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks. For each bird species, we collected data on nine life-history and ecological traits that are commonly assumed to influence urbanization vulnerability. For each park, we selected six landscape variables that are commonly considered to influence bird response to urbanization. After phylogenetic correction, the nine species traits were used separately and in combination to evaluate their associations with species abundance, an indicator of urbanization vulnerability. We then used the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to test relationships between species traits and environmental variables. We found that the 75 species analyzed demonstrated considerable variation in vulnerability to urbanization. Using PGLS analyses and model averaging, we found that habitat specificity was the single best ecological predictor of urbanization vulnerability in birds in Nanjing city parks. The RLQ analysis showed that body size and habitat specificity were correlated with distance to city center and connectivity of the parks, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit species with smaller body mass and lower habitat specificity in urbanized landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts giving priority to species with high habitat specificity and to parks with high connectivity and far away from the city center may prove effective for the preservation of bird diversity in our highly urbanized system. Meanwhile, preventing future habitat loss and destruction in existing city parks may also effectively conserve these vulnerable species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplied ecology 3abirds 3abody size 3abody weight 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alife history 3aphylogeny 3aspecies abundance 3aurbanization 3avulnerable species 3awildlife 3aChina 0aConnectivity 0aHabitat specificity 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aProactive conservation 0aRLQ analysis 0aTrait–environment relationship 0aUrbanization vulnerability1 aChen, Chuanwu1 aSong, Yunfeng1 aTan, Xinwei1 aYang, Xueru1 aWang, Yanping0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2022 Feb., v. 58 p.110-120dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2021.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008300160300002000243520123800263592002801501650002401529650001101553650001401564650001701578650002201595650001401617650000801631700001501639700001601654700002001670700001601690700001701706700001901723700001801742700001601760773014401776856007401920852000901994655001202003IND60621962620221119074117.0181123e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062196262DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta09544b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Changhyeon12aA self-healing Sn anode with an ultra-long cycle life for sodium-ion batteries  ap. 22809-22818.  aFor a next-generation sodium battery to replace lithium ion batteries, it is essential to develop an anode with a long cycle life and high rate. Sn is considered to be an ideal candidate for the anode of sodium ion batteries. Here, we report a Sn anode that exhibits ultra-long-term cycle stability with a high capacity of 554 mA h g⁻¹ at 10C-rate for 5000 cycles. The optimized cell configuration consists of 1,2-dimethoxyethane as the electrolyte, a double separator including a nanoporous membrane, and a Sn anode with MWCNT as a conductive additive. Its capacity retention reaches up to 99.8% and its coulombic efficiency is near 100% for 5000 cycles. Surprisingly, we have discovered that the Sn powder exhibits a self-healing phenomenon during cycling. Sn is initially pulverized into a nanometer-sized powder, and then forms a three-dimensional porous coral-like structure in which ligament-shaped micrometer-sized Sn particles are connected with a low coordination number by room temperature sintering. The coral-like structure is mechanically stable towards volume change and electrically connected. The self-healing structure and mechanism provide a direction for the design of other electrodes with alloying mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanodes 3achemistry 3aelectrolytes 3alithium batteries 3ananopores 3atin1 aKim, Icpyo1 aKim, Huihun1 aSadan, Milan K.1 aYeo, Hyewon1 aCho, Gyubong1 aAhn, Jaepyoung1 aAhn, Jouhyeon1 aAhn, Hyojun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 6, no. 45 p.22809-22818dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta09544b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01989naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012000156300002000276520088100296592002801177650002301205650001101228650001801239650001901257650001301276650002901289650002501318700001701343700001801360700001401378700002001392773014401412856007401556852000901630655001201639IND60621962720221119073957.0181123e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062196272DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta09656b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Yufeng10aNanostructure controlled construction of high-performance thermoelectric materials of polymers and their composites  ap. 22381-22390.  aBeing emerging green energy materials, organic polymer thermoelectric (TE) composites have attracted much current interest and witnessed a rapid development due to their diverse advantages, such as low density, low thermal conductivity, high flexibility, and highly tunable molecular structure. By adjusting the polymer structure and fabrication of their composites, the TE performance can be significantly enhanced. In this review, recent advances in the nanostructures of polymers and their composites for TE applications are introduced. The TE performance of polymers and their composites can be greatly improved and highly tuned by controlled construction of nanostructures via both in situ polymerization and physical mixing. The mechanism of the relation between nanostructures and TE performance is also discussed. Finally, the outlooks of future research are remarked.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3amixing 3ananomaterials 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3arenewable energy sources 3athermal conductivity1 aGao, Xuefen,1 aLiang, Lirong1 aWang, Xin1 aChen, Guangming0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 6, no. 45 p.22381-22390dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta09656b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013700173300001600310520173600326592002802062650002802090650002302118650001102141650001802152650001002170650001202180650001602192700002102208773009102229856008502320852000902405655001202414IND60111810120221120223300.0150812e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011181012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoenig, Walter D.10aAge-related provisioning behaviour in the cooperatively breeding acorn woodpecker: testing the skills and the pay-to-stay hypotheses  ap. 437-444.  aHelpers in cooperatively breeding acorn woodpeckers, Melanerpes formicivorus, gain indirect fitness benefits by provisioning related offspring, but may also gain direct fitness benefits by any of several mechanisms. We tested the ‘skills’ hypothesis, which proposes that provisioning behaviour provides helpers with experience that allows them to be more successful when they breed later in life, and the ‘pay-to-stay’ hypothesis, which proposes that provisioning behaviour by helpers is rewarded by dominant breeders, allowing helpers to remain in their natal group longer, thus reaping nepotistic benefits. We found that young helpers provisioned at relatively low rates, which in most cases increased with age, a necessary requirement of the skills hypothesis. Analyses of birds with known feeding histories, however, revealed that helper males that fed young at higher rates had no greater reproductive success later in life than less helpful helper males, contrary to the skills hypothesis. In accord with pay-to-stay, males that fed more as second-year helpers remained in their natal group as helpers significantly longer and were more likely to inherit than were male broodmates that fed less. An analysis controlling for the time that birds remained in their natal groups, however, failed to indicate that prior feeding history played a significant role in these differences, which are more likely to be a consequence of differences in dispersal behaviour. In acorn woodpeckers, as in other species of cooperative breeders in which helpers are close relatives, the primary benefits of provisioning behaviour are indirect via kin selection rather than direct via either the acquisition of skills or payment of rent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelanerpes formicivorus 3adispersal behavior 3afruits 3akin selection 3amales 3aprogeny 3awoodpeckers1 aWalters, Eric L.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 82, no. 3 p.437-444dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245014900152300001800301500002000319520177000339592002802109596007402137596005002211650002302261650002802284650002802312650002802340650002902368650001702397650000902414650001602423650002002439650001702459650001602476650002502492650000702517650001402524650002402538651001002562700001102572700001202583700001402595700001702609700001202626700001302638700001302651700001202664700005302676773013302729856007302862852000902935655001202944IND60688526420221118033841.0200415e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068852642DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.145702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, H.10aScreening of natural lactic acid bacteria with potential effect on silage fermentation, aerobic stability and aflatoxin B1 in hot and humid area  ap. 1301-1311.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To effectively make high‐quality silage in hot and humid area. METHODS AND RESULTS: The natural lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains CZ149, XH358, XH753 and XH761 isolated from corn and Napier grass were screened by the potential of low pH growth and high lactic acid production, and their effect on silage quality, aerobic stability and aflatoxin B1 production of whole‐crop corn was also studied in Sichuan, China. Four selected strains were Gram‐positive and catalase‐negative, rod‐shaped strains that are able to grow at pH 3·5 and at 45°C. Strains CZ149, XH358, XH753 and XH761 were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus and L. paracasei, respectively. After 60 days of fermentation, all LAB strains showed no significant relationship with the quality of corn silage, whereas the lowest aflatoxin B1 and lactic‐to‐acetic ratio were detected in strain XH753‐treated silage. Strain CZ149‐treated silage showed worse aerobic stability and higher aflatoxin B1 concentration than control, whereas strain XH753‐treated silage had better aerobic stability and lowest aflatoxin B1 concentration after aerobic exposure in hot and humid condition for 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: The three L. plantarum strains used in this study are not suitable as inoculants for local whole‐crop corn silage, whereas L. rhamnosus 753 could prolong the aerobic stability and inhibit the accumulation of aflatoxin B1 at hot and humid condition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides new information of LAB inoculants for corn silage in hot and humid areas. Especially, a screened strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 753 can be used as a candidate strains to make high‐quality silage in tropical and subtropical areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐34cModern Agro‐industry Technology Research System of China  a20191383cEducation Ministry Chunhui projects 3aCenchrus purpureus 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aLactobacillus salivarius 3aaflatoxin B1 3acorn 3acorn silage 3acrop production 3afeed quality 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3apH 3ascreening 3asilage fermentation 3aChina1 aKe, W.1 aYan, Y.1 aShuai, Y.1 aLi, Xunjing,1 aRan, Q.1 aYang, Z.1 aWang, X.1 aCai, Y.1 aZhang, X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1433-95100 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 May, v. 128, no. 5 p.1301-1311dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.145703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245007300160300001600233500002000249520161600269592002801885650002001913650002001933650001901953650002401972650002001996650002202016650001102038650001602049650001902065651001202084700002402096773013002120856007202250852000902322655001202331IND60587537320221122081043.0180319e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058753732DNAL7 a10.1890/03-50632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuyama, Toshinori10aCombining genetic and ecological data to estimate sea turtle origins  ap. 315-325.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany species of sea turtles spend part of their life cycle gathered in large feeding aggregations that combine individuals from widely separated rookery populations. Biologists have applied methods of mixed‐stock analysis to mitochondrial DNA samples from rookeries and mixed populations to estimate the contributions of different rookeries to the mixed stock. These methods are limited by the amount of genetic overlap between rookeries and fail to incorporate ecological covariates such as rookery size and location within major ocean currents that are strongly suspected to affect rookery contributions. A new hierarchical Bayesian model for rookery contributions incorporates these covariates (and potentially others) to draw stronger conclusions from existing data. Applying the model to various simple scenarios shows that, in some cases, it can accurately estimate turtle origins even when turtles come from rookeries with high degrees of genetic overlap. Applying the model to more complex simulations shows that it performs well in a wide range of scenarios. Applying the model to existing data on green turtles (Chelonia mydas) narrows confidence intervals but does not change point estimates significantly. Applying it to loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) strengthens the dominance of the large rookery in south Florida, and brings estimates from a small data set on sea turtle strandings into line with those from rookery data. Used appropriately, hierarchical Bayesian methods offer great potential for introducing multiple levels of variation and ecological covariates into ecological models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aCaretta caretta 3aChelonia mydas 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3asea turtles 3awater currents 3aFlorida1 aBolker, Benjamin M.0 tEcological applications.g2005 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.315-325dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-50633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011100173300001600284520160000300592002801900596001901928650001801947650001801965650001501983650002001998650001302018650001202031650001202043650002302055650002102078650002302099650001102122650001402133700002302147700001202170700001802182700002002200700005902220773012002279856008202399852000902481655001202490IND60747508820221121055351.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074750882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-021-00411-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolicz, Agnieszka A.12aA dynamic intron retention program regulates the expression of several hundred genes during pollen meiosis  ap. 225-242.  aKEY MESSAGE : Intron retention is a stage-specific mechanism of functional attenuation of a subset of co-regulated, functionally related genes during early stages of pollen development. To improve our understanding of the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive developmental processes, we performed a genome-wide study of alternative splicing and isoform switching during five key stages of pollen development in field mustard, Brassica rapa. Surprisingly, for several hundred genes (12.3% of the genes analysed), isoform switching results in stage-specific expression of intron-retaining transcripts at the meiotic stage of pollen development. In such cases, we report temporally regulated switching between expression of a canonical, translatable isoform and an intron-retaining transcript that is predicted to produce a truncated and presumably inactive protein. The results suggest a new pervasive mechanism underlying modulation of protein levels in a plant developmental program. The effect is not based on gene expression induction but on the type of transcript produced. We conclude that intron retention is a stage-specific mechanism of functional attenuation of a subset of co-regulated, functionally related genes during meiosis, especially genes related to ribosome biogenesis, mRNA transport and nuclear envelope architecture.

The southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina, has often been cited as being extremely polygynous, thus providing an important reference point for studies on mating systems. During the breeding season, these animals form terrestrial harems in which one dominant male controls tens to hundreds of females. Our current understanding of polygynous mating systems seems to imply that, unlike males, females are not under selection pressure to adopt alternative mating strategies, and in the case of the southern elephant seal, the possibility of mating at sea has not been considered. Furthermore, elephant seal females are thought to breed annually. Using a 25-year mark–recapture data set, we found that elephant seal females skipped breeding seasons, often returning to pup in the following breeding season. Females did not need to haul out on land in order to breed in the following season, thus providing evidence for mating at sea by virgin and multiparous females. Nonpolygynous, opportunistic mating at sea could be an important alternative mating strategy in a supposedly strictly polygynous species. This has implications for our understanding of elephant seal ecology, demography and behaviour and of the evolution of vertebrate polygyny in general. If polygyny does not preclude females from adopting alternative mating strategies, the term ‘polygyny’ may be misleading. Traditional concentration on male strategies has hampered our understanding of mating systems, in assuming that females capitulate to these strategies. We suggest similar misinterpretations could occur in other polygynous species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMirounga leonina 3aanimal behavior 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3adata collection 3ademography 3aevolution 3afemales 3amales 3amammals 3amating systems 3apolygyny 3apups1 aTosh, C.A.1 aBester, M.N.1 aCameron, E.Z.1 aMcIntyre, T.1 aWilkinson, I.S.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 82, no. 3 p.445-451dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245015700196300001800353500002000371520137500391592002801766596002401794650003101818650002501849650001601874650002301890650002001913650002601933650002001959650001301979650001701992700001502009700002002024700001702044700001502061773013302076856007302209852000902282655001202291IND60688526620221118033834.0200415e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068852662DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.145492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraissant, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0659-755X10aComparison of isothermal microcalorimetry and BACTEC MGIT960 for the detection of the metabolic activity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum samples  ap. 1497-1502.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: This study explores the uses of microcalorimetry to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) in sputum. Microcalorimetry measures metabolic heat evolution during cellular proliferation of tuberculosis (TB) and is considered as a possible alternative to conventional diagnostic tools. OBJECTIVES: To compare the time to detection (TTD) from the BACTEC™ MGIT™ 960 and the calScreener™ calorimetric system. METHODS: Sixty‐four sputa samples were selected from patients with confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Those sample were then decontaminated and analysed using calorimetry and BACTEC MGIT 960 system. RESULTS: The incubation period until detection of M. tuberculosis in the sample was 8·5 ± 3·7 days for the MGIT system and 10·1 ± 4·1 days (mean ± SD) for calorimetry. CONCLUSIONS: The microincubations in the 48‐well format calScreener offers potential for rapid and accurate diagnostic of TB in different samples. Although TTD from calorimetry is still longer than with the MGIT, our findings suggest that several improvements are possible. Still, the instrument is ideal for continuous, real‐time analysis of net metabolic heat release of limited sample numbers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our result emphasizes that with further optimization, calorimetry can become an alternative detection method for tuberculosis.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Basel 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3abiochemical pathways 3acalorimetry 3acell proliferation 3adecontamination 3adiagnostic techniques 3aheat production 3apatients 3atuberculosis1 aTheron, G.1 aFriedrich, S.O.1 aDiacon, A.H.1 aBonkat, G.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2020 May, v. 128, no. 5 p.1497-1502dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.145493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009600169300001600265520169900281592002801980596007302008596007302081596007302154596005702227596005702284650001802341650001602359650002302375650000802398650001502406650001102421650001702432650001002449650001502459650001002474650001102484650002302495650001302518650001102531650001702542650001902559650001202578650001702590700002502607700005602632773012002688856008202808852000902890655001202899IND60747509020221121055439.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074750902DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-021-00418-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagahara, Shiori10aDetection of a biolistic delivery of fluorescent markers and CRISPR/Cas9 to the pollen tube  ap. 191-205.  aKEY MESSAGE: Biolistic delivery into pollen. In recent years, genome editing techniques, such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, have been highlighted as a new approach to plant breeding. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has been widely utilized to generate transgenic plants by introducing plasmid DNA containing CRISPR/Cas9 into plant cells. However, this method has general limitations, such as the limited host range of Agrobacterium and difficulties in tissue culture, including callus induction and regeneration. To avoid these issues, we developed a method to genetically modify germ cells without the need for Agrobacterium-mediated transfection and tissue culture using tobacco as a model. In this study, plasmid DNA containing sequences of Cas9, guide RNA, and fluorescent reporter was introduced into pollen using a biolistic delivery system. Based on the transient expression of fluorescent reporters, the Arabidopsis UBQ10 promoter was found to be the most suitable promoter for driving the expression of the delivered gene in pollen tubes. We also evaluated the delivery efficiency in male germ cells in the pollen by expression of the introduced fluorescent marker. Mutations were detected in the target gene in the genomic DNA extracted from CRISPR/Cas9-introduced pollen tubes, but were not detected in the negative control. Bombarded pollen germinated pollen tubes and delivered their contents into the ovules in vivo. Although it is necessary to improve biolistic delivery efficiency and establish a method for the screening of genome-modified seeds, our findings provide important insights for the detection and production of genome-modified seeds by pollen biolistic delivery.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP16H06464cGrant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas  aJP16K21727cGrant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas  aJPMJPR15QCcPrecursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology  a20H05778cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20H05779cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aAgrobacterium 3aArabidopsis 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aRNA 3abiolistics 3acallus 3afluorescence 3agenes 3ahost range 3amales 3amodels 3aplant reproduction 3aplasmids 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3atissue culture 3atobacco 3atransfection1 aHigashiyama, Tetsuya1 aMizuta, Yoko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8086-22970 tPlant reproduction.g2021 Sept., v. 34, no. 3 p.191-205dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12165x2194-79537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-021-00418-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012100170300001600291520171900307592002802026650001502054650002002069650001302089650001002102650001102112650001102123650001002134650001002144650002602154650002502180700001402205773009102219856008502310852000902395655001202404IND60111810320221121222714.0150812e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011181032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaverschek, N.10aForaging leafcutter ants: olfactory memory underlies delayed avoidance of plants unsuitable for the symbiotic fungus  ap. 453-458.  aLeafcutter ants are known to reject previously accepted plants if they prove to be unsuitable for their symbiotic fungus: a phenomenon that involves avoidance learning. Workers need to associate the detrimental effects of the incorporated plant with its characteristics, chemical and/or physical features, thus allowing plant recognition at the foraging site on subsequent days, and its avoidance. We addressed the question of to what extent olfactory memory underlies delayed avoidance of plants unsuitable for the symbiotic fungus. Odour is an important plant characteristic used as a recognition cue outside the nest during foraging. Acromyrmex ambiguus foragers were able to learn about a plant’s unsuitability for their symbiotic fungus, rejecting this substrate in a binary choice experiment in the laboratory. Presented with leaf discs of two plant species simultaneously, one known to be unsuitable and one suitable, individual foragers significantly preferred the suitable plant species. When presented only with the plant odour, foragers steered away from the odour of the known unsuitable plant species, moving towards the simultaneously presented odour of a suitable plant species. Foragers were therefore able to identify plant species and recall information about substrate suitability for the fungus through the plant’s odour alone. None the less, foragers showed a significantly stronger avoidance of known unsuitable substrate when they could make contact with the leaf discs, suggesting the use of additional cues for plant identification. It is argued that not only appetitive, but also aversive learned responses are involved in the process of plant recognition by foraging leafcutter ants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcromyrmex 3aanimal behavior 3aforaging 3afungi 3aleaves 3amemory 3anests 3aodors 3aplant characteristics 3aplant identification1 aRoces, F.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 82, no. 3 p.453-458dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2011.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245015800182300001600340520129700356592002801653650001401681650000801695650002001703650002201723650002101745650002501766650002001791650000901811650001601820650002201836650001801858650001901876650000701895650001501902650001601917650001601933653002501949653002001974653002401994653004002018653002002058700002502078700002802103700006802131773010602199856008702305852000902392655001202401IND60545727120221118074553.0160902e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054572712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerna-Galvis, Efraím A.10aSonochemical degradation of the pharmaceutical fluoxetine: Effect of parameters, organic and inorganic additives and combination with a biological system  ap. 354-360.  aFluoxetine (FLX), one of the most widely used antidepressants in the world, is an emergent pollutant found in natural waters that causes disrupting effects on the endocrine systems of some aquatic species. This work explores the total elimination of FLX by sonochemical treatment coupled to a biological system. The biological process acting alone was shown to be unable to remove the pollutant, even under favourable conditions of pH and temperature. However, sonochemical treatment (600kHz) was shown to be able to remove the pharmaceutical. Several parameters were evaluated for the ultrasound application: the applied power (20–60W), dissolved gas (air, Ar and He), pH (3–11) and initial concentration of fluoxetine (2.9–162.0μmolL−1). Additionally, the presence of organic (1-hexanol and 2-propanol) and inorganic (Fe2+) compounds in the water matrix and the degradation of FLX in a natural mineral water were evaluated. The sonochemical treatment readily eliminates FLX following a kinetic Langmuir. After 360min of ultrasonic irradiation, 15% mineralization was achieved. Analysis of the biodegradability provided evidence that the sonochemical process transforms the pollutant into biodegradable substances, which can then be mineralized in a subsequent biological treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aair 3aantidepressants 3aaquatic organisms 3abiodegradability 3abiological treatment 3adissolved gases 3airon 3airradiation 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amineral water 3amineralization 3apH 3apollutants 3atemperature 3aultrasonics 0aUltrasonic oxidation 0aPharmaceuticals 0aEndocrine disruptor 0aUltrasound–biological combination 0aWater treatment1 aSilva-Agredo, Javier1 aGiraldo-Aguirre, Ana L.1 aTorres-Palma, Ricardo A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4583-98490 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Aug. 15, v. 524-525 p.354-360dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012700175300001600302520066900318592002800987650001301015650002301028650001501051650001801066650001401084650001201098650001801110650001201128650002301140650002001163650003301183653001801216653002101234653002101255653001301276653002201289700001901311773007901330856008101409852000901490655001201499IND60529213920221119080849.0161018e20160121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052921392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.11.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiedbal, Dominika Alina10aHalide-mediated regioselective 6-O-glycosylation of unprotected hexopyranosides with perbenzylated glycosyl bromide donors  ap. 415-419.  aThe regio- and stereoselective glycosylation at the 6-position in 2,3,4,6-unprotected hexopyranosides has been investigated with dibutyltin oxide as the directing agent.

Mannose donors and acceptors, on the other hand, did not react in the glycosylation under these conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromides 3achemical structure 3adibutyltin 3adisaccharides 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aglycosylation 3amannose 3amethylene chloride 3astereochemistry 3atetrabutylammonium compounds 0aGlycosylation 0aGlycosyl bromide 0aRegioselectivity 0aStannane 0aStereoselectivity1 aMadsen, Robert0 tTetrahedron.g2016 Jan. 21, v. 72 p.415-419dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2015.11.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01606naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011100154300001600265500001900281520063100300592002800931650002200959650001100981650001300992700001701005700002401022700001701046700001501063773013101078856007401209852000901283655001201292IND60724665820221119125424.0210122e20210121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072466582DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc07438a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lin10aModulation of destructive quantum interference by bridge groups in truxene-based single-molecule junctions  ap. 667-670.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aElectron transport properties of polycyclic truxene derivatives have been investigated by the single molecule conductance measurement technique and theoretical study.

Postzygotic hybrid incompatibility resulting from a cross between different species involves complex mechanisms occurring at various developmental stages. Embryo arrest, followed by seed abortion, is the first stage of such incompatibility reactions and inhibits hybrid seed development. In Prunus, a rosaceous woody species, some interspecific crosses result in fruit drop during the early stage of fruit development, in which inferior seed development may be accounted for the observed hybrid incompatibility. In this study, we investigated ovule development and the transcriptomes of developing ovules in inter-subgeneric crosses of Prunus. We conducted a cross of Prunus mume (subgenus Prunus), pollinated by P. persica (subgenus Amygdalus), and found that ovule and seed coat degeneration occurs before fruit drop. Transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed genes enriched in several GO pathways, including organelle development, stimulus response, and signaling. Among these pathways, the organelle-related genes were actively regulated during ovule development, as they showed higher expression in the early stage of interspecific crosses and declined in the later stage, suggesting that the differential regulation of organelle function may induce the degeneration of hybrid ovules. Additionally, genes related to ovule and seed coat development, such as genes encoding AGL-like and auxin response, were differentially regulated in Prunus interspecific crosses. Our results provide histological and molecular information on hybrid seed abortion in Prunus that could be utilized to develop new hybrid crops. Additionally, we compared and discussed transcriptome responses to hybrid seed failure in Prunus and other plant species, which provides insight into conserved or lineage-specific hybrid incompatibility mechanisms in some plant species.  aPublisher supplied data  a19K15834cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a17K19265cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aPrunus mume 3aauxins 3afruit drop 3afruiting 3agene expression regulation 3ahistology 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aovules 3aplant reproduction 3aseed abortion 3aseed coat 3aseed development 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3awoody plants1 aKitamura, Yuto1 aNumaguchi, Koji1 aItai, Akihiro0 tPlant reproduction.g2021 Sept., v. 34, no. 3 p.255-266dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12165x2194-79537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-021-00423-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01569naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245004800193300001800241520025300259592002800512650002100540650003100561650003600592650003700628650002400665650002700689650002800716650003300744650003300777650004000810650004300850650002300893650004900916773009300965856008101058990002301139852000901162655001201171IND60093841320221118031726.0141104e20110524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009384132DNAL7 a216018022pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClung, C. Robertson10aCircadian Rhythms: Lost in Post-Translation  ap.

Eighty-one female individuals representing 27 populations of H. theivora from tea plantations of different regions of Assam, India were collected and evaluated. Observation of 12 characters i.e. body length, antennae length, head width, stylet length, thorax width, forewing length, forewing width, hind wing length, hind wing width and length of foreleg, middle leg, hind leg revealed distinct pattern in different population of H. theivora. On the basis of morphological traits, six different types of population groups have been identified. Genetic analysis produced a total number of 262 bands, of which 221 (84.35 %) were polymorphic. The number of bands produced per primer varied from 2 to 17. The dendrogram derived from UPGMA cluster analysis indicates three clusters containing 24 populations at 63 % of similarity while three populations viz. H23, H19 and H14 excluded from the major cluster and come out as a discrete cluster. The cluster 1 includes populations from 9 different districts of Assam, cluster 2 again included 5 populations, cluster 3 constitute 3 populations and cluster 4 again consist of 3 populations. Both marker (morphological and molecular) systems indicated that genetic variability within populations examined was significantly high. Appropriate quality and quantity of chemical pesticides used in pest control programmes is a fundamental goal in the tea industry. It is supported by the knowledge of patterns of population connectivity and historical demography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplantations 3afemales 3ademography 3amorphometry 3astylets 3atea 3alegs 3apesticides 3acluster analysis 3apest control programs 3awings 3abody length 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic variation 3aHelopeltis theivora 3athorax 3aantennae 3aIndia 0aHemiptera1 aMech, Jiten1 aBorthakur, Sangita1 aBhuyan, Mantu1 aBhattacharyya, Pranab Ram0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Dec., v. 41, no. 12 p.7845-7856dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3678-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009100164300001600255520136200271592002801633650003101661650002301692650002001715650003201735653001701767653001401784653003501798653002201833653002301855700005301878773010101931856008502032852000902117655001202126IND60537797320221119112943.0190412e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053779732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2016.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Feng14aThe complex dynamics of a diffusive prey–predator model with an Allee effect in prey  ap. 123-144.  aThis paper investigates complex dynamics of a predator–prey interaction model that incorporates: (a) an Allee effect in prey; (b) the Michaelis–Menten type functional response between prey and predator; and (c) diffusion in both prey and predator. We provide rigorous mathematical results of the proposed model including: (1) the stability of non-negative constant steady states; (2) sufficient conditions that lead to Hopf/Turing bifurcations; (3) a prior estimates of positive steady states; (4) the non-existence and existence of non-constant positive steady states when the model is under zero-flux boundary condition. We also perform completed analysis of the corresponding ODE model to obtain a better understanding on effects of diffusion on the stability. Our analytical results show that the small values of the ratio of the prey's diffusion rate to the predator's diffusion rate are more likely to destabilize the system, thus generate Hopf-bifurcation and Turing instability that can lead to different spatial patterns. Through numerical simulations, we observe that our model, with or without Allee effect, can exhibit extremely rich pattern formations that include but not limit to strips, spotted patterns, symmetric patterns. In addition, the strength of Allee effects also plays an important role in generating distinct spatial patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3afunctional response models 3apopulation density 3apopulation size 3apredator-prey relationships 0aAllee effect 0aDiffusion 0aNon-constant positive solution 0aPattern formation 0aTuring instability1 aKang, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5448-76090 tEcological complexity.g2016 Dec., v. 28 p.123-144dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2171x1476-945X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2016.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01472naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012800160300001600288520043800304592002800742650001600770650002700786650001300813650001600826650001200842650001400854700001900868700002500887700002000912773013100932856007401063852000901137655001201146IND60724666220221119125602.0210122e20210121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072466622DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc07773a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDusold, Carolin10aSynthesis and crystal packing of perylene-derivatives with extreme sterically demanding pentaphenylbenzene bay-substituents  ap. 583-586.  aAn unprecedented library of single and double bay-substituted perylene-pentaphenylbenzenes (PPBs) is presented.

These stocks are required for assessment of relative limits of detection (LOD) of alternative nucleic acid testing (NAT)âbased methods in comparison to the conventional microbiological methods. Methods and Results: A kinetics study was used to assess the changes in ratios between the numbers of GC and CFU at different growth phases of six different mycoplasma cultures Acholeplasma laidlawii, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma arginini, Mycoplasma fermentans, Mycoplasma orale and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. All tested mycoplasmas demonstrated low GC/CFU ratios (â¤10) within the log and early stationary growth phases. A significant increase in GC/CFU ratios was observed at the very late stationary and death phases, when the titre of cultures has declined. Similar patterns of GC/CFU profiles were observed for A.Â laidlawii and Myc.Â gallisepticum coâcultured with suspension of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Conclusions: Tested mycoplasma strains harvested at the exponentialâearly stationary phases of growth demonstrated the lowest GC/CFU ratios and low propensity to form filamentous structures or aggregates under proposed conditions and can be used for the preparation of a mycoplasma reference panel for methods comparability study. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study shows that the preparation and use of viable mycoplasma reference strains with low CG/CFU ratios is the most reliable way to adequately evaluate the LOD of alternative NATâbased mycoplasma testing methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcholeplasma laidlawii 3aChinese hamsters 3aMycoplasma arginini 3aMycoplasma fermentans 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3aMycoplasma orale 3aMycoplasma pneumoniae 3acoculture 3adetection limit 3amicrobiology 3anucleic acids1 aVolokhov, D.V.1 aDavid, S.W.1 aIkonomi, P.1 aBrewer, A.1 aChang, A.1 aChizhikov, V.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2011 Oct., v. 111, no. 4 p.904-914dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.05108.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013500163300001800298520114200316592002801458650002501486650001401511650001901525650001601544650002301560650001901583650001001602650002101612650001101633650000901644650002301653650002601676650001101702650001401713650001801727700001601745773010801761856008101869852000901950655001201959IND60120534220221119222047.0151024e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012053422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3634-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yulin,10aDown-regulation of testes-specific protease 50 induces apoptosis in human laryngocarcinoma HEp2 cells in a NF-κB-mediated pathway  ap. 7743-7747.  aTestes-specific protease 50 is a newly reported threonine enzyme. It has similar amino acid sequences and enzymatic structures to some other serine proteases. It is proposed as a laryngocarcinoma-related gene in human beings. The physiological mechanism by which TSP50 exerts its promoting effects in laryngocarcinoma is not yet fully understood. The study investigated the function of TSP50 by suppressing its expression in the HEp2 cell line using a TSP50-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Western bloting and real-time-PCR were used to detect the levels of TSP50. By using MTT, Wound healing, flow cytometric and tumorigenesis assays, the study tested the TSP50 role in human laryngocarcinoma cell growth and apoptosis. The results demonstrated that TSP50 knockdown could inhibit HEp2 cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro in a NF-κB-mediated pathway. The tumorigenicity of TSP50 shRNA-expressing cells were decreased after inoculating into nude mice. The present results provide a new understanding of the TSP50 gene in the progression of laryngocarcinoma and put up a novel therapeutic target for treating this cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3amice 3aserine proteinases 3asmall interfering RNA 3atestes 3athreonine 3atissue repair1 aSun, Ya-nan0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Dec., v. 41, no. 12 p.7743-7747dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3634-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04011naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011400170300001800284520249600302592002802798650001502826650001202841650001402853650002302867650002102890650003002911650001702941650002002958650001802978650001602996650002903012650001703041653000803058653000803066653002303074653000803097653002803105653002603133653002403159700001503183700002203198700007003220773014403290856008603434852000903520655001203529IND60767319220220314000000.0220214e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076731922DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c056602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tsung-Wei10aEnergetics of Reaction Pathways Enabled by N and H Radicals during Catalytic, Plasma-Assisted NH₃ Synthesis  ap. 2034-2051.  aPlasma-assisted catalysis is emerging as an alternative to several thermocatalytic processes. For ammonia synthesis, it could make the process milder, which would help production, decentralization, and compatibility with renewable energy. However, one major obstacle preventing optimization of the plasma-assisted process is the incipient mechanistic understanding of ammonia formation on plasma-exposed catalysts. Here, optical emission spectroscopy is consistent with only a weak effect of the metal on plasma composition and with the presence of small concentrations of plasma radicals in N₂/H₂ mixtures in dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactors, which are bound to enable new catalyst-involved pathways not considered in previous kinetic models for NH₃ synthesis. Thus, we comprehensively examined, via density functional theory calculations, the energetics (favorability) of 51 reactions on Fe, Ni, Co, Pd, Ga, Sn, Cu, Au, and Ag. Enthalpic barriers for Eley–Rideal (ER) reactions involving N• and H• radicals were found to be negligible and hence supportive of the following: (i) plausible NNH formation and consequent prominent role of the associative pathway to form NH₃ (consistent with some experimental reports detecting surface-bound NXHY species), (ii) likelihood of N• adsorption taking over N₂* dissociation as the primary source of surface bound N*, and (iii) probable dominance of ER hydrogenation reactions over Langmuir–Hinshelwood ones. The energetics herein presented will allow thoroughly studying the pathway competition in future kinetic models, but numbers calculated here already suggest that the dominant pathway may change with the metal identity. For instance, N₂HY dissociation favorability is more likely to become competitive with ER hydrogenation earlier in the hydrogenation sequence the more nitrophilic the metals. Yet, the calculated favorability of ER reactions is also already consistent with the weaker dependence of initial NH₃ turnover frequencies (TOFs) on metal identity compared to the thermocatalytic scenario. With practical implications for computational catalyst screening, TOFs experimentally measured herein for an atmospheric DBD reactor linearly correlate with ΔEᵣₓₙ for the ER hydrogenation reaction H• + HNNH₂* → HNNH₃*. This descriptor may be robust to exact synthesis conditions, as its correlation with TOFs was maintained for earlier TOF data in a sub-atmospheric radio frequency reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adecentralization 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogenation 3aradio waves 3arenewable energy sources 3aspectroscopy 0aOES 0aDBD 0aplasma composition 0aDFT 0aEley−Rideal reactions 0ascaling relationships 0acatalyst descriptor1 aGorky, Fnu1 aCarreon, Maria L.1 aGómez-Gualdrón, Diego A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3237-01990 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 10, no. 6 p.2034-2051dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c056603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245009200171520131700263592002801580650001601608650001601624650002701640650001401667650001301681650002301694650001901717650001201736650001601748650001301764650002101777650001601798650001701814650001401831650001401845650001201859700002301871773011901894856007702013852000902090655001202099IND60703010920221121192728.0200719e20200228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070301092DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110302602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Bosse, Harold  J.P.10aClinical Observations and Treatment Approaches for Scoliosis in Prader–Willi Syndrome  aPrader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is recognized as the first example of genomic imprinting, generally due to a de novo paternal 15q11-q13 deletion. PWS is considered the most common genetic cause of marked obesity in humans. Scoliosis, kyphosis, and kyphoscoliosis are commonly seen in children and adolescents with PWS with a prevalence of spinal deformities cited between 15% to 86%. Childhood risk is 70% or higher, until skeletal maturity, with a bimodal age distribution with one peak before 4 years of age and the other nearing adolescence. As few reports are available on treating scoliosis in PWS, we described clinical observations, risk factors, therapeutic approaches and opinions regarding orthopedic care based on 20 years of clinical experience. Treatments include diligent radiographic screening, starting once a child can sit independently, ongoing physical therapy, and options for spine casting, bracing and surgery, depending on the size of the curve, and the child’s age. Similarly, there are different surgical choices including a spinal fusion at or near skeletal maturity, versus a construct that allows continued growth while controlling the curve for younger patients. A clear understanding of the risks involved in surgically treating children with PWS is important and will be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aattitudes and opinions 3achildhood 3achildren 3agenomic imprinting 3ahuman diseases 3aobesity 3aorthopedics 3apatients 3aphysical therapy 3aradiography 3arisk factors 3ascoliosis 3ascreening 3asurgery1 aButler, Merlin  G.0 tGenes.g2020 Feb. 28, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110302603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245010200158300001600260500002000276500001500296520138700311592002801698650001301726650002001739650002001759650001801779650000901797650001501806651003101821653001501852700002301867700002501890700002101915700001901936700002001955700001901975700002501994700002002019700002002039773013002059856007202189852000902261655001202270IND60587538220221122081018.0180319e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058753822DNAL7 a10.1890/03-52932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoot, J.

Rodents were sampled longitudinally from 1994 to 2001 on 23 trapping webs at 10 locations in the southwestern United States. This study provided an opportunity to apply meta‐analysis techniques to an important ecological question. There were sufficient captures by species on 199 occasions (three consecutive nights) to compare general use of space using multi‐response permutation procedures (MRPP). The MRPP results were then used in meta‐analyses by species to determine if overall effects of spatial clustering of hantavirus‐infected mice as well as categorical effects (elevation, season, site, and state) were present. Based on MRPP analyses, overall spatial clustering of hantavirus‐infected mice was most pronounced for brush mice, followed by the deer mouse. Meta‐analyses indicated significant overall effects of spatial clustering and varying categorical effects (elevation, season, site, state) of infected mice for each species compared. The overlapping space use by rodents might be an important factor affecting the local transmission of several hantaviruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3atrapping 3aReithrodontomys 3aOrthohantavirus 3ameta-analysis 3amice 3aPeromyscus 3aSouthwestern United States 0aHantavirus1 aWilson, Kenneth R.1 aCalisher, Charles H.1 aWagoner, Kent D.1 aAbbott, Ken D.1 aYates, Terry L.1 aKuenzi, Amy J.1 aMorrison, Michael L.1 aMills, James N.1 aBeaty, Barry J.0 tEcological applications.g2005 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.565-574dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-52933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245009700166300001600263520113600279592002801415650001201443650001401455650002701469650002701496650001501523650001401538650003301552650000901585650001801594650002001612651001601632653002601648653002001674653002801694653003301722700002101755700001701776700001201793773010701805856008701912852000901999655001202008IND60545727820221118074548.0160902e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054572782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bing10aSubstance flow analysis of phosphorus within New Zealand and comparison with other countries  ap. 483-492.  aPhosphorus (P) is an essential and non-renewable resource that is estimated to be depleted within the next 70–140years. Increasing P scarcity and environmental pollution requires the development of a proper P management system. One fundamental step is to understand how P flows within society. Thus, a substance flow analysis (SFA) of P was conducted to distinguish and quantify different P flows within New Zealand, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to show where the P flow in New Zealand was significantly different from the most efficient P utilization countries. Aside from having low P recovery, New Zealand imports a significant amount of P, while re-exporting a much smaller fraction of it compared with other countries, resulting in a high accumulation. The SFA analysis showed that although diffuse sources of P pollution pose a greater environmental risk to water bodies, promoting P recovery from point sources of pollution, such as from waste treatment facilities and landfill sites, would still improve the P management efficiency in New Zealand, which could decrease the annual P rock imports by 20%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimports 3alandfills 3amaterial flow analysis 3anonrenewable resources 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3asurface water 3awaste treatment 3aNew Zealand 0aPhosphorus management 0aPhosphorus flow 0aSubstance flow analysis 0aPrincipal component analysis1 aBoiarkina, Irina1 aYoung, Brent1 aYu, Wei0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 527-528 p.483-492dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008200173300001300255520175800268592002802026650001702054650001702071650002202088650002202110650002202132650001502154650002302169650001302192650002302205653001702228653003102245653003102276653001602307653003402323653002502357700001902382773010402401856008502505852000902590655001202599IND50067098220221119074328.0190215e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006709822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2013.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupuch, Angélique14aThe extent of edge effects increases during post-harvesting forest succession  ap. 9-16.  aAs human activities increase landscape fragmentation, edge effects on ecosystem properties are growing at an unprecedented rate. The influence of logging-induced edges on biodiversity can ultimately jeopardize the long-term sustainability of forest management practices. These effects are difficult to quantify, however, because temporal changes in edge influence on residual forests remain poorly understood. We examined vegetation gradients along 17 transects crossing the boundary between stands harvested 5–66years ago and old-growth boreal forests. We estimated the magnitude and distance of edge influence (MEI and DEI, respectively) in uncut old-growth forests, and investigated how these attributes of edge influence changed during the regeneration of adjacent logged stands. Analyses indicated that three types of vegetation gradients were necessary to describe the temporal changes of edge influence on vegetation in uncut forests. No temporal changes were detected for MEI during 66years of forest succession. Conversely, DEI in uncut forests ranged from 0 to 70m, and increased as the adjacent logged stands regenerated. This edge expansion through time, together with persistent differences in vegetation between logged and old-growth forests for at least 66years, raise questions as to whether or not forest management involving fast rotations between logging events can maintain biodiversity. In forest ecosystems where edge habitat widens while vegetation has still not recovered to its typical characteristics, the planning of an adequate combination of rotation time, size and perimeter/area ratio of residual forests becomes critical to achieve the objectives of sustainable management, including regional biodiversity preservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aedge effects 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest management 3aforest succession 3alandscapes 3aold-growth forests 3aplanning 3atemporal variation 0aBiodiversity 0aBlack spruce boreal forest 0aDistance of edge influence 0aEdge effect 0aSustainable forest management 0aVegetation structure1 aFortin, Daniel0 tBiological conservation.g2013 June, v. 162 p.9-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010700168520188800275592002802163650002002191650001202211650001902223650001502242650001202257650001502269650001402284650001102298650002902309650002402338650001602362650002102378651001002399653000802409653003202417653003502449653002302484700001602507700003002523700001702553700001402570700001502584700001502599700001602614773010102630856008602731852000902817655001202826IND60760110120221116143657.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076011012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiang10aDynamic vulnerability of ecological systems to climate changes across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China  aAt present, climate change has brought huge challenges to vegetation and ecosystems.

The coefficients of autocorrelation multiple linear regression are used to construct an ecological vulnerability model from the three dimensions of “exposure-sensitivity-elasticity” to conduct a dynamic assessment of ecological vulnerability. Based on the evaluation results, from 2000 to 2015, the ecologically fragile areas were mainly distributed in the eastern and central areas of the QTP. The ecological fragility of the western region showed obvious discontinuities, with high and low vulnerabilities staggered. The three ecosystems of forest, grassland, and bare land have significant differences in their ecological vulnerability to climate change, showing a clear positive correlation in the three dimensions of exposure, sensitivity, and resilience, but in terms of the contribution rates of the three dimensions. The performance is relatively similar, and the relative relationship between the three dimensions is relatively balanced. The longitude and precipitation of the sample points have a greater impact on ecological vulnerability and its three dimensions, and the impact of precipitation on ecological vulnerability is more significant than that of temperature. This research provides theoretical support for plateau ecological conservation and ecological security under the influence of global climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agrasslands 3alongitude 3amodels 3anet primary productivity 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 3avegetation index 3aChina 0aQTP 0aQinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) 0aEcological vulnerability model 0aDynamic assessment1 aYuan, Ruyue1 aSingh, V.

Herein, a novel gel electrolyte was fabricated by adding lignin/fumed silica composites to the reference aqueous electrolyte (RAE) (2 M ZnSO₄ + 0.2 M MnSO₄) for the purpose of mitigating the aforementioned issues of zinc anodes. Results of linear polarization and chronoamperometry showed that the as-prepared gel electrolyte reduced deterioration on zinc (up to 38.9%) and supported planar zinc deposits. Batteries using this gel electrolyte presented a higher open-circuit voltage after 24 h of monitoring and superior rate performance compared to batteries using the RAE. Most importantly, the discharge capacity of the batteries using this gel electrolyte after 3000 cycles at 1.5 A g–¹ was still up to 106.2 mA h g–¹, which was much higher than that (39.6 mA h g–¹) of the batteries using the RAE. Observation through X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy characterizations of the post-run zinc anodes revealed that this gel electrolyte could strongly inhibit the formation of zinc dendrites and reduce the production of byproducts (3Zn(OH)₂·ZnSO₄·xH₂O) during the operation of the battery. This study is highly significant to the development of advanced aqueous batteries with high safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abatteries 3acorrosion 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3agels 3agreen chemistry 3alignin 3asilica 3azinc 0azinc-ion batteries 0alignocellulosic biomass 0afumed silica 0agel electrolyte 0azinc dendrites1 aWang, Minghai1 aAlam, Md.

Natural gas is a crucial clean energy, and has significant influence on EE. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2017, this research studied the potential improvements in environmental regulation, industrial structure, capital investment, and technological investment of ineffective provinces. In addition, the coupling relationships between natural gas consumption (NGC) and EE are researched, and examined the parameters marginal effect by using quantile regression. The results indicate that, first, there are large inter-provincial differences in the improvement potential. Investment in technology is effective in China’s current development stage, and its improvement can largely promote EE. Second, the dynamic evolution relationship between NGC and EE among provinces has no same patterns. Finally, the coupling degree of EE and NGC shows an upward trend, and the provincial average coupling degree increased by 62.6% from 0.564 in 2000 to 0.917 in 2017, indicates a harmonious coordinate relationship trend between the EE and NGC level. As a result, a series of measures are put forward to better promote the development of provincial NGC and EE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclean energy 3aeco-efficiency 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic investment 3aenvironmental law 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anatural gas 3aregression analysis 3aChina 0aNatural gas consumption 0aCoupling degree 0aThe slack-based model 0aData envelopment analysis 0aDecision making units 0aSBM model 0aIndustrial structure 0aTechnological investment1 aQin, Manman1 aSun, Renjin1 aDong, Kangyin0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Jan., v. 134 p.108485-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1084853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01518naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009800155300002000253520051000273592002800783650002500811650002600836650002300862650002100885650002000906650001400926650001300940700001600953700001600969773012400985856007401109852000901183655001201192IND60640977920221123005819.0190505e20160707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064097792DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra14178a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, L.-Y.10aEnantioselective construction of novel chiral spirooxindoles incorporating a thiazole nucleus  ap. 64474-64481.  aAsymmetric cascade Michael/cyclization reaction between 2-substituted thiazol-4-ones and 2-(2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)malononitriles was investigated using a series of chiral bifunctional hydrogen-bonding organocatalysts.

It is known that process operating conditions such as temperature, heating rate, reactor configuration, moisture content, and pretreatment method can have a significant effect on the observed product distribution. Pyrolysis of carbohydrates in the presence of water at high concentrations can significantly alter the product spectrum and favor the production of specific products at unusually high yields. In this work, we show that pyrolysis of aqueous glucose solutions at high temperatures can result in highly selective production of glycolaldehyde, a C2 hydrocarbon with an aldehyde and hydroxyl functionality, toward direct applications in the food industry or as a chemical building block toward value-added products. A glucose pyrolysis model that was developed previously was expanded to capture the pyrolysis kinetics of glucose at hydrothermal conditions, accurately reproducing the observed product yields for a range of temperatures and feedstock compositions. Dominant reaction families were identified and interrogated to quantify the effect of hydrothermal conditions on the predicted kinetics. High yields of glycolaldehyde were achieved experimentally, with the maximum values observed at moderate temperatures and pure glucose feed. Elevated temperatures and increasing fructose concentrations negatively affected observed glycolaldehyde yields, resulting in increased production of undesired decomposition products in the C1-C3 range. The results of this study include preferred operating conditions toward maximizing the yield of glycolaldehyde as described by a predictive kinetic model that explicitly accounts for the major reactions comprising a complex network taking place and the effect of the operating conditions on their relative contributions to glucose conversion and product yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3achemical species 3afeedstocks 3afood industry 3afructose 3afuels 3aglucose 3aheat 3amodels 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3avalue-added products 3awater content 0aGlucose pyrolysis 0aGlycolaldehyde 0aMechanistic modeling 0aKinetic modeling1 aCoile, Matthew W.1 aTerrian, Joshua M.1 aCollins, Jake W.1 aMartin, Kevin J.1 aBrazdil, James F.1 aBroadbelt, Linda J.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2020 Aug., v. 149 p.104846-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1048463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009800169520080100267592002801068650005801096650001101154650002901165650001501194650002101209650001601230653002001246653002201266653001101288653001901299653001701318700006201335773011801397856008601515852000901601655001201610IND60737722920221117175431.0211219e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073772292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, Jamie10aPlanetary good governance after the Paris Agreement: The case for a global greenhouse gas tax  aThe Paris Agreement and the subsequent IPCC Global Warming of 1.5 °C report signal a need for greater urgency in achieving carbon emissions reductions. In this paper we make a two stage argument for greater use of carbon taxes and for a global approach to this. First, we argue that current modelling tends to lead to a “facts in waiting” approach to technology, which takes insufficient account of uncertainty. Rather than look to the future, carbon taxes that facilitate social redesign are something we have control over now. Second, we argue that the “trade” in “cap and trade” has been ineffective and carbon trading has served mainly as a distraction. Carbon taxes provide a simpler more flexible and pervasive alternative. We conclude with brief discussion of global context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3acarbon 3aenvironmental management 3agovernance 3agreenhouse gases 3auncertainty 0aParis agreement 0aClimate emergency 0aEU ETS 0aCarbon trading 0aCarbon taxes1 aPatomäki, Heikki,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9255-67830 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 292 p.112753-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03860naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245011800176520202900294592002802323650000802351650001702359650002802376650001202404650001702416650001402433650001602447650001402463650000902477650001702486650001302503650001302516650001602529653002202545653001702567653000802584653001502592653001702607700005702624700005502681700005302736700006902789700005702858700002102915700006002936700001802996700002003014700001803034700006103052773009303113856009103206852000903297655001203306IND60740443520221119084402.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074044352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.1208962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathak, Vertika10aMolecular magnetic resonance imaging of Alpha-v-Beta-3 integrin expression in tumors with ultrasound microbubbles  aMicrobubbles (MB) are used as ultrasound (US) contrast agents and can be efficiently targeted against markers of angiogenesis and inflammation. Due to their gas core, MB locally alter susceptibilities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but unfortunately, the resulting contrast is low and not sufficient to generate powerful molecular MRI probes. Therefore, we investigated whether a potent molecular MR agent can be generated by encapsulating superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) in the polymeric shell of poly (n-butylcyanoacrylate) (PBCA) MB and targeted them against αᵥβ₃ integrins on the angiogenic vasculature of 4T1 murine breast carcinomas. SPION-MB consist of an air core and a multi-layered polymeric shell enabling efficient entrapment of SPION. The mean size of SPION-MB was 1.61 ± 0.32 μm. Biotin-streptavidin coupling was employed to functionalize the SPION-MB with cyclic RGDfK (Arg-Gly-Asp) and RADfK (Arg-Ala-Asp) peptides. Cells incubated with RGD-SPION-MB showed enhanced transverse relaxation rates compared with SPION-MB and blocking αᵥβ₃ integrin receptors with excess free cRGDfK significantly reduced RGD-SPION-MB binding. Due to the fast binding of RGD-SPION-MB in vivo, dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI was employed to track their retention in tumors in real-time. Higher retention of RGD-SPION-MB was observed compared with SPION-MB and RAD-SPION-MB. To corroborate our MRI results, molecular US was performed the following day using the destruction-replenishment method. Both imaging modalities consistently indicated higher retention of RGD-SPION-MB in angiogenic vessels compared with SPION-MB and RAD-SPION-MB. Competitive blocking experiments in mice further confirmed that the binding of RGD-SPION-MB to αᵥβ₃ integrin receptors is specific. Overall, this study demonstrates that RGD-SPION-MB can be employed as molecular MR/US contrast agents and are capable of assessing the αᵥβ₃ integrin expression in the neovasculature of malignant tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aangiogenesis 3abiocompatible materials 3abreasts 3ainflammation 3aintegrins 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3amice 3amicrobubbles 3apeptides 3apolymers 3aultrasonics 0aMolecular imaging 0aAngiogenesis 0aMRI 0aUltrasound 0aMicrobubbles1 aNolte, Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3167-71211 aRama, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4445-35411 aRix, Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2624-046X1 aDadfar, Seyed Mohammadali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8621-308X1 aPaefgen, Vera1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3259-41011 aBanala, Srinivas1 aBuhl, Eva Miriam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0627-92281 aWeiler, Marek1 aSchulz, Volkmar1 aLammers, Twan1 aKiessling, Fabian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7341-03990 tBiomaterials.g2021 Aug., v. 275 p.120896-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2021.1208963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009400167300001800261520150100279592002801780650002101808650004401829650002101873650002601894650003001920650002101950650001501971650002501986650001102011650001002022650001902032650000702051650001302058650002102071650002202092650002102114700002002135700002102155700002802176700002702204700001902231700001802250700002502268773010202293856008102395852000902476655001202485IND60523836220221120223833.0160628e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052383622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-016-1717-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapitani, M.

Protein and Mucilage  ap. 1276-1286.  aBiodegradable films of chia by-products (mucilage and protein-rich fraction (PF)) incorporated with clove essential oil (CEO) were obtained and characterized. The effects of polymer concentration (PC; 1.0–3.0 %, w/v) and CEO concentration (0.1–1.0 %, v/v) were evaluated as well as the pH (7–10), using a 2³ factorial design with four central points. The films exhibited moisture values between 11.6 and 52.1 % (d.b.), which decreased (p < 0.05) with increasing PC and CEO. The thickness of the films increased (p < 0.05) with increasing PC. PC and pH influenced (p < 0.05) the lightness (L) and variation in color between red and green (a). The orientation of the color to yellow-blue hues (b) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with increasing PC. Transparency was significantly lower and higher (p < 0.05) than PC and CEO, respectively. The film surface morphology was evaluated using atomic force miscrocope images, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed to study the thermal stability of the films. The displacement and tensile strength were significantly lower (p < 0.05) at higher concentrations of CEO, this variable being the only one with a significant effect. The chemical composition of the films was confirmed utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The proportion of CEO added to the films had a significant influence on antimicrobial activity, inhibiting the growth of both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSalvia hispanica 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanti-infective properties 3abiodegradability 3abyproducts 3achemical composition 3acloves 3acolor 3aessential oils 3apH 3apolymers 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aMatus-Basto, A.1 aRuiz-Ruiz, J.

In this study, we developed an effective technology for treatment of chlortetracycline (CTC), a widely used antibiotic compound. A natural heteroatom-doped spent tea leaves-based biochar (STLB) with excellent adsorption and catalytic property was prepared by simple thermal treatment. An adsorption-promoted persulfate-based advanced oxidation process (PS-AOP) using STLB was studied for CTC removal. The results showed that the as-prepared STLB presented favorable adsorption affinity towards CTC with the maximum adsorption capacity of 627 mg g⁻¹. Meanwhile, CTC enriched on the surface of STLB was good for in-situ decomposition of CTC and nearly 97.4 % of CTC was removed within 30 min of pre-adsorption and 60 min of subsequent degradation. The STLB had excellent recyclability and wide pH tolerance range of 3.0–9.0 in combined pre-adsorption and PS-AOP. Reactive oxygen species analysis confirmed that CTC degradation was mainly due to non-radical (singlet oxygen, ¹O₂) and radicals (SO₄⁻ and OH). This study suggests that STLB is a promising adsorption-enhanced PS activator for the treatment of refractory wastewater and also provides a strategy of waste control by spent tea leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3achlortetracycline 3aheat treatment 3aoxidation 3apH 3asinglet oxygen 3atea 3awastewater 0aSpent tea leaves 0aPersulfate 0aReaction mechanism1 aZheng, Chao-Hong1 aHuang, Yao-Yi1 aChen, Yi-Ren1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8153-13100 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 286 p.131770-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1317703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01294naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008700155300001800242520033200260592002800592650001600620650001900636650001300655700001800668700001200686700001700698700001200715700001100727700001300738773013400751856007400885852000900959655001200968IND60741730320221119064615.0210618e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074173032DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc01607e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ping12aA hybridization-based dual-colorimetric kit for circulating cancer miRNA detection  ap. 6058-6061.  aA dual-colorimetric miRNA detection kit that can simultaneously detect two miRNAs with high sensitivity and selectivity is developed, and the data can be read by the naked eye easily.

Initially described as parasites, and later as potential secretory cells, the prevailing theory is that RCs are leucocyte-like cells that possess pathogen defence capabilities. The current case report involves a novel type of neoplasm discovered in the livers of two adult female white suckers (Catostomus commersonii) that were collected as part of a survey of fish from the St. Mary's River Area of Concern, in which sediment contaminated by polyaromatic hydrocarbons has been associated historically with a high prevalence of liver neoplasms in white suckers. The two tumours in this study were investigated by light microscopy, histochemical staining, immunohistochemical labelling for S100 protein and transmission electron microscopy. The evidence from these investigations suggests that these neoplasms may be derived from de-differentiated RCs or RC precursors. The unanticipated existence of these solid mesenchymal-like tumours may prompt a reassessment of the current dogma regarding the physiological function of RCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatostomus commersonii 3aadults 3acase studies 3afemales 3afish 3alight microscopy 3aliver 3aliver neoplasms 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3astaining 3asurveys 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCatostomus commersonii 0aliver neoplasia 0arodlet cell 0awhite sucker1 aSmith, S.A.1 aJortner, B.S.1 aMcMaster, M.E.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2018 Oct., v. 164 p.1-16dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013000164300001800294520123900312592002801551650002501579650001701604650001801621650001801639650001401657650001001671650001301681650001201694650002801706650001801734650001501752650001201767700001801779700001801797773010201815856008101917852000901998655001202007IND60523836420221121015505.0160628e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052383642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-016-1718-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fengxia10aEffects of High-Pressure Processing with or without Blanching on the Antioxidant and Physicochemical Properties of Mango Pulp  ap. 1306-1316.  aThe effects of high-pressure processing (HPP 300 MPa/15 min, 400 MPa/5 min, 500 MPa/2.5 min, and 600 MPa/1 min) and high-temperature/short-time processing (HTST 110 °C/8.6 s), with or without blanching, on mango pulp were comparatively evaluated in terms of the antioxidant compounds, antioxidant capacity, sugars, and color. Blanching treatment significantly increased the total phenol content and the antioxidant capacity of mango pulp, but did not change the levels of L-ascorbic acid, carotenoids, sugars, and visual color (total color difference, △E < 2.00). Both HPP and HTST treatments significantly increased the total phenol content and antioxidant capacity of un-blanched mango pulp, but no significant changes occurred in the blanched mango pulp. HPP did not affect the levels of L-ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and sugars in mango pulp regardless of blanching. However, HTST significantly decreased the fructose and glucose levels, as well as induced the isomerization of β-carotene, with the increase in 13-cis-β-carotene accompanied by the decrease in all-trans-β-carotene. Moreover, HPP-treated mango pulp consistently showed lower △E values than those HTST-treated samples, regardless of blanching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3ablanching 3acolor 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aisomerization 3amango pulp 3aphenols1 aLiao, Xiaojun1 aWang, Yongtao0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2016 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1306-1316dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-016-1718-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011800170300001800288520113100306592002801437650000801465650002501473650002001498650001701518650001001535700002001545700001501565700001601580700001601596700001401612700001201626700005501638773012801693856008501821852000901906655001201915IND60769014920221122031650.0220301e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076901492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c055712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jinzheng10aHighly Sensitive Glass Nanopipette Sensor Using Composite Probes of DNA-Functionalized Metal–Organic Frameworks  ap. 3701-3707.  aPore structure-based analytical techniques have great potential applications for the detection of biological molecules. However, the sophistication of traditional pore sensors is restricted in their applicability of analytical chemistry due to a lack of effective carrier probes. Here, we used porous coordination network-224 (PCN-224) composite probes in conjunction with a glass nanopipette (GN) as a sensing platform. The sensor exhibits a good fluorescence signal and a change in GN’s ionic current at the same time. Due to the volume exclusion mechanism coming from PCN-224, the detection limit of target DNA reaches 10 fM in a GN with a diameter of up to ca. 260 nm, outperforming a simple probe. The structure of the composite probe is optimized by the probe’s pairing efficiency. Furthermore, the sensor can also discriminate between 1-, 3-, and 5-mismatch DNA sequences and capture the target DNA from a complex mixture. Based on the GN platform, a series of techniques for detecting biomolecules are expected to emerge because of its simplicity, robustness, and universality by incorporating advanced nanoprobes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aglass1 aZhou, Shuailong1 aTan, Shiyi1 aYi, Kangyan1 aJin, Mengya1 aShi, Qian1 aWu, Fen1 aLiu, Nannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9235-26330 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 94, no. 8 p.3701-3707dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c055713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01802naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008300156300001800239520050700257592002800764650001800792650001300810650001500823650002100838650001500859650001700874700002100891700002200912700002300934700002100957700001600978700002700994700001801021700002101039700002301060700002701083700001701110700002401127773013401151856007401285852000901359655001201368IND60741730420221119064517.0210618e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074173042DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc01618k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChida, Koki10aForce-responsive ordered carbonaceous frameworks synthesized from Ni-porphyrin  ap. 6007-6010.  aForce-responsive ordered carbonaceous frameworks (OCFs) are synthesized for the first time.

The OCFs thus synthesized comprise non-stacked graphene sheets, affording a unique mechanical flexibility that enables force-driven reversible phase transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonization 3agraphene 3amicropores 3aphase transition 3aporphyrins 3asurface area1 aYoshii, Takeharu1 aTakahashi, Kazuma1 aYamamoto, Masanori1 aKanamaru, Kazuya1 aOhwada, Mao1 aDeerattrakul, Varisara1 aMaruyama, Jun1 aKamiya, Kazuhide1 aHayasaka, Yuichiro1 aInoue, M.q(Masataka),1 aTani, Fumito1 aNishihara, Hirotomo0 tChemical communications.g2021 June 17, v. 57, no. 49 p.6007-6010dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cc01618k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009900159300002000258520123300278592002801511650003701539650001101576650001401587650001501601650002101616650001301637650001401650650001101664650001901675700001901694700002101713700001301734773012401747856007401871852000901945655001201954IND60640978520221118104311.0190505e20160727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064097852DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra14192g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ting-Wen10aUltralong PtNi alloy nanowires enabled by the coordination effect with superior ORR durability  ap. 71501-71506.  aOne-dimensional (1D) nanostructure with high aspect ratio is expected and experimentally proven as a promising candidate of catalysts with simultaneous high durability and efficiency. Due to the isotropic growth tendency of a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure and the complicated redox-alloying kinetics/thermodynamics; however, the synthesis of Pt-based bimetallic nanowires with a high aspect ratio remains a big challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of ultralong PtNi nanowires via a surfactant-free method by taking advantage of the coordination effect to delicately control the reduction and alloying kinetics. The ORR electrocatalytic activities of the PtNi nanowires present a volcano-like trend depending on the Ni content with the Pt₇₅Ni₂₅ nanowires at the peak position, which can be attributed to the optimized electronic structure on the basis of the XPS characterizations. The electrochemical catalytic comparison between the nanowires and nanopolyhedrons further highlights the superiority of the nanowires as a high durability catalyst. The successful application of the coordination effect method in the fabrication of PtCo nanowires indicates its universality for creating alloy nanowires.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aisotropy 3ananowires 3anickel 3athermodynamics1 aKang, Jianxin,1 aZhang, Dong-Feng1 aGuo, Lin0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 27, v. 6, no. 75 p.71501-71506dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra14192g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245008700205500002200292520104900314592002801363650001601391650002001407650001601427650001101443650001101454650003501465650001801500650001301518650000901531650001701540653003401557653001801591653002101609700001501630700002001645700002001665773009701685856008201782852000901864655001201873IND60580903120221120103852.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058090312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Min-Joon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4243-238110aPurification of functional reprogramming factors in mammalian cell using FLAG -Tag  aPre-press version  aInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology is a method for generating pluripotent stem cells in vitro from fully differentiated cells such as fibroblast cells. The potential applications of iPSC technology in cell therapy and disease modeling could influence current medical practices. Despite current advances in iPSC technology, many patient-derived reprogrammed cells are not suitable for clinical trial because most protocols rely on virus-based techniques, which pose the risk of integration of the viral genome into the chromosomes. Therefore, non-viral methods such as mRNA and protein-based reprogramming are promising alternatives when generating clinically safe iPSCs. In a previous study, we generated human iPSCs using cell extracts with cell penetration peptide (CPP) for the delivery of reprogramming proteins [Kim et al. Cell Stem Cells, 2009]. In here, we show that the expression of reprogramming factors in mammalian cells and subsequent purification of these factors by FLAG-Tag could reprogram fibroblasts into iPSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosomes 3aclinical trials 3afibroblasts 3agenome 3ahumans 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3arisk 3atherapeutics 0aInduced pluripotent stem cell 0aReprogramming 0aProtein delivery1 aKim, HaRam1 aO'Reilly, Carla1 aKim, Chun-Hyung0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007300148245010100221520073100322592002801053650002501081650001501106650001501121650002001136653001901156653002301175653001101198653001401209653001401223773011201237856008301349852000901432655001201441IND60696237520221118031230.0220606e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069623752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2020.1159202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKal-Koshvandi, Afsaneh Taheri1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5904-615910aRecent advances in optical biosensors for the detection of cancer biomarker α-fetoprotein (AFP)  aα-fetoprotein (AFP) as a target marker refers to albuminoid proteins, which is a tumor-related fetal protein, increasing the AFP concentration leads to various diseases, including liver cancer.

Gasification of black liquor was carried out under sub- and supercritical conditions, varying the black liquor feed composition (0.10, 2.55 and 5.00 wb%) and temperature (350, 425 and 500 °C). Liquid products were identified by high resolution mass spectrometry (FT-Orbitrap MS) and compounds belonging to classes O₃ and O₄ were found to be the most representative in the products of reactions performed at 500 °C. The mass spectra results also revealed the overall selectivity of reactions, where decarboxylation and demethoxylation reactions were favored under subcritical and supercritical conditions, respectively. Among the gaseous products, hydrogen and methane were produced with maximum of 69.04 and 28.75 mol%, respectively, at 2.55 wb% and 425 °C. The proposed thermodynamic modelling of the reaction system satisfactorily predicted the gas phase behavior of the system. In the economic analysis, the simulated conditions indicated that the main energy requirements for a scaled-up black liquor gasification process are related to the necessary heat exchangers and pressurizing of the black liquor solution. Furthermore, the cost of the black liquor gasification is around 0.06 US$ per kg of feed stream. Liquid and gaseous products from gasification could be obtained at a cost of 56.64 US$ and 3.35 US$ per tonne of stream, respectively. Therefore, black liquor gasification is an interesting route for obtaining combustible gases and value-added bioproducts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3adecarboxylation 3aeconomic analysis 3aenergy 3afeed composition 3agasification 3aheat 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3amethane 3apulp and paper industry 3astreams 3atemperature 3avalue added 3awaste liquors 0aBlack liquor 0aFT-Orbitrap MS 0aSupercritical water gasification (SCWG)1 aCarregosa, Jhonattas d.C.1 aWisniewski Jr, Alberto1 aFreitas, Antonio C.D.1 aGuirardello, Reginaldo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9458-08081 aFerreira-Pinto, Leandro1 aBonfim-Rocha, Lucas1 aJegatheesan, Veeriah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8038-48541 aCardozo-Filho, Lucio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1764-99790 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 286 p.131774-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1317743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008600176300001800262520158300280592002801863650001601891650001101907650002601918650002801944650001101972650000901983650002401992650001902016650001602035700003102051773010202082856008102184852000902265655001202274IND60523836820221120223907.0160628e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052383682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-016-1723-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiguemoto, Érica Sayuri10aDielectric Properties of Cloudy Apple Juices Relevant to Microwave Pasteurization  ap. 1345-1357.  aContinuous flow microwave heating is an emerging technology that brings advantages to the pasteurization of food products such as fruit juices. In order to correctly design the microwave cavity and applicator tube, knowing the dielectric properties of the product is important. The relative electrical permittivity describes the capacity to store electrical energy, while the dielectric loss factor describes the ability to dissipate energy as heat. The penetration depth of microwaves depends on these properties and on the field frequency. In this work, the dielectric properties and electrical conductivity of cloudy apple juices, obtained from different varieties of apples (Gala, Fuji, Granny Smith, and Red Delicious) and from an industrial plant (Gala), were determined from 500 to 3000 MHz and temperatures between 10 and 90 °C. Penetration depth was also calculated, and all results were correlated with temperature for commercial frequencies of 915 and 2450 MHz. At these frequencies, apple variety showed little influence and the permittivity decreased almost linearly with temperature. The loss factor curves showed a minimum around 40 °C at 915 MHz and were slightly smaller for juices with lower conductivity. At 2450 MHz, the loss factor varied between 7 and 18 with a negative temperature effect, which indicates that thermal runaway should not be a problem. The penetration depth ranged from 33 to 58 mm at 915 MHz and from 9 to 23 mm at 2450 MHz, depending on temperature and variety, which is useful information for the design of applicator tubes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapple juice 3aapples 3adielectric properties 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3aheat 3amicrowave treatment 3apasteurization 3atemperature1 aGut, Jorge Andrey Wilhelms0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2016 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1345-1357dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-016-1723-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010800155300001800263520050700281592002800788650001100816650001800827650001200845650001700857650001700874650002200891700001400913700001600927700001800943700002000961700001700981700001400998700001301012700001601025700001501041773013401056856007401190852000901264655001201273IND60741730720221119064720.0210618e20210617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074173072DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc01655e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Ziyi10aLithium doped nickel oxide nanocrystals with a tuned electronic structure for oxygen evolution reaction  ap. 6070-6073.  aThe electronic structure of catalysts influences the electrocatalytic behavior.

In this work, a simple PEC aptasensor construction strategy based on a sulfur-doped g-C₃N₄ (SCN)/n-GaN heterostructure photoelectrode was proposed. The SCN/n-GaN heterostructure can be formed through self-assembly in solution since SCN can be uniformly dispersed in solution. In addition, as a dual-function mediate, an aptamer can be fixed on an SCN substrate automatically because of the good adsorption performance of SCN. Therefore, tedious steps of PEC electrode preparation and the fixing of recognition elements were both avoided. Compared with the traditional ones, the construction difficulty and time cost of the prepared PEC aptasensors are greatly reduced. The simplified experimental process improves the stability and reproducibility of the aptasensor. Finally, tetracycline (TET) was used as a model target to verify the sensing performance of the proposed PEC strategy. TET can consume the photogenerated holes of the SCN/n-GaN heterostructure, promote carrier migration, and result in the change in the photocurrent. The linear relationship between the change in the photocurrent intensity and the TET concentration can be used to detect TET. The aptasensor has a linear range of 0.10–10.0 nmol L–¹ and the detection limit is 0.030 nmol L–¹ (3S/N). The aptasensor was applied to the detection of TET in milk samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaptasensors 3adetection limit 3aelectric current 3amilk 3aoligonucleotides 3aphotoelectrodes 3atetracycline1 aRong, Xiujun1 aZhang, Yue1 aLuo, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1480-06771 aQiu, Bin1 aWang, Jian1 aLin, Zhenyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7890-68120 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Feb. 17, v. 94, no. 8 p.3735-3742dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c001183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006600164300001400230520091200244592002801156650003401184650001001218650001401228650001501242650000901257650002101266650002501287650001001312650001201322650001501334650002001349653000801369653003901377653002501416653001901441700001401460700001701474700001801491773011001509856008301619852000901702655001201711IND60619076020221118015116.0190312e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061907602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, C.-H.10aEpithelial-Myoepithelial Carcinoma in a Canine Salivary Gland  ap. 52-56.  aA 7-year-old male cavalier King Charles spaniel was presented with a cervical subcutaneous mass. The mass had a multilobular growth pattern and each individual lobule contained ductal epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells surrounding the ductal cells. Immunohistochemically, the ductal epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CAM5.2 and the myoepithelial cells were positive for α-smooth muscle actin and p63. Both types of cells were positive for CK14, a myoepithelial cell marker. Ultrastructurally, the ductal epithelial cells were attached by desmosomes and contained abundant intracytoplasmic tonofilaments. Some ductal epithelial cells contained myofilaments characteristic of myoepithelial cells. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma was made. It is presumed that the tumour originated from an intercalated duct in a parotid salivary gland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCavalier King Charles Spaniel 3aactin 3acarcinoma 3adesmosomes 3adogs 3aepithelial cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amales 3amuscles 3amyofibrils 3asalivary glands 0adog 0aepithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma 0aimmunohistochemistry 0asalivary gland1 aShiwa, N.1 aSumimoto, J.1 aKimitsuki, K.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2018 Nov., v. 165 p.52-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014800167520131900315592002801634650001101662650001901673650001101692650002001703650003201723650003001755650002901785650002601814650001101840650002901851650002701880651001001907653001801917653002201935653002101957653002301978653002302001700001502024700001602039700005702055700005702112773011802169856008602287852000902373655001202382IND60737723820221117175419.0211219e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073772382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jiajia10aExploring the role of green innovation and investment in energy for environmental quality: An empirical appraisal from provincial data of China  aTo better analyze China's carbon neutrality target, this study investigates the effect of green innovation and investment in the energy industry on China's provincial and regional data from 1995 to 2017. Using Westerlund and Edgerton's panel cointegration test, the authors found a stable long-run relationship between CO₂ emissions and its determinants. We found that under major structural breaks at the local, regional, and global levels, such as the East Asian crises of 1997, the financial crises of 2007–2008, China's RMB exchange rate reform announced on August 11, 2015, and mild recession in 2001, CO₂ emissions, income, green innovation, renewable energy use, and energy industry investment are cointegrated. The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is valid. In the long run, income, environmental innovation, investment in the energy industry, and renewable energy consumption are key contributors in explaining CO₂ emissions. The empirical evidence from augmented mean group (AMG) is consistent with the estimates of CS-ARDL. Concerning practical implications, the findings suggest that there is a need to switch the Chinese economy to more sustainable sources of energy, a viable solution to abate environmental degradation. China should introduce and shift investments to green innovation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aenergy industry 3aenvironmental Kuznets curve 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental quality 3aincome 3arenewable energy sources 3asustainable technology 3aChina 0aCO2 emissions 0aCarbon neutrality 0aGreen innovation 0aLow carbon economy 0aEnergy Investments1 aZhou, Yong1 aAli, Shahid1 aShahzad, Umer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7010-40541 aCui, Lianbiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8693-508X0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 292 p.112779-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1127793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245007100165300001600236506002800252520108100280592002801361506003701389650002101426650002301447650001101470650001601481650001501497650001001512650001901522650000901541650001701550650001301567650001301580650000801593650001001601650000901611650001201620650001301632650001001645650001401655653002201669653002001691653002201711653001301733653001501746700001801761700002001779700001901799773010301818856007901921852000902000655001202009IND60671845320221207063819.0200612e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067184532DNAL7 a10.1515/opag-2019-00512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWamelink, G.W.W.10aCrop growth and viability of seeds on Mars and Moon soil simulants  ap. 509-516.  aResource is Open Access  aIf humans are going to establish a base on the Moon or on Mars they will have to grow their own crops. An option is to use Lunar and Martian regolith. These regoliths are not available for plant growth experiments, therefore NASA has developed regolith simulants. The major goal of this project was to cultivate and harvest crops on these Mars and Moon simulants. The simulants were mixed with organic matter to mimic the addition of residues from earlier harvests. Ten different crops, garden cress, rocket, tomato, radish, rye, quinoa, spinach, chives, pea and leek were sown in random lines in trays. Nine of the ten species grew well with the exception of spinach. It was possible to harvest edible parts for nine out of ten crops. The total biomass production per tray was highest for the Earth control and Mars soil simulant and differed significantly from Moon soil simulant. The seeds produced by three species were tested for germination (radish, rye and cress). The germination on Moon soil simulant was significantly lower in radish than for the Earth control soil.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLepidium sativum 3abiomass production 3achives 3agermination 3aharvesting 3aleeks 3aorganic matter 3apeas 3aplant growth 3aradishes 3aregolith 3arye 3aseeds 3asoil 3aspinach 3atomatoes 3atrays 3aviability 0aExtra-terrestrial 0aFood production 0aGrowth experiment 0aRegolith 0aExobiology1 aFrissel, J.Y.1 aKrijnen, W.H.J.1 aVerwoert, M.R.0 tOpen Agriculture.g2019 Oct. 02, v. 4, no. 1 p.509-516dDe GruyterwJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2019-00513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012800164520143000292592002801722650001501750650001101765650002701776650002601803650001701829650001201846650002001858650000701878650001701885650001701902650002201919650001901941650001901960650002001979650002001999653001602019653002702035653001802062653003802080653003602118653003302154700001202187700001402199700001902213700001802232700001402250700001102264700005602275773011402331856008602445852000902531655001202540IND60656120420221119073458.0191214e20200105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065612042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1209612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ting10aIntegrating cationic metal-organic frameworks with ultrafiltration membrane for selective removal of perchlorate from Water  aWe design a novel cationic metal-organic framework hybrid ultrafiltration polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PVA/Cu-iMOFs/PVDF-0.05) and report its unique capture of aqueous perchlorate (ClO4−) at ppm-level. This membrane outperformed traditional adsorption materials and exhibited a specific affinity toward ClO4− in the presence of various competing anions at greater levels (up to a concentration ratio of 20). In the batch experiment, the ClO4− removal ratio reached 99.6% over a wide pH range (3˜10). Membrane filtration by using a 12.56 cm2 PVA/Cu-iMOFs/PVDF-0.05 membrane could effectively treat 4.71 L of ClO4−-contaminated water before breakthrough occurred, while maintaining a satisfactory permeability (˜627.32 L/(m2 h bar)) and antifouling property. The exhausted membrane could easily be regenerated in aminoethanesulfonic acid solution for repeated use with a negligible decrease in capacity. Moreover, the membrane showed excellent long-term stability in a cross-flow filtration process due to the amido bond between the Cu-iMOFs and membrane surface as well as the "protection" of polyvinyl alcohol. Selective and reversible ion-exchange between the sulfonic acid (R-SO3) ligands of Cu-iMOFs and tetrahedral oxo-anionic species was verified to be the pathway for ClO4− trapping. Thus, other problematic elements that also occur in tetrahedral form in water can be removed by this method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aantifouling activities 3acoordination polymers 3aion exchange 3aligands 3amicrofiltration 3apH 3aperchlorates 3apermeability 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asulfonic acids 3athermoplastics 3aultrafiltration 3awater pollution 0aPerchlorate 0aSelective ion-exchange 0aReversibility 0aCationic metal-organic frameworks 0aHybrid ultrafiltration membrane 0aTetrahedral heavy oxo-anions1 aRen, Yi1 aZhai, Shu1 aZhang, Weiming1 aZhang, Wenbin1 aHua, Ming1 aLv, Lu1 aPan, Bingcai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3626-15390 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Jan. 05, v. 381 p.120961-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1209613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01200naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011400158300001600272520027300288592002800561653001500589653001600604653001400620653001600634653001400650653001600664653001500680773011900695856007500814852000900889655001200898IND60129443220221121152718.0151124e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012944322DNAL7 a10.3956/2012-38.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellamy, C.

However, that risk is rarely tracked along different production steps, e.g., from pigs at farm to meat. To close that gap, we performed a prospective study in four conventional and two organic farms from the moment pigs entered the farm until meat sampling at slaughter. Antimicrobial use was recorded (0 to 11 agents). Antimicrobial susceptibility (AMS) against 26 antibiotics, including critically important substances, was tested by microdilution, and tetA-tetB-sulI-sulII-strA-strB-bla-CTXM-qacEΔ1 were included in PCR-genotyping. From 244 meat samples of 122 pigs, 54 samples (22.1%) from 45 animals were positive for E. coli (n = 198). MICs above the breakpoint/ECOFF occurred for all antibiotics except meropenem. One isolate from organic farming was markedly resistant against beta-lactams including fourth-generation cefalosporines. AMS patterns differed remarkably between isolates from one piece of meat, varying from monoresistance to 16-fold multiresistance. Amplicon-typing revealed high similarity between isolates at slaughter and on farm. Prior pig lots andeven the farmer might serve as reservoirs for E. coli isolated from meat at slaughter. However, AMS phenotyping and genotyping indicate that antimicrobial resistance in E. coli is highly dynamic, impairing reliable prediction of health risks from findings along the production chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3afarmers 3afarms 3agenotyping 3ameropenem 3aphenotype 3apork 3aprediction 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3aslaughter 3aswine1 aKronfeld, Hanna 1 aBauer, Johann 1 aSchwaiger, Karin 1 aHölzel, Christina 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 23, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100814853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245018100170300001800351520126400369592002801633650002501661650001601686650001301702650002801715650001801743650002201761650001301783650001401796650001701810650001501827650003001842650001601872700005901888773012401947856008302071852000902154655001202163IND60729820020221123024224.0210731e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072982002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-021-06142-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamavandi, Narges10aAssociation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (GSTM1 and GSTT 1), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) genetic polymorphisms with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  ap. 1225-1231.  aPrevious studies have revealed that genetic polymorphisms of the Glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 (GSTM1 and GSTT1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are associated with the presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in many populations. This study was conducted to investigate the association of the GSTM1, GSTT1, TNF-α rs1800629, and IL-6 rs1800795 with NAFLD in the general Iranian population. A case-control analysis included 242 NAFLD patients and 324 healthy controls from Iranian adults. After the physical examination, the genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction(PCR). The GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, TNF-α AG/AA, and IL-6 CG/CC genotypes were deemed to be high-risk. The null allele of GSTM1 and A allele of TNF-α were more frequent in NAFLD patients even after Bonferroni’s correction (P values<0.005, adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.66 and 2.02; 95% confidence intervals (CI), (1.18–2.32) and (1.34–3.34), respectively. The IL-6 CC/CG genotype association with NAFLD was not significant after correction (P value = 0.04) Polymorphisms of xenobiotic and pro-inflammatory genes are associated with NAFLD in the Iranian population and seem to be a useful tool for NAFLD prevention and care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical examination 3afatty liver 3agenotype 3aglutathione transferase 3ainterleukin-6 3amolecular biology 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3anull alleles 3aodds ratio 3apolymerase chain reaction 3axenobiotics1 aZeinali, Sirous1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2080-95820 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.1225-1231dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06142-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005500155245019700210300001400407520104000421592002801461650002201489650002601511650002401537650002301561650001401584650001101598650001101609650001101620650001401631650001201645650002201657650002501679650002201704650001301726650001301739650001101752653002601763653001601789653002201805653002001827653003001847700001901877700001901896700002201915700001901937700001501956700002701971773011701998856009002115852000902205655001202214IND60622947120221116172551.0190408e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062294712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2018.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aḢăbibă,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2605-295510aEvaluation of biocontrol potential of epiphytic yeast against postharvest Penicillium digitatum rot of stored Kinnow fruit (Citrus reticulata) and their effect on its physiochemical properties  ap. 38-48.  aTwenty five isolates of epiphytic yeasts were isolated from healthy surface of tomato, mango, lemon, orange, grape fruit and green chili and evaluated for their potential against postharvest Penicillium digitatum decay of kinnow fruits.

Some authors evaluate the potential impact of the abnormal body mass index (BMI) and abnormal lipid profile on the vulnerability to migraine and its severity. Regarding the fact that these factors have the inseparable connection with the risk of cardiovascular diseases, some papers bring the hypotheses of the probable role of migraine in the progression of such conditions. Some research suggests a link between abnormal BMI and a risk of migraine and its more severe course. When it comes to a lipid panel in migraine, the most frequent abnormalities are elevated levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol which may contribute to the increased risk of migraine. High-density lipoprotein and triglycerides levels were not contributory in most of the papers. We present the latest views on the mentioned problems focusing on differences in results of the particular works.  aPublisher supplied data 0amigrena 0aBMI 0alipidy 0acholesterol 0atriglicerydy choroby układu krążenia 0amigraine 0aBMI 0alipids 0acholesterol 0atriglycerides 0acardiovascular diseases1 aJanoska, Marlena1 aŚwić, Paweł1 aDomitrz, Izabela0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2013, v. 47 p.572-576dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Society of Neurology and the Polish Association of Neurosurgeonsx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5114/ninp.2013.390753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012500176520224100301592002802542650002202570650001602592650002002608650002002628650001702648650001902665650001402684650002202698650001402720650001302734650001602747650002602763650002302789650001602812650003002828650001502858650002102873650001502894650002202909700001902931700001802950700002702968700001602995700001703011700002303028700002703051700001703078773012803095856008703223852000903310655001203319IND60791037820221121112604.0220826e20220731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079103782DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100815482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMemon, Fareed Uddin10aChicken Gut Microbiota Responses to Dietary Bacillus subtilis Probiotic in the Presence and Absence of Eimeria Infection  aCoccidiosis is a well-known poultry disease that causes the severe destruction of the intestinal tract, resulting in reduced growth performance and immunity, disrupted gut homeostasis and perturbed gut microbiota. Supplementation of probiotics were explored to play a key role in improving growth performance, enhancing innate and adaptive immunity, maintaining gut homeostasis and modulating gut microbiota during enteric infection. This study was therefore designed to investigate the chicken gut whole microbiota responses to Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) probiotic feeding in the presence as well as absence of Eimeria infection. For that purpose, 84 newly hatched chicks were assigned into four groups, including (1) non-treated non-challenged control group (CG − ET), (2) non-treated challenged control group (CG + ET), (3) B. subtilis-fed non-challenged group (BS − ET) and (4) B. subtilis-fed challenged group (BS + ET). CG + ET and BS + ET groups were challenged with Eimeria tenella (E. tenella) on 21 day of housing. Our results for Alpha diversity revealed that chickens in both infected groups (CG + ET and BS + ET) had lowest indexes of Ace, Chao 1 and Shannon, while highest indexes of Simpson were found in comparison to non-challenged groups (CG − ET and BS − ET). Firmicutes was the most affected phylum in all experimental groups following Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota, which showed increased abundance in both non-challenged groups, whereas Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota affected both challenged groups. The linear discriminant analysis effect size method (lEfSe) analysis revealed that compared to the CG + ET group, supplementation of probiotic in the presence of Eimeria infection increased the abundance of some commensal genera, included Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, Romboutsia, Subdoligranulum, Bacillus, Turicibacter and Weissella, with roles in butyrate production, anti-inflammation, metabolic reactions and the modulation of protective pathways against pathogens. Collectively, these findings evidenced that supplementation of B. subtilis probiotic was positively influenced with commensal genera, thereby alleviating the Eimeria-induced intestinal disruption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aClostridium 3aCorynebacterium 3aEimeria tenella 3aEnterococcus 3aProteobacteria 3aWeissella 3aadaptive immunity 3abutyrates 3achickens 3acoccidiosis 3adiscriminant analysis 3agrowth performance 3ahomeostasis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3apoultry diseases 3aprobiotics 3aspecies diversity1 aYang, Yunqiao 1 aZhang, Geyin 1 aLeghari, Imdad Hussain1 aLv, Feifei 1 aWang, Yuhan 1 aLaghari, Farooque 1 aKhushk, Farooque Ahmed1 aSi, Hongbin 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 31, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100815483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014200162300001600304520027800320592002800598650001300626650001500639650001900654650001900673653002300692653001300715653001800728653001900746653001300765700002000778773011900798856007500917852000900992655001201001IND60129443520221121010651.0151124e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012944352DNAL7 a10.3956/2011-07.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttasopa, Korrawat10aRedescription, subgeneric position and distribution of the Oriental burrowing bee, Amegilla fimbriata (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Anthophorini)  ap. 281-291.  aAmegilla fimbriata (Smith, 1897) (Hymenoptera; Apidae; Anthophorini) is redescribed with detailed study of the male genitalia.

We show that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) depleted of Tet1 and/or Tet2 by RNAi exhibit short telomeres and chromosomal instability, concomitant with reduced telomere recombination. Tet1 and Tet2 double-knockout ESCs also display short telomeres but to a lesser extent. Notably, Tet1/2/3 triple-knockout ESCs show heterogeneous telomere lengths and increased frequency of telomere loss and chromosomal fusion. Mechanistically, Tets depletion or deficiency increases Dnmt3b and decreases 5hmC levels, resulting in elevated methylation levels at sub-telomeres. Consistently, knockdown of Dnmt3b or addition of 2i (MAPK and GSK3β inhibitors), which also inhibits Dnmt3b, reduces telomere shortening, partially rescuing Tet1/2 deficiency. Interestingly, Tet1/2 double or Tet1/2/3 triple knockout in ESCs consistently upregulates Zscan4, which may counteract telomere shortening. Together, Tet enzymes play important roles in telomere maintenance and chromosomal stability of ESCs by modulating sub-telomeric methylation levels.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTet 0aDNA methylation 0aembryonic stem cells 0atelomere 0apluripotency 0aDnmt3b 0aZscan41 aGuo, Renpeng1 aWang, Hua1 aYe, Xiaoying1 aZhou, Zhongcheng1 aDan, Jiameng1 aWang, Haiying1 aGong, Peng1 aDeng, Wei1 aYin, Yu1 aMao, ShiQing1 aWang, Lingbo1 aDing, Junjun1 aLi, Jinsong1 aKeefe, David L.1 aDawlaty, Meelad M.1 aWang, Jianlong1 aXu, Guoliang,1 aLiu, Lin0 tCell Reports.g2016 May 24, v. 15 p.1809-1821dElsevier Inc.x2211-12477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.04.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245011200191300001600303520151500319592002801834650002101862650002901883650002301912650002301935650002001958650001601978650002001994650002102014650002402035650001202059650005802071650006102129650003702190650002102227650001002248650001102258650001702269650005502286650006602341650004402407650002602451700002802477700002602505700002702531773009102558856008402649852000902733655001202742IND50068125320221119114852.0141112e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006812532DNAL7 a238903482pmid7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2013.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasileiou, Ioanna10aCurrent clinical status on the preventive effects of cranberry consumption against urinary tract infections  ap. 595-607.  aUrinary tract infections (UTIs) represent a common and quite costly medical problem, primarily affecting the female population which may be due to a shorter urethra. The bacterium Escherichia coli are mainly responsible for most uncomplicated UTIs. Cranberry antibacterial effects have widely been studied in vitro, and laboratory and clinical studies have also been performed to elucidate the mechanisms of cranberry actions and the clinical benefits of cranberry consumption against UTIs. The present review aimed to summarize the proposed mechanisms of cranberry actions against UTIs and the clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of supplementing cranberry products in different subpopulations. Taking into consideration the existing data, cranberry consumption may prevent bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells which reduces the development of UTI. Cranberry consumption could also decreasing UTI related symptoms by suppressing inflammatory cascades as an immunologic response to bacteria invasion. The existing clinical trials suggest that the beneficial effects of cranberry against UTIs seem to be prophylactic by preventing the development of infections; however, they exert low effectiveness in populations at increased risk for contracting UTIs. Additional well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials that use standardized cranberry products are strongly justified in order to determine the efficiency of cranberry on the prevention of UTIs in susceptible populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3aat-risk population 3abacterial adhesion 3aclinical trials 3acranberries 3aimmune response 3ain vitro studies 3amechanism of action 3aurethra 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBacterial Adhesionxdrug effects 2aEscherichia coli 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Preparationsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aUrinary Tract Infectionsxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aUrotheliumxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aVaccinium macrocarpon1 aKatsargyris, Athanasios1 aTheocharis, Stamatios1 aGiaginis, Constantinos0 tNutrition research.g2013 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.595-607dElsevier Inc.x0271-53177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2013.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245012100208300001100329500001100340506007600351520176000427592002802187506003702215650001902252650001102271650002202282650001602304700002202320700003002342700002102372700001902393700002302412700002502435700001702460700002202477700002302499700002002522700006102542773015902603856008102762852000902843655001202852IND60590554820221207050136.0190314e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059055482DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-017-0636-22doi7 aPMC58062712pmcid7 a294220512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowd, Kieran P.12aA systematic literature review of reviews on techniques for physical activity measurement in adults: a DEDIPAC study  ap. 15.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe links between increased participation in Physical Activity (PA) and improvements in health are well established. As this body of evidence has grown, so too has the search for measures of PA with high levels of methodological effectiveness (i.e. validity, reliability and responsiveness to change). The aim of this “review of reviews” was to provide a comprehensive overview of the methodological effectiveness of currently employed measures of PA, to aid researchers in their selection of an appropriate tool. A total of 63 review articles were included in this review, and the original articles cited by these reviews were included in order to extract detailed information on methodological effectiveness.Self-report measures of PA have been most frequently examined for methodological effectiveness, with highly variable findings identified across a broad range of behaviours. The evidence-base for the methodological effectiveness of objective monitors, particularly accelerometers/activity monitors, is increasing, with lower levels of variability observed for validity and reliability when compared to subjective measures. Unfortunately, responsiveness to change across all measures and behaviours remains under-researched, with limited information available.Other criteria beyond methodological effectiveness often influence tool selection, including cost and feasibility. However, researchers must be aware of the methodological effectiveness of any measure selected for use when examining PA. Although no “perfect” tool for the examination of PA in adults exists, it is suggested that researchers aim to incorporate appropriate objective measures, specific to the behaviours of interests, when examining PA in free-living environments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaccelerometers 3aadults 3aphysical activity 3aresearchers1 aSzeklicki, Robert1 aMinetto, Marco Alessandro1 aMurphy, Marie H.1 aPolito, Angela1 aGhigo, E.q(Ezio),1 avan der Ploeg, Hidde1 aEkelund, Ulf1 aMaciaszek, Janusz1 aStemplewski, Rafal1 aTomczak, Maciej1 aDonnelly, Alan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6874-09910 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2018 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.15-15dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-017-0636-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03605naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003200152245012500184520222900309592002802538650001802566650002302584650001302607650000902620650001002629650001702639650003002656650001202686650001402698650002202712650001102734651001202745700002302757700001902780700001802799700002102817700002102838700003202859700002302891700002102914773012802935856008703063852000903150655001203159IND60791038020221120224723.0220826e20220731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079103802DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100815502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemieux-Labonté, Virginie 10aProximate Drivers of Population-Level Lizard Gut Microbial Diversity: Impacts of Diet, Insularity, and Local Environment  aDiet has been suggested to be an important driver of variation in microbiota composition in mammals. However, whether this is a more general phenomenon and how fast changes in gut microbiota occur with changes in diet remains poorly understood. Forty-nine years ago, ten lizards of the species Podarcis siculus were taken from the island of Pod Kopište and introduced onto the island of Pod Mrčaru (Croatia). The introduced population underwent a significant dietary shift, and their descendants became omnivorous (consuming up to 80% plant material during summer). Variation in their gut microbiota has never been investigated. To elucidate the possible impact on the gut microbiota of this rapid change in diet, we compared the microbiota (V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene) of P. siculus from Pod Mrčaru, Pod Kopište, and the mainland. In addition, we explored other drivers of variation in gut microbiota including insularity, the population of origin, and the year of sampling. Alpha-diversity analyses showed that the microbial diversity of omnivorous lizards was higher than the microbial diversity of insectivorous lizards. Moreover, omnivorous individuals harbored significantly more Methanobrevibacter. The gut microbial diversity of insectivorous lizards was nonetheless more heterogeneous. Insectivorous lizards on the mainland had different gut microbial communities than their counterparts on the island of Pod Kopište. Bacillus and Desulfovibrio were more abundant in the gut microbiota from insular lizards compared to mainland lizards. Finally, we showed that the population of origin was also an important driver of the composition of the gut microbiota. The dietary shift that occurred in the introduced population of P. siculus has had a detectable impact on the gut microbiota, but other factors such as insularity and the population of origin also contributed to differences in the gut microbial composition of these lizards, illustrating the multifactorial nature of the drivers of variation in gut microbiota. Overall, our data show that changes in gut microbiota may take place on ecological timescales. Yet, diet is only one of many factors driving variation in gut microbiota across populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfovibrio 3aMethanobrevibacter 3aPodarcis 3adiet 3agenes 3ainsectivores 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alizards 3aomnivores 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3aCroatia1 aVigliotti, Chloé 1 aTadić, Zoran,1 aWehrle, Beck 1 aLopez, Philippe 1 aBapteste, Éric,1 aLapointe, François-Joseph 1 aGerman, Donovan P.1 aHerrel, Anthony 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 31, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100815503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03821naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245014200164300001600306520217400322592002802496653002702524653004802551653002002599653002502619653001602644653004502660653003302705653003202738653003302770653002002803653002102823653002102844653002202865653001202887653001002899653002402909653002202933653003002955700002202985700002203007700002403029700002403053700002503077773013903102856007703241852000903318655001203327IND60648261720221121005249.0190627e20180711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064826172DNAL7 a10.1093/biolre/ioy1652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHale, Matthew D.10aEmbryonic estrogen exposure recapitulates persistent ovarian transcriptional programs in a model of environmental endocrine disruption†  ap. 149-161.  aEstrogens regulate key aspects of sexual determination and differentiation, and exposure to exogenous estrogens can alter ovarian development. Alligators inhabiting Lake Apopka, FL, are historically exposed to estrogenic endocrine disrupting contaminants and are characterized by a suite of reproductive abnormalities, including altered ovarian gene expression and abated transcriptional responses to follicle stimulating hormone. Here, we test the hypothesis that disrupting estrogen signaling during gonadal differentiation results in persistent alterations to ovarian gene expression that mirror alterations observed in alligators from Lake Apopka. Alligator embryos collected from a reference site lacking environmental contamination were exposed to estradiol-17 beta or a nonaromatizable androgen in ovo and raised to the juvenile stage. Changes in basal and gonadotropin-challenged ovarian gene expression were then compared to Apopka juveniles raised under identical conditions. Assessing basal transcription in untreated reference and Apopka animals revealed a consistent pattern of differential expression of key ovarian genes. For each gene where basal expression differed across sites, in ovo estradiol treatment in reference individuals recapitulated patterns observed in Apopka alligators. Among those genes affected by site and estradiol treatment were three aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) isoforms, suggesting that developmental estrogen signaling might program sensitivity to AHR ligands later in life. Treatment with gonadotropins stimulated strong ovarian transcriptional responses; however, the magnitude of responses was not strongly affected by steroid hormone treatment. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that precocious estrogen signaling in the developing ovary likely underlies altered transcriptional profiles observed in a natural population exposed to endocrine disrupting contaminants. Summary Sentence Precocious estrogen signaling in the developing alligator embryo induces persistent shifts in ovarian transcriptional profiles that recapitulate effects observed in animals naturally exposed to environmental endocrine disruptors.  aPublisher supplied data 0aanti-Mullerian hormone 0adevelopmental origins of health and disease 0adifferentiation 0aendocrine disruptors 0aenvironment 0aenvironmental contaminants and toxicants 0aestradiol/estradiol receptor 0aandrogens/androgen receptor 0afollicle-stimulating hormone 0agene expression 0agonadal function 0agonadal steroids 0ahormone receptors 0ahormone 0aovary 0asex differentiation 0asex determination 0aaryl hydrocarbon receptor1 aMccoy, Jessica A.1 aDoheny, Brenna M.1 aGalligan, Thomas M.1 aGuillette, Louis J.1 aParrott, Benjamin B.0 tBiology of reproduction.g2018 July 11, v. 100, no. 1 p.149-161dSociety for the Study of ReproductionwJournal:26822x0006-33637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioy1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245007600169300001600245520165400261592002801915653003001943653003801973653002202011653003202033653004202065653002302107700002002130700001902150700001602169700002402185773019002209856007902399852000902478655001202487IND60551182720221118021508.0161018s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055118272DNAL7 a10.5114/ninp.2013.346992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerejko, Mirosława10aCorticomotor excitability in drug-naive patients with Parkinson disease  ap. 109-115.  aThis study aimed to assess the indices of corticomotor excitability (CE) in drug-naive Parkinson disease (PD) patients and to investigate its relationship with asymmetry and severity of clinical symptoms.Eleven (4 men) drug-naive PD patients (mean age: 53.1 ± 9.8 years) and 13 (7 men) healthy controls (mean age: 51.7 ± 4.2 years) were included. All PD patients were rated on the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) with measurement of the side-specific score separately for arms and legs. Resting motor threshold (RMT), central silent period (CSP), amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP) and central motor conduction time (CMCT) evoked by a single pulse of the transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded in all subjects from the left and right abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and extensor digitorum brevis (EDB).Parkinson disease patients showed higher MEP (1.8 ± 0.9 vs. 1.1 ± 0.8 mV, p < 0.05) and shorter CMCT (6.1 ± 0.9 vs. 7.4 ± 1.0 ms, p < 0.05) recorded from the ADM on the more affected side. CSP recorded from the more affected ADM was under the normal range in five and from the less affected ADM in four PD patients. For CSP recorded from the EDB, respective values are four for the more affected side and three for the less affected side. The rigidity from the more affected arm and leg correlated negatively with the respective CSP recorded from the ADM (r = –0.74, p < 0.01) and EDB (r = –0.68, p < 0.04).In the early stage of untreated PD the CE parameters are altered only on the more affected side. The shortening of CSP reflects the severity of rigidity on the more affected side.  aPublisher supplied data 0acorticomotor excitability 0atranscranial magnetic stimulation 0aParkinson disease 0apobudliwość kory ruchowej 0aprzezczaszkowa stymulacja magnetyczna 0achoroba Parkinsona1 aRakowicz, Maria1 aAntczak, Jakub1 aInglot, Ewa1 aNiewiadomska, Maria0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2013, v. 47 p.109-115dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Society of Neurology and the Polish Association of Neurosurgeonsx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5114/ninp.2013.346993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03688naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100003000184245013700214300001600351520218400367592002802551653001102579653001402590653001602604653002002620653002202640653002202662653004802684653005502732653001702787653003102804653004702835653001402882653001102896653001202907700002302919700001902942700002402961700002002985773013903005856007703144852000903221655001203230IND60648261820221120215540.0190627e20180730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064826182DNAL7 a10.1093/biolre/ioy1662doi7 aPMC63352122pmcid7 a300849512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerstraeten, Barbara S.E.10aPrenatal two-hit stress affects maternal and offspring pregnancy outcomes and uterine gene expression in rats: match or mismatch?†  ap. 195-207.  aMaternal stress and inflammation excesses can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and offspring development. We evaluated whether distinct prenatal stressors affect pregnancy, maternal and offspring outcomes, and uterine gene expression differently when combined than either alone. Long-Evans dams were exposed to psychological or/and (two-hit) immune stress (interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β]), on gestational days 12–18 and 17-delivery, respectively. Gestational length, maternal weight gain, glycaemia and corticosterone levels, offspring weight, and gender effects were recorded. Maternal and offspring uteri were collected at weaning and on postnatal day 160 correspondingly. Uterine expression of genes involved in local progesterone metabolism, neuroendocrine and immune systems were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Maternal two-hit stress increased gestational length variation and the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes while reducing gestational weight gain. Pup weight was negatively affected by prenatal stressors in a gender-specific way. In dams, IL-1β upregulated gene expression of neuroendocrine (Crh, Crhr1) and cytokine genes (Il1b, Il1rn, Il6, and Il10). Conversely, transcriptional patterns in offspring uteri were more variable with gene-specific up- or downregulation by each stressor separately, while exposure to both extensively reduced the expression of neuroendocrine (Hsd11b1), cytokine (Il1a, Il1rn, Il6), and IL-1 receptor genes. In conclusion, maternal stress affects physiological and molecular processes in dams and their offspring; two hits have different effects than single stressors. Outcomes appear generation-, gender-, and stressor-specific. Dampening of offspring uterine gene expression after exposure to multiple stressors could fit within the match/mismatch hypothesis of perinatal programming, with offspring preparing for a stressful life. Summary Sentence The combination of two distinct prenatal stressors, psychological and immune stress, induces adverse outcomes and differentially affects expression of genes related to progesterone metabolism, stress and the immune system in the rat uterus.  aPublisher supplied data 0astress 0apregnancy 0aparturition 0agene expression 0afetal development 0aearly development 0adevelopmental origins of health and disease 0acorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH/CRH receptor) 0aprogesterone 0atranscriptional regulation 0asteroid hormones/steroid hormone receptors 0acytokines 0auterus 0arodents1 aMccreary, J.

P.14aThe “Evolutionarily Significant Unit” concept and its applicability in biological conservation  ap. 182-193.  aAlthough most conservationists claim to protect “species”, the conservation unit actually and practically managed is the individual population. As resources are not unlimited, we need to focus on a restricted number of populations. But how can we select them? The Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU), first conceptualised by Ryder in 1986, may offer some answer. Several definitions have been proposed for the ESU, but all make reference to units “whose divergence can be measured or evaluated by putting differential emphasis on the role of evolutionary forces at varied temporal scales”. Thus, an ESU might be fully identical with a “species”, or a “species” could be composed of multiple ESUs. On the other hand, an ESU might comprise single/multiple populations exchanging a degree of gene flow, such as meta-populations. In an attempt to show strengths and weaknesses of ESU concepts, we present here, among several others, some case studies on the myrmecophilous butterflies of the genus Maculinea . In particular, we analyse the apparently everlasting debate about Maculinea alcon and M. rebeli , whose separation into separate species has been accepted by many authors, on mainly ecological criteria, but has not been fully supported by molecular analyses. We also discuss how the tight association with host ants may have driven selection for increasingly more strictly adapted Maculinea populations, arguably deserving specific taxonomic identity. Finally we discuss how current DNA analyses may fail to detect critical information on differences between taxa recently originated by the action of separate adaptive processes, which non-molecular studies can sometimes reveal. We conclude by discussing some current and often conflicting taxonomic trends, in their relationships with conservation policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aFormicidae 3abutterflies 3acase studies 3agene flow 3aissues and policy 3apopulation 3azoology 0aEvolutionarily Significant Unit 0abutterflies 0aMaculinea 0aconservation 0aspecies concepts1 aBarbero, F.1 aBalletto, E.0 tItalian journal of zoology.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 81, no. 2 p.182-193dTaylor & Francisx1748-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2013.8702403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245012200164300001800286500002000304520155600324592002801880596003201908650004401940650001501984650002301999650002102022650001602043650002302059650001502082650002202097650002102119650004402140650000902184650001502193650000902208650001602217650002102233650001402254700002402268700007102292773013402363856007402497852000902571655001202580IND60655573020221120063915.0190803e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065557302DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.294332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolbrook, Travis P.10aSynthesis of comb‐like dispersants and a study on the effect of dispersant architecture and carbon black dispersion  ap. 1682-1696.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aComb dispersants suitable for stabilization of carbonaceous deposits found in automotive lubricating oils were derived from the copolymerization of vinyl‐ether terminated polyisobutylene (VE‐PIB) macromonomers with maleic anhydride (MAH). The rate and degree of copolymerization of VE‐PIB with MAH was greatly influenced by the molecular weight of the VE‐PIB. Longer PIB tails imposed greater hindrance of the chain end resulting in slower propagation and lower degrees of copolymerization for PIB‐alt‐MAH copolymers. Functionalization of PIB‐alt‐MAH with a polyamine proceeded smoothly at elevated temperatures as evidenced by disappearance of anhydride stretches via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Analogous linear and grafted dispersants were prepared to investigate the influence of architecture on the physical properties of the dispersants. Characterization of the intermediates and final dispersants was conducted by nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis, and ultraviolet–visible. Using Langmuir adsorption studies and carbon black as a substitute for carbonaceous deposits, it was found that comb and grafted dispersants exhibit greater affinities for adsorption but decreased packing efficiencies in comparison to linear dispersants. Rheological studies investigating viscosity as a function of loading for dispersant/oil mixtures with carbon black present a similar finding. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

In this study, a novel nanocomposite membrane by mixing GOQDs with sodium alginate (SA) matrix was prepared for ethanol dehydration. GOQDs with an average lateral dimension around 3.9 nm provided additional shorter and less tortuous transport pathways for water molecules to penetrate the membrane compared to microsized GO sheets. Benefiting from the nanosize and high hydrophilicity of GOQDs, the nanocomposite membrane exhibited favorable ethanol dehydration performance with a total permeation flux of 2432 ± 58 g m−2 h−1, which was 60% higher than that of pristine alginate membrane, and a separation factor of 1152 ± 48. Incorporating GOQDs into the membranes can be an effective approach to improving the water permeation for water-permselective pervaporation membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon 3aethanol 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3amixing 3ananocomposites 3apervaporation 3aquantum dots 3asodium alginate 0aGraphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) 0aNanocomposite membrane 0aPervaporation 0aEthanol dehydration1 aPan, Fusheng1 aYang, Leixin1 aSong, Yimeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0015-75641 aWu, Hong1 aCheng, Xuanxuan1 aLiu, Guanhua1 aYang, Hao1 aWang, Hongjian1 aJiang, Zhongyi1 aCao, Xingzhong0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 563 p.903-913dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.06.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013800170520135300308592002801661650001201689650001301701650001101714650001401725650001701739650001101756650002101767650001301788650001301801650002701814650002001841650001401861650000901875650001801884650001601902650000801918650001501926653004001941653001801981653002001999653002202019700001802041700005802059773011402117856008602231852000902317655001202326IND60656121020221119073327.0191214e20200105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065612102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1209732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Qingming10aIndium recovery from In-Sn-Cu-Al mixed system of waste liquid crystal display panels via acid leaching and two-step electrodeposition  aSince indium (In) was the most valuable resource in waste liquid crystal panels (LCDs), most researches only focused on preliminary recovery of In, while those coexisting metal elements (Cu, Sn, Al) raised little concern. This could lead to waste of resources, potential risk of heavy metal pollution, and also complexation of following In purification procedures. Besides, current hydrometallurgy processes for In purification are complicated, consume more reagents and generate more wastewater. Therefore, this research applied simple acid leaching and two-step electrodeposition for In-Sn and In-Cu-Al separation with minimum waste generation and input. Considering the special doping structure of indium-tin oxide (ITO), feasibility for concurrent In leaching and Sn precipitation was explored based on the unique Sn species’ dissolution and precipitation behavior during acid leaching. Since the behavior of Sn was more sensitive to acidity and temperature, 97.07% of Sn removal and 99.25% of In recovery could be achieved using 1 mol/L H2SO4 at 70 ℃ for 1 h. A specific kinetic model depicting In leaching in thin ITO film situation was developed referring to avrami equation. Then, the application of two-step electrodeposition enabled 95.32% extraction of Cu and deposition of In with a purity over 99 wt% at respective potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aaluminum 3acopper 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3aindium 3aindium tin oxide 3akinetics 3aleaching 3aliquid crystal display 3aliquid crystals 3apollution 3arisk 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3atin 3awastewater 0aWaste liquid crystal display panels 0aAcid leaching 0aIndium recovery 0aElectrodeposition1 aZhang, Lingen1 aHsu, Chen-Min,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1404-54240 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Jan. 05, v. 381 p.120973-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1209733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010700168520121400275592002801489650001701517650002601534650002601560650001201586650002401598650001501622650001801637650001301655650001301668650002701681650002401708650002401732650002601756700001501782700001701797700001701814773012801831856008701959852000902046655001202055IND60791038320221120224646.0220826e20220731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079103832DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100815532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Zebao 10aSecondary Metabolites from the Endoparasitic Nematophagous Fungus Harposporium anguillulae YMF 1.01751  aHarposporium anguillulae, an endoparasitic nematophagous fungus (ENF), is a model fungus from which the genus Harposporium was established. It can infect nematodes via ingested conidia. In this paper, the morphology and nematode–fungus interaction between Panagrellus redivivus and H. anguillulae were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The secondary metabolites of H. anguillulae were also studied. Seven metabolites were purified and identified from an ethyl acetate extract of broth and a methanol extract of mycelium. These include a new polyketone 5-hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (1) and six known metabolites (17R)-17-methylincisterol (2), eburicol (3), ergosterol peroxide (4), terpendole C (5), (3β,5α,9β,22E)-3,5-dihydroxy-ergosta-7,22-dien-6-one (6), and 5α,6β-epoxy-(22E,24R)-ergosta-8,22-diene- 3β,7α-diol (7). These metabolites were assayed for their activity against plant root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, and the results showed that terpendole C (5) had weak nematicidal activity but also that other compounds did not have evident activity at a concentration of 400 μg mL⁻¹.

The relationships between the concentrations of 25(OH)D3 and the indices of calcium-phosphate metabolism were determined, depending on the duration of disease and vitamin and unsaturated fatty acids supplementation.Thirty patients (15 at the early stage and 15 at the advanced stage of MS) were enrolled. Each patient underwent neurological examination; neurological motor disability was defined according to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The results were compared to the values obtained in the control group (15 individuals) selected according to the age of subjects, their residence, ethnicity and gender.Significantly lower serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3 in MS patients compared to the control group were found. MS patients at the advanced stage of the disease (duration of 5–6 years) had lower 25(OH)D3 concentrations than patients at the early stage of MS. Among patients in an advanced stage of MS, significantly lower levels of 25(OH)D3 were found in women compared to men with a similar level of physical disability.Lower serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3 in MS patients compared to the control group were found. The lowest concentrations of 25(OH)D3 were found in female patients aged 20–40 and in patients with a longer disease duration without substantial impairment of calcium-phosphate metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 0amultiple sclerosis 0a25(OH)D3 0adietary supplements 0astwardnienie rozsiane 0a25(OH)D3 0asuplementy diety1 aPierzchała, Krystyna0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2013, v. 47 p.126-130dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Society of Neurology and the Polish Association of Neurosurgeonsx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5114/ninp.2013.347303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245017600157300001600333520129400349592002801643650001601671650001101687650001601698650001901714650002501733650001001758650002201768650001501790650001401805650001901819650002001838651001001858651001101868653002601879653003601905653002001941700001901961700001201980773011901992856007702111852000902188655001202197IND60129444220221121152655.0151124e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012944422DNAL7 a10.3956/2011-33.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chengli10aCOII phylogeography reveals surprising divergencies within the cryptic butterfly Kallima inachus (Doyére, 1840) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Kallimini) in southeastern Asia  ap. 381-398.  aPartial sequences (681 bp) of the mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII), were used to assess the genetic diversity among populations of the Oriental butterfly, Kallima inachus (Doyére 1840) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Kallimini), distributed through the southeastern Asian tropical and subtropical areas. Two haplotypes from Tibet and the Hainan Island are deeply divergent from each other, as well as from all other haplotypes (5.43%–7.05%, uncorrected), implying cryptic species might exist in the present morphological species K. inachus. Haplotypic divergences within the range north from Guangxi and within southern Yunnan are quite shallow. Phylogenetic analysis show the population in southern Yunnan should be an evolutionary significant entity distinct from the inland China populations, while those in the Sichuan Basin, southeast mainland China and the Taiwan Island are not genetically subdivided, suggesting the status of subspecies K. i. formosana Fruhstörfer, 1912 should be reconsidered. The rapid uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as well as dramatic climatic changes from the late Pliocene in the region could have served as main driving forces of the allopatric divergences within K. inachus, as well as among probable cryptic sibling species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNymphalidae 3abasins 3abutterflies 3aclimate change 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3asibling species 3aChina 3aTaiwan 0aGeographic population 0acytochrome c oxidase subunit II 0acryptic species1 aChen, Xiaoming1 aHe, Rui0 tPan-Pacific entomologist.g2012 Oct., v. 88, no. 4 p.381-398dPacific Coast Entomological Societyx0031-06037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3956/2011-33.13Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245012000178300001600298520142300314592002801737650001401765650002001779650002101799650003101820650001401851650001201865650001801877650003701895650001301932650001501945650002201960650002401982650002002006650003602026653001402062653002302076653001002099653001302109653001002122700002002132700001902152773012102171856008202292852000902374655001202383IND60533026720221123025055.0160728e20140718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053302672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorgani-Firuzjaee, Sattar10aPalmitate induces SHIP2 expression via the ceramide-mediated activation of NF-κB, and JNK in skeletal muscle cells  ap. 494-499.  aElevated plasma free fatty acids impair the insulin signaling by induction of the expression of protein phosphatases.

Specific inhibitors were used to identify the signaling pathways involved in SHIP2 expression.The results showed that 0.5mM palmitate significantly upregulates the mRNA and protein levels of SHIP2 in C2C12 cells. To address the role of palmitate intracellular metabolites in SHIP2 expression, the myotubes were treated with palmitate in the presence of ceramide and diacylglycerol synthesis inhibitors. The results demonstrated that only ceramide synthesis inhibition could prevent palmitate-induced SHIP2 expression in these cells. In addition, the incubation of muscle cells with different concentrations of C2-ceramide dose-dependently enhanced SHIP2 expression. Furthermore, the inhibition of both JNK and NF-κB pathways could prevent ceramide-induced SHIP2 expression in myotubes.These findings suggest that palmitate contributes to SHIP2 overexpression in skeletal muscle via the mechanisms involving the activation of ceramide-JNK and NF-κB pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramides 3adiacylglycerols 3afree fatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3ainositols 3ainsulin 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amyotubes 3apalmitates 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3askeletal muscle 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aPalmitate 0aInsulin resistance 0aC2C12 0aCeramide 0aSHIP21 aAhmadi, Saeideh1 aMeshkani, Reza0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 July 18, v. 450 p.494-499dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245016800159300001600327520126700343592002801610650002501638650002301663650002001686650001701706650002301723650001601746650001601762650001101778650002001789650001901809650001001828650001001838650002101848650001301869650001201882650001701894650001801911650002701929650001401956650001201970650002001982650001302002650002802015650001702043650001002060651001002070700001502080700001502095700001802110700001902128700001502147700001702162773008602179856004802265852000902313655001202322IND4473919820221116145422.0120907e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447391982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-012-0630-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jiwen10aMapping quantitative trait loci for cottonseed oil, protein and gossypol content in a Gossypium hirsutum × Gossypium barbadense backcross inbred line population  ap. 191-201.  aCotton is one of the most important oil-producing crops and the cottonseed meal provides important protein nutrients as animal feed. However, information on the genetic basis of cottonseed oil and protein contents is lacking. A backcross inbred line (BIL) population from a cross between Gossypium hirsutum as the recurrent parent and G. barbadense was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for cottonseed oil, protein, and gossypol contents. The BIL population of 146 lines together with the two parental lines was tested in the same location for three years in China. Based on a genetic map of 392 SSR markers and a total genetic distance of 2,895.2 cM, 17 QTLs on 12 chromosomes for oil content, 22 QTLs on 12 chromosomes for protein content and three QTLs on two chromosomes for gossypol content were detected. Seed oil content was significantly and negatively correlated with seed protein content, which can be explained by eight QTLs for both oil and protein contents co-localized in the same regions but with opposite additive effects. This research represents the first report using a permanent advanced backcross inbred population of an interspecific hybrid population to identify QTLs for seed quality traits in cotton in three environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium barbadense 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aadditive effect 3abackcrossing 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acorrelation 3acotton 3acottonseed meal 3acottonseed oil 3acrops 3afeeds 3agenetic distance 3agossypol 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3alipid content 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anutrients 3aparents 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseed quality 3aseeds 3aChina1 aYu, Shuxun1 aFan, Shuli1 aSong, Meizhen1 aZhai, Honghong1 aLi, Xingli1 aZhang, Jinfa0 tEuphytica.g2012 Sept., v. 187, no. 2 p.191-201dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-012-0630-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012100161300001600282520161200298592002801910653001201938653002801950653003301978653001802011653001402029653001102043653001302054700001902067700002102086700002002107700001802127700001702145700002002162700002002182700002102202773013902223856008202362852000902444655001202453IND60648262120221122034610.0190627e20180818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064826212DNAL7 adoi: 10.1093/biolre/ioy1692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jin10aCadmium induces ovarian granulosa cell damage by activating PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 through endoplasmic reticulum stress†  ap. 292-299.  aThis study aimed to investigate whether cadmium induces ovarian granulosa cell damage by activating protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-eIF2α-ATF4 through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and to elucidate the underlying regulation mechanism. Two models of cadmium exposure were established. In one model, ovarian granulosa cells isolated from 21-day-old female Sprague Dawley rats were cultured in vitro for 36 h and exposed to CdCl₂ (0, 5, 10, and 20 µM), and in another model, a human ovarian granulosa tumor cell line (COV434) was used to construct the binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP)-knockdown cell line sh-BIP and exposed to 0 and 20 µM CdCl₂. After exposure to cadmium for 12 h, the expression mRNA and protein levels of BIP, p-PERK, and p-eIF2α were determined in the two models. miRNAs related to BIP were also detected in granulosa cells after cadmium exposure. We found that mRNA and protein levels of all factors were upregulated in each cadmium-dose group, except for BIP mRNA expression in the 5 µM Cd group. The BIP gene was knocked down in COV434 cells before exposure to cadmium. All factors were upregulated in COV434 cells exposed to Cd, and the expression of the p-eIF2α protein was downregulated in sh-BIP cells exposed to Cd. In addition, no differences in BIP-related miRNAs were detected in cadmium-exposed rat ovarian granulosa cells versus the control group. Cadmium induces ovarian granulosa cell damage by inducing ER stress. Summary Sentence Cadmium damaged granulosa cells by activating BIP gene and then activates PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 0acadmium 0aovarian granulosa cells 0aendoplasmic reticulum stress 0agene knockout 0aGRP78/BIP 0ap-PERK 0ap-eIF2α1 aLuo, Ling-Feng1 aWang, Dong-Liang1 aWang, Wen-Xiang1 aZhu, Jian-Lin1 aLi, Youchen,1 aChen, Neng-Zhou1 aHuang, Hui-Ling1 aZhang, Wen-Chang0 tBiology of reproduction.g2018 Aug. 18, v. 100, no. 1 p.292-299dSociety for the Study of ReproductionwJournal:26822x0006-33637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/doi: 10.1093/biolre/ioy1693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100007000188245016800258300001400426506007600440520150900516592002802025506003702053650001102090650001902101650001002120650001902130650001302149650001402162650001802176650001102194650001402205650002202219650001202241650001702253650001302270650002102283650001202304650001302316650002002329650002502349700003202374700003002406700002902436700003002465700002602495700002002521773012802541856008202669852000902751655001202760IND60589019020221207121901.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058901902DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2758-62doi7 aPMC57561802pmcid7 a293587932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrnelas-Paz, Joséde Jesús1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1989-019X10aRelationship between the firmness of Golden Delicious apples and the physicochemical characteristics of the fruits and their pectin during development and ripening  ap. 33-41.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFirmness at harvest determines the postharvest storability and quality of apples. The climate change has altered the physiological processes of fruits and the reliability of ripening indicators typically used to determine the harvest time, compromising fruit firmness. In this study, ‘Golden Delicious’ apples were harvested at several developmental/ripening stages (107, 122, 137, 152 and 167 days after full bloom, DAFB) and evaluated for physicochemical attributes, which were correlated with fruit firmness. The 167 DAFB fruit corresponded to fruit at the commercial harvest. Fruit harvested at 107 and 122 DAFB did not develop the characteristics of ripe fruit while fruit harvested after 137 DAFB ripened normally. Fruit at commercial harvest showed low firmness. The changes of fruit weight, diameter, height, tristimulus color (L* values) as well as the content of total soluble solids and moisture in fruit correlated well with fruit firmness (r values from −0.76 to −0.97). The changes of pectin content, degree of esterification, molecular weight and content of glucose and galactose in pectin showed a positive relationship with firmness (r = 0.62–0.94). The content of protein, galacturonic acid and mineral elements in pectin correlated negatively with firmness (r −0.66 to −0.99). The results demonstrated that commercial harvest was delayed 30 days, compromising fruit firmness. Some underestimated ripening indicators may help in determining the harvest time of apples.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapples 3aclimate change 3acolor 3aesterification 3afirmness 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucose 3aharvest date 3aminerals 3amolecular weight 3apectins 3aripening 3astorage quality 3atotal soluble solids1 aQuintana-Gallegos, BrendaM.1 aEscalante-Minakata, Pilar1 aReyes Hernández, Jaime,1 aPérez-Martínez, JaimeD.1 aRios-Velasco, Claudio1 aRuiz-Cruz, Saul0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2018 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.33-41dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2758-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03837naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245014800135300001600283506002800299520239500327592002802722506003702750650000902787650001102796650001202807650002802819650001402847650002202861650003002883650001902913650001202932650001202944650001102956650001602967653002602983653002303009653004203032653002803074700003103102700002603133700001903159773020403178852000903382655001203391IND60785483420221207133204.0201111e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078548342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugusto, Gabriella10aAceitação de cupcakes com farinha de talos de couve manteiga e farinha de talos de espinafre por escolares do município de Prudentópolis-PR  ap. 731-737.  aResource is Open Access  aO estudo teve como objetivo avaliar sensorialmente a aceitação de cupcakes elaborados com substituição da farinha de trigo por farinha de talos de couve manteiga e espinafre.

At 34 points in the city, dust samples were collected by glass traps from the roof, for twelve months, and the climatic data were obtained and analyzed from relevant organizations. The highest deposition rate is in the western half of the city and its total amount has varied from 54.52 to 121.21 g/m2/y. In both halves of the city, summer has the highest dust deposition rate and its central areas have the highest amount. There were significant positive correlations between dust deposition rate with temperature and medium wind speed, and there were significant negative correlations between dust deposition rate with rainfall and relative humidity in all months, which justifies the high dust deposition rate in the dry seasons of the year. The results of stepwise regression showed that rainfall was the most important factor affecting the dust deposition rate in both halves of the city. The city of Tehran has a special geographical location the presence of mountains like a barrier has prevented dust from leaving the city and the air inlet corridor of Tehran has faced problems due to the expansion of building construction and high-rise building. Other factors affecting the rate of dust deposition in this city, in addition to the distance from the main source of dust production, atmospheric parameters can be mentioned the existence of barren lands around the city, vegetation cover, construction operations, and traffic.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3adust 3aglass 3arain 3arelative humidity 3asummer 3atemperature 3atraffic 3avegetation cover 3awind speed 0adust deposition rate 0aclimatic parameters 0astepwise regression 0ahigh-rise building effects 0athe western and eastern half of tehran metropolis1 aJalalian, A.1 aHonarjoo, N.0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2021 Sept., v. 25, no. 2 p.175-190dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007800170300001600248520090800264592002801172650002501200650001501225650002001240650001201260653002901272653001301301653001001314653002601324653002101350773010201371856008701473852000901560655001201569IND60635185520221120215716.0200110e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063518552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcock, Rowan14aThe New Rural Reconstruction Movement: A Chinese degrowth style movement?  ap. 261-269.  aThis paper investigates a grassroots Chinese movement called the New Rural Reconstruction Movement (NRRM).

This link is designed to bring greater awareness of the NRRM to western environmentalists and greater awareness of degrowth to Chinese scholars, in the expectation that the two movements will find it beneficial to engage in collaborative research. This paper demonstrates similar progressive environmental based arguments are being debated in places with different geographical and socio-political contexts. It suggests there is the possibility that the NRRM and degrowth could work together to help achieve shared goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooperative research 3ainterviews 3asocial networks 3asurveys 0aNew Rural Reconstruction 0aDegrowth 0aChina 0aEnvironmental Justice 0aSocial Movements0 tEcological economics.g2019 July, v. 161 p.261-269dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2019.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245015800179300001600337520159600353592002801949650001601977650001201993650001202005650001602017650002102033650002002054650000902074650001602083650001102099650002302110650001202133650003802145650002502183650001802208650001802226650001802244653002202262653001902284653002202303653001802325653001802343700002602361700001802387700002602405700001702431700002402448773009902472856009002571852000902661655001202670IND60644125720221123000822.0200106e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064412572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArifin, Otong Zenal10aEffects of stocking density on survival, food intake and growth of giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy) larvae reared in a recirculating aquaculture system  ap. 159-166.  aThe influence of stocking density on survival, food intake, and larval growth was assessed in giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy) larvae reared in an indoor recirculating aquaculture system. Larvae aged eight days post-hatching were arbitrarily divided into six stocking density treatments (A: 0.6, B: 1.2, C: 2.4, D: 4.8, E: 9.6, F: 19.2 individuals L⁻¹; four replicates per treatment) and reared for three weeks. Tubifex worms, used as food, were kept continuously available for larvae. Samples of larvae were collected at days 0, 7, 14 and 21. Performance indicators - including survival rate (%), food intake (% and g ind⁻¹), total length (cm), body weight (g), specific growth rate (g day⁻¹), biomass gain (g L⁻¹), feed conversion ratio (FCR), condition factor (K) and coefficients of variation (%) - were measured. Water quality was checked throughout the experiment and parameters were maintained below critical thresholds for fish. The results showed no effect of stocking density on survival (> 98%) or size heterogeneity, although growth significantly decreased with increasing stocking density. At the end of the 21-day experiment, mean individual body weights were 563.2 ± 64.3, 461.0 ± 28.6, 288.8 ± 19.3, 170.2 ± 13.8, 113.6 ± 6.9 and 81.9 ± 2.3 mg, for groups A, B, C, D, E and F, respectively. Decreased growth may be due to reduction in food intake in larvae stocked at the highest densities. The consequences of intensification of giant gourami larval rearing should be further investigated in the nursery and grow-out phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOsphronemus 3aTubifex 3abiomass 3abody weight 3acondition factor 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afood intake 3alarvae 3alarval development 3arearing 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3aspecific growth rate 3astocking rate 3asurvival rate 3awater quality 0aEarly life stages 0aGrowth metrics 0aRearing practices 0aStart-feeding 0aTropical fish1 aPrakoso, Vitas Atmadi1 aSubagja, Jojo1 aKristanto, Anang Hari1 aPouil, Simon1 aSlembrouck, Jacques0 tAquaculture.g2019 July 15, v. 509 p.159-166dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007700169300001600246500001900262520133800281592002801619650002001647650001801667650001001685650000701695650002101702650001901723651001201742653001201754653001301766653001601779700002001795700001801815773010301833856008601936852000902022655001202031IND60693811520210618000000.0200508e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069381152DNAL7 a10.1080/11956860.2001.116826702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchalk, Gina10aLeeches in acidified lakes of central Ontario, Canada: Status and trends  ap. 421-429.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLakes in the acid-sensitive regions of Sudbury, Algoma, and Muskoka, Ontario (Canada), were examined to assess relationships between leech populations and certain chemical and physical characteristics of the lakes (pH, conductivity, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and water depth). Thirteen leech species were trapped, and leeches occurred in 81% of study lakes. Leech species richness was higher in lakes with high pH (i.e., less acid) and low conductivity. Occurrence and abundance of some species were significantly increased in lakes with higher pH and lower conductivity; however, abundance models explained low portions of data variability (10-13%). Temporal trends of leech occurrence, species richness, and abundance in the Sudbury study area were examined in four separate years over a nine-year interval. Most lakes had no significant change in leech richness or abundance over this period. However, a substantial subset of the lakes showed declines in richness or abundance despite dramatic reductions in acidic deposition across eastern North America and some subsequent improvements in lake chemistries. Our results suggest that leech declines were not directly related to changes in lake chemistry. Hence, we suggest that leeches are not suitable as direct indicators of chemical recovery from acidification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid deposition 3aacidification 3alakes 3apH 3aspecies richness 3atotal nitrogen 3aOntario 0aLeeches 0aRecovery 0aSmall lakes1 aMcnicol, Donald1 aMallory, Mark0 tÉcoscience.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 8, no. 4 p.421-429dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2001.116826703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009600166300001800262520091100280592002801191650000801219650002601227650001001253650001901263650001101282650001301293650001601306650000801322650001801330700002001348700001801368773009901386856008101485990002301566852000901589655001201598IND60096372420221122045908.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009637242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Sung-Jei10aImprovement of electrical properties of printed ITO thin films by heat-treatment conditions  ap.

Then, the printed ITO thin films were heated at 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C under several atmospheric conditions of single step of N₂, air and combination steps using the gases, respectively. As a result, the sheet resistance of the printed ITO thin film was decreased as the concentration of ITO ink and heat-treatment temperature were increased under single step of N₂ atmosphere. In the case of the printed ITO thin film using 30 wt% ITO ink and heat-treatment at 600 °C under a N₂ atmosphere, the improved sheet resistance and optical transmittance of 455 Ω/square and 90%, respectively, were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aelectrical properties 3aglass 3aheat treatment 3aindium 3anitrogen 3atemperature 3atin 3atransmittance1 aKim, Jong-Woong1 aHan, Jeong In0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 Jan., v. 11, no. 1S p.S202-S205dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.0813Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003300155245014300188300001600331520168100347592002802028650002202056650001602078650001002094650002102104650001602125650002402141650001002165650001202175650001402187650001302201650001202214650001202226650001602238650001202254650001102266650002102277650002002298650002502318653001602343653001502359653001402374653001602388653001402404653002602418700002302444700002502467700002202492700002102514773009902535856009002634852000902724655001202733IND60644125920221123000417.0200210e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064412592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKropielnicka-Kruk, Katarzyna14aThe effect of conspecific interaction on survival, growth and feeding behaviour of early juvenile tropical spiny lobster Panulirus ornatus  ap. 234-247.  aBehaviour underpins many facets of the performance of animals in aquaculture. By manipulating culture systems to segregate or allow particular aspects of conspecific interaction, we found physical interactions between P. ornatus individuals to be essential for better culture performance. Three culture types were used to control conspecific interactions: isolated culture (individual vessels) excluded all conspecific interactions, separated culture (lobsters cultured in adjacent cages) excluded physical interactions, and communal culture allowed for all interactions. Two water exchange rates were introduced to investigate the influence of chemical cue intensity on growth and survival. Time-series photography was used to determine the feeding behaviour and preference for different feeds including mussel gonad, commercial prawn feed and moist feed. The experiment showed improved growth and moulting frequency in communally cultured lobsters. These results suggest that direct physical contact between conspecifics is required to optimise growth of lobsters, which may be related to the complex social structures of this gregarious species. Behavioural observations of two juvenile instars (2 and 4), revealed circadian rhythm of interactions with feeds, feed preferences and intake. Observations revealed differing behaviours between the different culture types, where lobsters reared in separation displayed higher level of interactions with feeds; however this was not associated with higher feed intake. Observations of two juvenile instars (2 and 4) exhibited increase of daylight activity (interactions with feeds and feed intake) in older lobsters (instar 4).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanulirus ornatus 3aaquaculture 3acages 3acircadian rhythm 3afeed intake 3afeeding preferences 3afeeds 3ainstars 3ajuveniles 3alobsters 3amolting 3amussels 3aphotography 3arearing 3ashrimp 3asocial structure 3asolar radiation 3atime series analysis 0aAquaculture 0aCrustacean 0aBehaviour 0aCannibalism 0aNutrition 0aTropical rock lobster1 aTrotter, Andrew J.1 aFitzgibbon, Quinn P.1 aSmith, Gregory G.1 aCarter, Chris G.0 tAquaculture.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 510 p.234-247dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245012300180300001400303520113700317592002801454650002301482650002201505650001701527650001601544650002301560650002801583650002101611650001501632650001701647650001301664650002401677650002001701650003701721653001301758653002301771653002001794653002501814700002101839700002601860700002601886700002101912700002701933773009701960856008602057852000902143655001202152IND60602843020221119134715.0180711e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060284302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.02.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamachandran, Rajendran10aEffect of reducing agent on graphene synthesis and its influence on charge storage towards supercapacitor applications  ap. 22-31.  aA simple chemical route was adopted for the preparation of graphene by chemical reduction route using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reducing agent. A systematic study was done to show the effect of NaBH4 on the reduction and the obtained graphene samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Atomic force microcopy and High resolution transmission electron microscopy. Better reduction of GO was observed at GO and NaBH4 ratio of 1:10 (denoted as SR1:10). Further, the investigation was emphasized to show the effect of the above GO to reductant ratio on its charge storage properties. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in 6M KOH electrolyte and the results show that the capacitance performance was increased in the order of GO<SR1:8<SR1:4<SR1:12<SR1:10. A high specific capacitance of 284.3F/g was observed for SR1:10 electrode at 5mV/s scan rate could be due to better electrical conductivity of sample. The ratio of GO and NaBH4 was optimized to 1:10 for high degree reduction of graphene, which has higher capacitance towards supercapacitor applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aborohydrides 3acapacitance 3achemical reduction 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3agraphene 3apotassium hydroxide 3areducing agents 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aGraphene 0aSodium borohydride 0aSupercapacitors 0aSpecific capacitance1 aSaranya, Murugan1 aVelmurugan, Venugopal1 aRaghupathy, Bala P.C.1 aJeong, Soon Kwan1 aGrace, Andrews Nirmala0 tApplied energy.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 153 p.22-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.02.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100005800181245012800239300001800367500002000385506007600405520169600481592002802177506003702205650001102242650001402253650001002267650001602277650001102293650000902304650001102313650002302324650001802347650002602365650002002391700005702411700003202468700002202500700002002522700001902542773014102561856007402702852000902776655001202785IND60606758820221207125330.0180727e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060675882DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.151362doi7 aPMC60603132pmcid7 a297496562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarnis, Elodie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3433-076710aEstablishment of reference values of the caudal vena cava by fast‐ultrasonography through different views in healthy dogs  ap. 1308-1318.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Clinical assessment of intravascular volume status is challenging. In humans, ultrasonographic assessment of the inferior vena cava diameter, directly or as a ratio to the aortic diameter is used to estimate intravascular volume status. OBJECTIVES: To ultrasonographically obtain reference values (RV) for caudal vena cava diameter (CVCD), area (CVCₐ) and aortic ratios using 3 views in awake healthy dogs. ANIMALS: One hundred and twenty‐six healthy adult dogs from clients, students, faculty, or staff. METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, observational study. Two observer pairs evaluated CVCD by a longitudinal subxiphoid view (SV), a transverse 11th‐13th right hepatic intercostal view (HV), and a longitudinal right paralumbar view (PV). Inter‐rater agreements were estimated using concordance correlation coefficients (CCC). For body weight (BW)‐dependent variables, RVs were calculated using allometric scaling for variables with a CCC ≥ 0.7. RESULTS: The CCC was ≤0.43 for the CVC/aorta ratio at the PV and ≤0.43 in both inspiration and expiration for CVC at the SV. The RVs using allometric scaling for CVCₐ at the HV for inspiration, expiration, and for CVCD at the PV were 6.16 × BW⁰.⁷⁶², 7.24 × BW⁰.⁷⁸⁷, 2.79 × BW⁰.³⁹⁰, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The CVCD, measured at the HV and PV in healthy awake dogs of various breeds has good inter‐rater agreement suggesting these sites are reliable in measuring CVCD. Established RVs for CVCD for these sites need further comparison to results obtained in hypovolemic and hypervolemic dogs to determine their usefulness to evaluate volume status in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aallometry 3aaorta 3abody weight 3abreeds 3adogs 3ahumans 3ainferior vena cava 3anormal values 3aobservational studies 3aultrasonography1 aBoysen, Soren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0936-48341 aMerveille, Anne‐Christine1 aDesquilbet, Loïc1 aChalhoub, Serge1 aGommeren, Kris0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 4 p.1308-1318dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.151363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01843naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010300170300001600273520093000289592002801219650001401247650001201261650001001273650001301283650001201296650000901308650001001317700002301327773008601350856008401436852000901520655001201529IND60122213220221118223322.0150325e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012221322DNAL7 a10.1080/07409710.2014.9356692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeiss, Sarah N.10aWhere's the Joy in Cooking? Representations of Taste, Tradition, and Science in the Joy of Cooking  ap. 198-216.  aProcuring, preparing, and consuming foods are symbolic processes learned and reified within cultural boundaries. While many cultures have established tradition or taste as rules to guide food activities, contemporary Americans are mainly guided by a fascination with health and risk (Pollan, The Omnivore's Dilemma). As reflections of and contributors to public understandings of food and risk, cookbooks can be rich sites for scholarly investigation (Driver; Nestle and McIntosh). In the current study, we explore the representation of tradition, taste, and science in the introductory materials of the Joy of Cooking . While discussions of science were more common than those of taste or tradition, science did not replace the presence of taste and tradition. The presence of science, taste, and tradition varied over time, suggesting that, though they remain criteria for eaters, their importance is constantly negotiated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3acooking 3afoods 3afoodways 3arecipes 3arisk 3ataste1 aBates, Benjamin R.0 tFood & foodways.g2014 July 3, v. 22, no. 3 p.198-216dRoutledgex1542-34847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07409710.2014.9356693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009500166300001600261500001500277520119100292592002801483650001401511650001701525650002501542650001101567650002001578651001001598653002501608700001701633700001201650700001601662700001801678700001501696773010701711856004801818852000901866655001201875IND50090599820221118172147.0140626e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009059982DNAL7 a10.1007/s12040-014-0429-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Zhenshan10aGeochemistry and zircon U–Pb geochronology of the Pulang complex, Yunnan province, China  ap. 875-885.  a2019-12-05  aThe Pulang complex is located tectonically at the southern margin of the Yidun–Zhongdian island arc belt in Yunnan province, China, and is closely related to formation of the Pulang copper deposit, which is the largest copper deposit in Asia. The Pulang complex can be divided into three intrusion stages based on contact relationships and petrological characteristics: (1) a first stage of quartz dioritic porphyry; (2) a second stage of quartz monzonitic porphyry; and (3) a third stage of granodioritic porphyry. The crystallization ages of these intrusion stages were determined by single-zircon U–Pb dating, yielding ages of 221.0 ± 1.0, 211.8 ± 0.5, and 206.3 ± 0.7 Ma for the first, second, and third stages, respectively. These dates, integrated with previous geochronological data and field investigations, indicate that the second-stage quartz monzonitic porphyry has a close spatial and temporal relationship with the large Pulang porphyry copper deposit. These age data, geochemical and Sr–Nd isotopic results suggest that the Pulang complex formed in the Indo-Chinese epoch (257 ∼ 205 Ma) by multiphase intrusion of a mixture of mantle- and crust-derived magmas.  aPublisher supplied data 3azirconium 3ageochemistry 3aEarth system science 3aquartz 3acrystallization 3aChina 0aearth system science1 aDu, Yangsong1 aCao, Yi1 aGao, Fuping1 aWang, Gongwen1 aDong, Qian0 tJournal of earth system science.g2014 June, v. 123, no. 4 p.875-885dSpringer-Verlagx0253-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-014-0429-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245009600177300001600273500000900289520182400298592002802122650001302150650002202163650001602185650002102201650002102222650001202243650001202255650001302267650001802280650002302298650002102321651001102342700001702353773012302370852000902493856009702502655001202599IND2048846120221118093314.0191122e199209  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204884612DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1992.00021962008400050016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmyth, T.

A field study was conducted in a Xanthic Hapludox near Manaus, Brazil, to evaluate lime and Ca requirements for corn (Zea mays L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) during five consecutive years. Calcitic lime was applied once at rates of 0, 0.6, 1.2, 2.3, and 4.6 t of CaCO₃ equivalent per hectare. The effects of 1 t ha⁻¹ of gypsum, applied to four crops, were evaluated with lime rates of 0, 1.2 and 2.3 t ha⁻¹. During the two initial years, maximum yields of corn and soybean occurred with 1.2 t of lime ha⁻¹. In subsequent years, maximum corn yields occurred to 4.6 t of lime ha⁻¹. Liming only increased cowpea yields in the third year. Peanut yields increased with liming to the highest lime rate in the fourth and fifth year. Gypsum increased yields for all crops to which it was applied. When averaged across time gypsum increased exchangeable Ca and reduced exchangeable Al by 0.41 and 0.20 cmol, kg⁻¹, respectively. Increased peanut shelling percent and peanut and cowpea leaf Ca concentrations with lime, gypsum, or both were indicative of improved soil Ca supply. Maximum corn and soybean yields occurred at 27% Al saturation, whereas the critical level for peanut was 54%. Regressions of relative yield for all lime and gypsum treatments on the exchangeable Ca:Al ratio gave R² values equal to those achieved with Al or Ca saturation. Critical Ca:Al ratio values would provide a useful index to ensure that lime recommendations based on Al saturation provide an adequate Ca supply. Joint contribution of the North Carolina Agric. Res.

Microclimate, vegetation, and shrub and leaf-litter arthropods were sampled at south-facing forest edges and interiors of three sites within each landscape. Forest edges in the agricultural landscape were older and had vegetation structures that differed from those in the forestry landscape. This resulted in a sharper contrast in microclimate (temperature and humidity) between edge and interior in forests abutting agriculture than in stands abutting recent clearcuts. Arthropods from the leaf-litter and shrub-layer samples exhibited different responses to edges. In both landscapes, total shrub-arthropod abundance was not significantly affected by edges, while total leaf-litter arthropod abundance was lower at edges than in forest interiors. This reduced abundance of leaf-litter arthropods could negatively affect birds and other insectivorous vertebrates or could have been caused by greater vertebrate predation there. Forest edges in agriculture and forestry landscapes represent relative extremes in edge maturity, demonstrating that age of edges cannot completely mitigate edge effects on microclimate and abundance of arthropods. We discuss the implications of our findings for influences of forest fragmentation and landscape change on forest birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural landscapes 3aarthropods 3aboreal forests 3aedge effects 3aforestry 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahumidity 3ainsectivores 3amicroclimate 3apredation 3ashrubs 3atemperature 3aSaskatchewan 0aFragmentation 0aEdge 0aBoreal forest 0aArthropod 0aSongbird diet 0aAgriculture1 aMazerolle, Daniel F.1 aHobson, Keith A.0 tÉcoscience.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 8, no. 4 p.454-461dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2001.116826753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012000162520139800282592002801680650002301708650001901731650001701750650001701767650002601784650001701810650001901827650001401846650002501860650004101885650001101926650001301937650002001950650003701970650001302007650001002020650001102030650001502041650002202056653003302078653002302111653002402134653001502158653002102173700001602194700001702210700001702227700001802244700001702262773011202279856008202391852000902473655001202482IND60689819020221121064635.0210428e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068981902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2020.1113472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanjun10aIllicium verum essential oil, a potential natural fumigant in preservation of lotus seeds from fungal contamination  aThe antifungal properties of Illicium verum essential oil (IV-EO) against a toxigenic strain of Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus) were analyzed in order to determine its use in the preservation of lotus seeds. GC/MS analysis of IV-EO revealed that its main components are trans-anethole (91.32%), D-Limonene (2.0%) and estragole (2.0%). The antifungal activity of IV-EO against A. flavus infection was analyzed in vitro upon A. flavus with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) determined to be 2.0 and 4.0 μL/mL, respectively. IV-EO exhibited strong inhibitory effects on the mycelial growth and spore production of A. flavus, and caused a significant reduction in dry mycelium weight and aflatoxin B₁ and B₂ (AFB₁ and AFB₂) biosynthesis. Complete inhibition was observed at an IV-EO concentration of 3.6 μL/mL. Analysis in an in vivo (food system) demonstrated that IV-EO inhibited AFB₁ and AFB₂ accumulation in lotus seeds to varying degrees depending on its concentration, and completely inhibited aflatoxin production at concentrations above 6.0 μL/g. Morphological studies carried out using SEM revealed that ultra-structural changes in the hyphae and conidiophore structures following IV-EO treatment. Therefore, IV-EO has demonstrated its practical efficacy as a new biological fumigant in the preservation of lotus seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aIllicium verum 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin B2 3aantifungal properties 3abiosynthesis 3aessential oils 3afumigants 3afungal contamination 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahyphae 3alimonene 3amethyl chavicol 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amycelium 3aseeds 3aspores 3atoxicology 3atoxigenic strains 0aIllicium verum essential oil 0aAspergillus flavus 0aAntifungal activity 0aLotus seed 0aNatural fumigant1 aWang, Yudan1 aKong, Weijun1 aYang, Shihai1 aLuo, Jiaoyang1 aYang, Meihua0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2020 July, v. 141 p.111347-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2020.1113473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245007400200300001800274506007600292520033900368592002800707506003700735650002700772650002300799650002300822650001200845650002200857650001600879700002000895700001900915700002800934700002100962700001800983700002101001700001901022700001901041700002101060700001801081700002201099700002201121700001701143700002301160773013401183856007401317852000901391655001201400IND60659710920221207104301.0190823e20130221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065971092DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc36844g2doi7 aPMC35789722pmcid7 a231654752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChae, Pil Seok10aGlucose-Neopentyl Glycol (GNG) amphiphiles for membrane protein study  ap. 2287-2289.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe development of a new class of surfactants for membrane protein manipulation, “GNG amphiphiles”, is reported.

Many assays are either labour-intensive and require specialised facilities (e.g. virus neutralization assays), or are expensive with suboptimal specificity (e.g. commercial ELISAs and RDTs). Bead-based assays offer a cost-effective alternative and allow for multiplexing to test for antibodies against multiple antigens and against other pathogens. Here, we compare the performance of spike (S) and nucleocapsid (NP) antigens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies in a panel of sera that includes recent (up to six weeks after symptom onset, severe n = 44; and mild cases n = 52) and old infections (five months after symptom onset, mild n = 104), using a Luminex-bead based assay and comparison to a virus neutralization test. While we show that neutralizing antibody levels are significantly lower in mild than in severe cases, we demonstrate that a combination of the recombinant nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) results in highly specific (99 %) IgG antibody detection five months after infection in 96 % of cases. Although most severe Covid-19 cases developed a clear IgM and IgA response, titers fell below the detection threshold in more than 20 % of mild cases in our bead-based assay. In conclusion, our data supports the use of RBD and NP for the development of SARS-CoV-2 serological IgG bead-based assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantibody detection 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aneutralization tests 3anucleocapsid 3anucleocapsid proteins 0aSars-CoV-2 0aBead-based assay 0aSerosurveillance 0aLuminex antibody test 0aVirus neutralization test1 aCeulemans, Ann1 aMichiels, Johan1 aHeyndrickx, Leo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5862-78211 aKerkhof, Karen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2208-99021 aFoque, Nikki1 aWiddowson, Marc-Alain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0682-69331 aMortgat, Laure1 aDuysburgh, Els1 aDesombere, Isabelle1 aJansens, Hilde1 aVan Esbroeck, Marjan1 aAriën, Kevin K.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2021 Feb., v. 288 p.114025-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2020.1140253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003600139245019800175300001800373520153400391592002801925650002001953650001301973650002701986650002202013650003402035650001802069650001302087650001802100651001802118651001402136700002402150700002102174700001702195773012502212856007502337852000902412655001202421IND60534728720170606000000.0160803e20130702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053472872DNAL7 a10.1021/es40112562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalbán-Malagón, Cristóbal
J.14aThe “Degradative” and “Biological” Pumps Controls on the Atmospheric Deposition and Sequestration of Hexachlorocyclohexanes and Hexachlorobenzene in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans  ap. 7195-7203.  aThe cycling of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) has been studied in the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean. Concentrations of HCHs and HCB were measured simultaneously in the atmosphere (gas and aerosol phases), seawater (dissolved and particulate phases), and phytoplankton. The atmospheric concentrations of HCHs decrease during transport over the Greenland Current with estimated e-folding times of 1.6 days, a trend not observed for HCB. This strong decrease in atmospheric concentrations of HCH is consistent with the estimated atmospheric depositional fluxes driven by the air–water disequilibrium. The removal of HCHs from the surface ocean by the degradative pump due to hydrolysis and microbial degradation and by the biological pump due to settling of particle-associated HCHs are estimated; the removal fluxes are within a factor of 2 of the atmospheric inputs for most sampling events, suggesting an important role of the degradative pump in the overall oceanic sink of HCHs. Conversely, the lack of degradation of HCB in surface waters and its relatively low hydrophobicity imply a lack of effective removal processes, consistent with the observed air and water concentrations close to equilibrium. This work is the first that estimates the relative importance of the biological and degradative pumps on the atmospheric deposition of the less persistent organic pollutants and points out the need for further research for quantifying the magnitude of degradative processes in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric deposition 3ahexachlorobenzene 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aphytoplankton 3aseawater 3asurface water 3aArctic region 3aGreenland1 aBerrojalbiz, Naiara1 aGioia, Rosalinda1 aDachs, Jordi0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 July 02, v. 47, no. 13 p.7195-7203dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes40112563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01435naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009800161300002000259520032000279592002800599650000800627650002600635650002700661650002300688650001300711650001100724650001300735650001800748700002200766700002200788700001800810700002500828773013700853856007400990852000901064655001201073IND60659711120221119173428.0190823e20121121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065971112DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc36859e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRullaud, Vanessa10aDNA surface coating of calixarene-based nanoparticles: a sequence-dependent binding mechanism  ap. 12186-12188.  aAn amphiphilic calix[4]arene derivative bearing four guanidino moieties at the upper rim and four dodecyl chains at the lower rim was shown to form stable solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) in water.

PRRS virus (PRRSV) has undergone rapid evolution since its first recognition in 1990s. In the present study, a PRRSV strain named FJXS15 causing high morbidity and mortality was isolated from piglets and sows from a farm participating in vaccination in China. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses revealed that FJXS15 was highly similar to the JXA1-R vaccine strain (a live attenuated virus vaccine strain derived from the highly pathogenic PRRSV JXA1) in the ORF1a (nt 901-)−ORF4 (-nt 419) coding regions, as well as to FJZ03 (lineage 1, NADC30-like) in the 5′-UTR, ORF5a−ORF7 coding regions, and 3′-UTR, suggestive of a natural recombination event. Recombination analyses showed that recombination events occurred in two inter-lineage recombination events between Lineages 1 and 8 based on based on classification system (Shi et al., 2010), and two recombination breakpoints at positions 1–1092 and 13771–15537 of the sequence alignment (with reference to the VR-2332 strain). Animal experiments demonstrated that FJXS15-infected animals had more severe histopathological lung lesions than did JXA1-R-infected and control groups. A 25% mortality rate was found in FJXS15-infected piglets, which was similar to that found with other Chinese HP-PRRSV strains. Thus, the recombinant virus is a highly virulent PRRSV. Moreover, this report provides evidence for inter-subgenotypic recombination between the JXA1-R vaccine virus and a circulating Lineage 1 virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3afarms 3afinancial economics 3ahistopathology 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aphylogeny 3apiglets 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3asequence alignment 3asows 3avaccination 3avaccines 3avirulence 3aviruses 3aChina 0aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 0aHP-PRRSV 0aVaccine 0aNADC30-like 0aRecombination 0aPathogenicity1 aZhou, Xia1 aZhai, Junqiong1 aWei, Chunhua1 aDai, Ailing1 aYang, Xiaoyan1 aLuo, Manlin0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 May, v. 204 p.110-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012400162300001600286520102700302592002801329650001201357650002101369650001501390650001901405650001101424650001401435650001101449650000701460650001501467700002201482773012201504856007801626852000901704655001201713IND60519235620221121024742.0160422e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051923562DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2015001512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSommer, Felix10aKnow your neighbor: Microbiota and host epithelial cells interact locally to control intestinal function and physiology  ap. 455-464.  aInteractions between the host and its associated microbiota differ spatially and the local cross talk determines organ function and physiology. Animals and their organs are not uniform but contain several functional and cellular compartments and gradients. In the intestinal tract, different parts of the gut carry out different functions, tissue structure varies accordingly, epithelial cells are differentially distributed and gradients exist for several physicochemical parameters such as nutrients, pH, or oxygen. Consequently, the microbiota composition also differs along the length of the gut, but also between lumen and mucosa of the same intestinal segment, and even along the crypt‐villus axis in the epithelium. Thus, host‐microbiota interactions are highly site‐specific and the local cross talk determines intestinal function and physiology. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of site‐specific host‐microbiota interactions and discuss their functional relevance for host physiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aepithelial cells 3aintestines 3amicroorganisms 3amucosa 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphysiology1 aBäckhed, Fredrik0 tBioEssays.g2016 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.455-464dPublished for ICSU Press by Cambridge University Pressx0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2015001513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04177naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012800169300001600297520240900313592002802722650001902750650001402769650001202783650001102795650002102806650002502827650001702852650001702869650001902886650000902905650001602914650001202930650002202942650001802964650001202982650001202994650002903006650002103035650001603056650001303072650001203085650001603097650001203113650000903125650003403134650001803168651001203186653002103198653002603219653001003245653001803255653001703273653001603290700001903306700002403325773009703349856008403446852000903530655001203539IND60547467920221121001320.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054746792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2014.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKechnie, Jon10aForest carbon accounting methods and the consequences of forest bioenergy for national greenhouse gas emissions inventories  ap. 164-173.  aWhile bioenergy plays a key role in strategies for increasing renewable energy deployment, studies assessing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from forest bioenergy systems have identified a potential trade-off of the system with forest carbon stocks. Of particular importance to national GHG inventories is how trade-offs between forest carbon stocks and bioenergy production are accounted for within the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector under current and future international climate change mitigation agreements. Through a case study of electricity produced using wood pellets from harvested forest stands in Ontario, Canada, this study assesses the implications of forest carbon accounting approaches on net emissions attributable to pellets produced for domestic use or export. Particular emphasis is placed on the forest management reference level (FMRL) method, as it will be employed by most Annex I nations in the next Kyoto Protocol Commitment Period. While bioenergy production is found to reduce forest carbon sequestration, under the FMRL approach this trade-off may not be accounted for and thus not incur an accountable AFOLU-related emission, provided that total forest harvest remains at or below that defined under the FMRL baseline. In contrast, accounting for forest carbon trade-offs associated with harvest for bioenergy results in an increase in net GHG emissions (AFOLU and life cycle emissions) lasting 37 or 90 years (if displacing coal or natural gas combined cycle generation, respectively). AFOLU emissions calculated using the Gross-Net approach are dominated by legacy effects of past management and natural disturbance, indicating near-term net forest carbon increase but longer-term reduction in forest carbon stocks. Export of wood pellets to EU markets does not greatly affect the total life cycle GHG emissions of wood pellets. However, pellet exporting countries risk creating a considerable GHG emissions burden, as they are responsible for AFOLU and bioenergy production emissions but do not receive credit for pellets displacing fossil fuel-related GHG emissions. Countries producing bioenergy from forest biomass, whether for domestic use or for export, should carefully consider potential implications of alternate forest carbon accounting methods to ensure that potential bioenergy pathways can contribute to GHG emissions reduction targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acoal 3aelectricity 3aexports 3aforest management 3aforest stands 3aforests 3afossils 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainventories 3aland use 3amarkets 3anatural gas 3apellets 3arisk 3astandard operating procedures 3awood products 3aOntario 0aForest bioenergy 0aLife cycle assessment 0aAFOLU 0aForest carbon 0aWood pellets 0aElectricity1 aColombo, Steve1 aMacLean, Heather L.0 tEnvironmental Science and Policy.g2014 Dec., v. 44 p.164-173dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2014.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009200165520145400257592002801711650002301739650002001762650002701782650001401809650001501823650001901838650002701857650001101884650001401895650001701909650001401926650002801940650001201968650001801980650001401998650003702012650002202049650002802071650001502099653001902114653002002133653001402153653001502167653001102182653001402193700002702207700002602234700002102260700002102281700002002302700002302322700002302345700002402368773011202392856008202504852000902586655001202595IND60689819420221121053456.0210428e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068981942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2020.1113672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Sarbari10aBacopa monnieri inhibits apoptosis and senescence through mitophagy in human astrocytes  aBenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is a potent neurotoxic agent that is responsible for impaired neuronal development and is associated with aging. Here, it was demonstrated that extracts of Bacopa monnieri (BM), a traditional Ayurvedic medicine, diminished the B[a]P-induced apoptosis and senescence in human astrocytes. BM was demonstrated to protect the immortalized primary fetal astrocytes (IMPHFA) from B[a]P-induced apoptosis and senescence by reducing the damaged mitochondria that produced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, it was shown that B[a]P-triggered G2 arrest could be altered by BM, thus indicating that BM could reverse the cell cycle arrest and mediate a normal cell cycle in IMPHFA cells. In addition, the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans was assessed, which confirmed these effects in the presence of BM, compared to the B[a]P-treated group. Furthermore, the anti-senescence and anti-apoptotic activities of BM were observed to be mediated through the protective effect of mitophagy, and inhibition of mitophagy could not protect the astrocytes from mitochondrial ROS-induced apoptosis and senescence in BM-treated cells. Moreover, it was revealed that BM induced Parkin-dependent mitophagy to exert its cytoprotective activity in IMPHFA cells. In conclusion, the anti-senescence and anti-apoptotic effects of BM in astrocytes could combat pollution and aging-related neurological disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aBacopa monnieri 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aapoptosis 3aastrocytes 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acell cycle checkpoints 3ahumans 3alongevity 3amitochondria 3amitophagy 3anervous system diseases 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicology 0aBenzo[a]pyrene 0aBacopa monnieri 0aApoptosis 0aSenescence 0aParkin 0aMitophagy1 aMahapatra, Kewal Kumar1 aMishra, Soumya Ranjan1 aMallick, Swarupa1 aNegi, Vidya Devi1 aSarangi, Itisam1 aPatil, Sankargouda1 aPatra, Samir Kumar1 aBhutia, Sujit Kumar0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2020 July, v. 141 p.111367-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2020.1113673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245016600157300001600323520141600339592002801755650002201783650001601805650001301821650002001834650001101854650001301865650001201878650001501890650001201905650002701917651001801944700002201962773012001984856004802104852000902152655001202161IND4478858420221116202048.0130318e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447885842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-011-1919-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Ran10aLipase-Catalyzed Synthesis of Saccharide-Fatty Acid Esters Utilizing Solvent-Free Suspensions: Effect of Acyl Donors and Acceptors, and Enzyme Activity Retention  ap. 455-463.  aThe effect of acyl donor (oleic, caprylic, lauric and myristic acids) and acceptor (fructose, sucrose, glucose and xylose) for synthesis of saccharide-fatty acid esters was conducted using solvent-free (50–200 μm sized) suspensions of saccharide crystals in a mixture of fatty acid/fructose oleate (90 wt% monoester and 10 wt% diester) at a ratio of 75/25 w/w initially, and a bioreactor system containing a packed bed bioreactor filled with immobilized Rhizomucor miehei lipase (Lipozyme®IM, Novozymes, Franklinton, NC, USA) at 53 °C or a stirred tank bioreactor (STBR) at 65 °C. A nearly linear relationship between initial saccharide concentration and initial rate of reaction and final ester concentration was achieved which was independent of acyl donor or acceptor type. Slightly lower reaction rate and yield were obtained for operation in STBRs. Suspensions containing the highest saccharide concentration coincided with saccharide crystals of the smallest average size, since large-sized crystals sedimented out during the workup for formation of the suspensions. The best performance was achieved using fructose and oleic acid as substrates (92.3 wt% ester, consisting of 92 wt% monoester) in a packed-bed bioreactor (PBBR). The activity of RML did not decrease appreciably after four successive runs for solvent-free fructose-oleate esterification, or equivalently, a 22 day reaction period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizomucor miehei 3abioreactors 3acrystals 3aenzyme activity 3aesters 3afructose 3aglucose 3aoleic acid 3asucrose 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aUnited States1 aHayes, Douglas G.0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2012 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.455-463dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-011-1919-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012100152300002000273520168500293592002801978650001502006650002602021650003402047650001502081650001302096650001902109650002102128700001702149700001502166700001902181773012302200856007402323852000902397655001202406IND60640455520221119165413.0190504e20160510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064045552DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra02671k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Fan10aFabrication of piezoelectric fiber composites by the double cutting–filling method and properties characterisation  ap. 45624-45629.  aFine-scaled piezoelectric fiber composites (PFCs) were successfully fabricated by the so-called double cutting–filling method developed in this research. The fabricated PFCs consisted of interdigitated electrodes, epoxy resin and piezoelectric fibers. The microstructure, piezoelectric properties, mechanical properties, free strain and sensing properties of the fabricated PFCs were characterized. It has been found that the fabricated PFCs with an active area of 50 × 30 mm² exhibited good coupling between the electrodes and fibers, which is highly required. The relative dielectric constant (εᵣ) and dielectric loss (tan δ) of the fabricated PFCs were 1961 and 0.054, respectively. The tensile strength reached 49.28 MPa and 36.18 MPa in the longitudinal and transverse directions, respectively, indicating that high and comparable tensile strength was achieved in both directions. The longitudinal free strain of the PFCs reached about 1400 με and the transverse free strain 680 με at a 2 kV peak-to-peak sinusoidal alternating voltage, suggesting that the PFCs exhibited good orthotropic properties, as desired. The longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d₃₃) of the PFCs reached 518 pC N⁻¹. The fabricated PFCs also exhibited desirable anisotropic sensing properties which can be utilized to quantify the origin of excitation in damage detection of composites. The PFCs developed in this study featured excellent piezoelectric and mechanical properties, high free strain, desirable orthotropic mechanical properties and excellent anisotropic sensing properties, which helps to extend their applications in self-diagnosis and adaptive smart structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3adielectric properties 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aepoxides 3amicrostructure 3atensile strength1 aLin, Xiujuan1 aMa, Yupeng1 aHuang, Shifeng0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 10, v. 6, no. 51 p.45624-45629dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra02671k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245005500160300001600215520099100231592002801222650001901250650001501269650002401284650001001308650001601318650001301334650002401347650002301371700002201394773012201416856007801538852000901616655001201625IND60519235820221122190418.0160422e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051923582DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2015001622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Payal10aMutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer  ap. 446-454.  aThe Polycomb group of proteins (PcGs) are transcriptional repressor complexes that regulate important biological processes and play critical roles in cancer. Mutating or deleting EZH2 can have both oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions by increasing or decreasing H3K27me3. In contrast, mutations of SUZ12 and EED are reported to have tumor suppressive functions. EZH2 is overexpressed in many cancers, including prostate cancer, which can lead to silencing of tumor suppressors, genes regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and interferon signaling. In some cases, EZH2 overexpression also leads to its use of non‐histone substrates. Lastly, PRC2 associated factors can influence the progression of cancer through progressive mutations or by specific binding to certain target genes. Here, we discuss which mutations and deletions of the PRC2 complex have been detected in different cancers, with a specific focus on the overexpression of EZH2 in prostate cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease course 3aepithelium 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ainterferons 3amutation 3aprostatic neoplasms 3arepressor proteins1 aDi Croce, Luciano0 tBioEssays.g2016 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.446-454dPublished for ICSU Press by Cambridge University Pressx0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2015001623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003500152245012100187300001300308500001900321520186700340592002802207650002002235650001002255650001902265650001202284650001502296650001202311650001402323650001302337650001502350650002202365653002402387653003802411653002602449653001302475653000902488700002402497700002102521773010002542856008602642852000902728655001202737IND60693812920210618000000.0200508e20020101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069381292DNAL7 a10.1080/11956860.2002.116826842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolenweg Peter, Anna-Katherina10aSpecies and sex ratio differences in mixed populations of hybridogenetic water frogs: The influence of pond features  ap. 1-11.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmong closely related species with overlapping fundamental niches, usually one species excludes the other(s) unless they differ in their realized niches. In some instances, however, niche overlap is inevitable. One example is European water frogs of the Rana lessonae / R. ridibunda / R. esculenta-complex, where the hybrid R. esculenta is reproductively dependent on one or the other of the two parental species. Hence, it has to live in close sympatry with them, but species and sex ratios in such mixed populations vary widely among ponds. In this paper we investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of the three species by comparing nine ponds with different ecological conditions and frog proportions. All three species occurred in all ponds, but in significantly different absolute and relative numbers. R. lessonae proportions are higher in smaller, more structured ponds with rich vegetation under water while R. ridibunda dominates in larger, less structured ponds with little vegetation under water. The hybrid R. esculenta is intermediate in its distribution; it occurs in larger ponds than R. lessonae, but in more vegetated ones than R. ridibunda. The sex ratios of the three species differ also within the ponds. In R. esculenta, the proportion of females decreased with increasing fluctuation in water temperature. The observed spatial distribution of adults is best explained through species differences in the habitat-related development and survival of their progeny, which is known from several experiments. Temporal changes in species proportions were not related to pond characteristics. This, however, is not surprising, as year-to-year changes in pond features were small, and strong site fidelity, combined with high annual survival, creates substantial temporal autocorrelation between population compositions of successive years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3afrogs 3ahybridogenesis 3ahybrids 3aphilopatry 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3asympatry 3avegetation 3awater temperature 0aSpecies composition 0aSpatial and temporal distribution 0aEcological conditions 0aAmphibia 0aRana1 aReyer, Heinz-Ulrich1 aAbt Tietje, Gaby0 tÉcoscience.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 9, no. 1 p.1-11dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2002.116826843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245008300199300001800282500001700300506007600317520073700393592002801130506003701158650002701195650001601222650001201238650001001250650001201260650001701272650001101289650001001300650001201310650002201322650002801344650001001372700006101382700002101443700006801464700002101532700006201553773014101615856007401756852000901830655001201839IND60606759420221207125331.0180727e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060675942DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.152182doi7 aPMC60603292pmcid7 a299578352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinn, Toby L.10aPersistent hypoglycemia associated with lipid storage myopathy in a paint foal  ap. 1442-1446.  aCase Reports  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA 12‐hours‐old Paint filly was examined because of weakness and dull mentation after birth.

This article reviews recent advances in understanding the origins and purposes of the complex dynamical behavior of the phosphorelay, which pulses with peaks of activity coordinated with the cell cycle. The transient imbalance in the expression of two critical genes caused by their strategic placement at opposing ends of the chromosome proved to be the key for this pulsed behavior. Feedback control loops in the phosphorelay use these pulses to implement a timer mechanism, which creates several windows of opportunity for phenotypic transitions over multiple generations. This strategy allows the cell to coordinate multiple differentiation programs in a decision process that fosters phenotypic diversity and adapts to current conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3acell cycle 3achromosomes 3agenes 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3asporulation 3astarvation0 tBioEssays.g2016 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.440-445dPublished for ICSU Press by Cambridge University Pressx0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2015001993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009800176300001600274520115900290536028701449592002801736650001301764650001801777650002201795650001201817650002801829650001301857650001101870650001901881653002801900653001801928653002301946653003201969653001402001700002102015700002102036700001502057700001802072773012902090856008602219852000902305655001202314IND60776289220221121110105.0220609e20220504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077628922DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2021.19098002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaboktakin, Abbasali10aFailure analysis of 3D stitched composite using multi-scale approach for aerospace structures  ap. 943-951.  aFinite element modeling is an excellent technique for simulating a stitched woven composite to determine its mechanical properties and the analysis of the damage progress. In this technique, actual textile tow geometry measurements based on textile fiber photomicrographs are used to make the internal geometry of the fabric. In this paper, a unit-cell of the stitched composite was generated in micro and mesoscale geometric in the first step, and afterward, unit-cell was imported to finite element analysis software. Besides, a code for calculating the mechanical coefficient of the stitched composite was implemented in the micro and meso models. Finally, a user-defined subroutine implements the damage model in the finite element code to predict damage initiation of the stitched composite. The results of finite element modeling indicate a good agreement between experimental results and theoretical results.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the decision and intensity of adaptation to this phenomenon among farmers in Central Chile and to identify the factors that influence the adoption of adaptation measures. The list of adaptation practices was created with the assistance of a panel of experts. A two-part hurdle model was used to identify the adoption and intensity of adoption. The decision to adapt is strongly influenced by land tenure security and access to weather information, which increase the probability of adaptation by 13% and 30%, respectively. The intensity of adaptation is highly influenced by affiliation to a farm organization or association, which tends to boost intensity by 72.2%. Land tenure also increases intensity by 44.5%. Years of experience in agriculture and the income obtained from crops in the previous season also have a positive impact. Empirical results reveal that the most effective way to reduce barriers to adaptation is to improve access to information, while a highly relevant mode to increase the intensity of adaptation is to encourage social networking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aexperts 3afarmers 3afarms 3aincome 3aland tenure 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aprobability 3aChile 0aClimate change 0aAdaptation practices 0aFarm practices 0aAgricultural systems 0aHurdle model 0aChile1 aEngler, Alejandra1 aBravo-Ureta, Boris1 aJara-Rojas, Roberto0 tEnvironmental Science and Policy.g2014 Dec., v. 44 p.86-96dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2014.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012500161300001600286500001500302520138700317592002801704650002101732650001101753650002501764650001901789650001601808650002201824650001601846650001901862650001801881651001001899653002501909700002201934700001601956773010701972856004802079852000902127655001202136IND50090600620221122231314.0140626e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009060062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12040-014-0437-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoxy, M S10aSoil heat flux and day time surface energy balance closure at astronomical observatory, Thiruvananthapuram, south Kerala  ap. 741-750.  a2019-12-05  aSoil heat flux is an important input component of surface energy balance. Estimates of soil heat flux were made in the year 2008 using soil temperature data at Astronomical Observatory, Thiruvananthapuram, south Kerala. Hourly values of soil heat flux from 00 to 24 LST are presented for selected days typical of the winter, pre-monsoon, SW monsoon and NE monsoon seasons. The diurnal variation is characterized by a cross-over from negative to positive values at 0700 h, occurrence of maximum around noon and return to negative values in the late evening. The energy storage term for the soil layer 0–0.05 m is calculated and the ground heat flux G ∗ is estimated in all seasons. Daytime surface energy balance at the surface on wet and dry seasons is investigated. The average Bowen’s ratio during the wet and dry seasons were 0.541 and 0.515, respectively indicating that considerable evaporation takes place at the surface. The separate energy balance components were examined and the mean surface energy balance closure was found to be 0.742 and 0.795 for wet and dry seasons, respectively. When a new method that accounts for both soil thermal conduction and soil thermal convection was adopted to calculate the surface heat flux, the energy balance closure was found to be improved. Thus on the land surface under study, the soil vertical water movement is significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil temperature 3awinter 3aEarth system science 3amonsoon season 3amethodology 3adiurnal variation 3aevaporation 3aenergy balance 3aheat transfer 3aIndia 0aearth system science1 aSumithranand, V B1 aRenuka, G.,0 tJournal of earth system science.g2014 June, v. 123, no. 4 p.741-750dSpringer-Verlagx0253-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-014-0437-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003400164245012100198300001600319520166200335592002801997650001602025650001302041650001702054650001602071650001302087650001302100650001302113650001202126650001702138650001002155650001002165650001002175650002202185650002402207650001902231650001202250650006202262650001102324650005602335650002202391650000902413650005502422650007002477700002302547700002902570700002202599773010102621856004802722852000902770655001202779IND4474897620221118054957.0120519e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447489762DNAL7 a225557712pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-012-0126-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsdotter-Mellström, Helena10aTiming of Male Sex Pheromone Biosynthesis in a Butterfly – Different Dynamics under Direct or Diapause Development  ap. 584-591.  aThe life history traits and behavior of the butterfly Pieris napi are well-known, as the species is often used as a model organism for evolutionary and ecological studies. The species has two or more generations per year in the major part of its temperate distribution, and as different selection pressures affect the different generations, both behavioral and physiological seasonal polyphenisms have been shown previously. Here, we explored the dynamics of male sex pheromone production. The two generations are shown to have significantly different scent compositions early in life; the direct developers—who have shorter time for pupal development—need the first 24 hr of adult life after eclosion to synthesize the sex pheromone citral (geranial and neral 1:1)—whereas the diapausing individuals who have spent several months in the pupal stage eclose with adult scent composition. Resource allocation and biosynthesis also were studied in greater detail by feeding butterflies 13C labeled glucose either in the larval or adult stage, and recording incorporation into geranial, neral, and other volatiles produced. Results demonstrate that the pheromone synthesized by newly eclosed adult males is based on materials ingested in the larval stage, and that adult butterflies are able to synthesize the pheromone components geranial and neral and the related alcohols also from adult intake of glucose. In summary, our study shows that time-stress changes the timing in biosynthesis of the complete pheromone between generations, and underpins the importance of understanding resource allocation and the physiological basis of life history traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPieris napi 3aalcohols 3abiosynthesis 3abutterflies 3adiapause 3aeclosion 3ageranial 3aglucose 3alife history 3amales 3aneral 3aodors 3apupal development 3aresource allocation 3asex pheromones 2aAnimals 2aButterfliesxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aLarvaxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aMale 2aPupaxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSex Attractantsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism.1 aMurtazina, Rushana1 aBorg-Karlson, Anna-Karin1 aWiklund, Christer0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2012 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.584-591dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-012-0126-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001600160245008700176300001600263500000900279520093000288592002801218650002201246650001001268650002201278700002301300700002101323773012301344852000901467856009701476655001201573IND2048847220221118092843.0191122e199209  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204884722DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1992.00021962008400050027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodges, Tom12aA Modular Structure for Crop Simulation Models: Implemented in the SIMPOTATO Model  ap. 911-915.  aepub  aA highly modular structure has been developed for crop growth simulation models and implemented in the SIMPOTATO model, a model based on the standards of the IBSNAT (International Benchmarks Sites Network for Agrotechnology Transfer) project. The model structure features top-down design, modularity, high cohesiveness, loose coupling, and data hiding. SIMPOTATO is composed of (i) an upper level module to run the model, (ii) an experiment selection module, (iii) an initialization module, (iv) a simulator module, (v) the crop and soil processes module, (vi) a start/stop module, (vii) a report writing module, and (viii) a graphic display module. Each module is composed of one or more subroutines and functions. Such a modular structure facilitates transferring improvements between models, combining models into multi-crop models and crop/pest models, and modifying models for new applications.

However, results of single species toxicity tests indicate these organisms are quite tolerant, with LC50 values often several orders of magnitude greater than those obtained using standard test organisms (e.g., cladocerans and fathead minnows). Reconciling these differences is a critical research need, particularly since water quality criteria for metals are based primarily on results of single species toxicity tests. In this research we provide evidence based on community-level microcosm experiments to support the hypothesis that some aquatic insects are highly sensitive to metals. We present results of three experiments that quantified effects of Cu and Zn, alone and in combination, on stream insect communities. EC50 values, defined as the metal concentration that reduced abundance of aquatic insects by 50%, were several orders of magnitude lower than previously published values obtained from single species tests. We hypothesize that the short duration of laboratory toxicity tests and the failure to evaluate effects of metals on sensitive early life stages are the primary factors responsible for unrealistically high LC50 values in the literature. We also observed that Cu alone was significantly more toxic to aquatic insects than the combination of Cu and Zn, despite the fact that exposure concentrations represented theoretically similar toxicity levels. Our results suggest that water quality criteria for Zn were protective of most aquatic insects, whereas Cu was highly toxic to some species at concentrations near water quality criteria. Because of the functional significance of aquatic insects in stream ecosystems and their well-established importance as indicators of water quality, reconciling differences between field and laboratory responses and understanding the mechanisms responsible for variation in sensitivity among metals and metal mixtures is of critical importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphemeroptera 3aPlecoptera 3aaquatic insects 3acopper 3adevelopmental stages 3aecosystems 3ainsect communities 3alethal concentration 50 3amedian effective concentration 3astreams 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3awater quality criteria 3azinc1 aCadmus, Pete1 aBrinkman, Stephen

This study reports the identification of OaPV4, a novel ovine PV type within Deltapapillomaviruses 3. The study of OaPV4 genomic features combined to in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry investigations allowed extrapolating several general biological features of ovine PVs, such as their cellular tropism, pathogenicity, and evolutionary history. Based on results, ovine PVs can be grouped into a polyphyletic ancient group of viruses, which splits in two main subgroups having peculiar cellular tropism and pathogenicity. Results add up to animal PV diversity and are crucial to future studies aimed to investigate the correlation between animal PV and cutaneous benign and malign proliferations.  aPublisher supplied data 3ain situ hybridization 3aimmunohistochemistry 3agenome 3asheep 3aDeltapapillomavirus 3apathogenicity 3aviruses 3awild animals 3apolyphyly 0aViral evolution 0aGenome characterizaton 0aCancer 0areports 0aViral oncogenesis 0aHost cell tropism1 aCacciotto, Carla1 aAnfossi, Antonio Giovanni1 aDore, Gian Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7171-41561 aAntuofermo, Elisabetta1 aScagliarini, Alessandra1 aBurrai, Giovanni Pietro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7696-74781 aPau, Salvatore1 aZedda, Maria Teresa1 aMasala, Gerolamo1 aPittau, Marco1 aAlberti, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1708-94730 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 May, v. 204 p.151-158dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003300144245012800177300001600305520115700321592002801478650002301506650001901529650001101548650001801559650001601577650002201593650002101615650001901636650002201655650001501677650001201692650002401704650001101728650002201739650001101761650001901772650001701791650001501808650001101823650001901834650001801853650001801871650002501889700003101914773012201945856007802067852000902145655001202154IND60519236120221121045909.0160422e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051923612DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2015001432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia‐Quintanilla, Albert10aExtraintestinal manifestations of celiac disease: 33‐mer gliadin binding to glutamate receptor GRINA as a new explanation  ap. 427-439.  aWe propose a biochemical mechanism for celiac disease and non‐celiac gluten sensitivity that may rationalize many of the extradigestive disorders not explained by the current immunogenetic model.

The theory is supported by numerous independent data from the literature, and provides a mechanistic link with otherwise unrelated disorders, such as cleft lip and palate, thyroid dysfunction, restless legs syndrome, depression, ataxia, hearing loss, fibromyalgia, dermatitis herpetiformis, schizophrenia, toxoplasmosis, anemia, osteopenia, Fabry disease, Barret's adenocarcinoma, neuroblastoma, urinary incontinence, recurrent miscarriage, cardiac anomalies, reduced risk of breast cancer, stiff person syndrome, etc. The hypothesis also anticipates better animal models, and has the potential to open new avenues of research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabortion (animals) 3aadenocarcinoma 3aanemia 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3aataxia (disorder) 3abreast neoplasms 3aceliac disease 3acomputer software 3adermatitis 3agliadin 3aglutamate receptors 3agluten 3ahearing disorders 3ahumans 3aimmunogenetics 3aion channels 3aosteopenia 3apalate 3arisk reduction 3aschizophrenia 3atoxoplasmosis 3aurinary incontinence1 aMiranzo‐Navarro, Domingo0 tBioEssays.g2016 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.427-439dPublished for ICSU Press by Cambridge University Pressx0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2015001433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245004400178300001200222500000900234500001500243520155600258592002801814650001301842650001601855650001001871650002001881650001501901650002201916650001701938650001101955650001901966650001101985651001301996651001202009653001802021700001802039773011802057852000902175856009702184655001202281IND2051716820221118092849.0191122e199601  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205171682DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800010002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortin, M. C.10aLeaf Azimuth in Strip-Intercropped Corn  ap. 6-9.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aIn strip-intercropping conditions where rows of corn (Zea mays L.) are subjected to widely different levels of radiation interception and of water and nutrient competition, leaf azimuthal direction may be an important determinant of yield. Observations of ear leaf direction were made on two outside rows and one middle row of a corn strip grown with small-grain cereal and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] stripintercrops in four trials with north-south rows in Ontario and Michigan. The objectives were to assess if row position within the strip and seed orientation at planting affect leaf azimuth and to find out if ear leaf azimuth and yield are related. In only one of the four trials was there a correlation between yield and the frequency of ears from ear leaves pointing in a specific direction (west). In both locations, row position affected the proportion of ear leaves in a direction perpendicular to the row and toward the inside of the strip rather than toward the outside in the case of border rows. When seed orientation at planting was controlled, 60 to 74% of ear leaves (leaves 11 or 12) developed in the same direction as the embryo orientation or opposite this orientation. Random orientation of the seed resulted in random ear leaf azimuths, except in a very dry growing season, when leaf azimuthal directions were mostly parallel to row direction, minimizing interception of radiation. This suggests that leaf azimuth could be an indicator of water deficit. Contribution from the Ctr. for Land and Biol. Resour.

Two-step approach was employed for the deposition, which offers advantages such as excellent surface adhesion, large area deposition, high reproducibility and yield. Structural characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows a preferred c-axis (002) oriented growth. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images reveals uniformly distributed hexagonal ZnO nanorods with average diameter varying from 80 to 250 nm. Average growth rate of the films was estimated using Surface Profilometer which was found to be ∼1 μm/h. Optical characterizations were carried out using Photo-spectrometer and Raman spectroscopy. The DSSCs using these ZnO films of nanorods array as photo-electrodes show conversion efficiency ranging from 0.24 to −0.71 %, the maximum efficiency was obtained for films deposited for time duration 8 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadhesion 3aglass 3aindium 3ananorods 3aphotovoltaic cells 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atin 3azinc oxide1 aSharma, Rama Kant,1 aGame, Onkar1 aBanpurkar, Arun0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 Jan., v. 11, no. 1S p.S113-S116dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.1113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01425naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014700160300001600307520031300323592002800636650002700664650002300691650001600714650001300730650002000743650001700763650000900780650001300789650002000802700002300822700001700845773013000862856007400992852000901066655001201075IND60659711820221119173819.0190823e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065971182DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc36872b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhalla, Vandana10aCyanide modulated fluorescent supramolecular assembly of a hexaphenylbenzene derivative for detection of trinitrotoluene at the attogram level  ap. 895-897.  aFluorescent nanorods formed by self-assembly of hexaphenylbenzene derivative 3 in the presence of cyanide ions serve as a sensitive colorimetric and fluorogenic sensor for the detection of trinitrotoluene (TNT) at the attogram (10⁻¹⁸ g) level with a detection limit of 10.21 ppq (parts per quadrillion).  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acolorimetry 3acyanides 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aions 3ananorods 3atrinitrotoluene1 aPramanik, Subhamay1 aKumar, Manoj0 tChemical communications.g2013 Jan. 2, v. 49, no. 9 p.895-897dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc36872b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245010200202300001800304500002000322506007600342520185900418592002802277506003702305650001102342650001602353650001902369650001602388650001502404650001302419650001402432650001702446650001402463650001802477650001602495650001702511650001002528650002102538650002102559650002402580650002102604650001702625650001102642650001002653700005902663700002402722700002002746700001902766700002402785773014102809856007402950852000903024655001203033IND60606759920221207102129.0180727e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060675992DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.152132doi7 aPMC60603112pmcid7 a297709762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgne, Gustavo F.10aPharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of orally administered torsemide in healthy horses  ap. 1428-1435.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Diuretic treatment is the mainstay for management of congestive heart failure in horses, and its use has been restricted to injectable medications because no currently data supports the use of PO administered loop diuretics. OBJECTIVES: To determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of PO administered torsemide and, determine if PO administered torsemide, could be used as an alternative to injectable diuretics in the horse. ANIMALS: Six healthy adult mares. METHODS: A 2‐phase, prospective study, that consisted of pharmacokinetic profiling of a single dose (6 mg/kg PO) and pharmacodynamic effects of long‐term torsemide administration (2 mg/kg PO q12h) for 6 days in healthy horses. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis identified a peak concentration (Cₘₐₓ) of 10.14 µg/mL (range, 6.79–14.69 µg/mL) and elimination half‐life (T₁/₂) 9.2 hours (range, 8.4–10.4 hours). The area under the plasma drug concentration over time curve (AUC) was 80.7 µg × h/mL (range, 56.5–117.2 µg × h/mL). A statistically significant increase in urine volume and decrease in urine specific gravity were found from day 0 (baseline) to day 6 (P < .0001). Significant alterations in biochemical variables included hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and increased serum creatinine concentration. Mean arterial blood pressure significantly decreased on day 6 (57.7 ± 8.8 mm Hg, P = .001) as compared with baseline (78 ± 6.1 mm Hg). Serum aldosterone concentrations significantly increased after 6 days of torsemide administration (P = .0006). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: PO administered torsemide (4 mg/kg/day) successfully reached therapeutic concentrations in blood, induced clinically relevant diuresis, and resulted in moderate pre‐renal azotemia and electrolyte disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aaldosterone 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adiuresis 3adiuretics 3aelectrolytes 3ahalf life 3aheart failure 3ahypokalemia 3ahyponatremia 3amares 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3aprospective studies 3aspecific gravity 3atherapeutics 3auremia 3aurine1 aJung, Seung Woo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6313-30841 aWooldridge, Anne A.1 aDuran, Susan H.1 aRavis, William1 aToribio, Ramiro E.,0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 4 p.1428-1435dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.152133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245006500164300001800229520108000247536025701327592002801584596001301612596001401625650001201639650001401651650002501665650001701690650001201707650001601719650002001735650001401755650001301769650001601782653002201798653001201820653001301832653002001845653001101865653001501876700002001891700001601911700001701927773014401944856008602088852000902174655001202183IND60776289720221121170340.0220820e20220503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077628972DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.18658722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dan12aA review of bacterial biofilm control by physical strategies  ap. 3453-3470.  aBiofilms are multicellular communities of microorganisms held together by a self-produced extracellular matrix, which contribute to hygiene problems in the food and medical fields. Both spoilage and pathogenic bacteria that grow in the complex structure of biofilm are more resistant to harsh environmental conditions and conventional antimicrobial agents. Therefore, it is important to develop eco-friendly preventive methodologies to eliminate biofilms from foods and food contact equipment. The present paper gives an overview of the current physical methods for biofilm control and removal. Current physical strategies adopted for the anti-biofilm treatment mainly focused on use of ultrasound power, electric or magnetic field, plasma, and irradiation. Furthermore, the mechanisms of anti-biofilm action and application of different physical methods are discussed. Physical strategies make it possible to combat biofilm without the use of biocidal agents. The remarkable microbiocidal properties of physical strategies are promising tools for antimicrobial applications.  aThe research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (21706037).

Single Layer Model (SLM) mapping function for spaceborne GPS was analyzed. SLM mapping functions at different altitudes were calculated. Ionospheric Pierce Point (IPP) trajectories of the dlft station (An IGS station located at the longitude of 4°23′15.22′′E and the latitude of 51°59′9.63′′N, in the TU Delft University, The Netherlands.) and the GRACE satellite were computed with the corresponding single layer height of 350 and 500 km, respectively. The Klobuchar model was used to compute ionospheric delays for the dlft station, and modified Klobuchar model, together with scale factors, was used to compute the fractional ionospheric corrections above the GRACE altitudes. Calculation results were validated using dual-frequency observations. The study shows that the single layer height needs to be changed from 350 to 500 km according to the altitude of GRACE. Approximate forms of Earth angle and slant factor developed for modified Klobuchar model are applicable to GRACE, with accuracy adequate to preserve the essential elements required to compute ionospheric delays. Results show that the Klobuchar model is effective for ground GPS, and the modified Klobuchar model corrects more than 80% on average of the ionospheric delays for spaceborne single-frequency GPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth system science 3amodels 3alongitude 3alatitude 3aaltitude 3aglobal positioning systems 3aalgorithms 3aNetherlands 0aearth system science1 aLi, Jiancheng1 aZhang, Shoujian0 tJournal of earth system science.g2014 June, v. 123, no. 4 p.767-778dSpringer-Verlagx0253-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-014-0442-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001600176245006800192300001500260520119100275592002801466650001301494650001201507650001201519650001501531650001201546650001901558650002201577650001001599650001401609650001301623650001001636650001001646700001601656700001601672773015201688856007001840856010001910990002302010852000902033655001202042IND60608689520221118032719.0190510e20180623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060868952DNAL7 a10.3791/578632doi7 aPMC61019822pmcid7 a299853172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hongwei10aSingle sensillum recordings for locust palp sensilla basiconica  ap. e57863.  aThe palps of locust mouthparts are considered to be conventional gustatory organs that play an important role in a locust's food selection, especially for the detection of non-volatile chemical cues through sensilla chaetica (previously named terminal sensilla or crested sensilla). There is now increasing evidence that these palps also have an olfactory function. An odorant receptor (LmigOR2) and an odorant-binding protein (LmigOBP1) have been localized in the neurons and accessory cells, respectively, in the sensilla basiconica of the palps. Single sensillum recording (SSR) is used for recording the responses of odorant receptor neurons, which is an effective method for screening active ligands on specific odorant receptors. SSR is used in functional studies of odorant receptors in palp sensilla. The structure of the sensilla basiconica located on the dome of the palps differs somewhat from the structure of those on the antennae. Therefore, when performing an SSR elicited by odorants, some specific advice may be helpful for obtaining optimum results. In this paper, a detailed and highly effective protocol for an SSR from insect palp sensilla basiconica is introduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantennae 3ainsects 3aligands 3amouthparts 3aneurons 3aodor compounds 3aodorant receptors 3apalps 3ascreening 3asensilla 3asmell 3ataste1 aYou, Yinwei1 aZhang, Long0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 June 23, , no. 136 p.e57863-e57863dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/578633Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57863/single-sensillum-recordings-for-locust-palp-sensilla-basiconica  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001600163245006600179300001600245520087900261536011901140592002801259650002101287650000901308650001701317650000901334650001501343650001601358650004301374650001801417650002201435650001801457650001201475650002301487650005701510650004601567650000901613650001101622650003401633650005201667650007001719651001501789651003001804653001401834653000901848653001501857653001301872700001601885773013201901852000902033856008102042655001202123IND4459482420221120040912.0181016e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445948242DNAL7 a219082962pmid7 a10.1177/10406387114041562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLittle, Liz10aCutaneous Hepatozoon canis infection in a dog from New Jersey  ap. 585-588.  aA 7-month-old mixed-breed intact female dog was presented to a private veterinarian with a 2 cm in diameter raised, pruritic, alopecic, subcutaneous, fluctuant swelling over the right eye.

There are many options to design breeding programs, with or without a multiplier tier. Our objectives were to evaluate different breeding program designs for aquaculture and to optimize the number of selection candidates for these programs. METHODS: The baseline was based on an existing breeding program for gilthead seabream, where improvement of the nucleus had priority over improvement of the multiplier tier, which was partly replaced once every 3 years. Alternative breeding programs considered were annual multiplier tier replacement, annual multiplier tier replacement with priority on improvement of the multiplier tier, and a program without a multiplier tier. Cost-benefit analyses were performed to compare breeding programs. The outcomes were used to describe relationships between profitability and the number of selection candidates, length of the time horizon, and production output, and to estimate the optimum numbers of selection candidates. RESULTS: The baseline breeding program was profitable after 5 years and reached a net present value of 2.9 million euro in year 10. All alternative programs were more profitable up to year 17. The program without a multiplier tier was the most profitable one up to year 22, followed by the program with annual multiplier tier replacement and nucleus priority. The optimum number of selection candidates increased with the length of the time horizon and production output. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline breeding program was profitable after 5 years. For a short time horizon, putting priority on improvement of the multiplier tier over the nucleus is more profitable than putting priority on nucleus improvement, and vice versa for a long time horizon. Use of a multiplier tier increases the delay between costs made for selection and resulting benefits. Thus, avoiding the use of a multiplier tier will increase the profitability of the breeding program in the short term. The optimum number of selection candidates increases with the length of the time horizon and production output. Using too many selection candidates relative to the optimum leads to less reduction in profitability than using too few selection candidates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSparus aurata 3aaquaculture 3abreeding programs 3acost benefit analysis 3amultipliers 3aprofitability 3aselection methods1 aSaatkamp, Helmut1 aKomen, Hans0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2018 Dec., v. 50, no. 1 p.2-2dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-018-0372-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245011300179520164800292592002801940650002401968650001501992650001502007650001602022650001302038650001402051650001602065650001102081650002002092650001702112650002002129650005002149650001302199650001602212650002102228650001702249773012802266856008702394852000902481655001202490IND60791035320221120183331.0220826e20220728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079103532DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100815262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuryanova, Svetlana V.10aRegulation of Immune Homeostasis via Muramyl Peptides-Low Molecular Weight Bioregulators of Bacterial Origin  aMetabolites and fragments of bacterial cells play an important role in the formation of immune homeostasis. Formed in the course of evolution, symbiotic relationships between microorganisms and a macroorganism are manifested, in particular, in the regulation of numerous physiological functions of the human body by the innate immunity receptors. Low molecular weight bioregulators of bacterial origin have recently attracted more and more attention as drugs in the prevention and composition of complex therapy for a wide range of diseases of bacterial and viral etiology. Signaling networks show cascades of causal relationships of deterministic phenomena that support the homeostasis of multicellular organisms at different levels. To create networks, data from numerous biomedical and clinical research databases were used to prepare expert systems for use in pharmacological and biomedical research with an emphasis on muramyl dipeptides. Muramyl peptides are the fragments of the cell wall of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Binding of muramyl peptides with intracellular NOD2 receptors is crucial for an immune response on pathogens. Depending on the microenvironment and duration of action, muramyl peptides possess positive or negative regulation of inflammation. Other factors, such as genetic, pollutions, method of application and stress also contribute and should be taken into account. A system biology approach should be used in order to systemize all experimental data for rigorous analysis, with the aim of understanding intrinsic pathways of homeostasis, in order to define precise medicine therapy and drug design.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomedical research 3acell walls 3adipeptides 3adrug design 3aetiology 3aevolution 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3aintracellular signaling peptides and proteins 3amedicine 3ametabolites 3amolecular weight 3atherapeutics0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 28, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100815263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03618naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016900168300001600337520205200353592002802405650002002433650001402453650001202467650001202479650001502491650000902506650001402515650002502529650001302554650002402567650001402591650001402605650001302619650001002632650001202642650000902654651002202663651001902685653002002704653002602724653002102750653001602771653003002787700001402817700001702831700001402848700001702862773010402879856008402983852000903067655001203076IND60122900820221118035703.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012290082DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2013.8371052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattaglia, P.10aCephalopods in the diet of young-of-the-year bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus L. 1758, Pisces: Scombridae) from the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (central Mediterranean Sea)  ap. 560-565.  aInformation on distribution and abundance of cephalopods inhabiting pelagic water masses is often not available because of the difficulty of applying conventional methods in this remote habitat. An alternative source of information is represented by stomach content analysis of pelagic predators that are known to be efficient cephalopod prey collectors. This study focuses on the occurrence of cephalopod prey in the diet of young-of-the-year bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus L. 1758, Pisces: Scombridae) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (central Mediterranean). Overall, 139 fishes were sampled by trolling lines or purse-seine in a Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) area and as by-catch of the purse-seine sardine fishery, from 1998 to 2000 between July and November. Cephalopods found in the stomach contents were identified to the lowest possible taxon and, when digestion was too advanced, beaks from stomachs were considered as the best taxonomic feature for classification. Of a total of 1233 cephalopod prey, 1144 individuals were identified, belonging to 15 species. Onychoteuthis banksii was the most common prey (%N = 58.39), followed by Heteroteuthis dispar (%N = 23.03). This importance was confirmed also in terms of biomass with O. banksii and H. dispar that respectively reached 39.41% and 21.23% in weight, followed by Todarodes sagittatus (%W = 20.16). In general, young-of-the-year bluefin tunas are able to feed on a large spectrum of cephalopod prey in the study area, usually relying on juvenile specimens and epipelagic and mesopelagic shoaling species. In fact, the identified preys mainly belong to muscular squids (71%) and sepiolids (25%), but pelagic octopuses, buoyant squids and juvenile demersal octopuses were also recorded. These data provide further information on the feeding habits of T. thynnus , relative to a poorly investigated life stage. The improving knowledge on trophic relationships of young tunas and their reliance on cephalopod taxa is an important step in supporting management of this fishery resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThunnus thynnus 3aTodarodes 3abiomass 3abycatch 3acollectors 3adiet 3adigestion 3afisheries management 3ahabitats 3ainformation sources 3ajuveniles 3apredators 3asardines 3asquid 3astomach 3atuna 3aMediterranean Sea 3aTyrrhenian Sea 0aThunnus thynnus 0amesopelagic diversity 0astomach contents 0acephalopods 0acentral Mediterranean Sea1 aPedà, C.1 aSinopoli, M.1 aRomeo, T.1 aAndaloro, F.0 tItalian journal of zoology.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 80, no. 4 p.560-565dTaylor & Francisx1748-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2013.8371053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245004300161300001800204520112700222592002801349650001601377650002401393650003601417650001101453650001801464650001401482650001101496650001101507650001901518653001601537653001401553653000901567653001901576653002401595700001901619700001501638700001501653700001401668700002701682700001601709700001701725700002501742773012601767856007801893852000901971655001201980IND60529041820221119225437.0160717e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052904182DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b114382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wenqing10aProbing the Buried Magnetic Interfaces  ap. 5752-5757.  aUnderstanding magnetism in ferromagnetic metal/semiconductor (FM/SC) heterostructures is important to the development of the new-generation spin field-effect transistor. Here, we report an element-specific X-ray magnetic circular dichroism study of the interfacial magnetic moments for two FM/SC model systems, namely, Co/GaAs and Ni/GaAs, which was enabled using a specially designed FM₁/FM₂/SC superstructure. We observed a robust room temperature magnetization of the interfacial Co, while that of the interfacial Ni was strongly diminished down to 5 K because of hybridization of the Ni d(eg) and GaAs sp³ states. The validity of the selected method was confirmed by first-principles calculations, showing only small deviations (<0.02 and <0.07 μB/atom for Co/GaAs and Ni/GaAs, respectively) compared to the real FM/SC interfaces. Our work proved that the electronic structure and magnetic ground state of the interfacial FM₂ is not altered when the topmost FM₂ is replaced by FM₁ and that this model is applicable generally for probing the buried magnetic interfaces in the advanced spintronic materials..  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aambient temperature 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acobalt 3ahybridization 3amagnetism 3amodels 3anickel 3asemiconductors 0aspintronics 0ainterface 0aXMCD 0asuperstructure 0amagnetic dead layer1 aZhou, Qionghua1 aChen, Qian1 aNiu, Daxin1 aZhou, Yan1 aXu, Y.

For patients with HD, feeding is one of the problems they have to face. People with HD often have lower than average body weight and struggle with malnutrition. As a part of therapy, good nutrition is an intervention maintaining health and functional ability for maximally prolonged time. In the early stages of HD, small amounts of blenderized foods given orally are recommended. In more advanced stages, enteral nutrition is essential using gastric, or jejunal tubes for short term. Most severe cases require gastrostomy or gastrojejunostomy. Although enteral feeding is well tolerated by most of the patients, a number of complications may occur, including damage to the nose, pharynx, or esophagus, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, metabolic imbalances due to improper nutrient and fluid supply, adverse effects affecting gastrointestinal system, and refeeding syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHuntington disease 0aDysphagia 0aMalnutrition 0aEnteral nutrition1 aKról, Renata1 aWróblewska, Paula1 aPiątek, Jacek,1 aGibas-Dorna, Magdalena0 tNeurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 48 p.442-448dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aPolish Neurological Societyx0028-38437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pjnns.2014.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012800166300001600294520119100310592002801501650002501529650001301554650001901567650001201586653002801598653002401626653002501650653002601675653002501701700001301726700001701739700001901756700001801775700001301793700001601806773011201822856008501934852000902019655001202028IND60601492620221117180822.0200607e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060149262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hanli10aHighly efficient tetrafluoroethylene recovery for batch polymerization system: Membrane preparation and process development  ap. 403-410.  aIn tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) batch polymerization, H₂ is utilized to stabilize pressure and control reaction degree. TFE lost in the purge can account for about 6.0% of the loaded monomer. In this work, membrane-based separation system was presented to effectually reduce TFE loss. Polyimide asymmetric membrane with JH₂ up to 196 GPU and αH₂/TFE higher than 1680 was developed for the separation. A pseudo-steady process was customized to sufficiently complete TFE recovery within the 30-min idle period after batch polymerization. With the procedure that H₂-enriched permeate is compressed back into the reactor, it is succeeded to overcome the limits that the purge is gradually falling in pressure and the TFE-enriched stream is hazardous in compression. In this instance, TFE recovery ratio was increased to about 90%. For a 5.0-kt/a TFE polymerization unit, the investment for the separation system is about 2.56 × 10⁵ USD, the running payout is less than 4.35 × 10⁴ USD/a, and meanwhile the annual gross profit can be up to 3.126 × 10⁶ USD. On the whole, gas membrane separation is a promising technique to reduce TFE loss in the batch polymerization processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3ahydrogen 3apolymerization 3astreams 0aGas membrane separation 0aTetrafluoroethylene 0aPolymerization purge 0aPseudo-steady process 0aProcess optimization1 aDai, Yan1 aRuan, Xuehua1 aJiang, Xiaobin1 aYan, Xiaoming1 aXiao, Wu1 aHe, Gaohong0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 549 p.403-410dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04058naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245008400206300001100290506007600301520188900377592002802266596006902294596006902363596008302432596008302515506003702598650001102635650002002646650001602666650002002682650001602702650001002718650003402728650001502762650001702777650000902794650003502803650001202838650002002850650002402870650000902894650003502903651001402938700002202952700001202974700001202986700001502998700002203013700001703035700001803052700001703070700001903087700001903106700002003125700002503145700002003170773010303190856008203293852000903375655001203384IND60590552820221207073450.0181229e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059055282DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-018-0340-32doi7 aPMC63891732pmcid7 a294771482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Xuling10aGene-diet interaction effects on BMI levels in the Singapore Chinese population  ap. 31.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 97 body-mass index (BMI) associated loci. We aimed to evaluate if dietary intake modifies BMI associations at these loci in the Singapore Chinese population. METHODS: We utilized GWAS information from six data subsets from two adult Chinese population (N = 7817). Seventy-eight genotyped or imputed index BMI single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that passed quality control procedures were available in all datasets. Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010 score and ten nutrient variables were evaluated. Linear regression analyses between z score transformed BMI (Z-BMI) and dietary factors were performed. Interaction analyses were performed by introducing the interaction term (diet x SNP) in the same regression model. Analysis was carried out in each cohort individually and subsequently meta-analyzed using the inverse-variance weighted method. Analyses were also evaluated with a weighted gene-risk score (wGRS) contructed by BMI index SNPs from recent large-scale GWAS studies. RESULTS: Nominal associations between Z-BMI and AHEI-2010 and some dietary factors were identified (P = 0.047-0.010). The BMI wGRS was robustly associated with Z-BMI (P = 1.55 × 10⁻ ¹⁵) but not with any dietary variables. Dietary variables did not significantly interact with the wGRS to modify BMI associations. When interaction analyses were repeated using individual SNPs, a significant association between cholesterol intake and rs4740619 (CCDC171) was identified (β = 0.077, adjPᵢₙₜₑᵣₐcₜᵢₒₙ = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: The CCDC171 gene locus may interact with cholesterol intake to increase BMI in the Singaporean Chinese population, however most known obesity risk loci were not associated with dietary intake and did not interact with diet to modify BMI levels.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01 CA144034 and UM1 CA182876cNational Institute of Health, USA  aR01 CA144034 and UM1 CA182876cNational Institute of Health, USA  a370062002cHUJ-CREATE Programme of the National Research Foundation, Singapore  a370062002cHUJ-CREATE Programme of the National Research Foundation, Singapore0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abody mass index 3acholesterol 3adata collection 3afood intake 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotyping 3ahealthy diet 3aloci 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aobesity 3aquality control 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aSingapore1 aDorajoo, Rajkumar1 aSun, Ye1 aHan, Yi1 aWang, Ling1 aKhor, Chiea-Chuen1 aSim, Xueling1 aTai, E-Shyong1 aLiu, Jianjun1 aYuan, Jian-Min1 aKoh, Woon-Puay1 avan Dam, Rob M.1 aFriedlander, Yechiel1 aHeng, Chew-Kiat0 tNutrition journal.g2018 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.31-31dBioMed CentralwJournal:2170x1475-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-018-0340-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04233naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245008700212300001100299506007600310520237100386592002802757506003702785650001702822650001502839650001702854650001202871650002602883650001702909650001502926650001802941650001902959650001102978650001102989650002203000650001503022650001103037650001503048650001503063650001503078650001203093650001303105650001803118650001103136650001203147650001703159650001503176651002103191651001003212651001003222700002103232700002603253700001903279700002503298700001303323700001703336773012703353856008203480852000903562655001203571IND60589016520221207131244.0181227e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058901652DNAL7 a10.1186/s13002-018-0211-12doi7 aPMC57896102pmcid7 a293786142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAryal, Kamal Prasad10aDiversity and use of wild and non-cultivated edible plants in the Western Himalaya  ap. 10.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Local people in the Himalayan region use a wide range of wild and non-cultivated edible plants (WNEPs) for food, spice, medicinal, and cultural purposes. However, their availability, use, status and contribution to livelihood security are poorly documented, and they have been generally overlooked in recent agro-biodiversity conservation and management programmes. The study aimed to investigate WNEP diversity and current status in a part of the Kailash Sacred Landscape—a transboundary landscape shared by Nepal, India and PR China—in terms of collection, use, management and conservation initiatives. METHODS: Multiple methodologies and tools were used for data collection. A series of participatory tools (45 key informant interviews, 10 focus group discussions, a crop diversity fair, direct observation of species through a transect walk and rapid market assessments) was followed by a household survey (195 respondents) and complemented by a literature review. RESULTS: The study recorded 99 WNEPs belonging to 59 families of which 96 were angiosperms, one gymnosperm and two pteridophytes. Species were used for food, spice, medicine, rituals and income generation. Thirty-five species had multiple uses, including these: 40 species were used for fruit and 31 for vegetables. WNEPs contribute significantly to daily food requirements, especially the vegetables. The use value of Dryopteris cochleata was found highest (0.98) among frequently used vegetable species. The values of informant consensus factor were found maximum for worms in the stomach (0.99) and minimum for skin disease treatment (0.67). Nearly 85% of households depended exclusively on WNEPs for at least more than a month per year. Results on the importance and use of different species, gender roles in WNEP activities and conservation approaches are presented. CONCLUSIONS: People living in the Kailash Sacred Landscape depend significantly on WNEPs, and this is especially critical in times of food shortage. The WNEPs have considerable potential as an important supplement to cultivated food crops. Farmers prioritise species with multiple use values and popular vegetables. However, there are numerous challenges and interventions needed to ensure conservation and management of species and their continued availability to support food security and local livelihoods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAngiospermae 3aDryopteris 3aGymnospermae 3afarmers 3aferns and fern allies 3afocus groups 3afood crops 3afood security 3afood shortages 3afruits 3agender 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3ainterviews 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3amarkets 3amedicine 3askin diseases 3aspices 3astomach 3atherapeutics 3avegetables 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 3aNepal1 aPoudel, Sushmita1 aChaudhary, Ram Prasad1 aChettri, Nakul1 aChaudhary, Pashupati1 aNing, Wu1 aKotru, Rajan0 tJournal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine.g2018 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.10-10dBioMed CentralwJournal:2213x1746-42697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13002-018-0211-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245013100156300001800287520113000305592002801435650001101463650001401474650002101488650002101509650001201530650001501542650001601557653002901573653001401602653003101616653002301647653002601670700001601696700001801712700001201730700001701742700001701759700001901776700001401795700002101809773012301830856008001953852000902033655001202042IND60529042020221119224714.0160717e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052904202DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b115562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xin10aRational Design of NiCoO2@SnO2 Heterostructure Attached on Amorphous Carbon Nanotubes with Improved Lithium Storage Properties  ap. 6004-6010.  aIt still remains very challenging to design proper heterostructures to enhance the electrochemical performance of transition metal oxide-based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Here, we synthesized the NiCoO₂ nanosheets@SnO₂ layer heterostructure supported by amorphous carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) which is derived from polymeric nanotubes (PNTs) by a stepwise method. The inner SnO₂ layer not only provides a considerable capacity contribution but also produces the extra Li₂O to promote the charge process of NiCoO₂ and thus results in a rising cycling performance. Combining with the contribution of ACNTs backbone and ultrathin NiCoO₂ nanosheets, the specific capacities of these one-dimensional nanostructures show an interesting gradually increasing trend even after 100 cycles at 400 mA g–¹ with a final result of 1166 mAh g–¹. This approach can be an efficient general strategy for the preparation of mixed-metal-oxide one-dimensional nanostructures and this innovative design of hybrid electrode materials provides a promising approach for batteries with improved electrochemical performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium 3ananosheets 3atin dioxide 0aternary nickel cobaltite 0atin oxide 0aamorphous carbon nanotubes 0asynergistic effect 0alithium ion batteries1 aChen, Sheng1 aXiao, Chunhui1 aXi, Kai1 aGuo, Chaowei1 aGuo, Shengwu1 aDing, Shujiang1 aYu, Demei1 aKumar, R.

Traditional assessment of child food preparation employs self- or parent proxy-reporting methods, which are prone to error. The eButton is a wearable all-day camera that has promise as an objective, passive method for measuring child food preparation practices. PURPOSE: This paper explores the feasibility of the eButton to reliably capture home food preparation behaviors and practices in a sample of pre- and early adolescents (ages 9 to 13). METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of two eButton pilot projects evaluating the dietary intake of pre- and early adolescents in or around Houston, Texas. Food preparation behaviors were coded into seven major categories including: browsing, altering food/adding seasoning, food media, meal related tasks, prep work, cooking and observing. Inter-coder reliability was measured using Cohen’s kappa and percent agreement. RESULTS: Analysis was completed on data for 31 participants. The most common activity was browsing in the pantry or fridge. Few participants demonstrated any food preparation work beyond unwrapping of food packages and combining two or more ingredients; actual cutting or measuring of foods were rare. CONCLUSIONS: Although previous research suggests children who “help” prepare meals may obtain some dietary benefit, accurate assessment tools of food preparation behavior are lacking. The eButton offers a feasible approach to food preparation behavior measurement among pre- and early adolescents. Follow up research exploring the validity of this method in a larger sample, and comparisons between cooking behavior and dietary intake are needed.  aPublisher supplied data  a5 R21 CA172864cNational Cancer Institute  aR01CA165255cNational Cancer Institute  aR25CA057730cNational Cancer Institute  aU01HL91736cNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  a58-3092-5-001cAgricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3abrowsing 3acameras 3achildren 3acooking 3acutting 3afood intake 3afoods 3ahealthy diet 3ahome food preparation 3aingredients 3aTexas1 aPatterson, Monika1 aJia, Wenyan1 aSun, Mingui1 aBaranowski, Tom0 tNutrition journal.g2018 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.32-32dBioMed CentralwJournal:2170x1475-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-018-0341-23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015700163300001800320500001900338520123100357592002801588650001201616650001201628650002701640650000901667650001401676650001201690650001901702650001301721650001901734650001601753650002601769650001001795651001801805700001501823700001401838700001901852700005601871773012701927856008202054852000902136655001202145IND60729817920221122205751.0210303e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072981792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-021-04528-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Zhou10aInterannual variability of body size and beak morphology of the squid Ommastrephes bartramii in the North Pacific Ocean in the context of climate change  ap. 1295-1309.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOceanic squids are typical species that sensitive to the environment change. Previous studies on oceanic squids mainly focus on its annually fluctuated abundance under the background of climate change. The changes of individual morphological sizes, including body and beak, have been observed in recent years. In this study, Ommastrephes bartramii, an important cephalopod species in North Pacific Ocean, has been selected to analyze the annual morphological changes of body and beak under different scales of climate events. Geometric morphometrics was used to analyze the shape variations of both upper beak and lower beak. The possible phenotypic plasticity of body and beak was also discussed in different aspects. Body size showed different variations among different climatic years. The size at the maturity stage in 2015 (El Niño year) was much smaller than that in other years for both sexes. The centroid size representing the beak size showed the significant difference between two types of Pacific Decadal Oscillation phases. The shapes of upper and lower beaks showed significant differences between small-scale climatic patterns in which El Niño or La Niña event occurred, displaying different growth patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aOmmastrephes bartramii 3abeak 3abody size 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ageometry 3amaturity stage 3amorphometry 3aphenotypic plasticity 3asquid 3aPacific Ocean1 aHan, Peiwu1 aWang, Yan1 aChen, Yangyang1 aChen, Xinjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0725-41100 tHydrobiologia.g2021 Mar., v. 848, no. 6 p.1295-1309dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04528-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012900167300001600296520119700312592002801509650002001537650002101557650001901578650001701597650001201614650002901626650001301655650002201668650002201690653002401712653003301736653001401769653002201783653002001805653001301825700002101838700005401859700001701913700002501930700001601955700002401971773009401995856008202089852000902171655001202180IND60635182520221120180040.0190606e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063518252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2019.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReckman, G.A.R.10aAnabolic competence: Assessment and integration of the multimodality interventional approach in disease-related malnutrition  ap. 179-184.  aDisease-related malnutrition (DRM) is a frequent clinical problem and is characterized by loss of lean body mass and decreased function, including muscle function and immunocompetence. In DRM, nutritional intervention is necessary, but it has not consistently been shown to be sufficient. Other factors, for example, physical activity and hormonal or metabolic influencers of the internal milieu, are also important in the treatment of DRM. A prerequisite for successful treatment of DRM is the positive balance between anabolism and catabolism. The aim of this review was to approach DRM using this paradigm of anabolic competence, for conceptual and practical reasons. Anabolic competence is defined as “that state which optimally supports protein synthesis and lean body mass, global aspects of muscle and organ function, and immune response.” Anabolic competence and interdisciplinary, multimodality interventions create a practical foundation to approach DRM in a proactive comprehensive way. Here, we describe the paradigm of anabolic competence, and its operationalization by measuring factors related to anabolic competence and suited for clinical management of patients with DRM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmune response 3aimmunocompetence 3alean body mass 3amalnutrition 3amuscles 3anutritional intervention 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aprotein synthesis 0aAnabolic competence 0aDisease-related malnutrition 0aNutrition 0aPhysical activity 0aInternal milieu 0aProteins1 aGomes-Neto, A.W.1 aVonk, R.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9914-58641 aOttery, F.D.1 avan der Schans, C.P.1 aNavis, G.J.1 aJager-Wittenaar, H.0 tNutrition.g2019 Sept., v. 65 p.179-184dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2019.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011800154300001600272500002000288520204300308592002802351596004602379596002902425650000902454650001002463650001602473650001102489650002102500650001902521650004402540650001102584700001702595700003102612700001702643700006002660773012502720856007302845852000902918655001202927IND60655570520221121063013.0190803e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065557052DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.130872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarley, G.10aMisoprostol is superior to combined omeprazole‐sucralfate for the treatment of equine gastric glandular disease  ap. 575-580.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated a poor response to healing of gastric glandular lesions with oral omeprazole and other medications. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of two novel treatments (misoprostol [M] and combined omeprazole‐sucralfate [OS]) in horses for gastric glandular disease. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, clinical study. METHODS: Sixty‐three sports horses with grade >1/4 glandular disease were identified by gastroscopy. Horses received either 5 μg/kg of misoprostol per os BID 1 h prior to feeding or a combination of 4 mg/kg enteric coated omeprazole per os SID and 12 mg/kg sucralfate per os BID where drugs were given 1 h prior to feeding and sucralfate given 60 min after omeprazole; allocation was dependent upon centre. Gastroscopy was repeated at 28–35 days. Evaluators of the gastroscopy images were blinded to the treatments the horses received and images were reviewed independently. RESULTS: The most common presenting sign in both treatment groups was poor performance (Overall – 65.1%; M – 60.5% and OS – 75%). Overall healing (P<0.001; OR = 11 [2.8–45]) and improvement (P = 0.006; OR = 11 [1.9–59]) of lesions were associated with resolution of clinical signs. Misoprostol was shown to be superior to combined omeprazole‐sucralfate both for healing (M – 72% [95% CI 43–67] and OS – 20% [95% CI 7–41]; P<0.001) and improvement (M – 98% [95% CI 90–100] and OS – 65% [95% CI 43–83]; P<0.001). MAIN LIMITATIONS: Relatively small, clinical study, reliance on client questionnaire data, clients not blinded to the treatments the horse received, diet could have affected drug pharmacodynamics although mimics clinical practice and no validated scoring system available for glandular lesions. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that gastric glandular disease does indeed result in clinical signs. In this population of horses, misoprostol was superior to omeprazole and sucralfate and warrants further evaluation in a large scale, multi‐centre trial.  aPublisher supplied data  cSchool of Veterinary Medicine and Science  cUniversity of Nottingham 3adiet 3adrugs 3agastroscopy 3ahorses 3apharmacodynamics 3aquestionnaires 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asports1 aBowen, I.

Quantification of soil erosion is required to effectively implement soil conservation practices. This study used the 210Pbex measurements to assess long-term rates and spatial pattern of soil redistribution in an agricultural catchment in the black soil region, Northeastern China. A total of 61 sampling cores were collected from the catchment, where 137Cs has been previously used to study medium-term soil redistribution rates. The potential use of 210Pbex was validated through using 137Cs measurements in our previous study and other methods. 210Pbex-based soil redistribution rates ranged from −106.5 to 166.9tha−1yr−1 with a mean value of −3.9tha−1yr−1. The net erosion rate for the entire catchment was −8.3tha−1yr−1, which is much higher than the tolerable soil erosion rate. The spatial pattern of soil redistribution was investigated based on the 210Pbex measurements. The correlations between the rates of soil redistribution and slope gradient and curvature were not significant at the 0.05 risk level. Although the shelterbelts could greatly affect spatial pattern of soil redistribution, ca. 78% of the eroded soils were lost per year from the agricultural catchment and soil erosion has accelerated in the last few decades. Integrated soil conservation measures are urgently required to effectively control soil loss in the black region of Northeastern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aagricultural watersheds 3aconservation practices 3aeroded soils 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3asoil fertility 3aChina 0a210Pbex 0aSoil redistribution 0aAgricultural catchment 0aBlack soil region of Northeastern China1 aSheng, M.L.1 aTang, Z.H.1 aCai, Q.G.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2013 Oct., v. 133 p.85-92dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2013.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009000173300001600263520160400279592002801883650002601911650001601937650002001953650002801973650001402001650002402015650002602039650001502065650002102080650001502101650001302116650002402129651001002153653002202163653002002185653001502205653003002220653002402250700002302274700002202297700001902319700002402338700002102362773013302383856008902516852000902605655001202614IND60622945220221116172934.0181127e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062294522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhnuma, Tetsu12aA nationwide survey of intravenous antimicrobial use in intensive care units in Japan  ap. 636-641.  aAlthough most patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) receive antibiotics, little is known about patterns of antibiotic use in ICUs in Japan. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pattern of antibiotic use in ICUs. A nationwide one-day cross-sectional surveillance of antibiotic use in the ICU was conducted three times between January 2011 and December 2011. All patients aged at least16 years were included. Data from 52 ICUs and 1148 patients were reviewed. There were 1028 prescriptions for intravenous antibiotics. Of 1148 patients, 834 (73%) received at least one intravenous antibiotic, and 575 had at least one known site of infection. Respiratory and intra-abdominal infections were the two most common types. Of 1028 prescriptions, 331 (34%) were for surgical or medical prophylaxis. Excluding prophylaxis, carbapenems were the most commonly prescribed agent. Infectious disease consultations, pre- and post-prescription antimicrobial stewardship, and ICU-dedicated antibiograms were available in 44%, 52%, 77%, and 21% of the ICUs, respectively. In logistic regression analysis adjusting for patient characteristics, treatment in a university hospital (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.05–2.84; P = 0.033) and an open ICU (adjusted odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.02–5.17; P = 0.044) were significantly associated with greater likelihood of carbapenem use. An increase in the number of closed ICUs and more intensive care specialists may reduce carbapenem use in Japanese ICUs. Large-scale epidemiological studies of antimicrobial resistance in the ICU are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3acarbapenems 3adisease control 3aepidemiological studies 3ahospitals 3ainfectious diseases 3aintravenous injection 3amonitoring 3anational surveys 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3aJapan 0aAntimicrobial use 0aDrug resistance 0aCarbapenem 0aAntimicrobial stewardship 0aIntensive care unit1 aHayashi, Yoshirō,1 aYamashita, Kazuto1 aMarquess, John1 aLefor, Alan Kawarai1 aSanui, Masamitsu0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2018 Apr., v. 51, no. 4 p.636-641dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2018.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005200153245009000205300001600295520175400311592002802065650001602093650002002109650002302129650002102152650002502173650003002198650002902228650002102257650001902278650001802297650002402315650001902339651001802358653001702376653002602393653001802419653001402437700001602451700005202467700005202519773012002571856008802691852000902779655001202788IND60635182720221120180011.0200210e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063518272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5115-735310aComparative life cycle assessment of station-based and dock-less bike sharing systems  ap. 180-189.  aBike sharing system (BSS) is growing worldwide. Although bike sharing is viewed as a sustainable transportation mode, it still has environmental footprints from its operation (e.g., bike rebalancing using automobiles) and upstream impacts (e.g., bike manufacturing). Thus, evaluating the environmental impacts of BSS from the life cycle perspective is vital to inform decision making for the system design and operation. In this study, we conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of station-based and dock-less BSS in the U.S. The results show that dock-less BSS has a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions factor of 118 g CO₂₋eq/bike-km in the base scenario, which is 82% higher than the station-based system. Bike rebalancing is the main source of GHG emissions, accounting for 36% and 73% of the station-based and dock-less systems, respectively. However, station-based BSS has 54% higher total normalized environmental impacts (TNEI), compared to dock-less BSS. The dock manufacturing dominants the TNEI (61%) of station-based BSS and the bike manufacturing contributes 52% of TNEI in dock-less BSS. BSS can also bring environmental benefits through substituting different transportation modes. Car trip replacement rate is the most important factor. The results suggest four key approaches to improve BSS environmental performance: 1) optimizing the bike distribution and rebalancing route or repositioning bikes using more sustainable approaches, 2) incentivizing more private car users to switch to using BSSs, 3) prolonging lifespans of docking infrastructure to significantly reduce the TNEI of station-based systems, and 4) increasing the bike utilization efficiency to improve the environmental performance of dock-less systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3aemissions factor 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainfrastructure 3amanufacturing 3asystems engineering 3atransportation 3aUnited States 0aBike sharing 0aLife cycle assessment 0aStation-based 0aDock-less1 aKou, Zhaoyu1 aZhao, Fu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5195-868X1 aCai, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5895-16640 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 July, v. 146 p.180-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010400171300001400275520093000289592002801219650002001247650001301267650001401280650001101294650002301305650002001328650002401348650001701372650001201389650002001401653002901421653002601450653001301476653002601489653002501515700005601540700002701596700002001623773010901643856008701752852000901839655001201848IND60541510020221117232518.0190318e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054151002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2014.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsevdou, Maria10aModelling the effect of storage temperature on the viscoelastic properties and quality of ice cream  ap. 35-42.  aThe quality of ice cream is highly correlated to the storage temperature since continuous temperature fluctuations can lead to significant defects of ice cream texture related to ice crystals recrystallization. The objective of the present work was to investigate the effect of storage temperature on viscoelastic properties of ice cream and correlate it with sensory quality. Oscillatory thermo-rheometry (OTR) tests were used to measure the viscoelastic properties of ice cream. Storage modulus (G′) and damping factor (tanδ) were found to be strongly affected by storage temperature. Damping factor was found to be also strongly affected by storage time where an exponential decrease of tanδ was identified with increasing storage time. For all measured quality indices, kinetic modelling of ice cream quality loss was conducted; temperature dependence of the respective quality loss rate constants was also evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aice cream 3amodels 3asensory properties 3astorage modulus 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atexture 3aviscoelasticity 0aTemperature fluctuations 0aOverall acceptability 0aRheology 0aIce recrystallization 0aFrozen dairy dessert1 aGogou, Eleni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4582-81381 aDermesonluoglu, Efimia1 aTaoukis, Petros0 tJournal of food engineering.g2015 Mar., v. 148 p.35-42dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2014.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016800159500002000327520078800347592002801135650002101163650002301184650001701207650002201224650002301246650002201269650002001291650001601311650004201327650002801369650001301397650002501410650002001435650005201455700002001507700005901527773014801586856007401734852000901808655001201817IND60655570920221121063033.0190803e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065557092DNAL7 a10.1002/arch.215992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaruta, Fumiko13aAn omega‐class glutathione S‐transferase in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens exhibits glutathione transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA complementary DNA that encodes an omega‐class glutathione S‐transferase (GST) of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (nlGSTO), was isolated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A recombinant protein (nlGSTO) was obtained via overexpression in the Escherichia coli cells and purified. nlGSTO catalyzes the biotransformation of glutathione with 1‐chloro‐2,4‐dinitrobenzene, a general substrate for GST, as well as with dehydroascorbate to synthesize ascorbate. Mutation experiments revealed that putative substrate‐binding sites, including Phe28, Cys29, Phe30, Arg176, and Lue225, were important for glutathione transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities. As ascorbate is a reducing agent, nlGSTO may participate in antioxidant resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aantioxidants 3abiotransformation 3acatalytic activity 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione transferase 3amutation 3arecombinant proteins 3areducing agents 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aYamada, Naotaka1 aYamamoto, Kohji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5859-912X0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2019 Sept., v. 102, no. 1 p.e21599-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl34835x0739-44627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.215993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149242017100171245016300342300001400505520165500519592002802174650000902202650001002211650001102221650001002232650001902242650001702261650001102278650001102289651002202300651001802322651002302340653002302363653002002386653001602406653002802422653001302450700002202463700001802485700002302503700001802526700001902544700002102563700002402584700001902608773011302627856008302740852000902823655001202832IND60648259820221120131543.0190627e20190218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064825982DNAL7 a10.13157/arla.66.1.2019.ra42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega, Marta Lomas10aEstrategias Migratorias de Las Aves Reproductoras Ibéricas Vencejo Cafre Apus caffer, Alzacola Rojizo Cercotrichas galactotes y Ruiseñor Pechiazul Cyanecula svecica10aMigration Strategies of Iberian Breeding White-Rumped Swifts Apus caffer, Rufous-Tailed Scrub-Robins Cercotrichas galactotes and Bluethroats Cyanecula svecica  ap. 51-64.  aThe migration strategies of smaller, south European, Mediterranean birds are less well known than those of northern and central European birds. We used geolocators to map individual spatiotemporal migration schedules of three species breeding in the Iberian Peninsula: the White-rumped Swift Apus caffer, rufous-tailed Scrub-robin Cercotrichas galactotes and Bluethroat Cyanecula svecica. The three species crossed the Sahara desert with a westward detour, to reach West African winter grounds in the Sahel (Bluethroats and Scrub-robins) or the rainforest belt (Swifts). Despite the proximity of the breeding grounds to the desert barrier, all but one individual stopped over before the desert crossing during autumn migration. After spending six months on average in sub-Saharan Africa with variable itinerancy, spring migration was faster overall and more direct than in autumn. Autumn migration was of similar duration to that found in related northern European migrants and therefore slower in southern birds. Spring migration was completed in less time than in the northern migrants (data only for Swifts and Scrub-robins). The shorter migration distance and proximity to the barrier potentially allow south European trans-Saharan migrants to migrate more slowly than northern migrants but only when less time-constrained in autumn.—Lomas vega, M., Willemoes, M., Arizaga, J., Onrubia, A., Cuenca, D., Alonso, D., Torralvo, C., Tøttrup, A.P. & Thorup, K.

The aim of this study was to use the recA gene for species discrimination in the L. acidophilus group, as well as to develop a species‐specific primer and single nucleotide polymorphism primer based on the recA gene sequence for species and subspecies identification. RESULTS: The average sequence similarity for the recA gene among type strains was 80.0%, and most members of the L. acidophilus group could be clearly distinguished. The species‐specific primer was designed according to the recA gene sequencing, which was employed for polymerase chain reaction with the template DNA of Lactobacillus strains. A single 231‐bp species‐specific band was found only in L. delbrueckii. A SNaPshot mini‐sequencing assay using recA as a target gene was also developed. The specificity of the mini‐sequencing assay was evaluated using 31 strains of L. delbrueckii species and was able to unambiguously discriminate strains belonging to the subspecies L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. CONCLUSION: The phylogenetic relationships of most strains in the L. acidophilus group can be resolved using recA gene sequencing, and a novel method to identify the species and subspecies of the L. delbrueckii and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was developed by species‐specific polymerase chain reaction combined with SNaPshot mini‐sequencing.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3ataxonomy 3aribosomal DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aphylogeny 3agene targeting 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aBacterial Typing Techniquesxmethods 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysis 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenotype 2aLactobacillus acidophilusxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aRec A Recombinasesxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxmethods 2aSequence Homology 2aSpecies Specificity 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aChang, Mu‐Tzu1 aHuang, Mu‐Chiou1 aWang, Li‐Tin1 aHuang, Lina1 aLee, Fwu‐Ling0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 Oct., v. 92, no. 13 p.2703-2708dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5692  aDNAL 7aarticle04678naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245015200212300001100364506007600375520243200451592002802883596006102911596004102972506003703013650001603050650001603066650001403082650002703096650001703123650003703140650001803177650000903195650001803204650001403222650001203236650001003248650001603258650001603274650001703290650001103307650001103318650001203329650001103341650002503352650001703377650001703394650002003411650001703431650002203448650003303470650002403503650000903527650001003536650001503546650001703561651001703578700002903595700002303624700001903647700002103666700006303687773010303750856008203853852000903935655001203944IND60590553320221207073302.0181229e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059055332DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-018-0324-32doi7 aPMC63890642pmcid7 a294906622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMovassagh, Elham Z.10aVegetarian-style dietary pattern during adolescence has long-term positive impact on bone from adolescence to young adulthood: a longitudinal study  ap. 36.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The amount of bone accrued during adolescence is an important determinant of later osteoporosis risk. Little is known about the influence of dietary patterns (DPs) on the bone during adolescence and their potential long-term implications into adulthood. We examined the role of adolescent DPs on adolescent and young adult bone and change in DPs from adolescence to young adulthood. METHODS: We recruited participants from the Saskatchewan Pediatric Bone Mineral Accrual Study (1991–2011). Data from 125 participants (53 females) for adolescent analysis (age 12.7 ± 2 years) and 115 participants (51 females) for adult analysis (age 28.2 ± 3 years) were included. Bone mineral content (BMC) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of total body (TB), femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Adolescent dietary intake data from multiple 24-h recalls were summarized into 25 food group intakes and were used in the principal component analysis to derive DPs during adolescence. Associations between adolescent DPs and adolescent or adult BMC/BMD were analyzed using multiple linear regression and multivariate analysis of covariance while adjusting for sex, age, the age of peak height velocity, height, weight, physical activity and total energy intake. Generalized estimating equations were used for tracking DPs. RESULTS: We derived five DPs including “Vegetarian-style”, “Western-like”, “High-fat, high-protein”, “Mixed” and “Snack” DPs. The “Vegetarian-style” DP was a positive independent predictor of adolescent TBBMC, and adult TBBMC, TBaBMD (P < 0.05). Mean adolescent TBaBMD and young adult TBBMC, TBaBMD, FNBMC and FNaBMD were 5%, 8.5%, 6%, 10.6% and 9% higher, respectively, in third quartile of “Vegetarian-style” DP compared to first quartile (P < 0.05). We found a moderate tracking (0.47–0.63, P < 0.001) in DP scores at individual levels from adolescence to adulthood. There were an upward trend in adherence to “Vegetarian-style” DP and an downward trend in adherence to “High-fat, high-protein” DP from adolescence to young adulthood (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A “Vegetarian-style” DP rich in dark green vegetables, eggs, non-refined grains, 100% fruit juice, legumes/nuts/seeds, added fats, fruits and low-fat milk during adolescence is positively associated with bone health.  aPublisher supplied data  a98002cInstitute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis  aDFC- 417283cDairy Farmers of Canada0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aadulthood 3aanalysis of covariance 3abone density 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aeating habits 3aeggs 3aenergy intake 3aequations 3afemales 3afemur 3afood groups 3afood intake 3afruit juices 3afruits 3agrains 3alegumes 3alipids 3alongitudinal studies 3alow fat milk 3alumbar spine 3amineral content 3aosteoporosis 3aphysical activity 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aseeds 3avegetables 3ayoung adults 3aSaskatchewan1 aBaxter-Jones, Adam D.

Cereals are one of the main hosts of plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN), chiefly root-lesion nematodes (RLN, Pratylenchus spp.) and cereal cyst nematodes (CCN, Heterodera spp.). These nematodes are known as major parasites of the cereal crops; however, agricultural areas accommodate various nematodes showing biological variation. The diversity of parasitic nematodes on cereals in the Sakarya provinces of Türkiye, where cereals are intensively grown and located in the middle of two climatic zones, has not been well studied. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the diversity, identification, and molecular phylogeny of PPNs in wheat-growing ecosystems in the Hendek, Pamukova, Geyve, Akyazı, and Central districts of Sakarya. The diversity of PPNs was calculated using the Shannon diversity index. Thirteen PPN genera were detected in 92% of soil samples. Heterodera filipjevi was identified in 24% of the soil samples using morphological, morphometrical, and molecular tools. In the morphological and molecular analyses, intraspecific polymorphism was observed in H. filipjevi populations. The result indicated that the high infestation rate of H. filipjevi was recorded from Geyve and Pamukova, followed by Hendek and Akyazı; however, a low infestation rate was detected in the Central district. The moderate value of the Shannon index of migratory nematode species was obtained in wheat fields as 2.31, whereas the value of evenness was 0.93, implying moderate diversity and high evenness of nematodes. This study is the first comprehensive report on H. filipjevi from wheat cropping areas in the Sakarya province. Intensified cereal cropping systems with/without non-cereal rotations increased the risk of plant-parasitic nematodes, especially RLNs and H. filipjevi infection of wheat production areas in the province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterodera filipjevi 3aPratylenchus 3acyst nematodes 3amigratory behavior 3aphylogeny 3arisk 3aroot lesion nematodes 3asoil 3asoil ecosystems 3awheat1 aBozbuğa, Refik 1 aÖcal, Atilla 1 aYüksel, Ebubekir,1 aÖzer, Göksel 1 aYildiz, Şenol 1 aLahlali, Rachid 1 aSlaats, Brigitte 1 aDababat, Abdelfattah A.1 aİmren, Mustafa 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 29, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100815343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015000159500002000309520124000329592002801569596004101597596005901638596004701697650002101744650002401765650001801789650001901807650002601826650001601852650002501868650001601893650002201909650001301931650001301944650001601957650002001973650000901993650001402002650004302016650005202059650002602111700001902137700005902156700002102215700001402236700002102250700001902271700002302290773014802313856007402461852000902535655001202544IND60655571120221121085141.0190803e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065557112DNAL7 a10.1002/arch.215922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Zhan‐Jun10aIdentification and functional analysis of an iron‐binding protein, ferritin heavy chain subunit, from the swallowtail butterfly, Papilio xuthus  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFerritin, which is ubiquitous among all living organisms, plays a crucial role in maintaining iron homeostasis, immune response, and detoxification. In the present research, we identified an iron‐binding protein, ferritin heavy chain subunit, from Papilio xuthus and named PxFerHCH. The complete complementary DNA of PxFerHCH was 1,252 bp encoding a sequence of 211 amino acids, which includes an iron‐responsive element. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PxFerHCH is clustered with Manduca sexta and Galleria mellonella ferritin heavy chain subunits. Expression levels of PxFerHCH in various tissues were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the results exhibited that PxFerHCH was expressed in all tissues with the highest expression in the fat body. The relative expression level of PxFerHCH in response to bacterial (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) challenges sharply increased by about 12 hr postinfection (hpi) and then decreased at 24 hpi. In addition, the iron‐binding capacity and antioxidation activity of recombinant PxFerHCH protein were also investigated. These results reveal that PxFerHCH might play an important role in defense against bacterial infection.  aPublisher supplied data  aGJJ180747cJiangxi Province of China  a31560602cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20171ACF60022cKey R&D projects of Jiangxi 3aEscherichia coli 3aGalleria mellonella 3aManduca sexta 3aPapilio xuthus 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aamino acids 3abacterial infections 3abutterflies 3acomplementary DNA 3afat body 3aferritin 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3airon 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription1 aXie, Yan‐Xin1 aYu, Hai‐Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8908-67811 aToufeeq, Shahzad1 aWang, Jie1 aHuang, Yu‐Ling1 aLi, Ning‐Yan1 aOuyang, Zhi‐Gang0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2019 Sept., v. 102, no. 1 p.e21592-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl34835x0739-44627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.215923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245009100213300001600304520093900320592002801259650001501287650002501302650001101327650001301338653002501351653003201376653001301408653001501421653001901436653002101455700006301476700001701539773012001556856008801676852000901764655001201773IND60635183120221122105903.0200210e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063518312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraccascia, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6841-982310aBusiness models for industrial symbiosis: A taxonomy focused on the form of governance  ap. 114-126.  aThe aim of this paper is to propose a taxonomy of industrial symbiosis (IS) business models. Rather than to adopt a firm perspective, we take a system perspective and focus on the governance of the system made up of the firms implementing IS, being the latter considered an important factor influencing firm’s competitive advantage. Four extreme IS business models are identified, characterized on the basis of two governance features: (1) need for coordination and (2) centralization of control. For each model, the main characteristics are presented and the main factors influencing firm value creation and value capture discussed. In doing so, our study contributes to clarify how and why firms applying IS practice can gain competitive advantage, a major gap in the current literature. Consequently, we contribute to the practical development of IS, which appears to be still not fully exploited by firms, despite its relevance.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3aindustrial symbiosis 3amodels 3ataxonomy 0aIndustrial symbiosis 0aSustainable business models 0aTaxonomy 0aGovernance 0aCentralization 0aCircular economy1 aGiannoccaro, Ilaria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5309-66111 aAlbino, Vito0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 July, v. 146 p.114-126dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03769naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245013700206300001000343506007600353520216300429592002802592506003702620650001502657650002102672650002902693650001302722650001402735650001902749650001402768650001802782650001302800650002002813650001902833650001002852650002002862650001702882650001002899650001002909700006202919700001802981700002102999700001703020700002203037773010103059856008203160852000903242655001203251IND60590553420221207073308.0181229e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059055342DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-018-0314-52doi7 aPMC57572972pmcid7 a293106532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirose, Asuka10aEffect of soy lecithin on fatigue and menopausal symptoms in middle-aged women: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study  ap. 4.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Lecithin is a complex mixture of phospholipids which compose lipid bilayer cell membranes. Lipid replacement therapy, or administration of phospholipids for the purpose of repairing the dmaged cell membranes, had been shown to alleviate fatigue. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of soy lecithin on fatigue in middle-aged women, as well as other menopausal symptoms and various health parameters. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 96 women aged 40 to 60 years who complained of fatigue. The participants were randomized to receive active tablets containing high-dose (1200 mg/day; n = 32) or low-dose (600 mg/day; n = 32) soy lecithin, or placebo (n = 32), for 8 weeks. The following parameters were evaluated: age, menopausal status, lifestyle factors, physical and psychological symptoms of menopause, subjective symptoms of insomnia and fatigue, body composition, cardiovascular parameters, and physical activities and objective sleep states obtained from actigraphy before and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment. Fatigue was evaluated using the Profile of Mood States (POMS)-brief, Menopausal Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and Brief Fatigue Inventory. RESULTS: Eighty-nine women completed the study. There were no significant differences in the changes in Chalder Fatigue Scale score (placebo vs low-dose vs high-dose groups: −2.9 ± 1.1, −3.2 ± 1.1, and −3.5 ± 1.0; P = 0.79). On the other hand, the improvements were greater in the high-dose group compared with the placebo group concerning vigor scores in the POMS-brief (1.9 ± 0.7 vs 0.2 ± 0.6; P = 0.02), diastolic blood pressure (−4.1 ± 1.8 vs 1.2 ± 1.9; P = 0.05), and cardio-ankle vascular index (−0.4 ± 0.2 vs 0.07 ± 0.1; P = 0.03) after 8 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose (1200 mg/day) soy lecithin not only increases vigor, but also lowers the diastolic blood pressure and cardio-ankle vascular index in middle-aged women who present with fatigue.

The strain had morphological characteristics of members of the family MICROMONOSPORACEAE: Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain FXJ6.011T indicated the highest similarity (98.7 %) to Micromonospora auratinigra JCM 12357T, Micromonospora chaiyaphumensis JCM 12873T and Micromonospora echinofusca JCM 3327T. Analysis of the gyrB gene sequence also showed that strain FXJ6.011T should be assigned to the genus MICROMONOSPORA: It contained DD-diaminopimelic acid as the major cell-wall diamino acid and MK-10(H2) as predominant menaquinone. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl mannosides and phosphatidylinositol dimannoside. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0, C17 : 1ω8c and C16 : 0. Physiological and biochemical data and low DNA–DNA relatedness values enabled the strain to be differentiated from members of closely related species. Based on phenotypic and genotypic data, strain FXJ6.011T represents a novel Micromonospora species, for which the name Micromonospora yangpuensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is FXJ6.011T ( = CGMCC 4.5736T = NBRC 107727T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicromonospora 3afatty acids 3amenaquinones 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3aSouth China Sea1 aXi, Lijun1 aRuan, Jisheng1 aHuang, Ying0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Feb., v. 62, no.

Three different Ru(II) complexes, trans(Cl)-[Ru(X₂bpy) (CO)₂Cl₂] (X₂bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine with substituents X in the 4-positions, X = COOH, PO₃H₂, or CH₂PO₃H₂), were employed as promoters and will be abbreviated as RuC (X = COOH), RuP (X = PO₃H₂), and RuCP (X = CH₂PO₃H₂). When C₃N₄ modified with a larger amount of RuCP (>7.8 μmol g–¹) was employed as a photocatalyst in a solvent having a relatively high donor number (e.g., N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) with the aid of triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor, the hybrid photocatalyst exhibited high performance for CO₂ reduction, producing CO and HCOOH with relatively high CO selectivity (40–70%). On the other hand, HCOOH was the major product when RuC/C₃N₄ or RuP/C₃N₄ was employed regardless of the loading amount of the Ru(II) complex and the reaction solvent. Results of photocatalytic reactions and UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy indicated that polymeric Ru species, which were formed in situ from RuCP on C₃N₄ under irradiation in a solvent having a high donor number, were active catalysts for CO formation. Nonsacrificial CO₂ reduction using RuP/C₃N₄ was accomplished in a DMA solution containing methanol as an electron donor, which means that visible light energy was stored as chemical energy in the form of CO and formaldehyde (ΔG° = +67.6 kJ mol–¹). This study demonstrated the first successful example of an energy conversion scheme using carbon nitride through photocatalytic CO₂ reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon nitride 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aenergy conversion 3aformaldehyde 3aformic acid 3airradiation 3amethanol 3aphotocatalysts 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aruthenium 3asolvents 0aartificial photosynthesis 0acarbon dioxide fixation 0aheterogeneous photocatalysis 0alight-energy conversion 0asolar fuels1 aIshitani, Osamu1 aMaeda, Kazuhiko0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Mar. 09, v. 8, no. 9 p.6011-6018dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b118363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245015300163300001600316520192000332592002802252650002102280650001302301650001702314650001102331650001202342650001202354650001302366650001502379650001102394650001102405650001502416650000902431650001902440650001702459650001602476650001302492650001202505651001602517651001002533651001302543653002202556653002002578653002102598700001502619700002002634773010402654856008402758852000902842655001202851IND60122901920221118035655.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012290192DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2013.8577292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, E.10aFrom the Apennines to the Alps: recent range expansion of the crested porcupine Hystrix cristata L., 1758 (Mammalia: Rodentia: Hystricidae) in Italy  ap. 469-480.  aIn the last few decades, the crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata L., 1758) showed a marked range expansion in Italy. Published and unpublished material was collected to reconstruct this phenomenon. Data were gathered by means of: (i) specific papers on crested porcupine distribution and more generic books and articles, (ii) expert collaboration in various Italian regions and (iii) information from the national Vertebrates mailing list. Until the 1970s, H. cristata was only present in Central and Southern Italy, mostly in the western part. Since 1978, the porcupine has been protected by Italian national law. The species first crossed the Apennines from the Tyrrhenian coast to the Marche, where the expansion to the north may have begun, and then reached the northernmost regions. An analysis of the potential distribution of the species was performed in a species distribution modeling framework (Maxent). The model suggested a high suitability of most of the Central and Southern Italian Peninsula for H. cristata , including the two major islands. Northern Italy proved suitable for the species’ establishment only in some central and western areas of the Po Valley. The core areas of the Apennines and of the Alps, as well as some areas characterized by low annual rainfall, were predicted as unsuitable. Historical and social factors related to the progressive urbanization and the consequent abandonment of the traditional land use in mountain landscapes probably helped the re-expansion of forests and uncultivated fields. Three introduced populations have been detected in Sardinia, Liguria and the province of Varese. In order to make the data collected easily consultable and to give people the opportunity to contribute to a continuous updating of the distributional map of the species, a web page dedicated to H. cristata was set up, in the framework of an open-source wildlife mapping project.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHystrix cristata 3aInternet 3abiogeography 3acoasts 3aforests 3aislands 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apeople 3apopulation 3arain 3asocial factors 3aurbanization 3avertebrates 3awildlife 3azoology 3aAlps region 3aItaly 3aSardinia 0aCrested porcupine 0arange expansion 0awildlife mapping1 aSforzi, A.1 aDi Febbraro, M.0 tItalian journal of zoology.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 80, no. 4 p.469-480dTaylor & Francisx1748-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2013.8577293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245012700164300001800291520194200309592002802251650000802279650001402287650001402301650001302315650001102328650002102339650001702360650001802377650001102395650001402406650002202420650002402442650001402466650001702480653001602497653002002513653002402533653002102557653002302578700001602601700002502617773012302642856008002765852000902845655001202854IND60529042820221119224940.0160717e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052904282DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b118402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVignesh, Ahilan10aPorous LaCo1–xNixO3−δ Nanostructures as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Water Oxidation and for a Zinc–Air Battery  ap. 6019-6031.  aPerovskites have emerged as promising earth-abundant alternatives to precious metals for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of porous perovskite nanostructures, LaCo₀.₉₇O₃₋δ, with systematic Ni substitution in Co octahedral sites. Their electrocatalytic activity during the water oxidation reaction was studied in alkaline electrolytes. The electrocatalytic OER activity and stability of the perovskite nanostructure was evaluated using the rotating disk electrode technique. We show that the progressive replacement of Co by Ni in the LaCo₀.₉₇O₃₋δ perovskite structure greatly altered the electrocatalytic activity and that the La(Co₀.₇₁Ni₀.₂₅)₀.₉₆O₃₋δ composition exhibited the lowest OER overpotential of 324 and 265 mV at 10 mA cm–² in 0.1 M KOH and 1 M KOH, respectively. This value was much lower than that of the noble metal catalysts, IrO₂, Ru/C, and Pt/C. Furthermore, the La(Co₀.₇₁Ni₀.₂₅)₀.₉₆O₃₋δ nanostructure showed outstanding electrode stability, with no observable decrease in performance up to 114th cycle in the auxiliary linear sweep voltammetry that lasted for 10 h in chronoamperometry studies. The excellent oxygen evolution activity of the La(Co₀.₇₁Ni₀.₂₅)₀.₉₆O₃₋δ perovskite nanostructure can be attributed to its intrinsic structure, interconnected particle arrangement, and unique redox characteristics. The enhanced intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the La(Co₀.₇₁Ni₀.₂₅)₀.₉₆O₃₋δ catalyst was correlated with several parameters, such as the electrochemical surface area, the roughness factor, and the turnover frequency, with respect to variation in the transition metals of the perovskite structure. Subsequently, La(Co₀.₇₁Ni₀.₂₅)₀.₉₆O₃₋δ was utilized as the air cathode in a zinc–air battery application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abatteries 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3ananomaterials 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3apotassium hydroxide 3aroughness 3asurface area 0aperovskites 0awater oxidation 0aLaCo1−xNixO3−δ 0aoxygen electrode 0azinc−air battery1 aPrabu, Moni1 aShanmugam, Sangaraju0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Mar. 09, v. 8, no. 9 p.6019-6031dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b118403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245010500215300001800320500001900338520156400357592002801921596008301949596008302032596007502115650001402190650002402204650003002228650002602258650001302284650001102297650002302308650002202331650001202353650001002365651001102375700004002386700002702426700003802453700003002491700002302521773012702544856008202671852000902753655001202762IND60729818820221122224502.0210303e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072981882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-021-04529-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Mello Cionek, Vivian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0879-690X10aInfluence of leaf miners and environmental quality on litter breakdown in tropical headwater streams  ap. 1311-1331.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHeadwater streams subjected to anthropogenic impacts are prone to environmental quality decay, which may affect stream functioning. To investigate the effects of loss of environmental quality in stream functioning, we tested the hypothesis that leaf breakdown is faster in streams with higher environmental quality, and that invertebrate community structure and microbial biomass are negatively affected by habitat simplification resulting from environmental degradation. We submerged Alchornea glandulosa leaves in litter bags in nine streams, in Southern Brazil, in an environmental gradient. We characterized breakdown rates (k), physical in-stream characteristics, abundance of invertebrate taxa, and functional groups and microbial biomass for each stream, with three mesh exclusions (fine, medium, coarse). Breakdown was faster in the most preserved stream (k = − 0.032 ± 0.005) and decreased towards the most disturbed stream (k = − 0.0034 ± 0.001). Breakdown rates were positively associated with underwater habitat complexity, equitability of macroinvertebrate taxa, and abundance of Stenochironomus sp., which together explained 51% of breakdown rate variability. Breakdown rates from the less disturbed streams (n = 7, excluding urban-influenced) were lowest in medium-mesh, intermediate in fine-mesh, and highest in coarse-mesh bags, and the only taxon that differed according to this pattern was the mining-chironomid Stenochironomus sp., which suggests that this taxon had a significant activity of leaf processing.  aPublisher supplied data  a140577/2012-2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a475256/2012-3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aPROEXcConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aAlchornea 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental quality 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3amacroinvertebrates 3amicrobial biomass 3astreams 3awater 3aBrazil1 aFogaça, Fábio Nascimento Oliveira1 aMoulton, Timothy Peter1 aPazianoto, Laryssa Helena Ribeiro1 aLandgraf, Guilherme Okuda1 aBenedito, Evanilde0 tHydrobiologia.g2021 Mar., v. 848, no. 6 p.1311-1331dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04529-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245006500209300001600274500001500290506007600305520161000381506003701991650002302028650001802051650001402069650001402083650001902097650001002116650001902126650001502145650001702160650001702177650001402194650001102208653002202219653001802241653002302259653001802282653001802300700002502318700002302343773009602366852000902462856008502471930003302556946001102589655001202600IND4448538220221207065550.0110128e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444853822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-010-0239-02doi7 aPMC30251052pmcid7 a211076202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiesche, Johannes 10aSymplasmic transport and phloem loading in gymnosperm leaves  ap. 181-190.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite more than 130 years of research, phloem loading is far from being understood in gymnosperms. In part this is due to the special architecture of their leaves. They differ from angiosperm leaves among others by having a transfusion tissue between bundle sheath and the axial vascular elements. This article reviews the somewhat inaccessible and/or neglected literature and identifies the key points for pre-phloem transport and loading of photoassimilates. The pre-phloem pathway of assimilates is structurally characterized by a high number of plasmodesmata between all cell types starting in the mesophyll and continuing via bundle sheath, transfusion parenchyma, Strasburger cells up to the sieve elements. Occurrence of median cavities and branching indicates that primary plasmodesmata get secondarily modified and multiplied during expansion growth. Only functional tests can elucidate whether this symplasmic pathway is indeed continuous for assimilates, and if phloem loading in gymnosperms is comparable with the symplasmic loading mode in many angiosperm trees. In contrast to angiosperms, the bundle sheath has properties of an endodermis and is equipped with Casparian strips or other wall modifications that form a domain border for any apoplasmic transport. It constitutes a key point of control for nutrient transport, where the opposing flow of mineral nutrients and photoassimilates has to be accommodated in each single cell, bringing to mind the principle of a revolving door. The review lists a number of experiments needed to elucidate the mode of phloem loading in gymnosperms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anutrient transport 3aplasmodesmata 3anutrients 3abranching 3asieve elements 3atrees 3aphloem loading 3aendodermis 3aGymnospermae 3aAngiospermae 3amesophyll 3aleaves 0aStrasburger cells 0aConiferophyta 0aTransfusion tissue 0aMagnoliophyta 0aBundle sheath1 aMartens, Helle Juel 1 aSchulz, Alexander 0 tProtoplasma.g2011 Jan., v. 248, no. 1 p.181-190dVienna : Springer Viennax0033-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-010-0239-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20110128b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle00958naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245012000129300001600249520019100265650002700456653002300483700002100506700001600527773008800543852000900631939003300640945000800673946001100681655001200692991583014620742620221119031612.0831129s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830103642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehta, S.10aRelative toxicity of some non-insecticidal chemicals to the free living larvae guinea-worm (Dracunculus medinensis)  ap. 397-400.  aDracunculus medinensis, relative toxicity of seven non-insecticidal chemicals against free living larvae, implications for simultaneous control of cyclops vector and D. medinensis larvae 3aDracunculus medinensis 0aVectors, Crustacea1 aSrivastava, R.C.1 aGupta, A.N.0 tActa hydrochimica et hydrobiologica.g1982, v. 10, no. 4 p.397-400x0323-43207nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831129c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01971naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245011100160300001600271520106400287650001701351650001701368650001601385650002301401650002001424651001601444653002501460773008201485852000901567930003301576945002501609946001101634655001201645IND4365212220221119031824.0041026e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436521222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJohnsen, S.14aThe redefinition of family farming: agricultural restructuring and farm adjustment in Waihemo, New Zealand  ap. 419-432.  aThe process of agricultural restructuring embarked upon by the New Zealand government in the mid-1980s precipitated a period of financial hardship for many of the nation's farmers. It was not uncommon for families to adapt major adjustment strategies in order to maintain the viability of their enterprise at this time. Drawing upon a detailed case study of farm-level responses in a small rural locality, this paper argues that farm adjustments employed during and since this period have altered the character of family farming in the area in fundamental ways. Such change has been evident in the increasing heterogeneity of farm structure, and the alteration of farming goals and household labour arrangements, together with the evolution of local cultural norms. These transformations not only raise important questions about the future structure and sustainability of family farming in the area, but also inspire a conceptual reconsideration of the family farm unit as traditional linkages between the farm enterprise, household and property are weakened. 3afamily farms 3acase studies 3arural areas 3aeconomic structure 3arural economics 3aNew Zealand 0aWaihemo, New Zealand0 tJournal of rural studies.g2004 Oct., v. 20, no. 4 p.419-432x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a20041227b00000000c00000000  aINDdRLGe2004/12/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03613naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245011900186300001700305520183600322650002302158650002202181650001502203650001002218650000902228650005702237650004302294650001102337650002402348650002702372650001102399650003602410650003502446650005002481650000902531650001602540650002202556650001602578653002302594653000802617700001602625700001402641700001502655700002102670700001602691700001802707700001602725700002002741773012902761852000902890856009202899930003302991946001103024655001203035IND4443090120221119031459.0101001e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444309012DNAL7 a208803462pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01290.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirsch, D.10aCorrection of insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal after pancreatic islet transplantation: preliminary results  ap. 994-1003.  aAims: Pancreatic islet transplantation (PIT) represents a potential curative treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes, but only 10-15% of patients remain insulin independent 5 years post-transplant.

The study objective was to understand the changes in insulin resistance, glucose effectiveness (Sg) and free fatty acid dynamics (FFAd) before and after PIT. Methods: Insulin sensitivity index (Si), Sg and FFAd were measured before and after PIT in 10 lean patients, 8 of whom reached insulin independence. Modified Bergman minimal model of frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed pretransplant and at 12 months post-transplant. Nine non-diabetic control (NDC) subjects matched by age, gender and BMI were used. Results: Pretransplant Si and Sg were 3.5 ± 0.8 x 10⁻⁵/min/(pmol/l) and 0.74 ± 0.24 x 10⁻²/min, respectively. Si was significantly lower than matched NDCs [10.8 ± 0.6 x 10⁻⁵/min/(pmol/l), p < 0.004]; Sg did not reach statistical significance (1.27 ± 0.22 x 10⁻²/min, p = 0.25). Compared to pretransplant values, mean post-transplant Si and Sg were 9.6 ± 1.3 x 10⁻⁵/min/(pmol/l)and 1.28 ± 0.22 x10⁻²/min, respectively, indicating significant improvement for Si but not Sg (p = 0.008and p = 0.06). Twelve-month post-PIT compared to NDC values were not significantly different (p = 0.58 and 0.97, respectively). In addition, fractional disposal rate for FFA which directly depends on the endogenous insulin release (10-20 min) nearly normalized after PIT (p = 0.06). Conclusion: These preliminary findings demonstrate that PIT can restore glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity and partially correct glucose effectiveness and FFAd. 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xphysiopathologyxsurgery. 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aInsulinxphysiologyxsecretion. 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aIslets of Langerhans Transplantationxmethods 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aTreatment Outcome 2aYoung Adult 0aglucose metabolism 0aPIT1 aOdorico, J.1 aRadke, N.1 aHanson, M.1 aDanobeitia, J.S.1 aHullett, D.1 aAlejandro, R.1 aRicordi, C.1 aFernandez, L.A.0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2010 Nov., v. 12, no. 11 p.994-1003dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01290.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02318naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009900163300001800262520130200280650002001582650001201602650001401614650001901628700002101647700002301668700002501691700002001716773011801736852000901854856008501863930003301948946001101981655001201992IND4446846920221119031754.0101224e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444684692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10552-010-9625-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurton, Anya 10aYoung adulthood body mass index and risk of cancer in later adulthood: historical cohort study  ap. 2069-2077.  aObjective To investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood and cancer incidence and mortality. Methods A total of 9,549 men and 2,657 women had weight and height measured while at university (1948-1968). Participants were traced through the National Health Service Central Register, and cancer registration and death certificates were obtained. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of associations between BMI and cancer incidence and mortality. Results The mean age at university was 20 years. During a median follow-up of 49 years, 2,349 deaths occurred, including 55 breast, 111 prostate, and 131 colorectal cancer. There were 1,305 cancer registrations, including 102 breast, 211 prostate, and 125 colorectal cancers. There was weak evidence of an association between BMI and colorectal cancer incidence (adjusted HR per 1 kg/m²: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.98-1.15) and mortality (HR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.98-1.14). There was no evidence of an association between BMI and either breast or prostate cancer. Conclusions Targeting a reduction in obesity in young adulthood may prevent a significant number of colorectal cancer deaths, although whether this relationship is direct or through tracking to later adult BMI has yet to be established. 3abody mass index 3aobesity 3aneoplasms 3acohort studies1 aMartin, Richard 1 aGalobardes, Bruna 1 aDavey Smith, George 1 aJeffreys, Mona 0 tCancer causes & control.g2010 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.2069-2077dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-010-9625-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02977naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245012500170300001600295520156500311650001901876650001101895650002401906650001501930650001401945650002301959650002201982650002102004650001902025650001402044650001602058650001502074651000902089653001402098653002202112653002102134700002102155700001902176700001902195700002002214773012802234852000902362856009202371930003302463946001102496655001202507IND4443462020221119031819.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444346202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00557.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlusià, Joan10aMeasurement of volatile terpene emissions in 70 dominant vascular plant species in Hawaii: aliens emit more than natives  ap. 863-874.  aAlien plant invasion is prominent in the Hawaiian Islands. There are many factors involved in invader success. To date, there is a general lack of information about one of them, which we aim to study here: the terpene emission capacity of both Hawaiian native and alien plants. Oahu (Hawaii). We screened 35 alien and 35 native dominant plant species on Oahu Island for monoterpene emissions. The emission rates were measured from field-grown plants under standardized conditions of temperature and quantum flux density in the laboratory. The emission rates of total terpenes ranged from 0 μg g⁻¹ h⁻¹ to 55 μg g⁻¹ h⁻¹, and altogether 15 different terpenes were emitted in detectable amounts by the overall set of species. A phylogenetic signal was observed for total terpene emissions. Total terpene emission rates were higher in aliens than in native species (12.8 ± 2.0 vs. 7.6 ± 1.9 μg g⁻¹ h⁻¹, respectively). The greater terpene emission capacity may confer protection against multiple stresses and may partly account for the success of the invasive species, and may make invasive species more competitive in response to new global change-driven combined stresses. These results are consistent with aliens coming from very diverse ecosystems with generally higher biotic and abiotic stress pressures, and having higher nutrient concentrations. On the contrary, these results are not consistent with the 'excess carbon' hypotheses. These results indicate changes in vegetation terpene emissions brought about by alien plant invasions. 3aabiotic stress 3acarbon 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3amonoterpenoids 3aphylogeny 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aOahu 0aα-pinene 0aspecies invasions 0aterpene emission1 aPeñuelas, Josep1 aSardans, Jordi1 aOwen, Susan M.1 aNiinemets, Ulo.0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2010 Nov., v. 19, no. 6 p.863-874dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1466-822X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00557.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02553naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155072000900173100001500182245013200197300001800329500002400347520060300371650002500974650001500999650002501014650004401039650005901083650003401142650004701176650005501223650010301278650004001381650004301421650003901464650002501503650002401528650004301552650003201595650002301627700001901650700001901669700001601688773011501704852000901819856009401828856007701922945002501999946001102024655001202035IND4361249220221119031750.0040209e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436124922DNAL7 a147198232pmid7 a10.1023/B:BILE.0000003978.72266.962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aKeyser, M.10aTreatment of winery effluent with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)--granular sludges enriched with Enterobacter sakazakii  ap. 1893-1898.  aIncludes references  aThree upflow anaerobic sludge blankets (UASBs) were evaluated for the treatment of winery wastewater: the first was seeded with granular sludge enriched with Enterobacter sakazakii and reached a 90% COD removal within 17 d at hydraulic retention time of 24 h; the second was seeded with brewery granules and achieved 85% COD removal within 50 d, the third was seeded with just sludge and showed the typical problems encountered with conventional sludge seeding and had continuously to be re-seeded.

The experiment included five fertilizer treatments: organic amendment (OA), half organic amendment plus half mineral fertilizer (1/2 OM), mineral fertilizer NPK, mineral fertilizer NK, and the control (without fertilization). AMF inoculation responsiveness (MIR) of wheat plants at acquiring P were estimated by comparing plants grown in unsterilized soil inoculated with G. caledonium and in untreated soil containing indigenous AMF. Without AMF inoculation, higher crop yields but lower colonization rates were observed in the NPK and two OA-inputted treatments, and NPK had significantly (P < 0.05) lower impacts on organic C and available P in soils and thereby P acquisition of wheat plants compared with OA and 1/2 OM. G. caledonium inoculation significantly (P < 0.05) increased colonization rates with the NPK and two P-deficient treatments but significantly (P < 0.05) increased vegetative biomass, crop yield, and P acquisition of wheat as well as soil alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, only with the NPK treatment. This gave an MIR of ca. 45% on total P acquisition of wheat plants. There were no other remarkable MIRs. It suggested that the MIR is determined by soil available P status, and rational combination of AMF with chemical NPK fertilizer can compensate for organic amendments by improving P-acquisition efficiency in arable soils. 3aGlomus caledonium 3aNPK fertilizers 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aarable soils 3abiomass 3acrop yield 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3amineral fertilizers 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asandy loam soils 3asoil inoculation 3awheat 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aBiomass 2aFertilizers 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTriticumxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 0aP efficiency 0aSoil alkaline phosphatase 0aSoil available P 0aSoil microbial biomass P 0aSoil organic C1 aLin, Xiangui 1 aWang, Junhua 1 aCui, Xiangchao 1 aDai, Jue 1 aChu, Haiyan 1 aZhang, Jiabao 0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Oct., v. 88, no. 3 p.781-787dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2791-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01438naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245008000139300001600219300002400235520050300259650001900762650001600781650001700797650001900814650002700833653001900860700002400879700001900903773010200922852001301024939003301037945000801070946001301078852000901091655001201100991583005770742620221119031356.0860320e198508  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860101532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, Jeanette L.10aDevelopment of an assessment form: Attitude toward weight gain in pregnancy  ap. 946-949.  ap. 946-949. charts.  aExtract: A questionnaire with 18 statements expressing different attitudes of pregnant women toward their own weight gain was developed and tested.

These lesions are predominantly repaired via the conserved base excision repair (BER) pathway. BER is initiated with excision of oxidized or modified bases by DNA glycosylases leading to formation of abasic (AP) site or strand break at the lesion site. Structural analysis by experimental and modeling approaches shows the presence of a disordered segment commonly localized at the N- or C-terminus as a characteristic signature of mammalian DNA glycosylases which is absent in their bacterial prototypes. Recent studies on unstructured regions in DNA metabolizing proteins have indicated their essential role in interaction with other proteins and target DNA recognition. In this review, we have discussed the unique presence of disordered segments in human DNA glycosylases, and AP endonuclease involved in the processing of glycosylase products, and their critical role in regulating repair functions. These disordered segments also include sites for posttranslational modifications and nuclear localization signal. The teleological basis for their structural flexibility is discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aexcision 3agenome 3aglycosylases 3ahumans 3amodels 3anuclear localization signals 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins 3aprototypes 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 0aBase excision repair 0aDNA glycosylases 0aEnd processing proteins 0aDisordered terminal segments 0aSingle strand breaks 0aRepair complex 0aProtein-protein and protein-DNA interactions1 aHazra, Tapas K. 1 aMitra, Sankar 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 Nov., v. 67, no. 21 p.3573-3587dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-010-0485-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01836naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007100128300001400199520115600213650001301369650001301382650002501395653001201420773009501432852000901527939003301536946001301569655001201582IND9200534520221119031211.0920131e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920053452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorkman, J.E.10aStatus characteristics theory: an application to clothing research  ap. 49-54.  aThe purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two variables on performance; a status characteristic (fashionable) and a opportunity to demonstrate competence. Sixty-two undergraduate female volunteers participated in the study. Fifty percent of the subjects, after being labeled either fashionable or unfashionable, were given an opportunity to demostrate competence by making decisions about appropriate clothing for various situations. The other 50% were given no opportunity to demostrate competence. Subjects who were given an opportunity to demonstrate competence improved their scores on a posttest twice as much as subjects who were not given an opportunity to demostrate competence. Subjects who had been negatively labeled "unfashionalbe" and who were then given an opportunity to demonstrate competence improved their scores almost three times as much as subjects who had been negatively labeled "unfashionalbe" and who were not given an opportunity to demonstrate competence. Results suggest that persons in a lower status position relative to other can benefit from being given an opportunity to disprove that lower status label. 3aclothing 3aresearch 3asocioeconomic status 0afashion0 tClothing and textiles research journal.g1990 Summer, v. 8, no. 4 p.49-54x0887-302X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01850naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002500133245007200158300001600230300002400246520035000270650002100620650001300641650002500654650002000679650001800699650002600717650001200743650001100755650001000766650000900776650001700785650002600802650001700828650002100845650001800866650001100884650001000895650001100905650000900916650001800925650000900943650002000952650001600972650001500988651001101003700002101014700002501035700002201060773010201082852001301184939003301197945000801230946001301238852000901251655001201260991583003620742620221119031130.0860320e198508  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860101522DNAL7 a40199852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewell, G.

In a fed-batch culture with the chemically defined medium, 237 g xylitol l-1 was produced from 270 g xylose l-1 after 120 h. The volumetric rate of xylitol production and the xylitol yield from xylose were 2 g l-1 h-1 and 89%, respectively. These values were about 5% lower and 4% higher, respectively, than those obtained using the complex medium.

In the Triticeae, the protein has evolved the ability to specifically inhibit the main group of α-amylases expressed during germination of barley and encoded by the amy1 gene family found only in the Triticeae. The expression of the asi gene that encodes BASI has been reported to be controlled by the hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA). Despite many studies at the gene and protein level, the function of this gene in the plant remains unclear. In this study, the 5'-flanking region (1033 bp, 1033-asi promoter) and the 3'-flanking region (655 bp) of the asi gene were isolated and characterised. The 1033-asi promoter sequence showed homology to a number of ciselements that play a role in ABA and GA regulated expression of other genes. With a green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) as reporter, the 1033-asi promoter was studied for spatial, temporal and hormonal control of gene expression. The 1033-asi promoter and its deletions direct transient gfp expression in the pericarp and at low levels in mature aleurone cells, and this expression is not regulated by ABA or GA. In transgenic barley plants, the 1033-asi promoter directed tissue-specific expression of the gfp gene in developing grain and germinating grain but not in roots or leaves. In developing grain, expression of gfp was observed specifically in the pericarp, the vascular tissue, the nucellar projection cells and the endosperm transfer cells and the hormones ABA or GA did not regulate this expression. In mature germinating grain gfp expression was observed in the embryo but not in aleurone or starchy endosperm. However, GA induced gfp expression in the aleurone of mature imbibed seeds from which the embryo had been removed. Expression in maternal rather than endosperm tissues of the grain suggests that earlier widespread assumptions that the protein is expressed largely in the endosperm may have been largely based on analysis of mixed grain tissues. This novel pattern of expression suggests that both activities of the protein may be primarily involved in seed defence in the peripheral tissues of the seed. 3agreen fluorescent protein 3abarley 3apericarp 3aHordeum vulgare 3atransgenic plants 3agibberellic acid 3atranscription (genetics) 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agene expression 3aendosperm 3aaleurone layer 3areporter genes 3aabscisic acid 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 2a3' Flanking Regionxgenetics 2a5' Flanking Regionxgenetics 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGerminationxgenetics 2aGibberellinsxpharmacology 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aHordeumxgenetics 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTrypsin Inhibitor, Kunitz Soybeanxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aseeds 0aembryo (plant) 0aalpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aHenry, R.1 aScott, K.1 aMeech, S.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2003 July, v. 52, no. 4 p.787-799dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-4412/contents3electronic resource  aINDdRHFe2004/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03356naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002200186245014400208300001800352520171300370650002202083650005402105650007102159650004202230650001102272650002402283650003002307650004202337650001102379650000902390650003102399650001602430650003202446650002302478651002002501653003202521653002202553700002402575700001902599773011802618852000902736856008502745930003302830946001102863655001202874IND4442639420221119025711.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444263942DNAL7 a205355412pmid7 aPMC36217162pmcid7 a10.1007/s10552-010-9597-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilip, Errol J. 10aEvaluating the impact of an educational intervention to increase CRC screening rates in the African American community: a preliminary study  ap. 1685-1691.  aBackground Despite the acknowledged importance of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and its proven prognostic benefit, African American men and women simultaneously possess the highest rates of CRC-related incidence and mortality (Swan et al. in Cancer 97(6):1528-1540, 2003) and lowest screening rates in the United States (Polite et al. in Med Clin N Am 89(4):771-793, 2005). Effective, targeted interventions that promote CRC screening for this community are therefore critical. The current study evaluated the impact of a print-based educational intervention on screening behavior and associated patient-based factors, including cancer-related knowledge, fatalism, worry, and decisional balance (pros-cons). Methods One hundred and eighteen individuals (mean age = 56.08, SD = 5.58) who had not undergone screening were recruited from two health clinics in New York City. Each participant received educational print materials regarding the need for screening, the process of undergoing screening, and the benefits of regular CRC screening. Results One in four individuals had undergone post-intervention screening at a three-month follow-up. Whereas all participants reported a decrease in cancer-related worry (p < .05), it was a decrease in fatalism (p < .05) and an increase in decisional balance (p < .05) that was associated with post-intervention screening behavior. Discussion These preliminary results suggest that fatalistic beliefs and an individual's assessment of the benefits and barriers of screening may be critical in the decision to undergo CRC screening. Future interventions to increase CRC-screening rates for this community may be improved by focusing on these patient-based factors. 3aAfrican Americans 2aBlack or African Americanxeducationxpsychology. 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxethnologyxprevention & controlxpsychology. 2aEarly Detection of Cancerxpsychology 2aFemale 2aGuidelines as Topic 2aHealth Educationxmethods 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMass Screeningxpsychology 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTeaching Materials 0aNew York (N.Y.) 0aColorectal cancer screening 0aCancer prevention1 aDuHamel, Katherine 1 aJandorf, Lina 0 tCancer causes & control.g2010 Oct., v. 21, no. 10 p.1685-1691dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-010-9597-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02334naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155072000900173072000900182100002000191245011100211300001800322500002400340520064900364650002501013650003501038650003701073650005601110650005101166650003101217650003401248650002501282650003401307650003401341650004401375650004001419700001501459700001901474700001401493700001401507773011501521852000901636856009401645856007701739945002501816946001101841655001201852IND4361249820221119025647.0040209e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436124982DNAL7 a147198312pmid7 a10.1023/B:BILE.0000003991.71854.092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aX3001 aPassolunghi, S.10aMonitoring the transport of recombinant Candida rugosa lipase by a green fluorescent protein-lipase fusion  ap. 1945-1948.  aIncludes references  aIn a batch cultivation of Pichia pastoris expressing Candida rugosa lipase 1 (CRL1), secretion of 200 micrograms lipase ml-1 of culture was achieved in sorbitol-based medium.

Rooting phase was performed on media supplemented with different auxins: 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA), 3-indolebutyric acid (IBA) and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The best axillary-bud proliferation was recorded on MS medium containing 1.33 micromolar BA plus 0.32 micromolar NAA. Plantlets rooted easily on the different tested media, but more abundant and stronger roots occurred on media containing 2.68 micromolar NAA. The composition of oil obtained through the cultured explants was analyzed by headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC), and santolindiacetylene (SDA) in vitro production was tested. In order to stimulate the production of this product, different concentrations of linoleic acid were supplemented to the media. The best santolindiacetylene production was obtained when the rooting media was supplemented with 0.36 micromolar linoleic acid. 3aSantolina 3akinetin 3avolatile compounds 3alinoleic acid 3ain vitro culture 3abiosynthesis 3aindole butyric acid 3amedicinal plants 3aplant fats and oils 3arooting 3acytokinins 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3aalkynes 3anaphthalene 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 0aSantolina canescens 0aauxins 0asantolindiacetylene1 aNavarro, M.C.1 aUtrilla, M.P.1 aMartinez, A.1 aJimenez, J.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2002 May, v. 69, no. 2 p.147-153dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  aINDdMKSe2004/02/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02006naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001400147245009400161300001800255500002400273500001500297520047700312650002200789650003300811650002000844650005500864650002200919650002100941650004800962650008501010650001301095650002501108650002401133650001601157653001901173700001701192700001501209700001701224700001701241700001701258773011501275852000901390856007701399945002501476946001101501655001201512IND4361355320221119025801.0040225e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436135532DNAL7 a145849262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aX3001 aIqbal, Z.10aKinetics of enhanced thermostability of an extracellular glucoamylase from Arachniotus sp  ap. 1667-1670.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPurified extracellular glucoamylase from Arachniotus sp. was used for kinetic and thermodynamic characterization.

Only 4% (0.026 U ml-1) of the total peroxidase was secreted into the broth by cultured cells while in cultured protoplasts, 45% (0.12 U ml-1) was secreted. Protoplasts were protected against the physical and osmotic stresses by immobilizing them in 3% agarose gel (high mass transfer, non-electric charge, low gelation temperature). In order to increase peroxidase production, the immobilized protoplasts were cultivated in shake cultures at low osmotic pressure (12.3 to 16.4 atm) without disruption. During batch peroxidase production, the total activities obtained with free cells at 4.9 atm, free protoplasts at 19.3 atm, and immobilized protoplasts at 12.3 atm were 0.17, 2.54, and 5.16 U, respectively. When four repeated-batch cultures of the immobilized protoplasts were performed at 16.4 atm, 11.8 U of peroxidase was obtained.

At the end of the beam, the animal takes a 180° turn. This is a difficult situation because substrate area is small and moves relative to the body during the turn. We investigated how leg movements are organised during this turn. A non-contact of either front leg appears to indicate the end of the beam. However, a turn can only begin if the hind legs stand in an appropriate position relative to each other; the outer hind leg must not be placed posterior to the inner hind leg. When starting the turn, both front legs are lifted and usually held in a relatively stable position and then the inner middle leg performs a swing-and-search movement: The leg begins a swing, which is continued by a searching movement to the side and to the rear, and eventually grasps the beam. At the same time the body is turned usually being supported by the outer middle leg and both hind legs. Then front legs followed by the outer middle leg reach the beam. A scheme describing the turns based on a few simple behavioural elements is proposed. 3aCarausius morosus 3aanimals 3ainsects 3alegs 3awalking1 aEhmanns, I. 1 aStübner, S. 1 aSchmitz, Josef 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2009 Mar., v. 195, no. 3 p.299-309dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-008-0406-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02166naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155072000900173100001400182245012100196300001400317500002400331500001500355520050200370650002600872650001700898650001600915650004200931650003000973650002701003650003701030650003001067650007101097650002901168650001501197650003001212650000901242653002201251653001801273700001401291700001501305700001401320773011001334852000901444856009401453856007701547945002501624946001101649655001201660IND4361437720221119025914.0040301e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436143772DNAL7 a150051562pmid7 a10.1023/B:BILE.0000009464.23026.e02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3001 aWee, Y.J.10aBiotechnological production of L(+)-lactic acid from wood hydrolyzate by batch fermentation of Enterococcus faecalis  ap. 71-74.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe inhibition of lactic acid fermentation by wood hydrolyzate was decreased (approx. 20%) by adaptation of Enterococcus faecalis RKY1 to wood hydrolyzate-based medium whereby lactic acid productivity and cell growth were enhanced by 0.5 g l-1 h-1 and 2.1 g l-1, respectively.

In this study, we used cardiotonic steroids as Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase inhibitors to explore the possible involvement of Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase in pulmonary epithelial inflammation. The results demonstrated that mice after ouabain inhalation developed cyclooxygenase-2-dependent acute lung inflammation. The in vitro experiments further confirmed that Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase inhibitors significantly stimulated cyclooxygenase-2 expression in lung epithelial cells of human or murine origin, the process of which was participated by multiple cis-elements and trans-acting factors. Most importantly, we first described here that Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase inhibitors could evoke a significant Hu antigen R nuclear export in lung epithelial cells, which stabilized cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA by binding with a proximal AU-rich element within its 3′-untranslated region. In conclusion, HuR-mediated mRNA stabilization opens new avenues in understanding the importance of Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase, as well as its inhibitors in inflammation. 3aantigens 3abreathing 3acytokines 3aepithelial cells 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aouabain 3aphysiological transport 3apneumonia 3aprostaglandin synthase 3asodium 3asteroids 3atransactivators 0aNa⁺, K⁺-ATPase 0aCardiotonic steroids 0aAcute lung inflammation 0aCyclooxygenase-2 0aHu antigen R1 aChen, Wei 1 aCao, Dan 1 aBian, Jinjun 1 aGong, Fang-Yuan 1 aCheng, Wei 1 aCheng, Shun 1 aXu, Qiang 1 aHua, Zi-Chun 1 aYin, Wu 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2011 Jan., v. 68, no. 1 p.109-124dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-010-0444-13Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02267naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245011500161300001600276500002400292520100300316650001701319650000901336650002101345650002001366650002201386650001201408650001001420650003501430650001201465650001601477650001401493650001901507650001401526653003401540700001501574773012201589852000901711856007701720945002501797946001101822655001201833IND4361357420221119025921.0040225e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436135742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To investigate functional differences between GBSS alleles, we cloned and sequenced GBSS cDNA from a series of cultivars that differed substantially in apparent amylose content and starch viscosity characteristics. We found two single nucleotide polymorphisms in exons 6 and 10 that resulted in amino acid substitutions. These substitutions are associated with differences in apparent amylose content and viscosity characteristics. Subsequent sequencing of these regions from additional cultivars confirmed their association with particular rice quality characteristics. These point mutations could prove useful as molecular markers in the production of cultivars with superior eating, cooking and processing quality, and contribute to our understanding of the various structural and functional differences among granule bound starch synthase alleles. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3astructural genes 3astarch synthase 3acomplementary DNA 3aalleles 3aexons 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aamylose 3arice starch 3aviscosity 3apoint mutation 3acultivars 0agranule-bound starch synthase1 aPark, W.D.0 tMolecular breeding.g2003 Nov., v. 12, no. 4 p.335-339dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1380-3743/contents3electronic resource  aINDdRHFe2004/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02455naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010100128300001600229500001500245520126900260650001801529650001201547650000901559650002101568650001901589650002601608650001301634650002601647650001201673650002301685650002301708650002201731650001101753653001301764653001401777653002801791653001101819653001201830700002001842773006701862852000901929930003301938945001301971946001301984655001201997IND2039741520221119030112.0940523e199308  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203974152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoulden, M.G.10aFunctionally homologous host components recognize potato virus X in Gomphrena globosa and potato  ap. 921-930.  a2019-12-05  aAll known isolates of potato virus X (PVX), with the exception of a South American isolate PVX(HB), induce an extreme resistance response on potato carrying the Rx gene and elicit the production of necrotic lesions on Gomphrena globosa: PVX(HB) establishes systemic infection on Rx genotypes of potato and infects the inoculated leaf of G. globosa without lesion formation. Previously, we have shown that the Rx-mediated resistance is affected by a feature of the coat protein that depends on the presence of a threonine residue at position 121 in the coat protein of PVX(CP4) and that the resistance is an induced response expressed in protoplasts of potato with the Rx genotype. In this study, we provide evidence, based on the analysis of PVX(CP4)/PVX(HB) hybrids, that the elicitation of lesions on G. globosa also requires the presence of a threonine residue at position 121 of the viral coat protein. The lesion-forming phenotype was not associated with the ability of the viral isolate to accumulate in the infected plant. We therefore propose that there is a homologous component of both potato carrying Rx and G. globosa that interacts with a feature of the PVX coat protein and, following the interaction, activates an induced response in the plant cell. 3acoat proteins 3ahybrids 3aloci 3astructural genes 3aPotato virus X 3aChenopodium giganteum 3anecrosis 3aNicotiana clevelandii 3amutants 3adisease resistance 3ainduced resistance 3aGomphrena globosa 3aleaves 0arx locus 0aNicotiana 0aexperimental infections 0agenome 0arx gene1 aBaulcombe, D.C.0 tPlant cell.g1993 Aug., v. 5, no. 8 p.921-930x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03709naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001900150245022200169300001800391500002400409500001500433506007600448520110900524506003701633650002501670650001801695650002001713650001201733650000901745650002201754650001801776650001501794650002101809650002501830650002501855650001201880650002101892650002001913650002401933650001201957650005301969650005902022650001602081650003202097650003702129650002602166650006202192650001402254650004202268650004102310650005602351650004602407650003702453650003302490650002302523650003402546650002602580653001402606653001502620653002802635653001502663700001602678700001502694773011102709852000902820856005102829930003302880945001302913946001302926655001202939IND2332861620221207051421.0030603e200206  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233286162DNAL7 a120848352pmid7 aPMC1507882pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaswick, P.E.10aJasmonate response locus JAR1 and several related Arabidopsis genes encode enzymes of the firefly luciferase superfamily that show activity on jasmonic, salicylic, and indole-3-acetic acids in an assay for adenylation  ap. 1405-1415.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aJasmonic acid (JA) and related cyclopentanones are critical plant signaling molecules, but their mode of action at the molecular level is unclear. A map-based approach was used to identify the defective gene in the Arabidopsis JA response mutant jar1-1. JAR1 is 1 of 19 closely related Arabidopsis genes that are similar to the auxin-induced soybean GH3 gene. Analysis of fold predictions for this protein family suggested that JAR1 might belong to the acyl adenylate-forming firefly luciferase superfamily. These enzymes activate the carboxyl groups of a variety of substrates for their subsequent biochemical modification. An ATP-PPi isotope exchange assay was used to demonstrate adenylation activity in a glutathione S-transferase-JAR1 fusion protein. Activity was specific for JA, suggesting that covalent modification of JA is important for its function. Six other Arabidopsis genes were specifically active on indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and one was active on both IAA and salicylic acid. These findings suggest that the JAR1 gene family is involved in multiple important plant signaling pathways.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3afar-red light 3aseedling growth 3aalleles 3aloci 3acomplementary DNA 3ajasmonic acid 3aluciferase 3amethyl jasmonate 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3amutants 3amultigene family 3aenzyme activity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aColeoptera. 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aLuciferasesxgenetics 2aNucleotidyltransferasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxylipins 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSalicylic Acidxpharmacology 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubstrate Specificity 0ajar1 gene 0ajar1 locus 0amolecular sequence data 0aoxygenases1 aTiryaki, I.1 aRowe, M.L.0 tplant cell.g2002 June, v. 14, no. 6 p.1405-1415dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02819naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245012600156300001600282500001500298520123200313650001201545650001901557650001901576650002201595650001201617650001301629650001201642650001201654650003301666650001101699650002801710650001101738650002201749650001501771650001601786650001601802650001001818651001101828653003001839653002801869653001301897653000901910653002501919700001601944700002001960700001501980700001401995700001302009773006002022852000902082856008102091930003302172945001302205946001102218655001202229IND2061715720221119025841.0980206s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206171572DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500500812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinter, K.10aEffect of elevated CO2 on growth and crassulacean-acid-metabolism activity of Kalanchoe pinnata under tropical conditions  ap. 389-396.  a2019-12-04  aKalanchoe pinnata (Lam.) Pers. (Crassulaceae), a succulent-leaved crassulacean-acid-metabolism plant, was grown in open-top chambers at ambient and elevated (two times ambient) CO2 concentrations under natural conditions at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Republic of Panama. Nocturnal increase in titratable acidity and nocturnal carbon gain were linearly related, increased with leaf age, and were unaffected by CO2 treatments. However, under elevated CO2, dry matter accumulation increased by 42-51%. Thus, the increased growth at elevated CO2 was attributable entirely to increased net CO2 uptake during daytime in the light. Malic acid was the major organic acid accumulated overnight. Nocturnal malate accumulation exceeded nocturnal citrate accumulation by six- to eightfold at both CO2 concentrations. Basal (predawn) starch levels were higher in leaves of plants grown at elevated CO2 but diurnal fluctuations of starch were of similar magnitude under both ambient and elevated CO2. In both treatments, nocturnal starch degradation accounted for between 78 and 89% of the nocturnal accumulation of malate and citrate. Glucose, fructose, and sucrose were not found to exhibit marked day-night fluctuations. 3aacidity 3aisocitric acid 3acarbon dioxide 3aKalanchoe pinnata 3aglucose 3afructose 3atropics 3asucrose 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3astarch 3adry matter accumulation 3acarbon 3adiurnal variation 3amalic acid 3acitric acid 3adegradation 3alight 3aPanama 0acarbon dioxide enrichment 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0aleaf age 0adark 0aBryophyllum pinnatum1 aRichter, A.1 aEngelbrecht, B.1 aPosada, J.1 aVirgo, A.1 aPopp, M.0 tPlanta.g1997, v. 201, no. 4 p.389-396x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500500813Available from publisher's Web site  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02711naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007500127300001400202520160600216650003001822650001201852650001601864650002101880650001801901650002001919650002001939650001801959650001101977650002601988650001302014650001802027650002302045650001502068650001402083653001302097700001502110700001902125773006502144852000902209930003302218945001302251946001302264655001202277IND2039909520221119025838.0940531e199401  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203990952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, J.P.10aMutants of Chlamydomonas with aberrant responses to sulfur deprivation  ap. 53-63.  aIn the absence of sulfur, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga, increases its rate of sulfate import and synthesizes several periplasmic proteins, including an arylsulfatase (Ars). These changes appear to help cells acclimate to a sulfur-deficient environment. The elevated rate of sulfate import results from an increase in the capacity and affinity of the transport system for sulfate. The synthesis of Ars, a periplasmic enzyme that cleaves sulfate from aromatic compounds, enables cells to use these molecules as a source of sulfur when free sulfate is not available. To characterize the ways in which C. reinhardtii perceives changes in the sulfur status of the environment and regulates its responses to these changes, we mutagenized cells and isolated strains exhibiting aberrant accumulation of Am activity. These mutants were characterized for Ars activity, ars mRNA accumulation, periplasmic protein accumulation, and sulfate transport activity when grown in both sulfur-sufficient and sulfur-deficient conditions. All of the mutants exhibited pleiotropic effects with respect to several of these responses. Strains harboring double mutant combinations were constructed and characterized for Ars activity and ars mRNA accumulation. From the mutant phenotypes, we inferred that both positive and negative regulatory elements were involved in the acclimation process. Both the epistatic relationships among the mutations and the effects of the lesions on the responses of C. reinhardtii to sulfur limitation distinguished these mutants from similar mutants in Neurospora crassa. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3amutants 3amutagenesis 3astructural genes 3aarylsulfatase 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3asulfur 3anutrient deficiencies 3asulfates 3aion transport 3anutrient transport 3apleiotropy 3aepistasis 0aars gene1 aYildiz, F.1 aGrossman, A.R.0 tPlant cell.g1994 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.53-63x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02210naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001400142245010300156300001600259500001500275520091300290650001301203650002201216650002201238650001701260650002001277650001901297650001401316650002201330651001001352653001401362653001701376700001701393700001401410700002001424700001701444700002001461700001601481700002201497773007301519852000901592856008201601930003301683945001301716946001101729655001201740IND2205300120221119025812.0000619e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220530012DNAL7 a10.1080/030794599944702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapua, I.10aOutbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N2) in Italy during October 1997 to January 1998  ap. 455-460.  a2019-12-04  aBetween the month of October 1997 and January 1998, eight outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza were diagnosed in the Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions in north-eastern Italy. For each of the eight outbreaks, influenza A virus of subtype H5N2 was isolated and the inoculation of susceptible chickens confirmed these viruses to be extremely virulent with intravenous pathogenicity indices in 6-week-old chickens of 2.98 to 3.00. Although it was not possible to trace the origin of infection, the epidemiological investigation revealed connections between several outbreaks and emphasized the well-known risk factors for avian influenza such as bird movement, rearing of mixed populations and contact with migratory waterfowl. Control measures listed in European Union directive 92/40/EEC were implemented promptly and spread of the infection to intensively-reared domestic poultry was avoided. 3achickens 3aantigen detection 3aInfluenza A virus 3arisk factors 3adisease control 3aviral antigens 3avirulence 3adisease diagnosis 3aItaly 0aoutbreaks 0aepidemiology1 aMarangon, S.1 aSelli, L.1 aAlexander, D.J.1 aSwayne, D.E.1 aDalla Pozza, M.1 aParenti, E.1 aCancellotti, F.M.0 tAvian pathology.g1999 Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.455-460x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794599944703Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02217naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245019900159300001600358520105900374650001301433650003201446650001801478650001601496650002201512650002301534653002601557700001701583700001601600700001801616773007301634852000901707856008201716930003301798945001301831946001101844655001201855IND2205300720221119025757.0000619e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220530072DNAL7 a10.1080/030794599945062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, J.K.A.10aBreadth of protection of the respiratory tract provided by different live-attenuated infectious bronchitis vaccines against challenge with infectious bronchitis viruses of heterologous serotypes  ap. 477-485.  aThe regime of administering the infectious bronchitis (IB) Ma5 vaccine (Massachusetts serotype) at 1 day old and the heterologous 4/91 vaccine at 2 weeks of age, was shown to be highly effective in protecting the respiratory tract of specified pathogen free chickens. Protection, as measured by assessing ciliary activity of the tracheal epithelium following challenge, was excellent against challenge at 5 weeks of age with IB strains of many serotypes, isolated from disease outbreaks in different parts of the world. This vaccination protocol was more effective than revaccination with a vaccine of the same serotype as the first vaccine. Furthermore, significantly better protection was seen when the Ma5 vaccine was given before, rather than at the same time as or following, the 4/91 vaccine. It is suggested that the use of these two IB vaccines will frequently broaden the protection possible against challenge with IB isolates of many different serotypes, without the need to develop a new IB vaccine to combat each new IB serotype that emerges. 3achickens 3aInfectious bronchitis virus 3alive vaccines 3avaccination 3agenetic variation 3adisease prevention 0aimmunization programs1 aOrbell, S.J.1 aWoods, M.A.1 aHuggins, M.B.0 tAvian pathology.g1999 Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.477-485x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794599945063Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03406naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245008800166300001400254500001500268520098600283650002501269650002701294650001701321650002001338650002801358650000901386650002101395650001701416650002201433650002401455650003001479650002201509650001501531650002501546650001201571650002001583650001901603650001001622650001901632650001201651650002401663650002901687650007001716650002501786650001801811650002801829650002301857650000801880650002501888650001701913650005001930650001001980650002801990650001302018650001402031650004002045650004202085650003302127650001302160650002302173650003202196650002402228653002802252653001902280653001402299653001902313653001502332653002502347653003002372700001702402773006502419852000902484930003302493945001302526946001302539655001202552IND2039908820221119025639.0940531e199401  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203990882DNAL7 a81306432pmid7 aPMC1604132pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastle, L.A.12aA FUSCA gene of Arabidopsis encodes a novel protein essential for plant development  ap. 25-41.  a2019-12-05  aArabidopsis fusca mutants display striking purple coloration due to anthocyanin accumulation in their cotyledons. We describe six recessive fusca mutants isolated from Agrobacterium-transformed Arabidopsis families. These mutants first become defective during embryogenesis and exhibit limited seedling development. Double mutant constructs revealed that developmental defects were not simply a consequence of anthocyanin accumulation. fusca seedlings showed altered responses to several environmental and endogenous factors. Allelism tests established that three fusca loci are represented by mutants previously described as defective in light-regulated responses. To study the molecular basis of the fusca phenotype, we cloned the FUS6 gene. FUS6 encodes a novel protein that is hydrophilic, alpha-helical, and contains potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. The FUSCA proteins appear to act in a network of signal transduction pathways critical for plant development. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenetic transformation 3aanthocyanins 3aseedling growth 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aloci 3astructural genes 3apigmentation 3acomplementary DNA 3arestriction mapping 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3atransgenic plants 3acotyledons 3aamino acid sequences 3amutants 3arecessive genes 3aultrastructure 3aexons 3aplant proteins 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnthocyaninsxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA 2aGTP-Binding Proteins 2aGenes, Plant 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins 2aLight 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxphysiology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinase Cxmetabolism 2aProteins 2aRepressor Proteins 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 2aSignal Transduction 0amolecular sequence data 0aseedling stage 0afusb gene 0agenbank/l26498 0afusb locus 0anucleotide sequences 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aMeinke, D.W.0 tPlant cell.g1994 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.25-41x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02746naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245010200156300001500258520139400273650002201667650001101689650001601700650001401716650001701730650001801747650001401765650002701779650001901806650001701825650001401842650001301856650001901869650001201888650003701900650002501937653002401962653001401986653001102000653001702011700001802028773005902046852000902105856008102114930003302195945001302228946001102241655001202252IND2061714220221119025852.0980206s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206171422DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500501072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, H.Q.10aCalcium distribution in fertilized and unfertilized ovules and embryo sacs of Nicotiana tabacum L  ap. 93-105.  aPotassium antimonate was used to localize Ca2+ in tobacco ovules from 0 to 7 d after anthesis in pollinated and emasculated flowers. Antimonate binds "loosely bound" Ca2+ into calcium antimonate; less-soluble forms are unavailable and free calcium usually escapes. Ovules are immature at anthesis. Abundant calcium precipitates in nucellar cells surrounding the micropylar canal. A difference between calcium in the two synergids emerges at 1 d, which is enhanced in pollinated flowers. The future receptive synergid accumulates more precipitates in the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell walls. After fertilization, micropyle precipitates diminish, and the ovule is unreceptive to further tube entry. In emasculated flowers 6 d after anthesis, ovular precipitates essentially disappear; however, flowers pollinated at =5 d and collected 2 d later largely restore their prior concentration of precipitates. Ovular precipitates occur initially in the nucellus, then the embryo sac, and finally the synergid and micropylar filiform apparatus. There is a possibility that calcium is released from the embryo sac, although no structural evidence of exudate formation was observed. Calcium precipitates in the ovule correlate with the ability of the ovule to be fertilized, suggesting that successful pollen tube entry and later development may require calcium of the class precipitated by antimonate. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aovules 3apollination 3aflowering 3aplant organs 3acytochemistry 3acytoplasm 3achemical precipitation 3aembryo (plant) 3apollen tubes 3apotassium 3aantimony 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3acell wall components 0acell ultrastructure 0afertility 0anuclei 0aemasculation1 aRussell, S.D.0 tPlanta.g1997, v. 202, no. 1 p.93-105x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500501073Available from publisher's Web site  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02267naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245007000183300001400253500004500267520107000312650002201382650001101404650001601415650001901431650001701450650001801467651001001485653002101495700001601516700001601532700001801548700001601566700001301582700001601595773007101611852000901682856008501691930003301776945001301809946001101822655001201833IND2230178520221119025600.0010213e200102  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND223017852DNAL7 a191848792pmid7 a10.1080/030794500200232582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández, M.10aAvian pox infection in Spanish Imperial eagles (Aquila adalberti)  ap. 91-97.  aSummaries in French, German, and Spanish  aA cutaneous lesion, previously known as "warts", affecting the featherless parts of face and legs has long been recognized in juvenile Spanish Imperial eagles (Aquila adalberti). This paper describes the presentation, microbiological, histopathological, and electron microscopic findings of lesions and diagnosis of poxvirus infection in nine juveniles. Lesions consisted of single or multiple nodules with a crust and surrounded by skin swelling. Seventy-eight percent of the swabs taken from lesions yielded bacterial growth, with Escherichia coli being the most common bacterium isolated. Histopathology revealed typical pox lesions in all cases. Histopathological changes found consisted of proliferative epithelium, with ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes and lymphocyte infiltrates extending into underlying dermis. Avianpox virus was confirmed by the presence of eosinophilic intracytoplasmatic inclusion bodies in the affected cells on light microscopy, and diagnosis confirmation was performed by electron microscopy of biopsies from all nine eagles. 3adisease diagnosis 3aAquila 3aAvipoxvirus 3ahistopathology 3askin lesions 3ayoung animals 3aSpain 0aclinical aspects1 aSanchez, C.1 aGalka, M.E.1 aDominguez, L.1 aGoyache, J.1 aOria, J.1 aPizarro, M.0 tAvian pathology.g2001 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.91-97x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794500200232583Available from publisher's Web site  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle04301naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001400159245009000173300001600263500001500279520175100294650001902045650001202064650001802076650002002094650002202114650001302136650002402149650001702173650002502190650002002215650002102235650001802256650002102274650001002295650002102305650001102326650003202337650002402369650001802393650002302411650002302434650003902457650001702496650002802513650002102541650003302562650002602595650005502621650001602676650003302692650003302725650005102758650002302809650003402832650003402866650004102900653002802941653001102969653001902980653001902999653002303018653001403041653002803055653002503083653001903108700001503127700002303142700002603165700001603191700002103207773006003228852000903288856008103297930003303378945001303411946001103424655001203435IND2061730620221119025742.0980206s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206173062DNAL7 a92657872pmid7 a10.1007/s0042500501482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoons, A.13aAn abscisic-acid- and salt-stress-responsive rice cDNA from a novel plant gene family  ap. 443-454.  a2019-12-04  aA novel cDNA clone osr40c1, encoding a abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive 40-kDa protein previously associated with salt tolerance (Moons et al. '1995' Plant Physiol 107: 177-186), was isolated from roots of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.). Exogenously applied ABA and salt shock induced a marked increase of the osr40c1 transcript level in roots of seedlings whereas constant osr40c1 mRNA levels were found in the shoot. The root-specific salinity-induced osr40c1 mRNA accumulation was rapid and gradually declined upon prolonged salt shock. Plant growth regulators, signalling the wounding and the pathogen response, did not enhance osr40c1 expression, indicating a salt- and osmotic-stress-specific response. The encoded OSR40c1 protein was found to be hydrophilic, rich in histidine residues (6%) constituting putative metal-binding domains, and to consist of a duplicated domain of 151 amino acids (75% identical), that can form amphiphilic alpha-helical structures. The gene osr40c1 belongs to a multigene family. Two osr40 genes were isolated, osr40g2 and osr40g3, tandemly arranged in an 8-kb region of the rice genome. Antisera raised against a conserved OSR40 peptide recognized different OSR40 proteins that accumulated in roots upon exposure to salt stress. The OSR40 protein family included 29-kDa proteins and two 40-kDa proteins, the latter most probably corresponding to OSR40c1 and OSR40g2 with duplicated domain structures. The osr40g3 transcript encoded a single copy of the OSR40 domain and exhibited a shoot-specific expression.

Currently, intracellular slow wave activity has not been demonstrated in the equine colon. Objectives: To characterise the in vitro myoelectrical activity of the equine pelvic flexure using intracellular recording techniques. Methods: Intestinal samples were collected immediately following euthanasia from 14 normal horses. One millimetre thick tissue sections were pinned and superfused with warmed, oxygenated Krebs solution. Intracellular recordings were made from smooth muscle cells close to the submucosal border of the circular muscle layer. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine was added to the superfusion fluid in 9 experiments while the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin was added to the superfusion fluid in 4 experiments. The data were recorded and stored using an acquisition system and a software package used to analyse the recordings. Results: In 10 of the 14 horses, electrical events consistent with slow wave patterns were recorded from individual smooth muscle cells. Surprisingly, adding nifedipine to the superfusion fluid abolished all electrical activity. In contrast, tetrodotoxin had no apparent effect on the electrical activity. Conclusions: Assuming that the electrical events were slow waves, the blockade by nifedipine suggests significant and potentially important differences in the ionic mechanisms responsible for slow waves in the different regions of the equine intestinal tract, which deserve further evaluation. 3acalcium channel blockers 3acalcium channels 3acolon 3acomputer software 3aeuthanasia 3agastrointestinal motility 3ahorses 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3asmooth muscle 3asodium channels 3atetrodotoxin1 aPearson, G.T.1 aMayhew, I.G.1 aHudson, N.P.H.0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2011 Aug., v. 43 p.145-148x0425-16447nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20110908  aNon-US 7aarticle01981naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013700129300001600266520110600282650001201388650001301400650001001413650001001423650001101433650001401444650001501458650001601473650002001489700001701509773007601526852000901602939003301611946001101644655001201655IND4461702220221119030143.0110908e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446170222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrenager, N.S.10aUltrasonographic evidence of colonic mesenteric vessels as an indicator of right dorsal displacement of the large colon in 13 horses  ap. 153-155.  aThis report describes the use of ultrasound to diagnose right dorsal displacement of the large colon (RDDLC) in 13 horses prior to surgery. Horses had ultrasonographic examinations performed of the right lateroventral aspect of the abdomen upon admission to the hospital with a 2-5 MHz broadband curvilinear sector scanning transducer after alcohol was used to wet the hair. First, the caecal vessels were identified in the right flank and followed medially and cranially. Next, each intercostal space, from caudal to cranial, was scanned from dorsal to ventral evaluating for abnormally-located mesenteric vessels associated with the large colon. Abnormally-located mesenteric vessels associated with the large colon, distinct from the caecal vessels, were identified in 13 of 23 horses with a diagnosis of RDDLC obtained at exploratory laparotomy. In horses, ultrasonographic visualisation of mesenteric vessels along the right lateral abdomen, dorsal to the costochondral junction in at least 2 intercostal spaces, distinct from the caecal vessels, is consistent with a surgical diagnosis of RDDLC. 3aabdomen 3aalcohols 3acecum 3acolon 3ahorses 3ahospitals 3alaparotomy 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography1 aDurham, M.G.0 tEquine veterinary journal.g2011 Aug., v. 43 p.153-155x0425-16447nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20110908  aNon-US 7aarticle03451naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001300150245009800163300001800261500002400279506007600303520103900379506003701418650002501455650001901480650001801499650002001517650000901537650001201546650001401558650002001572650001001592650001701602650001501619650002001634650001801654650001001672650006101682650002501743650001801768650002501786650005301811650003401864650001601898650001801914650001801932650001801950650001701968650003101985650001602016650002102032650003502053650004402088650004202132650002802174650003302202650001302235650004402248650000902292653001402301700001402315700002102329700001602350700001902366700001602385700001402401773011102415852000902526856005102535930003302586945001302619946001302632655001202645IND2332859220221207071640.0030603e200206  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233285922DNAL7 a120848232pmid7 aPMC1507762pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVert, G.10aIRT1, an Arabidopsis transporter essential for iron uptake from the soil and for plant growth  ap. 1223-1233.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlants are the principal source of iron in most diets, yet iron availability often limits plant growth. In response to iron deficiency, Arabidopsis roots induce the expression of the divalent cation transporter IRT1. Here, we present genetic evidence that IRT1 is essential for the uptake of iron from the soil. An Arabidopsis knockout mutant in IRT1 is chlorotic and has a severe growth defect in soil, leading to death. This defect is rescued by the exogenous application of iron. The mutant plants do not take up iron and fail to accumulate other divalent cations in low-iron conditions. IRT1-green fluorescent protein fusion, transiently expressed in culture cells, localized to the plasma membrane. We also show, through promoter::beta-glucuronidase analysis and in situ hybridization, that IRT1 is expressed in the external cell layers of the root, specifically in response to iron starvation. These results clearly demonstrate that IRT1 is the major transporter responsible for high-affinity metal uptake under iron deficiency.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant proteins 3aion transport 3anutrient uptake 3airon 3amutants 3achlorosis 3amineral content 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3ametal ions 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aroots 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aCation Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCations, Divalentxmetabolism 2aDNA Primers 2aFMN Reductase 2aGene Deletion 2aGenes, Lethal 2aGenes, Plant 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aHomeostasis 2aIronxmetabolism 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgenetics 2aNADH, NADPH Oxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlasmids 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSoil 0airt1 gene1 aGrotz, N.1 aDedaldechamp, F.1 aGaymard, F.1 aGuerinot, M.L.1 aBriat, J.F.1 aCurie, C.0 tplant cell.g2002 June, v. 14, no. 6 p.1223-1233dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03182naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001200150245007700162300001800239500002400257506007600281520156000357506003701917650003001954650001701984650001202001650001802013650001802031650001402049650001602063650001102079650002302090650002402113650003402137650002902171650003302200650002402233650001302257650002902270650003302299650003702332650003502369700001802404773011102422852000902533856005102542930003302593945001302626946001302639655001202652IND2332860120221207070145.0030603e200206  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233286012DNAL7 a120848272pmid7 aPMC1507802pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSai, J.10aDark-stimulated calcium ion fluxes in the chloroplast stroma and cytosol  ap. 1279-1291.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUsing transgenic Nicotiana plumbaginifolia seedlings in which the calcium reporter aequorin is targeted to the chloroplast stroma, we found that darkness stimulates a considerable flux of Ca(2+) into the stroma. This Ca(2+) flux did not occur immediately after the light-to-dark transition but began approximately 5 min after lights off and increased to a peak at approximately 20 to 30 min after the onset of darkness. Imaging of aequorin emission confirmed that the dark-stimulated luminescence emanated from chloroplast-containing tissues of the seedling. The magnitude of the Ca(2+) flux was proportional to the duration of light exposure (24 to 120 h) before lights off; the longer the duration of light exposure, the larger the dark-stimulated Ca(2+) flux. On the other hand, the magnitude of the dark-stimulated Ca(2+) flux did not appear to vary as a function of circadian time. When seedlings were maintained on a 24-h light/dark cycle, there was a stromal Ca(2+) burst after lights off every day. Moreover, the waveform of the Ca(2+) spike was different during long-day versus short-day light/dark cycles. The dark-stimulated Ca(2+) flux into the chloroplastidic stroma appeared to affect transient changes in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. DCMU, an inhibitor of photosynthetic electron transport, caused a significant increase in stromal Ca(2+) levels in the light but did not affect the magnitude of the dark-stimulated Ca(2+) flux. This robust Ca(2+) flux likely plays regulatory roles in the sensing of both light/dark transitions and photoperiod.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana plumbaginifolia 3achloroplasts 3acytosol 3aion transport 3acytochemistry 3aseedlings 3aphotoperiod 3adiuron 2aAequorinxgenetics 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium Signalingxphysiology 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aDarkness 2aLuminescent Measurements 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aJohnson, C.H.0 tplant cell.g2002 June, v. 14, no. 6 p.1279-1291dAmerican Society of Plant Physiologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/3electronic resource  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03043naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012300127300001600250500001500266520175200281650002702033650001802060650001402078650002102092650002002113650002802133650001302161650002002174650001902194650001302213650003002226650001602256650002802272650002802300653001802328653002202346653001402368653002502382700001502407700001602422773006702438852000902505930003302514945001302547946001302560655001202573IND2039867620221119025626.0940526e199402  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203986762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKindle, K.L.10aGene amplification can correct a photosynthetic growth defect caused by mRNA instability in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts  ap. 187-200.  a2019-12-05  aChlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast transformants that lack an inverted repeat normally found at the 3' end of the chloroplast atpB gene have a slow phototrophic growth phenotype due to reduced accumulation of atpB mRNA and the chloroplast ATPase beta subunit. We have recovered transformants exhibiting more robust phototrophic growth at a moderate frequency (approximately 1% relative to slow-growing transformants). Quantitative DNA blot analysis indicated that in one class of these robust photosynthetic transformants, the introduced plasmid DNA is maintained at high copy number-approximately 25 copies per chloroplast genome or 2000 copies per cell. Partial restriction digests resulted in a ladder with at least 15 visible fragments, indicating that most of the transforming DNA is organized as a long head-to-tail tandem repeat. Total atpB transcription and accumulation of atpB mRNA and the ATPase beta subunit were increased approximately fivefold relative to transformants that carry a single copy of the truncated atpB gene. The amplified DNA was stably maintained at high copy number under mixotrophic growth conditions. It was inherited uniparentally from the mt+ parent, and its synthesis was sensitive to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, an inhibitor of chloroplast DNA synthesis. Therefore, we conclude that the tandem repeat is maintained in the chloroplast. Restriction enzymes that fall to digest the transforming plasmid but have recognition sites in chloroplast DNA did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of the tandem repeat, suggesting that it is not integrated in the chloroplast genome. We conclude that the tandem repeat is probably episomal and hypothesize that its replication is independent of the chloroplast genome. 3agenetic transformation 3amessenger RNA 3aphenotype 3astructural genes 3achloroplast DNA 3atandem repeat sequences 3aplasmids 3agene expression 3aphotosynthesis 3agenomics 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3adegradation 3acytoplasmic inheritance 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 0aamplification 0adna amplification 0aatpb gene 0arepetitive sequences1 aSuzuki, H.1 aStern, D.B.0 tPlant cell.g1994 Feb., v. 6, no. 2 p.187-200x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02789naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009100171300001800262520154900280650002301829650001101852650002601863650001201889650001701901650001201918650001001930650001301940650002001953653001201973653001201985653001701997653001602014700002202030700002102052700002302073773013302096852000902229856008502238930003302323946001102356655001202367IND4395039220221119025323.0070916e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439503922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-007-0415-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Horn, Russell C. 10aDivided destinies: group choice by female savannah baboons during social group fission  ap. 1823-1837.  aGroup living provides benefits to individuals while imposing costs on them. In species that live in permanent social groups, group division provides the only opportunity for nondispersing individuals to change their group membership and improve their benefit to cost ratio. We examined group choice by 81 adult female savannah baboons (Papio cynocephalus) during four fission events. We measured how each female's group choice was affected by several factors: the presence of her maternal kin, paternal kin, age peers, and close social partners, her average kinship to groupmates, and her potential for improved dominance rank. Maternal kin, paternal kin, and close social partners influenced group choice by some females, but the relative importance of these factors varied across fissions. Age peers other than paternal kin had no effect on group choice, and average kinship to all groupmates had the same effect on group choice as did maternal kin alone. Most females were subordinate to fewer females after fissions than before, but status improvement did not drive female group choice; females often preferred to remain with social superiors who were their close maternal kin, rather than improving their own social ranks. We suggest that during permanent group fissions, female baboons prefer to remain with close maternal kin if those are abundant enough to influence their fitness; if they have too few close maternal kin then females prefer to remain with close paternal kin, and social bonds with nonkin might also become influential. 3aPapio cynocephalus 3aadults 3acost benefit analysis 3afemales 3agroup effect 3akinship 3apeers 3asavannas 3asocial cohesion 0aFission 0aFitness 0aSocial bonds 0aSocial rank1 aBuchan, Jason C. 1 aAltmann, Jeanne 1 aAlberts, Susan C. 0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2007 Oct., v. 61, no. 12 p.1823-1837dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-007-0415-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02583naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002600149245010300175300001600278500001500294520092500309650002601234650001201260650003701272650002101309650001901330650001801349650001701367650003001384650000801414650002401422650002801446650001701474650002801491650005301519650003101572650003401603650003201637650003801669650005901707650005301766653001401819653001701833653001601850653001101866700001701877773006701894852000901961930003301970945001302003946001302016655001202029IND2039742820221119025630.0940523e199308  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203974282DNAL7 a84008732pmid7 aPMC1603322pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiesman-Cookmeyer, D.10aAlanine scanning mutagenesis of a plant virus movement protein identifies three functional domains  ap. 973-982.  a2019-12-05  aAlanine scanning mutagenesis was performed on the red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) movement protein (MP), and 12 mutants were assayed in vitro for RNA binding characteristics and in vivo for their ability to potentiate RCNMV cell-to-cell movement. The mutant phenotypes that were identified in vitro and in vivo suggest both that cooperative RNA binding is not necessary for cell-to-cell movement in vivo and that only a fraction of the wild-type RNA binding may be required. The MP mutants defined at least three distinct functional regions in the MP: an RNA binding domain, a cooperative RNA binding domain, and a third domain that is necessary for cell-to-cell movement in vivo. This third domain may be required for targeting the MP to cell walls and plasmodesmata, interacting with host proteins, folding, or possibly binding RNA into a functional ribonucleoprotein complex capable of cell-to-cell movement. 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aalanine 3aRed clover necrotic mosaic virus 3abinding proteins 3aviral proteins 3abinding sites 3apathogenesis 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aRNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Movementxgenetics 2aGenes, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMosaic Virusesxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPlant Viral Movement Proteins 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRNA, Viralxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aViral Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aNicotiana 0ainteractions 0amutagenesis 0aspread1 aLommel, S.A.0 tPlant cell.g1993 Aug., v. 5, no. 8 p.973-982x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03358naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002100149245014400170300001600314500001500330520120700345650001601552650002701568650002001595650002101615650002201636650002201658650002201680650001501702650002001717650001101737650001901748650002201767650001901789650001301808650003401821650002101855650002301876650001801899650004401917650002001961650001701981650004401998650004302042650002802085650005302113650003302166650003102199650003902230650002402269650004502293650001302338653001902351653001202370653001002382653002802392653002502420700001902445700001802464700002002482773006602502852000902568930003302577945001302610946001302623655001202636IND2041679620221119025512.0940829e199405  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204167962DNAL7 a80386012pmid7 aPMC1604622pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuller-Rober, B.12aA truncated version of an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase promoter from potato specifies guard cell-selective expression in transgenic plants  ap. 601-612.  a2019-12-05  aADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) is a key regulatory enzyme in starch biosynthesis in higher plants. A 3.2-kb promoter of the large subunit gene of the AGPase from potato has been isolated and its activity analyzed in transgenic potato and tobacco plants using a promoter-beta-glucuronidase fusion system. The promoter was active in various starch-containing cells, including guard cells, tuber parenchyma cells, and the starch sheath layer of stems and petioles. No expression was observed in mesophyll cells. Analysis of various promoter derivatives showed that with respect to expression in petioles and stems, essential elements must be located in the 5' distal region of the promoter, whereas elements important for expression in tuber parenchyma cells are located in an internal fragment comprising nucleotides from positions -500 to -1200. Finally, a 0.3-kb 5' proximal promoter fragment was identified that was sufficient to obtain exclusive expression in guard cells of transgenic potato and tobacco plants. The implications of our observations are discussed with respect to starch synthesis in various tissues and the use of the newly identified promoter as a tool for stomatal biology. 3aguard cells 3agenetic transformation 3arecombinant DNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3atransgenic plants 3aSolanum tuberosum 3ainternodes 3agene expression 3atubers 3ahistochemistry 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3apetioles 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3apromoter regions 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aBase Sequence 2aEscherichia colixenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aGlucose-1-Phosphate Adenylyltransferase 2aGlucuronidasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleotidyltransferasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSolanum tuberosumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTATA Box 0agenbank/x75017 0akinases 0astems 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aLa Cognata, U.1 aSonnewald, U.1 aWillimitzer, L.0 tPlant cell.g1994 May, v. 6, no. 5 p.601-612x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02748naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001500159245009100174300001400265500001500279520126300294650001201557650001601569650001901585650001301604650001701617650001001634650001701644650003501661650003101696650004301727650003301770650001701803650002901820653001801849653001901867653001501886653001101901653001701912653002401929653001401953653002001967653002101987773006302008852000902071856008102080930003302161945001302194946001102207655001202218IND2061957820221119025550.0980220e199801  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206195782DNAL7 a94433842pmid7 a10.1007/s0042500502292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrolig, F.10aNuclear centering in Spirogyra: force integration by microfilaments along microtubules  ap. 54-63.  a2019-12-04  aThe contribution of microtubules and micro-filaments to the cytomechanics of transverse nuclear centering were investigated in the charophycean green alga Spirogyra crassa (Zygnematales). Cytoplasmic strands of enhanced rigidity and fasciate appearance radiate from the rim of the lenticular nucleus through the vacuole, frequently split once or twice and are attached to the helical chloroplast bands in the peripheral cytoplasm. The nucleus is encased in tubulin and a web of F-actin. Bundles of microtubules, emerging from the nuclear rim, are organized into dividing fascicles within the strands and reach to the inner surface of the chloroplast envelope. Organelles are translocated in both directions along similarly arranged fascicles of microfilament bundles which extend from the nucleus to the peripheral actin cytoskeleton. Application of microtubule- and/or microfilamen-depolymerizing drugs affected the position of the nucleus only slowly, but in distinct ways. The differential effects suggest that nuclear centering depends on the tensional integrity of the perinuclear scaffold, with microfilaments conveying tension along stabilized microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton integrating the translocation forces generated within the scaffold. 3atubulin 3aChlorophyta 3amicrofilaments 3avacuoles 3amicrotubules 3aactin 3achloroplasts 2aActin Cytoskeletonxphysiology 2aCell Nucleusxdrug effects 2aChlorophytaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCytochalasin Dxpharmacology 2aCytoskeleton 2aMicrotubulesxphysiology 0aChlorophycota 0atensile stress 0aorganelles 0anuclei 0acytoskeleton 0acell ultrastructure 0acytoplasm 0acell structures 0aspirogyra crassa0 tPlanta.g1998 Jan., v. 204, no. 1 p.54-63x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500502293Available from publisher's Web site  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03250naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245007900157300001600236500001500252520157900267650001301846650001801859650001401877650001401891650002401905650002301929650002401952650001001976650001101986650001101997650001302008650001402021650001702035650002002052650001302072650001602085650004202101650001702143650000902160650001002169650001402179650002002193653001102213653001002224653001202234653002002246653001602266653001502282653002102297700002202318700001902340700002002359700001402379773006002393852000902453856008102462930003302543945001302576946001102589655001202600IND2062114720221119025406.0980226s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206211472DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500501392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTadeo, F.R.10aGibberellin-ethylene interaction controls radial expansion in citrus roots  ap. 370-378.  a2019-12-04  aThe involvement of gibberellins (GAs) and ethylene in the process of root radial expansion was studied in young seedlings of Carrizo citrange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.]. The GA inhibitors cycocel, paclobutrazol, and tetcyclacis enhanced radial expansion of the root tip (up to 2.3-fold) as a result of increases in stele diameter and inner cortex width. The GA deficiency increased cell number and width, and changed the polarity of growth, generating wider and shorter cortical cells in the elongation zone. In the presence or absence of GA inhibitors, GA3 decreased root tip width and reduced all parameters related to radial expansion. The ethylene inhibitors (aminooxyacetic acid; cobalt ions, CoCl2; silver thiosulfate) suppressed swelling induced by GA deficiency, generating thinner cells just as GA3 did. In contrast to GA3, ethylene inhibitors produced longer cells strongly resembling those of the untreated seedlings. Ethylene released by ethephon did not modify root tip width in control plants, while root diameter behind the root tip was increased. In the presence of low and ineffective concentrations of cycocel, the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid increased radial expansion of root tips (1.3-fold) and changed the polarity of growth, producing wider and shorter inner cortical cells as GA inhibitors did. These observations imply, first, that ethylene is the hormonal effector of the process of root radial expansion and, second, that the endogenous GAs modulate the promotive response of ethylene. 3aethylene 3apaclobutrazol 3aroot tips 3aseedlings 3aCitroncirus webberi 3asilver thiosulfate 3aaminooxyacetic acid 3awidth 3acortex 3acobalt 3adiameter 3ahistology 3agibberellins 3acell structures 3aethephon 3aacetic acid 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aroot systems 3aions 3astele 3achlorides 3aCitrus sinensis 0agrowth 0aroots 0acycocel 0acobalt chloride 0atetcyclacis 0ainhibitors 0aplant morphology1 aGomez-Cadenas, A.1 aBen-Cheikh, W.1 aPrimo-Millo, E.1 aTalon, M.0 tPlanta.g1997, v. 202, no. 3 p.370-378x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500501393Available from publisher's Web site  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02321naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001100141245011600152300001600268500001500284520113200299650003701431650001601468650001201484650001701496650001201513650001401525650001601539650001501555650001901570653001501589653001501604653002301619653001501642653001101657700001201668773006001680852000901740856008101749930003301830945001301863946001101876655001201887IND2062113020221119025459.0980226s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206211302DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500501352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, L.14aThe effects of extracellular calmodulin on initiation of Hippeastrum rutilum pollen germination and tube growth  ap. 336-340.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of anti-calmodulin (CaM) serum, the CaM antagonist W7-agarose, the Ca2+ chelator ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl)-N,N,N',N'- tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and exogenous pure CaM on pollen germination and tube growth of Hippeastrum rutilum Herb were studied.

Recent studies have reported sex-specific effects of hormones on offspring viability. Specifically, we previously found that elevating the plasma androgen level in mothers results in a male-biased offspring primary sex ratio, but it affects the viability of sons negatively and daughters positively in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata; Rutkowska and Cichoń, Anim Behav, 71:1283-1288, 2006). In this study, we studied further fitness consequences of exposure to elevated yolk androgen levels in zebra finches. We measured growth rate and cellular immune response of nestlings that hatched from eggs laid by females injected with testosterone during egg laying and nestlings of unaffected control females. We found that sons of testosterone-treated females grew slower in comparison to sons of control females. The significant interaction between experimental group and offspring sex indicates that sons of testosterone-treated mothers suffered impaired immune responsiveness while daughters seemed to benefit from elevated androgen level in terms of enhanced immune responsiveness. We found no effects of androgens on offspring performance at adulthood--neither fecundity of females nor attractiveness of males was affected. We conclude that the benefits of biasing sex ratio towards males by increasing androgen level in the yolk may be limited due to negative effects on male offspring performance early in life. 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3aadulthood 3aadverse effects 3acell-mediated immunity 3adaughters 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3amales 3amaternal effect 3amothers 3anestlings 3aoviposition 3asex ratio 3asons 3atestosterone 3aviability 0aGrowth rate 0aAttractiveness 0aSex-specific effects 0aTaeniopygia guttata1 aWilk, Tomasz 1 aCichoń, Mariusz 0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2007 June, v. 61, no. 8 p.1211-1217dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-007-0351-03Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070529b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04423naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245021500156300001600371500001500387520302500402650002003427650002003447650001503467650003703482650002003519650002203539650001203561650001203573650001603585650001603601650001203617650002703629650001703656653001903673653001003692653001303702653001503715700001603730773006003746852000903806856008103815930003303896945001303929946001103942655001203953IND2062112920221119025439.0980226s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206211292DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500501342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHertel, A.14aThe function of water channels of Chara: the temperature dependence of water and solute flows provides evidence for composite membrane transport and for a slippage of small organic solutes across water channels  ap. 324-335.  a2019-12-04  aUsing the cell pressure probe, the effects of temperature on hydraulic conductivity (Lp; osmotic water permeability), solute permeability (permeability coefficient, Ps), and reflection coefficients (sigma s) were measured on internodes of Chara corallina, Klein ex Willd., em R.D.W.. For the first time, complete sets of transport coefficients were obtained in the range between 10 and 35 degrees C which provided evidence about pathways of water and solutes as they move across the plasma membrane (water channel and bilayer arrays). Test solutes used to check for the selectivity of water channels were monohydric alcohols of different molecular size and shape (ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, and tert-butanol) and heavy water (HDO). Within the limits of accuracy, Q10 values for Lp and for the diffusive water permeability (Pd) were identical (Q10 for Lp = 1.29 +/- 0.17 (+/-SD; n = 15 cells) and Q10 for Pd = 1.25 +/- 0.16 (n = 5 cells)). The Q10 values were equivalent to activation energies of Ea = 16.8 +/- 6.4 and 16.6 +/- 10.0 kJ.mol-1, respectively, which is similar to that of self-diffusion or of viscous flow of water. The Q10 values and activation energies for Ps of the alcohols were significantly larger (ethanol: Q10 = 1.68 +/- 0.16, Ea = 37.1 +/- 5.9 kJ.mol-1; n-propanol: Q10 = 1.75 +/- 0.40, Ea = 43.1 +/- 15.3 kJ.mol-1; iso-propanol: Q10 = 2.12 +/- 0.42, Ea = 52.2 +/- 4.6 kJ. mol-1; tert-butanol: Q10 = 2.13 +/- 0.56, Ea = 51.6 +/- 17.1 kJ. mol-1; +/-SD; n = 5 to 6 cells). Effects of temperature on reflection coefficients were most pronounced. With increasing temperature, sigma s values of the alcohols decreased and those of HDO increased. The data indicate that water and solutes use different pathways when crossing the membrane. Ordinary and isotopic water use water channels and the other test solutes use the bilayer array (composite transport model of membrane). Changes in sigma s values with temperature were found to be a sensitive measure for the open/closed state of water channels. The decrease of sigma s with temperature was theoretically predicted from the temperature dependence of Ps and Lp. Differences between predicted and measured values of sigma s, allowed estimation of the bypass flow (slippage) of solutes through water channels which did not completely exclude test solutes. The permeability of channels depended on the structure and size of test solutes. It is concluded that water channels are much less selective than is usually thought. Since water channels represent single-file or no-pass pores, solutes drag along considerable amounts of water as they diffuse across channels. This results in low overall values of sigma s. The sigma s of HDO was extremely low. Its response to temperature was opposite to that for the sigma s of the alcohols. This suggested a stronger effect of temperature on the hydraulic (osmotic) than on the diffusive water flow across individual water channels, i.e. a differential sensitivity of different mechanisms to temperature. 3aplasma membrane 3aChara corallina 3ainternodes 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3adeuterium oxide 3aisopropyl alcohol 3asolutes 3abutanol 3atemperature 3areflectance 3aethanol 3ahydraulic conductivity 3apermeability 0awater transfer 0aChara 0aalcohols 0an-propanol1 aSteudle, E.0 tPlanta.g1997, v. 202, no. 3 p.324-335x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500501343Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02934naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001700160245011600177300001600293520136300309650002601672650000901698650001301707650002101720650002201741650001101763650001201774650001401786650000901800650003401809650002801843650002401871650003001895650003501925650002001960650002401980653001302004653001702017653001502034653002702049653001702076653002702093700001802120700001502138773009202153852000902245856008102254930003302335945001302368946001102381655001202392IND2326184120221119025447.0020325e200106  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232618412DNAL7 a115294842pmid7 a10.1007/s0035901002132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidgel, A.L.10aDynamic responses of tibial campaniform sensilla studied by substrate displacement in freely moving cockroaches  ap. 405-420.  aResponses of the tibial campaniform sensilla, receptors that encode strains in the exoskeleton, were characterized by recording sensory activities during perturbations in freely standing cockroaches. The substrate upon which the animal stood was displaced horizontally using ramp and hold stimuli at varied rates. The sensilla showed short latency responses that were initiated in the first 30 ms of platform movement. Responses of individual receptors depended upon the direction of displacement and the orientation of their cuticular cap. Proximal receptors, whose caps are perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia, responded to displacements directed from the contralateral side of the body and from the head toward the abdomen. The distal sensilla, oriented parallel to the tibia, discharged at longer latency to displacements in opposite directions. Plots of receptor activity versus displacement direction showed that proximal and distal sensilla are activated in non-overlapping ranges of movement direction. Afferent responses also increased as the platform was displaced more rapidly. These results are consistent with a model in which displacements produce forces that result in bending of the tibia. This information could be utilized to detect the direction and rate of forces that occur during leg slipping or in walking on unstable terrains. 3aPeriplaneta americana 3alegs 3asensilla 3amechanoreceptors 3aelectrophysiology 3aforces 2aAnimals 2aMagnetics 2aMale 2aNeurons, Afferentxphysiology 2aPeriplanetaxphysiology 2aPosturexphysiology 2aReaction Timexphysiology 2aSensory Thresholdsxphysiology 2aVideo Recording 2aWalkingxphysiology 0amovement 0adisplacement 0asubstrates 0amechanical stimulation 0ainsect tibia 0asubstrate perturbation1 aFrazier, S.F.1 aZill, S.N.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2001 June, v. 187, no. 5 p.405-420x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035901002133Available from publisher's Web site  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle04031naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100002300159245014600182300001600328500001500344520163400359650001301993650001002006650002202016650002602038650002202064650002002086650002302106650002202129650002002151650002502171650000702196650002202203650001002225650001802235650002002253650001802273650001902291650002402310650001202334650002802346650003302374650004002407650002802447650002502475650005902500650003302559650002202592650001802614650007202632650001002704650002302714650003402737650002402771650001002795650001202805650002302817650004502840653002802885653002302913700001702936700001702953700001602970700001802986700002103004773006503025852000903090856008103099930003303180945001303213946001103226655001203237IND2061879620221119025431.0980217e199711  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206187962DNAL7 a94316782pmid7 a10.1007/s0042500501952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossi de Sa, M.F.10aMolecular characterization of a bean alpha-amylase inhibitor that inhibits the alpha-amylase of the Mexican bean weevil Zabrotes subfasciatus  ap. 295-303.  a2019-12-04  aCultivated varieties of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) contain an alpha-amylase inhibitor (alpha AI-1) that inhibits porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA; EC 3.2.1.1) and the amylases of certain seed weevils, but not that of the Mexican bean weevil Zabrotes subfasciatus. A variant of alpha AI-1, called alpha AI-2, is found in certain arcelin-containing wild accessions of the common bean. The variant alpha AI-2 inhibits Z. subfasciatus alpha-amylase (ZSA), but not PPA. We purified alpha AI-2 and studied its interaction with ZSA. The formation of the alpha AI-2-ZSA complex is time-dependent and occurs maximally at pH 5.0 or below. When a previously isolated cDNA assumed to encode alpha AI-2 was expressed in transgenic tobacco seeds, the seeds contained inhibitory activity toward ZSA but not toward PPA, confirming that the cDNA encodes alpha AI-2. The inhibitors alpha AI-1 and alpha AI-2 share 78% sequence identity at the amino acid level and they differ in an important region that is part of the site where the enzyme binds the inhibitor. The swap of a tripeptide in this region was not sufficient to change the specificity of the two inhibitors towards their respective enzymes. The three-dimensional structure of the alpha AI-1/PPA complex has just been solved and we recently obtained the derived amino acid sequence of ZSA. This additional information allows us to discuss the results described here in the framework of the amino acid residues of both proteins involved in the formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex and to pinpoint the amino acids responsible for the specificity of the interaction. 3apancreas 3aseeds 3acomplementary DNA 3aZabrotes subfasciatus 3atransgenic plants 3aanimal proteins 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agene expression 3aamino acid sequences 3apH 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aswine 3abinding sites 3aenzyme activity 3aalpha-amylase 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxenzymology. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemistry 2aFabaceaexparasitologyxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPancreasxenzymology 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSeeds 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwine 2aTobacco 2aTrypsin Inhibitors 2aalpha-Amylasesxantagonists & inhibitors 0amolecular sequence data 0achemical structure1 aMirkov, T.E.1 aIshimoto, M.1 aColucci, G.1 aBateman, K.S.1 aChrispeels, M.J.0 tPlanta.g1997 Nov., v. 203, no. 3 p.295-303x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500501953Available from publisher's Web site  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01960naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245006100179300001600240500001500256520092500271650002301196650001001219650001701229650001601246650001101262650001901273650001501292650003001307653002501337773007301362852000901435856008501444930003301529945001301562946001101575655001201586IND2268038920221119025517.0010330e200012  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226803892DNAL7 a191848582pmid7 a10.1080/030794500200168692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShawky, S.10aTarget cells for duck enteritis virus in lymphoid organs  ap. 609-616.  a2019-12-04  aDuck enteritis virus (DEV), a herpesvirus, has been shown to cause lymphoid organ atrophy and immunosuppression in white Pekin ducklings.

Here, we demonstrated that recombinant GF14 omega is expressed in Escherichia coli as a dimer. Blot binding and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses indicated that GF14 omega binds calcium. Equilibrium dialysis further demonstrated that GF14 omega binds an equimolar amount of calcium with an apparent binding constant of 5.5 X 10(4) M-1 under physiological conditions. The C-terminal domain, which contains a potential EF hand motif, is responsible for the calcium binding. The C-terminal domain also cross-reacted with the anti-GF14 omega monoclonal antibody. In addition, GF14 omega is phosphorylated by Arabidopsis protein kinase activity at a serine residue(s) in vitro. Therefore, GF14 omega protein has biochemical properties consistent with potential signaling roles in plants. The presence of a potential EF hand-like motif in the highly conserved C terminus of 14-3-3 proteins together with the calcium-dependent multiple functions attributed to the 14-3-3 proteins indicate that the C terminus EF hand is a common functional element of this family of proteins. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acalcium-binding proteins 3aplant proteins 3aphosphorylation 3amolecular conformation 3abinding sites1 aSehnke, P.C.1 aFerl, R.J.0 tPlant cell.g1994 Apr., v. 6, no. 4 p.501-510x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03625naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245008000156300001600236520244800252650002002700650001302720650002602733650002602759650001102785650001602796650001102812650001502823650002102838650002202859650001102881650002002892653001402912653001602926700002102942700002102963773006002984852000903044856008103053930003303134945001303167946001103180655001203191IND2061738520221119025435.0980206s1997    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206173852DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500501572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFricke, W.10aWhy do leaves and leaf cells of N-limited barley elongate at reduced rates?  ap. 522-530.  aThe objective of the present study was to assess whether, in barley, nitrogen supply limits the rate of leaf elongation through a reduction in (relative) cell elongation rate and whether this is attributable to a reduced turgor, a reduced availability of osmolytes or, by implication, changed wall properties.

Third leaves were analysed for leaf elongation rate and final epidermal cell length, and, within the basal growing region, for the spatial distribution of relative segmental elongation rates (RSER, pin-pricking method), epidermal cell turgor (cell-pressure probe), osmotic pressure (OP, picolitre osmometry) and water potential (psi). During the development of the third leaf, plants grew at relative growth rates (relative increase in fresh weight) of 18.2, 15.6 and 8.1%.d-1 (Hoagland-, 16%- and 8%-plants, respectively). Final leaf length and leaf elongation rate were highest in Hoagland plants (ca. 34.1 cm and 2.33-2.60 mm.h-1, respectively). intermediate in 16%-plants (31.0 cm and 1.89-1.96 mm.h-1) and lowest in 8%-plants (29.4 cm and 1.41-1.58 mm .h-1). These differences were accompanied by only small differences in final cell length, but large differences in cell-flux rates (146, 187 and 201 cells.cell-file-1.d-1 in 8%-, 16%-and Hoagland-plants, respectively). The length of the growth zone (32-38 mm) was not much affected by N-levels (and nutrient technique). A decrease in RSER in the growth zone distal to 10 mm produced the significant effect of N-levels on leaf elongation rate. In all treatments, cell turgor was almost constant throughout the growing region, as were cell OP and psi in 16%- and 8%-plants. In Hoagland-plants, however, cell OP increased by ca. 0.1 MPa within the zone of highest elongation rates and, as a consequence, cell psi decreased simultaneously by 0.1 MPa. Cell psi increased considerably where elongation ceased. Within the zone where differences in RSERs were highest between treatments (10-34 mm from base) average turgor was lowest, OP highest and psi most negative in Hoagland- compared to 8%- and 16%-plants (P < 0.001), but not significantly different between 8%- and 16%-plants. 3aHordeum vulgare 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3aleaves 3acell growth 3aturgor 3acell walls 3aosmotic pressure 3aplant development 3alength 3awater potential 0aepidermis 0agrowth rate1 aMcDonald, A.J.S.1 aMattson-Djos, L.0 tPlanta.g1997, v. 202, no. 4 p.522-530x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500501573Available from publisher's Web site  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02912naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001700160245007700177300001600254500001500270520130900285650001201594650002101606650002601627650001301653650001501666650000901681650002201690650002201712650001201734650002101746650002801767650002201795650001101817650000901828650002401837650002201861653002701883653001001910653001701920653002101937653002701958653001801985653001802003653000902021700002002030700001802050700001602068773009102084852000902175856008102184930003302265945001302298946001102311655001202322IND2323341420221119025548.0011004e200105  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232334142DNAL7 a114675032pmid7 a10.1007/s0035901002022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbert, J.T.10aArthropod touch reception: spider hair sensilla as rapid touch detectors  ap. 303-312.  a2019-12-04  aWandering spiders like Cupiennius salei are densely covered by tactile hairs. In darkness Cupiennius uses its front legs as tactile feelers. We selected easily identifiable hairs on the tarsus and metatarsus which are stimulated during this behavior to study tactile hair properties. Both the mechanical and electrophysiological hair properties are largely independent of the direction of hair displacement. Restoring torques measure 10(-9) to 10(-8) Nm. The torsional restoring constant S changes non-linearly with deflection angle. It is of the order of 10(-8) Nm/rad, which is about 10,000 times larger than for trichobothria. Angular thresholds for the generation of action potentials are ca. 1 degree. Electrophysiology reveals a slow and a fast sensory cell, differing in adaptation time. Both cells are movement detectors mainly responding to the dynamic phase (velocity) of a stimulus. When applying behaviorally relevant stimulus velocities (up to 11 cm s-1) threshold deflection for the elicitation of action potentials and maximum response frequency are reached as early as 1.2 ms after stimulus onset and followed by a rapid decline of impulse frequency. Obviously these hairs inform the spider on the mere presence of a stimulus but not on details of its time-course and spatial orientation. 3aneurons 3amechanoreceptors 3amechanical properties 3asensilla 3aCupiennius 3alegs 3aelectrophysiology 2aAction Potentials 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aElectrophysiology 2aFemale 2aHair 2aSpidersxphysiology 2aTouchxphysiology 0amechanical stimulation 0atouch 0abiomechanics 0acupiennius salei 0aanatomy and morphology 0atactile hairs 0asensory cells 0ahair1 aFriedrich, O.C.1 aDechant, H.E.1 aBarth, F.G.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2001 May, v. 187, no. 4 p.303-312x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035901002023Available from publisher's Web site  a20020106b20020114c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03105naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245013700175300001600312520132300328650001401651650001901665650002201684650001301706650002201719650001201741650001401753650002301767650001301790650001101803650001101814650001001825650002301835650001301858650003001871650001201901650003201913650002501945650002101970650001901991650001302010650002302023650002602046653001102072653000902083653001502092653001402107653001802121653003302139653001702172700002102189700001902210773009102229852000902320856008102329930003302410945001302443946001102456655001202467IND2323341020221119025552.0011004e200105  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232334102DNAL7 a114675022pmid7 a10.1007/s0035901002012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPankiw, T.10aModulation of sucrose response thresholds in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.): influence of genotype, feeding, and foraging experience  ap. 293-301.  aThe perception of sugar is important to honey bees for making foraging decisions. We measured bees' perception by determining what concentration of sucrose touched to the antennae elicited the proboscis extension response (response threshold). A low response threshold (extension at low concentration) suggests a high perceptual value of sucrose, and vice versa. Perception of sucrose solutions differed between two artificially selected genotypic strains and was modulated by the bees' recent feeding experiences. Bees offered 10%, 30%, or 50% sucrose solutions in small cages overnight, and in large flight-cages or free-flying in the field for several days, had subsequent response thresholds positively correlated to the concentration offered. Empty bees, whether they were nectar, water or pollen foragers, dancers or non-dancers, had a significantly lower threshold than loaded bees. Crop volume affected response thresholds directly and independently of sucrose concentration. We interpret these findings as multiple mechanisms that operate in different time scales, modulating perception of sucrose. Changes occurred in the time scale of evolutionary processes as demonstrated by genotypic differences. Changes with foraging experience occur in hours or minutes while effects of crop filling are instantaneous. 3anutrition 3aApis mellifera 3aworker honey bees 3aantennae 3ataste sensitivity 3asucrose 3aproboscis 3astrain differences 3aforaging 3apollen 3anectar 3awater 3atemporal variation 3agenotype 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBeesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBiological Evolution 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFlight, Animal 2aGenotype 2aSensory Thresholds 2aSucrosexpharmacology 0adances 0acrop 0amodulation 0aresponses 0aconcentration 0aproboscis extension response 0acrop filling1 aWaddington, K.D.1 aPage, R.E.

There are a variety of other factors that can trigger the ascites syndrome. These factors may cause increased blood flow because of a higher metabolic rate (cold, heat, certain nutrients, chemicals, etc.) or they may cause pulmonary hypertension-induced ascites in rapidly growing chickens because of greater resistance to blood flow in the lung by: (i) increased blood viscosity or red blood cell rigidity; or (ii) reduced vascular capacity in the lung. Some secondary factors, such as high sodium from salt in feed or water, may cause both increased flow and increased resistance to flow. Measures to reduce the ascites syndrome must address the primary genetic cause of insufficient vascular flow capacity in the lung and oxygen delivery to tissues, and the secondary factors that increase oxygen requirement, blood flow and the resistance to blood flow in the lung. 3achickens 3aascites 3aetiology 3ablood flow 3aoxygen requirement 3apathogenesis 0aliterature reviews 0agrowth rate0 tAvian pathology.g2000 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.519-527x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794500200167513Available from publisher's Web site  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03522naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001800159245013100177300001600308500001500324520164700339650002501986650001202011650002002023650001402043650001702057650002202074650001202096650001302108650002002121650002002141650001402161650001102175650002002186650001102206650002102217650002302238650003302261650004402294650002802338650003902366650001302405650003302418650003902451650003702490650002702527650002202554653003702576653001202613700001502625700001602640700001602656773006502672852000902737856008102746930003302827945001302860946001102873655001202884IND2061882420221119025541.0980217e199711  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206188242DNAL7 a94316832pmid7 a10.1007/s0042500502022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArisi, A.C.M.10aModification of thiol contents in poplars (Populus tremula X P. alba) overexpressing enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis  ap. 362-372.  a2019-12-04  aThe hybrid poplar (Populus tremula X P. alba) was transformed to express the Escherichia coli gene for 7-glutamylcysteine synthetase (EC 6.3.2.2: gamma-ECS) in the cytosol. Four transformed lines of poplar were obtained. These were phenotypically indistinguishable from untransformed poplars. Three lines, ggs28 (Noctor et al. 1996. Plant Physiol 112: 1071-1078), ggs11 and ggs5 possessed high levels of bacterial gene transcripts. Line ggs17 had lower transcript levels. Antisera were prepared against bacterial gamma-ECS and bacterial glutathione synthetase (EC 6.3.2.3: GS). Using the antiserum prepared against the purified His-tagged E. coli gamma-ECS, lines ggs28, ggs11 and ggs5 were shown to possess abundant quantities of the bacterial protein, whereas ggs17 contained lower amounts. The antiserum prepared against the purified His-tagged E. coli GS was also effective in screening poplars transformed with the E. coli gene coding for this enzyme. Immunoblots of leaf extracts from poplars overexpressing GS using this antibody revealed two bands. The extractable foliar gamma-ECS activities of the gamma-ECS transformants were in quantitative agreement with the protein levels. Lines ggs28, ggs11 and ggs5 had approximately 30-fold higher gamma-ECS activity than untransformed poplars, whereas in ggs17 this activity was only augmented about 3-fold. The lines strongly overexpressing gamma-ECS, ggs28, ggs11 and ggs5, contained enhanced foliar levels of cysteine (up to 2-fold), gamma-glutamylcysteine (5- to 20-fold) and glutathione (2- to 4-fold).

Labeling of the 75-kD protein occurred only when low levels of ATP were present, whereas labeling of the 86-kD protein occurred in the absence of exogenous ATR Although both labeled proteins were identified as proteins of the outer envelope membrane, the labeled form of the 75-kD protein could only be detected in fractions containing mixed envelope membranes. Based on these observations, we propose that prSSU first binds in an ATP-independent fashion to the 86-kD protein. The energy-requiring step is association with the 75-kD protein and assembly of a translocation contact site between the inner and outer membrane of the chloroplastic envelops. 3aPisum sativum 3achloroplasts 3acell membranes 3abinding proteins 3aplant proteins 3azymogens 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aprotein transport 3achemical reactions 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aBiological Transport 2aCells, Cultured 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aCross-Linking Reagentsxpharmacology 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aFabaceae 2aIntracellular Membranesxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Precursorsxmetabolism 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aThermolysinxmetabolism 0ainteractions 0achloroplast membranes1 aKeegstra, K.0 tPlant cell.g1994 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.93-105x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02825naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245006900181300001600250520158200266650000901848650001601857650002301873650001301896650001701909650002301926650001601949650001801965653001301983653002001996653002702016700001602043700001502059700001602074700001702090700001802107700001802125773007302143852000902216856008502225930003302310945001302343946001102356655001202367IND2268038120221119025530.0010330e200012  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226803812DNAL7 a191848502pmid7 a10.1080/030794500200167882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, J.K.A.10aAvian pneumovirus infection of laying hens: experimental studies  ap. 545-556.  aAdministration of a virulent strain of avian pneumovirus (APV) to specific pathogen free laying hens by the oculonasal route failed to induce a drop in egg production or any adverse effects on eggshell quality. However, intravenous (i.v.) inoculation of the same strain caused a substantial drop in egg production and a high incidence of soft and thin-shelled eggs. Some respiratory signs were also observed and the hens appeared sick, with diarrhoea being observed in approximately one-half of the hens between 4 and 11 days post-inoculation (p.i.). APV antigen was detected in the oviduct epithelium up to 9 days p.i. This challenge model was then used to investigate the efficacy of live attenuated turkey rhinotracheitis (TRT) vaccine administered alone at 1 day old, or an inactivated TRT vaccine (at 16 weeks), or a combined programme using both vaccines, in protecting against this challenge. Neither the live nor the inactivated vaccine alone protected against clinical signs (respiratory infection or diarrhoea). However, the inactivated, but not the live, vaccine did protect against the effect of the i.v. challenge on laying performance. In contrast, the combined vaccination programme protected completely against both clinical signs and poor egg-laying performance. This protection lasted until at least 60 weeks of age. On the basis of the results with this experimental model, it is concluded that the use of live priming followed by administration of inactivated TRT vaccine is necessary to provide complete protection of laying chickens against APV challenge. 3ahens 3aPneumovirus 3alaying performance 3aoviducts 3apathogenesis 3adisease prevention 3avaccination 3alive vaccines 0aefficacy 0arhinotracheitis 0aexperimental infection1 aChesher, J.1 aOrthel, F.1 aWoods, M.A.1 aOrbell, S.J.1 aBaxendale, W.1 aHuggins, M.B.0 tAvian pathology.g2000 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.545-556x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794500200167883Available from publisher's Web site  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03226naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007900126300001600205500002400221520210500245650002502350650001002375650001902385650001402404650001102418650001302429650001402442650001602456651001202472651001202484651001602496651001002512700001602522700001602538773012602554852000902680856007002689930003302759945001302792946001102805655001202816IND2333035920221119025615.0030612e20030317ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233303592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaoud, I.P.10aSuitability studies of inland well waters for Litopenaeus vannamei culture  ap. 373-383.  aIncludes references  aThe inland farming of penaeid shrimp in low-salinity waters is now de facto in many regions of the world, yet there is little information pertaining to the suitability of waters with various ionic compositions for shrimp culture. In the present study, short-term (48 h) survival of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei postlarvae (PL), and long-term (4 weeks) growth and survival of juvenile L. vannamei in various inland saline ground waters were evaluated. A correlation between survival and growth of PLs and the ionic composition of the waters was performed. Short-term bioassays were conducted on 10-, 15- and 20-day-old postlarvae using waters from various wells. Salinity was decreased at a rate of 4 ppt h(-1) using fresh water from 24 ppt until a salinity of 2 ppt above the target salinity was reached. Water in the containers was then slowly exchanged with water from inland saline wells. Survival of the PLs was evaluated 48 h after the start of acclimation. In the second study, four replicates of 15 juveniles were placed in 144-l square tanks containing various saline well waters from west Alabama. Growth and survival were evaluated after 4 weeks. The ionic makeup of the various inland well waters from Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas was analyzed to characterize each source. Survival of PL10 shrimp in some of the waters was similar to survival in the low-salinity reconstituted seawater control and was significantly different from the control in other waters. Survival of PL15 was greater than survival of PL10 but similar to PL20. Some waters were unsuitable for shrimp culture at all PL stages tested. Survival and growth of the juveniles paralleled results of the short-term bioassays. Shrimp survived and grew well in waters in which more than 90% of the postlarvae acclimated and survived in. Juvenile survival and growth were intermediate and low in waters in which PL acclimation was intermediate and low, respectively. Survival appears to be positively correlated with ions such as K, Mg and SO4 and negatively correlated with a high concentration of iron. 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3awells 3ashrimp culture 3amortality 3alarvae 3asalinity 3abioassays 3aacclimation 3aAlabama 3aFlorida 3aMississippi 3aTexas1 aDavis, D.A.1 aRouse, D.B.0 tAquaculture.g2003 Mar. 17, , no. 1/4 p.373-383dElsevier Pub.

Diets contained 0, 130, 260 and 390 g kg(-1) of oven-dried CoP. In aquaria, fish receiving increasing dietary CoP levels (from 0 to 390 g kg(-1)) showed a progressive reduction in final body weight, growth rate and protein efficiency ratio (PER) (P < 0.05). Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly higher at 390 g kg(-1) dietary CoP. Dietary CoP reduced digestibility of dietary dry matter and carbohydrate. In pens, CoP inclusions led to reduced final weight, growth rate and PER but to a much smaller extent than in aquaria. Fish fed the diet with 130 g kg(-1) CoP had similar growth and feed utilization (PER and FCR) to those fed the control diet (P>0.05). High dietary fibre levels together with the presence of antinutritional factors (ANFs) in CoP diets may explain why tilapia grew less and had lower feed utilization. Natural productivity of the pond could explain why results in pens were better than in aquaria. Results indicated that inclusion of CoP in tilapia diets might be limited to no more than 130 g kg(-1) when fish are raised in earthen ponds and natural food is available. 3aOreochromis aureus 3acoffee pulp 3afeeds 3abody weight 3acarbohydrates1 aVerreth, J.A.J.0 tAquaculture.g2003 Mar. 17, , no. 1/4 p.275-283dElsevier Pub.

The samples of undergrade barley were obtained from four provinces and analysed for the presence of deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV) by gas chromatography and zearalenone (ZEN) by high performance liquid chromatography. Of 37 samples, 33, 37 and 10 were positive for DON, NIV and ZEN, respectively. The husked barley contained 29-677 ng/g for DON, 114-1546 ng/g for NIV and 183-1416 ng/g for ZEN. The naked barley contained 38-645 ng/g for DON, 85-4569 ng/g for NIV and 40-1081 ng/g for ZEN. The average concentration of NIV in naked barley was higher than that in husked barley, but the average concentration of DON in husked barley was higher than that in naked barley. The survey indicates that the 1990 barley crop in Korea was heavily contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins. 3abarley 3aFusarium 3amycotoxins 3afood contamination 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFood Contamination 2aFusariumxmetabolism 2aHordeumxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aTrichothecenesxanalysis 3aSouth Korea 0aKorea1 aPark, A.R.1 aLee, Y.W.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1992 , v. 9, no. 6 p.639-645x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02844naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245008700149300001600236300002400252500002300276520168900299650001901988650001602007650001602023650001802039650001702057650001502074650001202089650005502101650001102156650003402167653002302201653001102224653001502235653002902250773008202279852000902361939003302370945000802403946001102411655001202422991582942660742620221119024222.0920225e199103  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920003772DNAL7 a18689252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulsen, E.10aSafety evaluation of substances consumed as technical ingredients (food additives)  ap. 125-133.  ap. 125-133. charts.  aLiterature review.  aThe different types of acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) are described as used by the FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the EEC Scientific Committee for Food (SCF). The allocation is discussed of a full ADI or a temporary ADI, and examples are given for the establishment (or withdrawal) of these ADIs. The flavours cinnamyl anthranillate and the solvent 2-nitropropane (both withdrawn), the sweeteners cyclamate and saccharin and the antioxidant BHA (all three changed) but not abolished. For BHA and saccharin the ADI was retained by both committees in spite of some evidence of carcinogenicity to experimental animals. ADI-'not specified' is specially discussed and it is recommended that numerical ADIs are used whenever possible. With an ADI-'not specified' it should be stated which use (and intake) levels are toxicologically acceptable. Some compounds evaluated by the two committees are discussed, e.g. the colours: Allura red AC, erythrosine, canthaxanthin and the caramels; three anti-oxidants: BHA, BHT and the gallates; the sweeteners: polyols, aspartame, saccharin and cyclamates. Four recommendations are made: (1) a numerical basis be given for the levels allocated an ADI-'not specified' or 'acceptable'; (2) lowering of the conventional safety factor be considered when the effects found are trivial-higher safety factors be considered when the toxic effects are serious or even irreversible; (3) ADIs should, whenever possible, be based on a combination of human and animal data; (4) ADIs might be allocated to compounds indicating animal carcinogenicity, if the compound is non-genotoxic, the mechanism clearly secondary and/or species-specific. 3afood additives 3afood safety 3acarcinogens 3afood coloring 3aantioxidants 3asweeteners 2aAnimals 2aFood Additivesxadministration & dosagextoxicity. 2aHumans 2aNeoplasmsxchemically induced 0aliterature reviews 0aintake 0aevaluation 0aacceptable daily intakes0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1991 , v. 8, no. 2 p.125-133x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03152naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245017500142300001600317500001500333520178500348650001802133650001602151650001702167650001502184650001702199650002102216650003202237650003002269650001602299650002202315650002002337650002102357650001902378650002202397650002302419653001502442653002802457653001302485653001802498773008802516852000902604930003302613945002502646946001102671655001202682IND4382739720221119024117.0060811s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438273972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The rust fungus Endophyllum osteospermi causes witches' brooms on C. monilifera ssp. monilifera in South Africa, and is associated with a reduction in growth and seed production of its host under natural conditions, as well as mortality of severely infected bushes. This rust fungus is considered to be a potential biological control agent for use against C. monilifera ssp. monilifera in Australia. Endophyllum osteospermi has a long latent period, typically between 6 and 24 months between infection and the initiation of witches' brooms. This long latent period makes the logistics of doing traditional host specificity testing, in which all test plant species are inoculated and observed for symptom development, unfeasible for this rust fungus. Germination of aecidioid teliospores and penetration by basidiospores were observed on the surface of excised leaves of 32 test plant species at 4 days after inoculation, and compared to that on C. monilifera ssp. monilifera. Germinating aecidioid teliospores aborted on 14 test plant species, whilst no penetration was attempted on a further 12 test plant species. Penetration only occurred on nine of the 32 test plant species, in addition to C. monilifera ssp. monilifera. Inoculating whole plants of nine selected test plant species confirmed the above results. Therefore, only the test plant species in which penetration occurred, or at least was attempted, need to undergo comprehensive host specificity testing. Pending these results, E. osteospermi may be suitable for release in Australia for the biological control of C. monilifera ssp. monilifera. 3arust diseases 3aPucciniales 3aweed control 3ahost range 3aplant growth 3aresearch methods 3aChrysanthemoides monilifera 3abiological control agents 3ahost plants 3aspore germination 3abroadleaf weeds 3ahost specificity 3amycoherbicides 3aseed productivity 3abiological control 0aUredinales 0aEndophyllum osterspermi 0asymptoms 0acell invasion0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2006, v. 16, no. 5-6 p.495-507x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02752naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245009200173300001400265520143600279650001301715650001601728650001301744650001201757650000901769650001001778650001101788650001401799650001301813650001101826650002401837650001401861650001201875650001101887650001301898650002601911651001501937653001601952653001601968653002801984700001902012773009202031852000902123856009202132930003302224946001302257655001202270IND4399920920221119024103.0080113e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439992092DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00334.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKennedy, Lisa M.12aA Late Holocene Pollen and Charcoal Record from La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica  ap. 11-19.  aPollen and charcoal analysis of a 5.9-m-long sediment profile from a swamp on an alluvial terrace on the edge of La Selva biological station, Costa Rica (10°26'23" N, 84°00'24" W, 36 m asl), documents three millennia of human and natural disturbance within a lowland tropical rain forest. The record indicates that the highly diverse rain forest that presently surrounds the Cantarrana swamp regrew following forest clearing and maize agriculture that ended only a few centuries ago. The first maize pollen appears in sediments deposited ~1070 calendar-year BP. Older sediments below the 'maize zone' contain macroscopic charcoal, abundant microscopic charcoal, and possible pollen indicators of forest clearance, perhaps signaling local cultivation of root crops that left no pollen in the sediments. Interpretation of local archaeology indicates that La Selva reserve may have been most heavily populated during the El Bosque and La Selva regional archaeological phases from 2250-950 yr BP. However, the distribution of maize pollen in the sediments is clear evidence that the reserve was also occupied during the later La Cabaña phase (950-400 yr BP), from which few artifacts have yet surfaced. Natural forest disturbance from treefalls and stream dynamics, and hydrological shifts associated with late-Holocene climate variability, form a backdrop to the human land-use history preserved in the Cantarrana sediment profile. 3aaltitude 3aarchaeology 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3acorn 3acrops 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3aland use 3apollen 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3astreams 3aswamps 3aterraces 3atropical rain forests 3aCosta Rica 0aarchaeology 0adisturbance 0aprehistoric agriculture1 aHorn, Sally P.0 tBiotropica.g2008 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.11-19dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00334.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01949naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245010500154300001600259520086500275650001301140650002001153650002001173650002101193650002301214650001201237650002201249650001101271650001101282650002601293650002001319650001201339650002201351653002401373700001501397700001501412773008201427939003301509852000901542655001201551991582942260742620221119024120.0920702e199112  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920023432DNAL7 a18120222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBloodworth, B.C.10aAluminium content in milk powders by inductively-coupled argon plasma--optical emission spectrometry  ap. 749-754.  aForty-four brands of milk powders and simulated milk powders were analysed for aluminum content using Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) technique, The samples covered the full range of infant food items available in Singapore-full-cream milk formula, infant formula, fortified infant formula and milk-free soy protein formula.

Alternately, it may provide a bet-hedging option for an otherwise 'all eggs in the one basket' reproductive strategy. Rapid germination of seeds upon hydration has been demonstrated for a range of tropical, semelparous bamboos, but the fate of seeds that failed to germinate promptly has been inadequately investigated. We demonstrate prompt germination of seeds upon hydration and the absence of a dormant seedbank in a long-lived, gregariously semelparous bamboo, Bambusa arnhemica, from monsoonal northern Australia. However, we refute the suggestion that seed dormancy is necessarily maladaptive in a gregariously semelparous plant. Rather, caryopsis dormancy may not be possible in a seasonally moist tropical climate. Given an inability to adjust or bet-hedge their germination, bamboo germinants must cope with the vagaries of the monsoonal climate, a factor that may contribute to the general restriction of bamboos to regions with higher rainfall. 3aBambusa 3abamboos 3aeggs 3afruits 3arain 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3atropics 3aAustralia 0aBambusa arnhemica 0abet-hedging 0acaryopsis 0amonsoonal northern Australia 0areproductive biology 0aseed biology1 aFranklin, Donald C.1 aHogarth, Nicholas J.0 tBiotropica.g2008 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.28-31dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00336.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02623naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245011000168300001600278520137800294650001201672650001801684650002301702650000801725650001801733650000901751650002101760650002501781650001201806650002201818650001001840651001101850700002001861700002001881700001501901700001301916700002801929773009601957852000902053856008302062939003302145946001102178655001202189IND4464139520221119024107.0120921e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446413952DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez-Villegas, A.12aA systematic review of socioeconomic differences in food habits in Europe: consumption of cheese and milk  ap. 917-929.  aObjective: To assess differences in cheese and milk consumption across socioeconomic groups in representative samples from several European countries. Design: A meta-analysis of published and unpublished surveys of food habits performed in nine European countries between 1985 and 1999. Educational and occupational levels were used as indicators of socio-economic status. Results: A higher socioeconomic status was associated with a greater consumption of cheese. The pooled estimate of the difference in cheese consumption between women in the highest vs the lowest educational level was 9.0 g/day (95% CI: 7.1 to 11.0). The parallel observation in men was 6.8 g/day (95% CI: 3.4 to 10.1). Similar results were obtained using occupation as an indicator of socioeconomic status. The pooled estimates of the higher cheese consumption among subjects belonging to the highest (vs the lowest) occupational level were 5.1 g/day (95% CI: 3.7 to 6.5) in women and 4.6 g/day (95% CI: 2.1 to 7.0) in men. No statistically significant associations were found for milk consumption concerning educational or occupational level. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that consumption of cheese is likely to be higher among subjects belonging to higher socioeconomic levels. We did not find enough evidence to support that milk intake is different according to educational or social levels. 3acheeses 3aeating habits 3aeducational status 3amen 3ameta-analysis 3amilk 3amilk consumption 3asocioeconomic status 3asurveys 3asystematic review 3awomen 3aEurope1 aMartínez, J.A.1 aPrättälä, R.1 aToledo, E.1 aRoos, G.1 aMartínez-González, A.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Aug., v. 57, no. 8 p.917-929x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016263Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle02811naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001500143245006000158300001800218520176300236650001901999650001702018650001602035650002302051650001402074650001302088650002002101650001502121650001202136700001902148700002102167700001402188773009902202852000902301856008302310939003302393946001102426655001202437IND4464137220221119024007.0120921e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446413722DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevine, J.10aTracmor system for measuring walking energy expenditure  ap. 1176-1180.  aObjective: Walking is an important mode of exercise and is likely to represent a major component of nonexercise activity thermogenesis. The question arises, how best to quantify walking-energy expenditure (EE) in free-living individuals. The triaxial accelerometer for movement registration (Tracmor) is a valid measure of body displacement and so we wanted to evaluate this tool for quantifying walking-EE. Hypothesis: In this study, we test the hypothesis that walking-EE, measured in a Room Calorimeter, can be predicted from Tracmor output using a regression equation derived from a brief Tracmor/treadmill/Metabolic Cart protocol. Design: First, 11 healthy subjects completed a 40-min procedure whereby they wore a Tracmor unit and walked on a treadmill at 0, 1, 2 and 3 mph while EE was measured using a Metabolic Cart. This allowed a regression equation to be defined for each subject to convert Tracmor output to EE. Each subject then entered a Room Calorimeter wearing the Tracmor Unit and walked at two self-selected velocities ('slow', 'fast') while EE was measured. 'Tracmor/regression equation' predictions of walking-EE were compared with Room Calorimeter measurements of walking-EE for the two velocities. Results: The 'Tracmor/regression equation' prediction of EE for walking slowly was 6.36 ± 1.67 kJ/min, and for walking fast it was 11.0 ± 2.60 kJ/min. Room Calorimeter measurements were 6.43 ± 1.85 and 10.9 ± 3.03 kJ/min, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient for slow-paced walking was 0.93 (P<0.001), and for fast-paced walking it was 0.82 (P<0.005). Conclusions: When combined with laboratory measures of EE, the Tracmor accelerometer provides useful data on walking-EE and is applicable to free-living individuals. 3aaccelerometers 3acalorimeters 3acorrelation 3aenergy expenditure 3aequations 3aexercise 3aheat production 3aprediction 3awalking1 aMelanson, E.L.1 aWesterterp, K.R.1 aHill, Jo.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.1176-1180x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016733Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle01639naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245005600131300001500187500002400202520075700226650002400983650002701007650001301034650001801047650002001065650001101085650001301096650000901109700001601118773008601134852000901220856009601229655001201325IND4462834120221119024011.0120229s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446283412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZilberman, David14aThe Lessons of Fermentation for the New Bio-Economy  ap. 97-103.  aIncludes references  aThe modern bio-economy consists of biotechnology, green chemistry, and modern biofuels, and can learn from the experience of the "traditional" bio-economy that relied on processes such as fermentation to alcoholic drinks, foods, and medicine.

Design, Setting and Subjects: Urinary iodine (UI) was assessed as an indicator of iodine status in spot urine samples of women participating in a field trial in three rural communities in the plains of southeastern Nepal. Samples were collected during pregnancy (n=1021) and during lactation at 3-4 months postpartum (n=1028) at a central clinic; 613 women were assessed at both times. Salt iodine (SI) content was assessed semiquantitatively at 6-7 months postpartum in households (n=1572). Results: During pregnancy and lactation, median UI concentrations were 0.756 and 0.483 mol/l, respectively, indicating mild iodine deficiency. UI and SI concentrations covaried markedly by season and were highest during hot, dry, premonsoon months and lowest during and following the humid monsoon season. Within women who contributed urine samples during both pregnancy and the postpartum period, iodine status determined by UI was not correlated. The percentage of households with adequately iodized salt (30 ppm) ranged from 85 to 44% from the hot, dry to the humid seasons, respectively. Conclusions: In the rural southern plains of Nepal, iodine deficiency remains a mild-to-moderate public health problem among pregnant and lactating women despite the availability of iodized salt. Marked seasonality in SI content may account for the lack of intraindividual correlation between maternal iodine status during pregnancy and postpartum periods and contribute to periodicity in the risk of iodine deficiency. 3afield experimentation 3ahouseholds 3aiodine 3aiodine deficiency 3aiodized salt 3alactating women 3alactation 3amonsoon season 3aperiodicity 3apostpartum period 3apregnancy 3apublic health 3arisk 3arural communities 3aurine 3aNepal1 aWest, K.P.

To identify genes affected in the signal perception and/or transduction phase of the gravity response, a mutant screen was devised using cold treatment to delay the gravity response of inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis. Inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis show no response to gravistimulation at 4 degrees C for up to 3 h. However, when gravistimulated at 4 degrees C and then returned to vertical at room temperature (RT), stems bend in response to the previous, horizontal gravistimulation (H. Fukaki, H. Fujisawa, M. Tasaka [1996] Plant Physiology 110: 933-943). This indicates that gravity perception, but not the gravitropic response, occurs at 4 degrees C. Recessive mutations were identified at three loci using this cold effect on gravitropism to screen for gravity persistence signal (gps) mutants. All three mutants had an altered response after gravistimulation at 4 degrees C, yet had phenotypically normal responses to stimulations at RT. gps1-1 did not bend in response to the 4 degrees C gravity stimulus upon return to RT. gps2-1 responded to the 4 degrees C stimulus but bent in the opposite direction. gps3-1 over-responded after return to RT, continuing to bend to an angle greater than wild-type plants. At 4 degrees C, starch-containing statoliths sedimented normally in both wild-type and the gps mutants, but auxin transport was abolished at 4 degrees C. These results are consistent with GPS loci affecting an aspect of the gravity signal perception/transduction pathway that occurs after statolith sedimentation, but before auxin transport.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atransgenic plants 3aseedlings 3aseedling growth 3ainflorescences 3astems 3aplant proteins 3aloci 3amutation 3agravitropism 3agravity 3asignal transduction 3acold stress 3aplant stress 3aphysiological transport 3aplant morphology 3akinetics 3aindole acetic acid 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aBiological Transportxdrug effects 2aCold Temperature 2aFlowering Topsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aGravitropismxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGravity Sensingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aSignal Transductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aStarchxmetabolism 0agravity persistence signal 0agps1 protein 0agps2 protein 0agps3 protein1 aRashotte, A.M.1 aShipp, M.J.1 aRobertson, D.1 aMuday, G.K.0 tPlant physiology.g2002 Nov., v. 130, no. 3 p.1426-1435dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRSC  aOther US 7aarticle03553naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001500143245019100158300001800349520183900367650001302206650001402219650001802233650002002251650001802271650002402289650001202313650001302325650001902338650001202357650002802369650002002397650001902417650001302436650001102449650001002460650001802470650001702488650001502505650001402520650001502534650001602549651001202565700002002577700001402597700001702611700001602628700001802644700001702662700001902679700001802698773009902716852000902815856008302824939003302907946001102940655001202951IND4464136220221119024226.0120921e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446413622DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolf, B.W.10aEffects of a beverage containing an enzymatically induced-viscosity dietary fiber, with or without fructose, on the postprandial glycemic response to a high glycemic index food in humans  ap. 1120-1127.  aObjective: Dietary supplementation with guar gum or fructose has been reported to reduce the postprandial glycemic response to an oral glucose challenge. As a result of the poor palatability of most foods containing guar gum, a novel low-viscosity beverage with guar gum was developed that becomes viscous in vivo through an enzymatic induction. The primary study objective was to determine the effect of an amylase-induced viscosity (I-V) product, with or without supplemental fructose, on the postprandial glycemic response to a high glycemic index test meal in healthy nondiabetic subjects. Design: The study was a four-treatment, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized block protocol. Setting: The study was performed at Glycaemic Index Testing, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Subjects: A total of 30 healthy nondiabetic volunteers (13 male, 17 female, mean ± s.e.m. age of 51 ± 3 y and body mass index of 24.2 ± 0.4 kg/m2) participated in the study. Interventions: In the morning after an overnight fast, subjects participated in four 3-h meal glucose tolerance tests on separate occasions. The test meals contained 50 g of available carbohydrate from maltodextrin and white bread (control) or the same meal with either 5 g of guar gum (3.6 g galactomannan), 5 g of fructose, or 5 g of guar gum +5 g of fructose. Results: Treatments containing guar gum had a reduced (P<0.01) baseline-adjusted peak glucose response and incremental area under the glucose curve. In contrast to previous studies, fructose increased (P<0.05) the baseline-adjusted peak glucose concentration. Conclusions: Guar gum incorporated into an amylase I-V product provided a means to stabilize blood glucose levels by reducing the early phase excursion and then by appropriately maintaining the later phase excursion in healthy nondiabetic humans. 3aamylases 3abeverages 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3adietary fiber 3adietary supplements 3afemales 3afructose 3agalactomannans 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3aglycemic effect 3aglycemic index 3aguar gum 3ahumans 3amales 3amaltodextrins 3apalatability 3atest meals 3aviscosity 3avolunteers 3awhite bread 3aOntario1 aWolever, T.M.S.1 aLai, C.S.1 aBolonesi, C.1 aRadmard, R.1 aMaharry, K.S.1 aGarleb, K.A.1 aHertzler, S.R.1 aFirkins, J.L.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.1120-1127x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016523Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle03312naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001500143245012000158300001800278520205900296650001702355650001002372650001402382650001002396650001302406650002402419650002902443650001202472650002402484650001802508650001202526650002302538650001602561650001302577700001902590700001702609700001702626773009902643852000902742856008302751939003302834946001102867655001202878IND4464136120221119023838.0120921e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446413612DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVernia, P.10aEffect of predominant methanogenic flora on the outcome of lactose breath test in irritable bowel syndrome patients  ap. 1116-1119.  aBackground: The relationship between hydrogen and methane production is a possible confounding factor in the interpretation of H2 breath tests (HBT), but is usually disregarded for the interpretation of HBT and, in most instances, only H2 excretion is measured. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of predominant fasting methane CH4 or H2 production on the outcome of lactose HBT, in a large, homogeneous series of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients and methods: A lactose HBT was performed in 237 IBS patients with predominant fasting methane production (CH4>H2), recording the outcome of the test, amount of gas excreted and occurrence of clinical symptoms. Data were compared to those of 237 age- and sex-matched IBS patients with low fasting CH4 excretion. Results: The test was positive in 124 predominant CH4 producers (52.3%) (PMP), as compared to 201 (84.8%) low methane producers (LMP) (P<0.0001). Peak hydrogen concentration and area under the curve of H2 were significantly (P<0.001) lower, and the occurrence of symptoms during the test less frequent, in PMP vs LMP patients. During the test, CH4 excretion doubled in 57/113 (50.4%) patients with negative HBT, and in 49/124 (39.5%) with positive HBT. Conclusions: Patients with predominant fasting methane production excrete less H2 than LMP, after an oral load of lactose. The lower prevalence of severe lactose intolerance in PMP, as well as lower incidence of symptoms during the test, is, indeed, related to lower and slower H2 excretion. The assumption that H2 excretion is an effective means of quantifying the amount of malabsorbed carbohydrates is questionable in PMP. Methane-producing patients likely have a higher 'false negative' rate as compared to LMP after an oral load of lactose. Nonetheless, as symptoms are related to the amount of gas produced in the colon, HBT identifies patients with 'lactose intolerance', irrespective of the presence of lactose malabsorption, and helps in predicting the effect of lactose-restricted diet. 3abreath tests 3acolon 3aexcretion 3agases 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airritable bowel syndrome 3alactose 3alactose intolerance 3amalabsorption 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3apatients1 aDi Camillo, M.1 aMarinaro, V.1 aCaprilli, R.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.1116-1119x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016513Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle03176naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001700143245011100160300001800271520164600289650001501935650001701950650001901967650001601986650001802002650001302020650001502033650001502048650001502063650001402078650000902092650002502101650002202126650002002148650002402168650001502192650000902207650001202216650001402228650001402242650001602256650001002272651001602282700003202298700001702330700001902347700002102366773009902387852000902486856008302495939003302578946001102611655001202622IND4464136320221119023825.0120921e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446413632DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeerd, S. de10aMaternal periconceptional biochemical and hematological parameters, vitamin profiles and pregnancy outcome  ap. 1128-1134.  aObjectives: To evaluate periconceptional maternal biochemical and hematological parameters and vitamin profiles in relation to the risk of early pregnancy loss and birth weight. Design: Prospective longitudinal study. Setting: University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Maria and Elisabeth Hospitals, Tilburg, and Catharina Hospital, Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Subjects: A cohort of 240 women recruited before pregnancy. Interventions: Blood samples were taken preconceptional and at 6 and 10 weeks amenorrhea in which the concentrations of hemoglobin, hematocrit, creatinin, uric acid, total protein, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and the concentrations of retinol, tocopherol, thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, cobalamin and folate were analyzed. Main outcome measures: Risk of early pregnancy loss and birth weight. Results: The risk of early pregnancy loss increased with increasing prepregnancy weight, and when the periconceptional decline in hematocrit, creatinin and uric acid was less profound (slope: P<0.01). Maternal smoking was negatively associated with birth weight (mean reduction of 183 g, P<0.05). Maternal age and prepregnancy weight were positively associated with birth weight (P<0.01). No significant associations were found between vitamin concentrations and risk of early pregnancy loss or birth weight. Conclusions: Several periconceptional biochemical parameters are significantly associated with early pregnancy loss. The effects of maternal periconceptional health on embryonic development and subsequent pregnancy outcome should be further explored. 3aamenorrhea 3abirth weight 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3aembryogenesis 3aferritin 3afolic acid 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahospitals 3airon 3alongitudinal studies 3apregnancy outcome 3aprotein content 3apyridoxal phosphate 3ariboflavin 3arisk 3athiamin 3auric acid 3avitamin A 3avitamin B12 3awomen 3aNetherlands1 aSteegers-Theunissen, R.P.M.1 aBoo, T.M. de1 aThomas, C.M.G.1 aSteegers, E.A.P.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Sept., v. 57, no. 9 p.1128-1134x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016543Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle01641naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009600127300001200223520083400235650001301069650001901082650003001101650002701131653002301158700001801181773008601199852000901285930003301294945001301327946001101340655001201351IND2062092420221119024338.0980225e199603  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206209242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilner, R.J.10aBiological control of termites: results and experiences within a CSIRO project in Australia  ap. 3-9.  aClassical biological control of termites is not possible. The most promising biological method is the inundative release of pathogenic microorganisms as 'biological insecticides'. Fungi are the most promising type of pathogen for development as biological insecticides. Studies in Australia have shown that certain isolates of the Hyphomycete, Metarhizium anisopliae, can be applied to kill colonies of mound- and tree-nesting termites. Indirect treatment using feeding sites and baiting has not yet been successful in killing colonies: however it may provide control for an extended time (over 1 year). The live conidia are repellent to termites, and this characteristic can be used for the barrier treatment of soil to protect seedling-stage susceptible crops, such as eucalypts, as well as for protection of wooden structures. 3aIsoptera 3ainsect control 3abiological control agents 3aentomopathogenic fungi 0aliterature reviews1 aStaples, J.A.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g1996 Mar., v. 6, no. 1 p.3-9x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdLJS  aNon-US 7aarticle02360naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009100130300001600221500002400237520133800261650001601599650001601615650002501631650001401656650001701670650001301687650001001700651001601710700002201726773012601748852000901874856007001883930003301953945001301986946001101999655001202010IND2333027320221119024255.0030612e20030317ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233302732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuckworth, A.R.10aDeveloping farming structures for production of biologically active sponge metabolites  ap. 139-156.  aIncludes references  aA major obstacle to acceptance and use of sponge aquaculture as a viable method for production of biologically active metabolites is the lack of a farming technology suitable for commercial use. Using the New Zealand sponges Latrunculia sp. nov, Polymastia croceus and Raspailia agminata, all containing bioactive metabolites with biomedical potential, four general farming methods were examined: held on longline arrays sponge explants were farmed inside mesh support structures, rope threaded through explants and rope wrapped around explants. The fourth method additionally acted as a control procedure with sponge explants attached to substrate. Each general farming method was expanded to examine the effects of various mesh sizes and/or rope materials. Most methods were found to be unsuitable for commercial application because the farmed explants did not attach to the supporting substrate but instead grew away from it and were subsequently lost. The two methods that showed the most potential for large-scale sponge farming, in terms of good growth, survival and metabolite biosynthesis, were threaded polyvinyl alcohol rope and individual bags with large mesh size and thin strand diameter. These were developed into "rope" and "mesh" arrays that may be suitable for commercially farming sponges for metabolite production. 3aaquaculture 3ametabolites 3amedicinal properties 3amortality 3abiosynthesis 3adiameter 3aropes 3aNew Zealand1 aBattershill, C.N.0 tAquaculture.g2003 Mar. 17, , no. 1/4 p.139-156dElsevier Pub.

Kroes, I. Munro and E. Poulsen.  a2019-12-05  aAn increased incidence of bladder cancer is found when male rats are fed high dietary concentrations of sodium saccharin (3% or more) from birth. This toxicity has been used as the basis for the development of a data-derived safety factor. Such an effect would attract an extra factor (10-fold) for nature of toxicity and in the absence of other data would result in a high overall safety factor. However the extensive mechanistic database on sodium saccharin allows an assessment of the potential relevance of the effect for humans. In addition the effect is only seen under specific conditions in rats, i.e. largely with the sodium salt and with a commercial rat diet. The effect is not related to the concentration of saccharin in the rat urine or bladder so that toxicokinetic considerations are simplified. The extensive animal database allows the determination of data-derived factors for inter-species differences in both toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics. Based on this analysis an overall safety factor of 50 (which includes the factor of 10 for severity of effect) would appear appropriate at the present time. This factor, and the ADI which would result from its application, are consistent with the absence of an association between the consumption of artificial sweeteners and bladder cancer in humans. 3acarcinogenesis 3ainterspecific variation 3abladder 3ahuman health and safety 3apharmacokinetics 3acarcinoma 3akinetics 3ano observed adverse effect level 3adata analysis 3asaccharin 3aadverse effects 2aAnimals 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMaximum Allowable Concentration 2aRats 2aSaccharinxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxpharmacokinetics. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aUrinary Bladder Neoplasmsxchemically induced 0aspecies differences 0atoxicodynamics 0aintake 0atoxicity 0adynamics0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1993 , v. 10, no. 3 p.337-350x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01759naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245014100171300001600312520058400328650002800912650001700940650001100957650001300968650001000981653002300991653001801014653003301032653002301065700001701088700001901105700002001124773009401144852000901238856009201247930003301339946001301372655001201385IND4399921020221119024354.0080113e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439992102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00325.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoof, Jennifer10aContrasting Structure and Function of Pubescent and Glabrous Varieties of Hawaiian Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae) at High Elevation  ap. 113-118.  aHawaiian dominant tree species Metrosideros polymorpha varieties glaberrima and polymorpha have glabrous and pubescent leaves, respectively.

Subjects and methods: In total, 40 obese male subjects (mean BMI 32.3 kg/m2; mean age 39 y) were recruited and randomly divided into a diet (D; n=20) and a diet plus exercise (DE; n=20) group. Both groups participated in an energy restriction programme (ER), which was followed by a weight maintenance phase (WM). Subjects in the DE also participated in an exercise programme. Body mass (BM) and the scores on the three factor eating questionnaire (TFEQ) were measured before and after the ER and after WM. Results: No significant differences between both groups were found. All data taken together showed that BM loss during ER was explained by initial BM (r2=0.3, P<0.0005) and inversely by initial cognitive restraint (F1) (r2=0.4, P<0.0005) in a stepwise regression. BM regain during WM was explained by BM loss (r2=0.5, P<0.001) and by increase in F1 during ER (r2=0.6, P<0.001), while the exercise intervention did not contribute further to the explained variation. Subjects with a relatively high diet frequency prior to the study had relatively significant higher initial F1 scores (P<0.05). During ER, increase in F1 was associated with decrease in general hunger (F3). Conclusion: Successful BM loss was associated with higher initial BM and lower initial F1. Successful WM was explained by BM loss and increase in F1 during ER, irrespective of possible exercise training effects. Successful WM was reduced when F1 scores reach their limit, due to diet-frequency. 3abody mass index 3adietary restriction 3aexercise 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahunger 3alow calorie diet 3amen 3aobesity 3aweight control1 aAggel-Leijssen, D.P.C. van1 aBaak, M.A. van1 aWesterterp-Plantenga, M.S.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Oct., v. 57, no. 10 p.1338-1344x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016973Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle03291naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245006100175300001600236500001500252520183700267650001502104650001502119650001902134650002602153650001002179650001202189650001502201650001602216650001702232650002602249650001802275650001802293650001902311651001102330653002802341653003402369653001102403653002702414653002902441700002702470700002702497700002002524773009402544852000902638856009202647930003302739946001302772655001202785IND4393335120221119024341.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439333512DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00304.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidson, Diane W.14aThe Tropical Ant Mosaic in a Primary Bornean Rain Forest  ap. 468-475.  a2019-12-05  aIn primary lowland rain forest in Brunei Darussalam, we studied arboreal ant communities to evaluate whether densities and spacing of spatially territorial taxa along 2.9 km of well-studied trails are consistent with existence of a continuous mosaic of dominant ants. A median intercolony distance of 24.5 m, about twice or less distances over which colonies of most included species regularly ranged, suggested a relatively continuous mosaic. Despite relying on nesting sites in preformed plant cavities, carpenter ants contributed > 70 percent of mapped colonies. Most belonged to the Camponotus (Colobopsis) cylindricus (COCY) complex, including SE Asia's 'exploding' ants. Their lack of aggression against certain Polyrhachis species was associated with interspecific territory sharing by members of the two groups, and with a dominance-discovery trade-off. Experimental approaches yielded evidence for two putative contributors to positive association. Larger-bodied Polyrhachis parasitize food-finding abilities of smaller, more populous Camponotus workers, and the two taxa cooperate in territorial defense. Highly territorial and predatory weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) were an important component of the ant mosaic in primary forest, second only to codominant COCY and Polyrhachis taxa. Members of the genus Crematogaster were significantly associated with Oecophylla in baiting censuses and regularly monopolized near-nest baits to the exclusion of weaver ants. Litter ant abundances differed between territories of Oecophylla and less predatory COCY species, but direction of difference was inconsistent over time. The densely packed mosaic of spatially territorial, and differentially predatory, taxa in Bornean rain forest likely contributes to spatial variation in ant effects on plant and arthropod communities. 3aCamponotus 3aparasitism 3acarpenter ants 3aarthropod communities 3abaits 3abaiting 3aaggression 3aPolyrhachis 3arain forests 3aOecophylla smaragdina 3anesting sites 3aCrematogaster 3aterritoriality 3aBrunei 0aCamponotus, codominants 0adominance-discovery trade-off 0atrails 0ainformation parasitism 0ashared territory defense1 aLessard, Jean-Philippe1 aBernau, Christopher R.1 aCook, Steven C.0 tBiotropica.g2007 July, v. 39, no. 4 p.468-475dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00304.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02960naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001400143245008500157300001800242520185200260650002102112650001602133650000902149650001202158650001302170650001502183650001802198650001502216650001502231650001802246650001702264650001102281651001802292700001702310773009902327852000902426856008302435939003302518946001102551655001202562IND4464132020221119024312.0120921e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446413202DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexy, U.10aTime trends in the consumption of dairy foods in German children and adolescents  ap. 1331-1337.  aObjective: Examination of time trends in the consumption of dairy food and their impact on fat and calcium intakes in German children and adolescents. Design: Dietary records from the DONALD Study (DOrtmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed Study). Methods: A total of 5068 3-day weighed dietary records from 914 1 to 13-y-old children and adolescents collected between 1986 and 2001 were analysed using a mixed linear model, in which the means of the data and the covariance structure specific to the DONALD Study were modelled. Results: During the study period, the consumption of 'milk products' in children and adolescents >=4 y remained stable, since the reduced consumption of 'fluid milk' (between -2.8 and -7.4 g/day/study year) was compensated for by an increased consumption of 'yoghurt' (between +2.4 and +3.3 g/day/study year). The consumption of 'cheese' increased in subjects 4 y (between +0.2 and +0.7 g/day/study year). In 1 to 3-y-old children, the decreased intake of 'fluid milk' (-6.5 g/day/study year) was not compensated for by the increased intake of 'formula' (+3.5 g/day/study year). The percentage of 'low-fat milk products' significantly increased (although not significant in 9-13-y-old boys) to nearly 25% of milk products. The impact of dairy food on fat intake (as percentage of energy intake) remained stable with the exception of a slight reduction in 4-8 y olds, the impact of dairy on calcium (as percentage of US adequate intake) decreased only in 1-3 y olds. Conclusions: The consumption of dairy food remained widely stable over time in >=4-y-old children and adolescents, but decreased in 1-3 y olds. A further decline in this age group would be undesirable as is the shift from common milk to formula. The intake of 'low-fat milk products' increased and should be continuously promoted. 3aAdequate Intakes 3aadolescents 3aboys 3acalcium 3achildren 3acovariance 3aenergy intake 3afat intake 3afluid milk 3alinear models 3alow fat milk 3ayogurt 3aUnited States1 aKersting, M.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Oct., v. 57, no. 10 p.1331-1337x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016963Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle02839naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245005600161300001800217520158700235650002101822650001301843650002501856650002401881650002001905650001401925650001201939650001201951650001501963650001401978650002001992650000902012650001002021651001002031700001802041700001502059700001402074700001602088700001602104700001402120773009902134852000902233856008302242939003302325946001102358655001202369IND4464132520221119024423.0120921e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446413252DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParazzini, F.10aModerate alcohol drinking and risk of preterm birth  ap. 1345-1349.  aObjective: We have analysed the association between alcohol drinking before and during the three trimesters of pregnancy and risk of preterm birth of babies with normal weight for gestational age or with low weight for gestational age (SGA). Design: Case-control study. Setting: General and university hospitals in Italy. Subjects: Cases were 502 women who delivered preterm births <37 weeks gestation. The controls included 1966 women who gave birth at term (>=37 weeks of gestation) to healthy infants of normal weight (ie between 10th and 90th centile according to the Italian standard) on randomly selected days at the hospitals where cases had been identified. Interventions: Interview. Results: No increased risk of preterm birth was observed in women drinking one or two drinks/die in pregnancy, but three or more drinks/die increased the risk (multivariate odds ratios (OR) 2.0 for >=3 drinks during the first trimester, 1.8 during the second and 1.9 during the third). When the analysis was conducted separately for preterm births with normal weight or SGA, the increased risk was observed in preterm SGA only (multivariate OR for >=3 drinks/die during the first trimester=3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-11.1); the estimated multivariate OR for >=3 drinks/die during the first trimester of preterm babies with normal weight for gestational age was only slightly above unity and not statistically significant (multivariate OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-3.7). Conclusions: The study shows an increased risk in mothers who drink 3 die units alcohol in pregnancy of preterm births. 3aalcohol drinking 3aalcohols 3acase-control studies 3aconfidence interval 3agestational age 3ahospitals 3ainfants 3amothers 3aodds ratio 3apregnancy 3apremature birth 3arisk 3awomen 3aItaly1 aChatenoud, L.1 aSurace, M.1 aTozzi, L.1 aSalerio, B.1 aBettoni, G.1 aBenzi, G.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Oct., v. 57, no. 10 p.1345-1349x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016903Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle03117naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245014400173300001600317520175200333650001002085650001402095650002002109650001502129650001702144650001702161650001202178650001802190650002402208650002302232650001402255650001302269650001902282650002102301653002502322653001702347653001202364653002202376700002002398773009302418852000902511856009302520930003302613946001302646655001202659IND4390841620221119023950.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439084162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00272.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeres, Carlos A.10aBasin-Wide Effects of Game Harvest on Vertebrate Population Densities in Amazonian Forests: Implications for Animal-Mediated Seed Dispersal  ap. 304-315.  aVertebrate responses to hunting are widely variable for target and nontarget species depending on the history of hunting and productivity of any given site and the life history traits of game species. We provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of changes in population density or other abundance estimates for 30 mid-sized to large mammal, bird and reptile species in 101 hunted and nonhunted, but otherwise undisturbed, Neotropical forest sites. The data set was analyzed using both an unnested approach, based on population density estimates, and a nested approach in which pairwise comparisons of abundance metrics were restricted to geographic groups of sites sharing similar habitat and soil conditions. This resulted in 25 geographic clusters of sites within which 1811 population abundance estimates were compared across different levels of hunting pressure. Average nested changes in abundance across increasingly greater levels of hunting pressure ranged from moderately positive to highly negative. Populations of all species combined declined across greater differences in hunting pressure by up to 74.8 percent from their numeric abundance in less intensively hunted sites, but harvest-sensitive species faired far worse. Of the 30 species examined, 22 declined significantly at high levels of hunting. Body size significantly affected the direction and magnitude of abundance changes, with large-bodied species declining faster in overhunted sites. Frugivorous species showed more marked declines in abundance in heavily hunted sites than seed predators and browsers, regardless of the effects of body size. The implications of hunting for seed dispersal are discussed in terms of community dynamics in semi-defaunated tropical forests. 3abirds 3abody size 3adata collection 3afrugivores 3agame animals 3alife history 3amammals 3ameta-analysis 3anontarget organisms 3apopulation density 3apredators 3areptiles 3aseed dispersal 3atropical forests 0adispersal limitation 0agame harvest 0ahunting 0alarge vertebrates1 aPalacios, Erwin0 tBiotropica.g2007 May, v. 39, no. 3 p.304-315dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00272.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02674naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010000172300001600272520123900288650002001527650001101547650002301558650001001581650002601591650001001617650001301627650001901640650002001659650001201679650002601691650001701717651001501734653002301749653002401772653002101796653000901817700001701826700002701843700002001870700002401890700002501914773009301939852000902032856009302041930003302134946001302167655001202180IND4390845620221119023958.0070506e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439084562DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00268.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Barbara A.10aBehavioral Avoidance of Ultraviolet-B Radiation by Two Species of Neotropical Poison-Dart Frogs  ap. 433-435.  aMany animals, plants, and microorganisms are harmed by ultraviolet-B radiation. In particular, several members of class amphibia are negatively affected by exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation. Exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation can cause death or various types of sublethal damage in amphibians. One mechanism to lessen the effect of harmful ultraviolet-B radiation is to limit exposure to sunlight behaviorally. Few studies have examined the behavioral sensitivity of adult amphibians to ultraviolet-B radiation. Using both field experiments and field observations, we found that two species of diurnal poison-dart frogs in Costa Rica (Dendrobates pumilio, D. auratus) consistently preferred areas in the field and within experimental testing chambers that offered low levels of ultraviolet-B radiation. In field observations, vocalizing D. pumilio were found at locations with significantly lower levels of ambient ultraviolet-B compared to random locations throughout their natural habitat. Ultraviolet-B avoidance behavior may be an important behavioral response for tropical frogs in light of recent evidence suggesting a significant increase in the levels of ambient ultraviolet-B radiation in the tropics over the past decade. 3aOophaga pumilio 3aadults 3aavoidance behavior 3adeath 3afield experimentation 3afrogs 3ahabitats 3amicroorganisms 3aplants (botany) 3atropics 3aultraviolet radiation 3avocalization 3aCosta Rica 0aavoidance behavior 0alowland rain forest 0apoison-dart frog 0aUV-B1 aKats, Lee B.1 aPommerening, Rachel C.1 aFerrer, Ryan P.1 aMurry-Ewers, Marcia1 aBlaustein, Andrew R.0 tBiotropica.g2007 May, v. 39, no. 3 p.433-435dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2007.00268.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02726naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245006700154300001300221500013800234520134900372650002301721650001501744650002401759650001201783650004801795650000901843650002701852650001801879650002301897650001101920650004501931650004801976650002702024650002502051650004002076651001102116700001202127773008002139852000902219939003302228945000802261946001102269655001202280991582928920742620221119024140.0930608e199301  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930018092DNAL7 a85048742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConacher, H.B.S.10aAssessment of human exposure to chemical contaminants in foods  ap. 5-15.  aPaper presented at the symposium and workshop on "Food Contamination, Mycotoxins and Phycotoxins," November 4-15, 1990, Cairo, Egypt.  aOne of the most important factors in assessing risk to human health from potentially harmful chemicals in foods is the availability of good data on the exposure of the public to such substances. The means of acquiring these data generally involves monitoring programmes using appropriate sampling procedures and reliable analytical methods for measuring the compounds of concern in a variety of substrates. Two approaches are generally employed: a biological monitoring programme which measures substances in human fluids and tissues, and a food analysis monitoring programme, preferably a total diet study, wherein food is prepared for consumption prior to analysis. The choice of approach to use and chemicals to monitor depend on the situation within a particular country. The analysis of food has the advantage of short term impact since problems can be identified relatively quickly and control measures established. Biological monitoring on the other hand tends to indicate both accumulated and current exposure from all sources, including air, water and food. In Canada both approaches have been used for a number of years with major surveys of human milk and adipose tissue, and the total diet study, being conducted approximately every five years. Details of these programmes together with some of the pertinent findings are presented. 3afood contamination 3amonitoring 3achemical substances 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aDiet 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Contamination 2aHumans 2aLeadxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aMercuryxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aPesticidesxanalysis 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxanalysis 0aCanada1 aMes, J.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1993 , v. 10, no. 1 p.5-15x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02528naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245012500161300001800286520139400304650001601698650003401714650000801748650001501756650002501771650001301796650001001809651000901819700001601828700001501844700001601859700001701875700001501892773009901907852000902006856008302015939003302098946001102131655001202142IND4464130620221119024244.0120921e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446413062DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorheim, L.E.10aValidation of food variety as an indicator of diet quality assessed with a food frequency questionnaire for Western Mali  ap. 1283-1291.  aObjective: To assess the validity of two diet quality indexes-food variety score (FVS) and diet diversity score (DDS) in Western Mali. Design: In two separate studies (A and B), FVS and DDS were derived from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and were compared with the same scores and with measures of nutrient adequacy derived from 2-day weighed records (WR). Setting: Two rural, adjacent villages in Mali, West Africa. Subjects: In study A (1996), 48 women and 27 men (15-59 y) participated. Study B (1999) included 34 women and 36 men (15-45 y). Results: Spearman's correlation coefficients between FVS from the FFQ and WR for men were 0.5 in study A and 0.4 in study B. The corresponding correlations for DDS were 0.2 and 0.4, respectively. Correlations for women were lower, especially in study B. Classification into quartiles was also best for men. Correlations for the two diet variety scores from the FFQ with nutrient adequacy from the WR in study A were about 0.3 for men, but lower for women. In study B, these correlations were around 0.5 for men, whereas for women there was no association. Conclusions: FVS and DDS can be assessed by our FFQ. The two diet variety scores reflect diet quality and are simple tools that can be used for monitoring. The validation study gave better results for men than for women, which has implications for further use of these instruments. 3acorrelation 3afood frequency questionnaires 3amen 3amonitoring 3anutritional adequacy 3avillages 3awomen 3aMali1 aBarikmo, I.1 aParr, C.L.1 aHatløy, A.1 aOuattara, F.1 aOshaug, A.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Oct., v. 57, no. 10 p.1283-1291x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016863Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle02247naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245005000151300001600201520110300217650001901320650001401339650002101353650002101374650002101395650002401416650001201440650001101452650002101463650001901484650001201503650001001515650001001525650002401535651001901559700001701578700001901595700001601614700001601630773008201646852000901728939003301737945000801770946001101778655001201789991582928580742620221119024219.0921208e199205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920037072DNAL7 a13973982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScotter, M.J.10aSurvey of animal livers for vitamin A content  ap. 237-242.  aRetail samples of livers from calf (23), ox (18), lamb (17), pig (15), chicken (16) and turkey (1) were analysed to determine levels of vitamin A (all trans-retinol) and to aid assessment of the effects of using vitamin supplemented compound feedingstuffs for livestock. For comparison, 22 liver samples from lambs reared on diets not containing vitamin-supplemented compound feedingstuffs and four samples of liver from ox which had received supplemented feed but not during the last four months prior to slaughter were also analysed. The chosen method of analysis utilized saponification, solvent extraction and normal-phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. For all species analysed, the levels of vitamin A ranged from 10 to 1100 mg/kg, with all but seven at or below 400 mg/kg. For lamb and ox livers, the mean levels were 310 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg respectively for retail samples.

Various internal or external factors can modulate these gene expression patterns, which then elicit physiological or pathological changes. We have characterized the global gene expression patterns of Arabidopsis leaves by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). A total of 21 280 SAGE tags were sequenced and 12 049 unique tags were identified. Among these, only 3367 tags (27.9%) were matched to the Arabidopsis cDNA or EST database. Functional analysis of annotated tags indicated that a significant proportion of the genes expressed in normal leaves were involved in energy and metabolism, especially in photosynthesis. To systematically analyze differential gene expression profiles under cold stress, a similar SAGE tag library from cold-treated leaves was constructed and analyzed. A comparison of the tags derived from the cold-treated leaves with those identified in the normal leaves revealed 272 differentially expressed genes (P<0.01): 82 genes were highly expressed in the normal leaves and 190 genes were highly expressed in the cold-treated leaves. After cold stress, in general, many of the genes involved in cell rescue/defense/cell death/aging, protein synthesis, metabolism, transport facilitation, and protein destination were induced. They included various COR genes, lipid transfer protein genes, alcohol dehydrogenase, beta-amylase and many novel genes. By comparison, down-regulated genes were mostly photosynthesis related genes involved in energy metabolism. The expression patterns of several cold responsive transcripts identified by SAGE were confirmed by northern analysis. The results presented here will provide valuable information for understanding the mechanisms of the freezing tolerance of plants. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aleaves 3acold stress 3aplant stress 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3amessenger RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCold Temperature 2aGene Expression Profilingxmethods 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aPlant Leavesxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aserial analysis of gene expression 0adifferential gene expression1 aLee, J.Y.1 aLee, D.H.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2003 June, v. 52, no. 3 p.553-567dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-4412/contents3electronic resource  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03078naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002500129245014800154300001600302500002400318500001500342520079800357650000901155650002201164650002601186650001701212650003001229650003101259650002801290650002401318650002901342650002001371650002701391650002101418650002301439650002401462650002301486650002001509650002801529650003001557650005201587650002701639650002801666650005301694650003501747650003101782650003001813650003801843650003401881653001001915653003701925700001501962700001501977700001701992700001402009700001502023700001702038700001502055700001802070700001602088773010902104852000902213856007702222930003302299945001302332946001102345655001202356IND2334148120221119023848.0030925e200306  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233414812DNAL7 a129565252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkimoto-Tomiyama, C.10aRice gene expression in response to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor: comprehensive analysis by DNA microarray with randomly selected ESTs  ap. 537-551.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aN-acetylchitooligosaccharides are potent elicitors to suspension-cultured rice cells, inducing a set of defense reactions. Expression of defense-related genes is considered to play an important role in defense reactions, and we employed microarray analysis of 8987 randomly selected expressed sequence tags to analyze the changes in gene expression caused by N-acetylchitooctaose. In this experiment, 166 genes were significantly induced and 93 genes were repressed. RNA gel blot analysis of 16 of these genes confirmed the microarray results. Of the 259 ESTs identified as responsive to N-acetylchytooctaose, 18 genes are related to signal transduction, including five calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs). Among these, three novel CDPKs responsive to N-acetylchitooctaose were isolated. 3arice 3acomplementary DNA 3amicroarray technology 3aOryza sativa 3afungal diseases of plants 3agene expression regulation 3aexpressed sequence tags 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aoligosaccharides 3adefense mechanisms 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCells, Cultured 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysisxmethods 2aOligosaccharidesxpharmacology 2aOryzaxcytologyxgenetics. 2aProtein Kinasesxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0agenes 0acalcium dependent protein kinase1 aSakata, K.1 aYazaki, J.1 aNakamura, K.1 aFujii, F.1 aShimbo, K.1 aYamamoto, K.1 aSasaki, T.1 aKishimoto, N.1 aKikuchi, S.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2003 June, v. 52, no. 3 p.537-551dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-4412/contents3electronic resource  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02824naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001700143245006700160300001800227520169700245650001501942650002301957650002501980650001502005650001002020650001802030650001302048650001502061700001702076700001402093700002302107700002102130700002402151700001602175773009902191852000902290856008302299939003302382946001102415655001202426IND4464129620221119024040.0120921e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446412962DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPentieva, K.10aAcute absorption of folic acid from a fortified low-fat spread  ap. 1235-1241.  aObjective: To explore the feasibility of low-fat spreads as vehicles for folic acid (FA) fortification by determining the acute absorption of FA from a fortified spread. Design: Double blind, crossover study to test each of the following treatments administered at 1-weekly intervals: (A) 20 g low-fat (40%) spread fortified with 200 μg FA and a placebo tablet; (B) 20 g low-fat placebo spread and a 200 μg FA tablet; (C) 20 g low-fat placebo spread and a placebo tablet. Subjects: A total of 13 male volunteers, aged 31.813.2 y. Main outcome measures: Plasma total folate concentrations, measured before and up to 10 h after each treatment (n=10 samples per treatment). Results: Plasma folate concentrations were significantly increased compared with baseline values 1 h after administration of the FA tablet, and 1.5 h after the FA spread, and remained significantly higher than the baseline values for up to 7 h after both treatments. The maximum plasma folate response (Rmax), corrected for baseline values and 'placebo response', was established between 1 and 3 h postprandially in response to both FA spread and FA tablet, and no significant difference in Rmax was found between the two treatments (13.4 vs 14.4 nmol/l, P=0.9). The acute absorption of FA from fortified spread relative to that from the tablet, calculated on the basis of area under the plasma folate response curve, was 67% (P=0.04). Conclusion: The absorption of FA from fortified low-fat spread, although lower than from a tablet, is effective. These results suggest that low-fat spreads, typically associated with fat-soluble vitamin fortification, may also be considered feasible as vehicles for FA fortification. 3aabsorption 3across-over studies 3afat soluble vitamins 3afolic acid 3amales 3anormal values 3aplacebos 3avolunteers1 aMcKillop, D.1 aDuffy, N.1 aDeckere, E.A.M. de1 aJacobs, R.G.J.M.1 aPut, N.M.J. van der1 aMcNulty, H.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Oct., v. 57, no. 10 p.1235-1241x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16016743Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120921  aNon-US 7aarticle02514naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245009800150300001600248300002400264520123400288650001701522650002301539650000901562650001201571650001401583650001201597650002201609650002801631650001101659650002101670650001101691650001101702650002601713650002001739650001901759650001901778650002001797650002701817650002601844700001901870773008201889852000901971939003301980945000802013946001102021655001202032991582926600742620221119024018.0890320e198807  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890005262DNAL7 a33967372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDabeka, R.W.10aLead and cadmium levels in commercial infant foods and dietary intake by infants 0-1 year old  ap. 333-342.  ap. 333-342. charts.  aLead and cadmium levels were determined in 131 infant foods. Mean lead and cadmium levels were 19.3 and 3.3 ng/g for meats, 8.4 and 4.1 ng/g for vegetables, 14.9 and 0.58 ng/g for fruits and desserts, 9.6 and 0.53 ng/g for juices and drinks, and 32.8 and 33.6 ng/g for dry infant cereals. These data, combined with those from other recent surveys, yielded average dietary (food and water) intakes of lead and cadmium by infants 0-1 year old of 2.4 and 0.37 micrograms/kg/day, respectively. Lead intakes were most strongly influenced by storage of infant formulas in lead-soldered cans. For infants 0-1 month old, they ranged from 0.5 micrograms/kg/day when human or cow milk was fed to infants to 5.3 micrograms/kg/day (exceeding the FAO/WHO provisional tolerable daily intake, PTWI, of lead by children of 3.5 micrograms/kg) when ready-to-use formula stored in lead-soldered cans was fed. Cadmium intakes were most strongly affected by soya based formulas, and ranged, for 0-1 month olds, from 0.16 micrograms/kg/day for infants fed human or cow milk to 0.50 micrograms/kg/day for infants fed soya-based concentrated liquid formula. Cadmium intakes were all below the FAO/WHO PTDI of cadmium by adults of 0.96-1.2 micrograms/kg. 3ainfant foods 3afood contamination 3alead 3acadmium 3aingestion 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxanalysis 2aEdible Grainxanalysis. 2aFemale 2aFruitxanalysis. 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Foodxanalysis 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLeadxanalysis 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMilkxanalysis. 2aMilk, Humanxanalysis. 2aVegetablesxanalysis.1 aMcKenzie, A.D.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g1988 , v. 5, no. 3 p.333-342x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle
